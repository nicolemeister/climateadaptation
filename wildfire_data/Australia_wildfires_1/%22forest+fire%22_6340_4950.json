Science students can now graduate with a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.</p><p>Professor Jim Howe, head of Edinburgh University's department of artificial intelligence, said the main thrust of his work was to move from machines with\"low-level intelligence\" - ones whose ability to make decisions is still heavily dependent on a human operator - to machines which can make their own decisions.</p><p>Such research seems sinister to those who don't trust scientists but Professor Howe scoffed at such an idea and said machines would only be useful once they could be trusted to react to changing conditions.</p><p>He said the areas where machines are most useful are those where it is too unpleasant or dangerous for humans to work.</p><p>\"Forest fire-fighting is a good example,\" said Professor Howe, who witnessed the bushfires which killed so many people, including fire-fighters, in the Dandenongs in 1983.</p><p>He said artificial intelligence could be used to program robot firefighters to fight fires in the most extreme sections of a bushfire so that humans could control the blaze from safer, strategic positions.</p><p>The aim is not necessarily to lose robots - they will be given the artificial intelligence they need to react as effectively as possible - but to eliminate the need to risk human life.</p><p>Deep-sea diving is another area where robots should be used extensively, once they have high enough levels of artificial intelligence to replace a human operator.</p><p>Robot submarines are used extensively to check deep-sea drilling sites and pipelines and for exploration but they all require a human operator because they have low-level intelligence.</p><p>Making clever robots is only a small part of the artificial intelligence field.</p><p>Much of the work at Edinburgh is directed towards intelligent language teaching and translation systems.</p><p>Scientists are developing an artificial interpreter - a computer system which translates from English to Japanese and from Japanese to English as two people talk to each other.</p><p>CONVERSATION</p><p>As a Japanese speaker holds a conversation with an English speaker, each will be given an interpretation of what the other is saying through an earpiece or a computer screen.</p><p>Such a system can also be used over the telephone. Someone in Tokyo can plug in the system when talking with a business contact in Sydney and each person can discuss business in his own language and hear or read the answers in his own language.</p><p>Other language research is looking at how we use language to communicate.</p><p>Much of what we say and do when communicating is difficult to put into pedantic, mechanical form, yet a machine or a computer will be very limited if it cannot use language the way we use it.</p><p>Anyone who has used computer dictionary systems knows just how limited and stupid a computer's attitude to written language can be.</p><p>Spoken language is even less precise, so a truly intelligent system has to be ready to understand and interpret an enormous variety of words and images.</p><p>Computers can ask questions but they must receive exactly the right answer. If they receive something even slightly out of keeping with what they have been programmed to expect, they simply reject it.</p><p>An intelligent system will not do this - it will listen, learn and ask more questions.</p><p>Studies of how humans - especially children - learn are yielding many clues to how machines can be made to learn.</p><p>One project at Edinburgh University is a study of why some children, despite being intelligent, fail to learn to spell.</p><p>The researchers have produced intelligent spelling systems which teachers can use to help poor spellers.</p><p>They found the children did better with the computers than with teachers because they were less afraid of failing.</p><p>Education is an area where intelligent systems have obvious potential. They will never, said Professor Howe, replace teachers but they allow the pupil to work at his own pace without feeling his performance is being critically assessed.</p><p>Systems for teaching physics and languages and for giving explanations which the user can interrupt are being studied at Edinburgh.</p><p>In the explanations research, the user can tell the machine to stop when he is losing track of the explanation and the computer can then find a simpler way of putting it, based on its interpretation of how much the user has understood.</p><p>Medical diagnosis is another area of enormous potential for artificial intelligence. Researchers have found patients give more honest answers to machines than to family doctors because they don't worry about what the machine thinks of them.</p><p>EMBARRASSING</p><p>Doctors say it will remove the personal relationship between doctor and patient but that, said Professor Howe, is its advantage.</p><p>It can be used by doctor and patient to cover areas both may find embarrassing or time-consuming.</p><p>All these uses of intelligent machines have been suggested before but now they are happening it will be threatening for many professionals who might fear a mechanical invasion will lead to loss of professional mystique.</p><p>However, Professor Howe said professionals should use intelligent tools the way firefighters and factory managers use them - to do the time-consuming or dangerous things allowing humans more time or scope to do their jobs better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Port: RESEARCH: Prof Jim Howe.

Gutters, combustibles in the yard and overhanging foliage needed to be cleared. When the time came, hoses were to be set up, sinks and tubs filled with water to damp down spot fires ahead, and after the passage of the front.</p><p>The worst option, firefighters emphasised, was to be semi-committed: if a bushfire bore down there would be no halfway house for vacillators: to flee then was to risk death.</p><p>``There has been over 30 years of debate among fire experts as to whether people should stay and defend their property or leave early when there is a real risk of bushfire approaching,'' says Robert Heath, a psychologist and crisis management expert at the University of South Australia.</p><p>``Personally, my feeling is that most people should evacuate in the case of mega-fires -- that is, when you have multiple spotting of fires ahead of a large firefront.''</p><p>Authorities put increased emphasis on aerial suppression of firefronts, especially with the giant sky crane helicopters that are now a fixture of summer bushfire fighting in Australia. However, it made little difference during those fatal hours on Saturday night in Victoria. Why? In this case, the threat was known and emergency services were mobilised. The change in weather conditions that sparked the emergency had been predicted well in advance.</p><p>History provides a guide. It's no accident that mega-fires, once started, turn into infernos that defeat the heroics of firefighters and claim lives. In the lead-up to Ash Wednesday in 1983, Victoria had endured 10 months of drought; the warning signs had been apparent for months after a total fire ban was declared across the state the previous November, until then the earliest in the fire season such a measure had been imposed. On the day itself, Wednesday, February 16, 1983, the temperature soared to over 40C while relative humidity dropped to 15 per cent.</p><p>Fast-forward to Saturday. Melbourne baked in record 46.5C heat as northerly winds drew in blistering air from the deserts of central Australia. It was even hotter outside the city: in the paddocks around Avalon, the mercury had hit 47.9C by mid-afternoon.</p><p>Relief was to have been brought to the city by a cooling wind change but, as in 1983, this proved to be a hydra-headed monster for those in the fire zone. The temperature, after dipping in Melbourne, began to rise again as bushfires took hold on its northern outskirts. A smoke haze drifted across the city, imparting a sense of surreality to the unfolding emergency.</p><p>To put the threat in perspective, the forest fire danger index for the Adelaide Hills on Saturday was 111, against 50 for Ash Wednesday. The South Australian capital got off lightly when the temperature topped out at a relatively moderate 41C on Saturday, and because the cool change that came through in the early afternoon did not pack the punch of the wind shift that blasted into Victoria a few hours later.</p><p>That turned the prevailing wind direction from the north to southwesterly outside Melbourne, pushing the flames east, on to the Kinglake area, Marysville and St Andrews. In east Gippsland, the fires in the Bunyip forest burst through containment lines. In many cases, there was little firefighters could do except save themselves.</p><p>Questions are sure to be asked about whether more could have been done to warn communities in danger. Inquiries have inevitably followed bushfire disasters and this one in Victoria will be no exception.</p><p>The parallels between Black Saturday, 2009, and Ash Wednesday can be traced further along the timeline. It's no coincidence the heat records broken in Victoria over the weekend had stood since January 1939, when the Black Friday fires killed 71 people in logging communities in the state's high country (on the day of the Black Friday outbreaks, the temperature topped 45.6C in Melbourne).</p><p>A subsequent royal commission blamed the careless use of campfires and land clearing; supervised burning techniques that endure today were subsequently developed.</p><p>The 2003 Canberra fires, which killed four, raised searching questions about co-operation between the ACT and NSW fire authorities and whether more could have been done to have stopped the inferno before it broke into the national capital.</p><p>The inquiry recommended increased emphasis on controlled burning as a fuel-reduction strategy in national parks, and improvements to training for volunteer and fire crews. Crucially, more emphasis was to be placed on informing the public of emerging bushfire threats, especially in urban areas.</p><p>After the Eyre Peninsula disaster in South Australia in January 2005 claimed nine lives, a coroner found that fire authorities had wrongly assumed the deadly blaze had been contained, resulting in a crucial delay in issuing warnings.</p><p>But Victorian fire authorities insist no amount of preparation could have coped with the deadly conditions on late Saturday. ``You couldn't fight it, nobody could,'' one tearful survivor says.</p><p>``It rained fire,'' says another.</p><p>Raylene Kincaide of Narbethong, near devastated Marysville, northeast of Melbourne, thought she would never go through another bushfire as bad as Ash Wednesday, but this was worse. ``Everyone we know has lost everything they had,'' she says.</p><p>The term mega-fire was coined in the US, but fire experts say Australians may need to get used to it. Rod Incoll, a fire management consultant who was formerly a chief fire office responsible for Victoria's state forests and national parks, says such blazes go off ``like a nuclear release ... you're talking about megawatts of energy''.</p><p>As was the case on Saturday, these are typically formed by several fires, covering a huge area, converging. They exhibit complex behaviour, create their own weather and burn on and on, brushing aside the most intense and sophisticated efforts to contain them.</p><p>Kevin O'Loughlin of the Bushfire Co-operative Research Centre points out that the worst fires in recorded history in the US have occurred in the past decade, and Australia is likely to be no exception as the drought drags on in the southern half of the continent. There, lower rainfall and higher temperatures associated with global warming threaten to intensify the bushfire menace.</p><p>The scenes described by survivors of the Black Saturday blazes in Victoria are salutary. As the firefront approached, the sky blackened. Spotfires broke out as blazing embers fell from the heavens. The heat intensified and a blistering wind, whipped up by the change of air pressure caused by the fire sucking in oxygen, sounded like a ``freight train'', according to one account.</p><p>``Most people are not psychologically prepared for the noise and heat of a mega-fire,'' Heath warns.</p><p>Phil Cheney, an honorary research scientist with the CSIRO, says the tips of flames in a firestorm burn at 300C, while at the base of the fire the temperature can climb to 1000C. Radiant heat reaches out to kill long before the fire itself arrives.</p><p>Incoll fears that there is only so much fire crews can do in the face of a monster conflagration. ``The fuel loads are so high because there has been no strategic burning done,'' he prophetically told The Australian in December 2006. ``Those large fires just get going and once they get going you can't stop them because the fire intensity, the heat generated by the fire, exceeds the fairly puny efforts that human intervention can exert.''</p><p>University of Tasmania bushfire management expert David Bowman agrees. ``This is a truly terrible situation,'' he says.</p><p>And let's not forget something else: this hot, dry summer in southeastern Australia still has a long way to go. South Australia and Tasmania are tinderboxes, and NSW is feeling the heat, too.</p><p>There may be more black days to come.</p><p>Jamie Walker is The Australian's Adelaide bureau chief.</p><p>RAVAGED: AUSTRALIA'S TRIAL BY FIRE</p><p>* January 13, 1939: ``Black Friday'' fires in Victoria claim 71 lives after burning through almost 2 million hectares</p><p>* February 7, 1967: Tasmanian fires kill 59 people and burn through 264,270ha in the state's south.</p><p>* February 16, 1983: The Ash Wednesday bushfires claim 47 lives in Victoria and 28 in South Australia.

When the time came, hoses were to be set up, sinks and tubs filled with water to damp down spot fires ahead, and after the passage of the front.</p><p>The worst option, firefighters emphasised, was to be semi-committed: if a bushfire bore down there would be no halfway house for vacillators: to flee then was to risk death.</p><p>``There has been over 30 years of debate among fire experts as to whether people should stay and defend their property or leave early when there is a real risk of bushfire approaching,'' says Robert Heath, a psychologist and crisis management expert at the University of South Australia.</p><p>``Personally, my feeling is that most people should evacuate in the case of mega-fires -- that is, when you have multiple spotting of fires ahead of a large firefront.''</p><p>Authorities put increased emphasis on aerial suppression of firefronts, especially with the giant sky crane helicopters that are now a fixture of summer bushfire fighting in Australia. However, it made little difference during those fatal hours on Saturday night in Victoria. Why? In this case, the threat was known and emergency services were mobilised. The change in weather conditions that sparked the emergency had been predicted well in advance.</p><p>History provides a guide. It's no accident that mega-fires, once started, turn into infernos that defeat the heroics of firefighters and claim lives. In the lead-up to Ash Wednesday in 1983, Victoria had endured 10 months of drought; the warning signs had been apparent for months after a total fire ban was declared across the state the previous November, until then the earliest in the fire season such a measure had been imposed. On the day itself, Wednesday, February 16, 1983, the temperature soared to over 40C while relative humidity dropped to 15 per cent.</p><p>Fast-forward to Saturday. Melbourne baked in record 46.5C heat as northerly winds drew in blistering air from the deserts of central Australia. It was even hotter outside the city: in the paddocks around Avalon, the mercury had hit 47.9C by mid-afternoon.</p><p>Relief was to have been brought to the city by a cooling wind change but, as in 1983, this proved to be a hydra-headed monster for those in the fire zone. The temperature, after dipping in Melbourne, began to rise again as bushfires took hold on its northern outskirts. A smoke haze drifted across the city, imparting a sense of surreality to the unfolding emergency.</p><p>To put the threat in perspective, the forest fire danger index for the Adelaide Hills on Saturday was 111, against 50 for Ash Wednesday. The South Australian capital got off lightly when the temperature topped out at a relatively moderate 41C on Saturday, and because the cool change that came through in the early afternoon did not pack the punch of the wind shift that blasted into Victoria a few hours later.</p><p>That turned the prevailing wind direction from the north to southwesterly outside Melbourne, pushing the flames east, on to the Kinglake area, Marysville and St Andrews. In east Gippsland, the fires in the Bunyip forest burst through containment lines. In many cases, there was little firefighters could do except save themselves.</p><p>Questions are sure to be asked about whether more could have been done to warn communities in danger. Inquiries have inevitably followed bushfire disasters and this one in Victoria will be no exception.</p><p>The parallels between Black Saturday, 2009, and Ash Wednesday can be traced further along the timeline. It's no coincidence the heat records broken in Victoria over the weekend had stood since January 1939, when the Black Friday fires killed 71 people in logging communities in the state's high country (on the day of the Black Friday outbreaks, the temperature topped 45.6C in Melbourne).</p><p>A subsequent royal commission blamed the careless use of campfires and land clearing; supervised burning techniques that endure today were subsequently developed.</p><p>The 2003 Canberra fires, which killed four, raised searching questions about co-operation between the ACT and NSW fire authorities and whether more could have been done to have stopped the inferno before it broke into the national capital.</p><p>The inquiry recommended increased emphasis on controlled burning as a fuel-reduction strategy in national parks, and improvements to training for volunteer and fire crews. Crucially, more emphasis was to be placed on informing the public of emerging bushfire threats, especially in urban areas.</p><p>After the Eyre Peninsula disaster in South Australia in January 2005 claimed nine lives, a coroner found that fire authorities had wrongly assumed the deadly blaze had been contained, resulting in a crucial delay in issuing warnings.</p><p>But Victorian fire authorities insist no amount of preparation could have coped with the deadly conditions on late Saturday. ``You couldn't fight it, nobody could,'' one tearful survivor says.</p><p>``It rained fire,'' says another.</p><p>Raylene Kincaide of Narbethong, near devastated Marysville, northeast of Melbourne, thought she would never go through another bushfire as bad as Ash Wednesday, but this was worse. ``Everyone we know has lost everything they had,'' she says.</p><p>The term mega-fire was coined in the US, but fire experts say Australians may need to get used to it. Rod Incoll, a fire management consultant who was formerly a chief fire officer responsible for Victoria's state forests and national parks, says such blazes go off ``like a nuclear release ... you're talking about megawatts of energy''.</p><p>As was the case on Saturday, these are typically formed by several fires, covering a huge area, converging. They exhibit complex behaviour, create their own weather and burn on and on, brushing aside the most intense and sophisticated efforts to contain them.</p><p>Kevin O'Loughlin of the Bushfire Co-operative Research Centre points out that the worst fires in recorded history in the US have occurred in the past decade, and Australia is likely to be no exception as the drought drags on in the southern half of the continent. There, lower rainfall and higher temperatures associated with global warming threaten to intensify the bushfire menace.</p><p>The scenes described by survivors of the Black Saturday blazes in Victoria are salutary. As the firefront approached, the sky blackened. Spotfires broke out as blazing embers fell from the heavens. The heat intensified and a blistering wind, whipped up by the change of air pressure caused by the fire sucking in oxygen, sounded like a ``freight train'', according to one account.</p><p>``Most people are not psychologically prepared for the noise and heat of a mega-fire,'' Heath warns.</p><p>Phil Cheney, an honorary research scientist with the CSIRO, says the tips of flames in a firestorm burn at 300C, while at the base of the fire the temperature can climb to 1000C. Radiant heat reaches out to kill long before the fire itself arrives.</p><p>Incoll fears that there is only so much fire crews can do in the face of a monster conflagration. ``The fuel loads are so high because there has been no strategic burning done,'' he prophetically told The Australian in December 2006. ``Those large fires just get going and once they get going you can't stop them because the fire intensity, the heat generated by the fire, exceeds the fairly puny efforts that human intervention can exert.''</p><p>University of Tasmania bushfire management expert David Bowman agrees. ``This is a truly terrible situation,'' he says.</p><p>And let's not forget something else: this hot, dry summer in southeastern Australia still has a long way to go. South Australia and Tasmania are tinderboxes, and NSW is feeling the heat, too.</p><p>There may be more black days to come.</p><p>Jamie Walker is The Australian's Adelaide bureau chief.</p><p>RAVAGED: AUSTRALIA'S TRIAL BY FIRE</p><p>* January 13, 1939: ``Black Friday'' fires in Victoria claim 71 lives after burning through almost 2 million hectares</p><p>* February 7, 1967: Tasmanian fires kill 59 people and burn through 264,270ha in the state's south.</p><p>* February 16, 1983: The Ash Wednesday bushfires claim 47 lives in Victoria and 28 in South Australia.

Consolidated Group net earnings, at $239 million, were up 112 per cent on the $113 million recorded in the corresponding period to December 1998, and represent a significant turnaround from the loss of $12 million reported in the six months period to June 1999. Unusual items, net of taxation and minority interests, in the latest period comprised: a gain of $113 million on the sale of Natural Gas Corporation, a loss of $10 million on the sale of the Tasman eucalypt forest estate, a gain of $11 million relating to the receipt of Chile forest fire insurance proceeds, and restructuring costs of $10 million relating to direct costs associated with the proposed merger of Fletcher Challenge Paper and Fletcher Challenge Canada. Excluding net unusual items, net earnings were $135 million, compared with $34 million and $87 million for the two immediate preceding six-month periods. Operating earnings (EBIT) excluding unusual items rose from $138 million in the June 1999 half year, to $365 million in this period - a 164 per cent improvement, and a $107 million increase over the $258 million reported in December 1998. Cash flow from operations was up 31 per cent on the $527 million in the June 1999 half-year to $690 million, in line with the $696 million in the December 1998 period. The ratio of debt to total capitalisation improved even further from the 36.7 per cent recorded in December 1998, to 32.3 per cent, and represents the lowest ratio the Group has recorded in more than a decade. This improvement was also reflected in the ratio of the cash flow coverage of interest, which increased from 3.79 times in the June 1999 half-year to 4.63 times this period. As a result of the overall financial performance improvement and favourable business outlook, dividend increases for Building and Energy have been announced. Building has increased its interim dividend by 33 per cent, from 6.0 cents to 8.0 cents per share. Energy shareholders will receive a 1.0 cent (14 per cent) increase to 8.0 cents per share. Given the current Paper separation process, Directors have decided to hold the current level of dividend for Paper shareholders at 1.5 cents per share. Consistent with past periods, Forests has not declared a dividend. All dividends will be fully tax credited.

PERFORMANCE Detailed reports on operations and results are contained in the separate announcements for each of the four divisions. Fletcher Challenge Building (FCB) achieved a strong result, with net earnings of $46 million, up 171 per cent on the $17 million reported in the previous corresponding period. The result reflected a doubling in earnings from operations ($81 million, compared to $40 million in the previous corresponding period) and $8 million of restructuring costs incurred in relation to the downsizing of international construction operations, exiting the Chinese steel operations, and the sale of Fletcher Aluminium's Hamilton production facility. Domestic businesses continued to benefit from the strong upturn in residential construction activity that commenced early in the calendar year. Most businesses experienced higher demand, but price competition was intense in readymix concrete, concrete pipes and steel. Earnings were assisted by ongoing benefits from cost reduction and productivity improvement programmes. Net earnings (excluding unusual items) of Fletcher Challenge Energy (FCE) rose 53 per cent to $61 million. Both production and price increases were achieved in nearly all of the key businesses. Gas production in New Zealand increased by 15.5 per cent to 66.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) reflecting higher demand from the methanol and thermal electricity generation sectors. Gas production in Canada increased by 9.1 per cent to 26.5 bcf at a time of very strong North American gas prices. Oil production in both New Zealand and Canada fell, due to expected reservoir decline and preferential investment in gas developments in response to last year's low oil prices. The Maharaja Lela field in Brunei reached full contract production quantities, making an important contribution of 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent over the period. Net earnings of Fletcher Challenge Forests (FCF) were $4 million (excluding unusual and non-recurring items) compared with $6 million for the previous six months and $3 million for the comparative period in 1998. The comparative figures have been adjusted to exclude the results of the Chilean operations, which were sold last year, and which contributed $3 million to earnings in the June 1999 period. Trading conditions were mixed, with strong sales of manufactured products in New Zealand and the United States, and a partial recovery in log demand from South East Asia; however export log prices picked up more slowly than volume. Fletcher Challenge Paper (FCP) recorded net earnings (excluding unusual items) of $18 million, compared with a loss of $11 million in the June half-year and earnings of $18 million in the previous December half. Shipments for Paper operations were 1,010,000 tonnes (excluding shipments from the Malaysian mill), and were virtually unchanged from those for the six months ended December 1998. Shipments of pulp and containerboard were 515,000 tonnes, an improvement of 52,000 tonnes over the comparable period. Production of paper, excluding Malaysia, was 1,112,000 tonnes (48.8gsm basis), almost identical to the same period in 1998. Production of pulp and containerboard was 516,000 tonnes, also comparable to 1998 levels. GROUP RESTRUCTURING In December 1999, the Board of Directors of Fletcher Challenge Limited resolved to propose to shareholders the dismantling of the Group's targeted share structure. While the Board is determined to deliver optimal separation solutions quickly, it will not be artificially limited in this process by a timetable. Instead, timing will be determined by those transactions and options that maximise value for shareholders.

A zebra crossing is desperately needed across Waverley St.</p><p>This small strip of road gets my vote as the most pedestrian-unfriendly area in Waverley, only just beating Bondi Rd. Also, why isn't there a 10km/h bus zone on Oxford St through the Westfield site? This stretch of Oxford St is a busy route doing a great job masquerading as a carefree pedestrian walkway.</p><p> Where are the barriers? Where are the measures to ensure pedestrian safety?</p><p>Madeleine Walker, Tamarama</p><p>Trail to fire disasters</p><p>A result of the closing of National Park and State Forest fire trail access to four-wheel-drives and recreational vehicles in recent years was the degradation of these trails as they fell into disuse.</p><p>It would seem the (largely unheeded) warnings from the recreational 4WD community have been validated by the NSW Deputy State Coroner's finding that poorly maintained fire trails were a major contributing factor in hampering recent bushfire-fighting efforts (Daily Telegraph, December 15).</p><p>Perhaps now the various government agencies can fully engage with initiatives to reopen these areas and trails to 4WDs for the mutual benefit of park management, rather than caving in to the anti-4WD lobby.</p><p>Programs such as the current arrangements at Menai, where drivers contribute to rubbish removal and track maintenance, offer a more long-term trail-management option for many of our parks and forests.</p><p>The misconception that all 4WD who go off-road are bush-bashing yobbos who should be kept out is inhibiting fire-trail management.</p><p>Paul Kretschmann,</p><p>Northmead</p><p>Time of joy</p><p>From the excitement and enthusiasm radiating from Christmas shoppers, it seems that it is the giving rather than the receiving of gifts that creates so much of the joy at Christmas time.</p><p>Mary Julian,</p><p>Woollahra</p><p>More patrols can cut road toll</p><p>Along with many other people, I also feel that one of the best ways to deter drivers from speeding is the presence of police vehicles.</p><p>Instead, over the years, there has been a huge increase in the number of speed-related signs and an increase in the number of speed cameras.</p><p>To make matters worse, instead of increasing the number of patrol cars on our major roads to suit the changing traffic conditions, the police have reduced the number of patrol cars.</p><p>Therefore, it seems to me, that the State Government must be very happy with the latest proposal to reduce P-plate accidents because it has to outlay very little.</p><p>Once again, it will be the learner drivers and their parents who have to foot the bill.</p><p>Come on Premier Carr, if you want to make road safety a priority, use some of the revenue from speed camera fines and put more police patrols on our roads.</p><p>Peter Blanton,</p><p>Elermore Vale</p><p>Education assets</p><p>Maralyn Parker's piece, \"Funds wasted on unnecessary inquiry\" (Daily Telegraph, December 15), asserts: \"Brendan Nelson's committee will instead waste the money finding new ways to denigrate teachers.\"</p><p>Such an assertion could not be further from the truth. Rather, a key objective of the National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy is to support teachers via the identification of best practice in the teaching of literacy, and how best to train teachers.</p><p>I draw attention to just two objectives of the Committee of Inquiry's work, namely:</p><p>Review and analyse recent national and international research about literacy teaching approaches, particularly approaches that are shown to be effective in assisting students with reading difficulties;</p><p>Identify the ways in which research evidence on literacy teaching and policies in Australian schools can best inform classroom teaching practice and support teacher professional learning.</p><p>Since literacy is the foundation of lifelong learning, teacher training and capacity-building is vital so that all children, adolescents and adults are able to read, write and communicate competently.</p><p>For the sake of Australia's social and economic future, let alone our children's, I trust Ms Parker understands the importance of investing in Australia's most valuable educational resource -- our teachers.</p><p>Dr Ken Rowe, committee chair, National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy,</p><p>Camberwell, Victoria</p><p>Erosion of values</p><p>My daughter, a single parent with two small children, lost her purse while shopping at Eastgardens. I told her to go to the centre's management the next day and ask whether the purse had been handed in as she was panicking about the money in it and her Medicare card, etc.</p><p>A day later the centre handed back her purse and my daughter was overjoyed but that soon dissipated when she realised the money that was in it -- which she was going to use to buy the children's presents -- had been removed.</p><p>Why are people like this? Nobody cares about anybody else. Road rage, robberies and violence are on the rise, yet more and more people are coming into the country and eroding that community spirit Australia used to enjoy.</p><p>Leonie Williams, Maroubra</p><p>Kind words</p><p>Over the four weeks that I attended the Cancer Therapy Centre at Campbelltown Hospital recently, I found the doctors and staff helpful, co-operative and efficient in their expertise and their work. I can only say thank you to the people in the unit for the treatment I received.</p><p>P. Rich, Moss Vale</p><p>Thank you to a sweet Chinese lady, Natalie, who inspired us all, especially me at 66, to get fit again with her encouragement. She will never be forgotten by our community of early-morning exercisers at our local park.</p><p>Geoff Hinds, Merrylands</p><p>I caught the XPT from Strathfield last Sunday. I was 30 minutes early, so I had time to observe rail staff and train guards going about their work. They were nothing but professional and polite, without exception.</p><p>The facilities at the station have dramatically improved since I used to catch trains to work in the 1970s and '80s -- from digital clocks to TV monitors showing train arrivals/destinations. Once on the XPT, again the staff were faultless and kept us informed along the way as to why we stopped and also on approaching stations.</p><p>My experience was most enjoyable and I look forward to another trip. They get 10 out of 10 from me. Keep up the great work. They also make a good cup of coffee.</p><p>Robyn Bate, Laurieton</p><p>_____________________________</p><p>Mail</p><p>PO Box 2808, GPO Sydney, NSW 2001</p><p>Fax</p><p>Letters Editor, Daily Telegraph, 01-9288-2300</p><p>Phone</p><p>1900-969545.

Big Lucy recognised the ABC arts reporter, Sally Begbie, instantly, and promptly informed everyone that she had changed her hairstyle. Ms Begbie hit back quickly, asking him if he had found any rusty nails lately</p><p>Excuse us?</p><p>The Big P will not go on stage to sing unless he finds a rusty nail, Begbie explained later. This little idiosyncrasy is so well known in opera houses around the world that Covent Garden assigns a stagehand to make sure a few rusty nails are strategically dropped backstage whenever the Big P is appearing there.</p><p>Begbie, however, was at a loss to explain the tenor's skills in observation. The change in her hairdo since they last met was slight.</p><p>Pavarotti will give free outdoor concerts in New York in June and in Hyde Park, London, in July. The Hyde Park gig will be simulcast later, on August 24, by Channel 10 and 2UE.</p><p>INFAMOUS FIVES</p><p>* You're the top, you're Mahatma Gandhi: After seeing the catlike crooner Eartha Kitt last week, the Herald music critic Bruce Elder said her concert definitely made it into his list of top 10 concerts. So we asked him which gigs rated at the very top in his 20 years of critical concert-going. His choice:</p><p>1. Bob Marley and the Wailers, 1976, London. Bruce was not a huge reggae fan at the time, but the king of reggae was a \"mesmerising\" live performer.</p><p>2. Sweet Honey in the Rock, 1990, Sydney, a fabulous a cappella band.</p><p>3. Jane Siberry, the Canadian singer of the inspired Everything reminds me of my Dog, at the Real Ale Cafe, Sydney, 1990. A consummate live performer.</p><p>4. Lonnie Brooks, Paddington RSL, Sydney, 1990.</p><p>5. Pink Floyd, Knebworth, England, 1976.</p><p>Tomorrow, the five worst.</p><p>POET'S CORNER</p><p>* There was a young man and a shoe: Today, in our occasional series, the writer Cathy Peake shares with us her \"favourite lines of poetry I never learnt in school\".</p><p>The Firbanks of Bairnsdale asked</p><p>me to tea</p><p>and were as kind as kind could</p><p>possibly be</p><p>but their rumbles abdominal</p><p>were simply phenomenal</p><p>and everyone, even Caroline,</p><p>thought it was me.</p><p>Ms Peake reads tonight at the Harold Park Hotel from Speaking with the Sun, an anthology of stories from contemporary Australian and New Zealand women writers.</p><p>IDIOT BOX BLUES</p><p>* Like the trees in the forest, so are the days of our lives: OK, so one of the mysteries in the small-town-makes-weird (and damn good coffee) soap is solved. You may know who killed Miss Glad Wrap 1991, but frustrated detectives can try this quick quiz.</p><p>1. What is Agent Cooper's middle name and in what city did he grow up?</p><p>2.

Fighting a forest fire.</p><p>Quote of the day: \"I sang in Voices That Care and stood next to Tom Selleck. I actually sang but Tom didn't. His lips were moving but nothing was coming out.\" - The football player turned thespian Brian Bosworth, on the cable show Entertainment Television.</p><p>Voices That Care was the recording made in support of United States troops in the Gulf and gave celebrities the chance to demonstrate how warm and fuzzy they really are.</p><p>Oops, the devil did it: Somehow the word \"yuppie\" fell out of our column yesterday when we had hoped to call Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho a publication about the designer yuppie from hell. We hope we didn't offend any designers anywhere.</p><p>SPIN US ANOTHER ONE</p><p>A honkin' and a screamin' and a cookin': Big Jay McNeely is back in town to play some rampant rhythm and blues on his glow-in-the-dark saxophone and analyse his audience by their clothing.</p><p>The Go Go Man says he plays differently according to who's there (so for a wild night leave the beige bodyshirt at home). It's the shoes, the hats and the hairstyles that are the real giveaways, he says.</p><p>Why a fluorescent saxophone? It all happened back in 1986 in Los Angeles. \"I started playing on the floor; I got down on my knees and lay on the floor and the audience responded and it became a really big thing and a couple of others started copying my thing. I went into a club and a girl stripper came out in fluorescent clothes and I said this is it and went down and had my horn painted - chartreuse and red, but on this tour it's orange and lime green.\"</p><p>Big Jay, now 64, first made it big with live audiences in 1949, in the days when his music was called race music and the radio stations wouldn't touch it</p><p>Then Pat Boone came along and sang Little Richard numbers and Elvis and Carl Perkins et al joined in and turned rhythm and blues into rock'n'roll.</p><p>Miles Davis, Teddy Edwards, Keith Compton and Charles Mingus are his heroes but he's not a big fan of rap. \"I like everything but I think rap is more of a visual thing,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Drawing: By Rocco Fazzari</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhodau1qgk6r1mc08</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1991</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7M-D100-TXN5-R1WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1991 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"1991\"><dateText>May 28, 1991 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Luciano Pavarotti Quotations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001254</classCode><className>OPERA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp;

Oscar Pistorius</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KNOWN as the fastest man on no legs, Oscar Pistorius was born without fibula bones, and had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. Raised on prosthetic legs, Pistorius soon discovered he could run faster on his carbon fibre blades than most people could on two good legs and duly claimed the world record in the 100, 200 and 400 metres for athletes with a disability events. Last weekend, the \"Blade Runner\" took part in the 400 metres of the ablebodied British Grand Prix - the first time a disabled athlete had competed against the world's best in a top international meeting - in an attempt to reach the 45.95-second mark he needs to qualify for the able-bodied Olympic Games. In driving rain, the South African struggled with the puddles and finished last in 47.65, then was disqualified for running out of his lane. But he'll be back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Ian Thorpe</p><p>WHEN a seven-year-old Ian Thorpe followed his older sister into swimming, the young tyro was quickly diagnosed as being allergic to chlorine. \"You could say it was like my Kryptonite,\" a humble Thorpedo told the Impossible is Nothing adidas ad campaign. \"I just had huge sinus headaches in chlorine pools. It helped me develop my passion and my drive in the pool - I was willing to get constantly sick.\" The first time Thorpe competed, he swam with his head out of the water, his nose clamped shut with a clip, and won.</p><p>In time, he outgrew the allergy, grew to 195 centimetres (six-foot-five) with size-17 feet. But the legend of the allergy lives on - there's even an online game to prove it: go to http://thorpe.ggg.com.au/ where you can \"help Thorpie overcome his chlorine allergy and conquer the pool by avoiding harmful enemies while collecting medals, trophies and using thorpedo boosts to finish in the fastest time!\".</p><p>3. Steve Elkington</p><p>ALTHOUGH Elkington is blessed with what has been dubbed golf's \"sweetest swing\", the Elk is cursed with a severe allergy to grass. Bummer, really, considering his workplace.</p><p>Bermuda grass, bent grass, rye grass, poa annua, bluegrass, it doesn't matter. He has had sinus surgery twice and suffered viral meningitis - and accompanying spinal taps - three times, which he describes as having \"a forest fire in your head\". In 1994, the New York Times reported that each day, Elk took 800 milligrams of antibiotics (one dose in the morning, one at night), an antihistamine and five applications of three different nasal sprays. Twice weekly, he gave himself an antihistamine injection.</p><p>He still won the 1995 US PGA championship, the 1992 Australian Open, and a further nine US tour events. The surgeries and the antihistamine Allegra - which became a personal sponsor - have improved things in recent years, including his sense of humour.</p><p>Of Tiger Woods, he says: \"I'm afraid Woods is a very one-dimensional golfer. He wins all the time.\"</p><p>4. Bart Cummings</p><p>CUPS king Bart Cummings hardly ever made it to the track. When a child, a doctor told young Bart's folks that he was allergic to horse hair, oats, chaff, lucerne and hay. \"All those things I was allergic to,\" Cummings told the ABC. \"And the chap said, 'Oh you're easy to fix, son', he said, 'Keep away from horses and you'll never look back.' \" Bart, who will be 80 in November, ignored the advice, embracing a lifetime of taking antihistamines on his way to training 11 Melbourne Cup winners among his 247 group 1 winners. Intriguingly, last year his leading Cups contender Accumulate also had an allergic reaction to lucerne, and was given a similar antihistamine to the drug Cummings takes.</p><p>5. Steven Arnold</p><p>AT 175 centimetres, Arnold is probably the tallest flat race jockey in Australia. He's certainly the best tall jockey in Australia.</p><p>Arnold is two centimetres taller than West Coast Eagle David Wirrpanda and yet rides at 55.5 kilograms - almost 30 kilograms lighter than Wirrpanda plays. Arnold eats just one light meal and a non-fattening bite - literally, a bite - a day. Known for his horsemanship and soft hands, the jockey from Alice Springs remains a favourite with trainers - when he can make the weight. He couldn't do it in last year's Melbourne Cup, when he gave up the ride on the third-placed Maybe Better, carrying 50kg. From limited opportunities, he's nailed nine group 1 winners, including the Oaks on Magical Miss, the Doomben 10,000 on Undue and the SAAB Quality on Maybe Better. Arnold will ride a \"tick lighter\" than his 55.5kg in a big race: \"If I've got the desire, and I still have at the moment, I can hold it. I've been doing it long enough.\"</p><p>6. Tyrone \"Muggsy\" Bogues</p><p>IN THE NBA, where the average player is 200 centimetres, Muggsy dominated, despite being 160 centimetres. Muggsy, so nicknamed because a coach likened his playing style to a mugging, grew up in housing projects in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>Selected 12th in the first round of the 1987 NBA draft by the Washington Bullets, the little point guard made his name at the Charlotte Hornets, played in the play-offs three times, and finished his career as the Hornets' all-time leader in assists (5557), steals (1067) and turnovers (1118) - and in the NBA's all-time top 20 players for assists. Although able to jump more than 115 centimetres into the air - in 1996, he blocked a shot attempt by New York Knicks' 213-centimetre center Patrick Ewing - Muggsy was a demon when the ball hit the ground. \"The ball's on the floor more than it's in the air. And down there is Muggsyland,\" he wrote in his autobiography.\"</p><p>That's where I rule. On the floor, you gotta watch out for the little fella.\"</p><p>7. Azeem Hafeez</p><p>A TALL, strong left-arm quick, Azeem Hafeez took 63 wickets in 18 Tests for Pakistan despite the fact he was born with two fingers missing on his right hand.</p><p>With limited first-class cricket behind him, Hafeez was rushed into the Test arena as a 20-year-old when Imran Khan went down with a shin injury. He debuted against India in 1983-84, then toured Australia, where he bowled marathon spells, took 19 wickets, including five-wicket bags in Adelaide and Perth. He also became a crowd favourite, with satirist Billy Birmingham (The 12th Man) none-too-subtly adopting him as the character \"Hafeez Andmissin\". At home against India, he then took 6-46 on a lifeless pitch, and 22 wickets in six Tests against New Zealand. Then in 1984-85, aged just 21, Hafeez gave way for Wasim Akram and, with Waqar Younis and Imran ahead of him - supported by Abdul Qadir - the luckless youngster never played Test cricket again.</p><p>8. Bhagwat Chandrasekhar</p><p>INDIAN leg spinner Bhagwat \"Chandra\" Chandrasekhar was stricken by polio aged five and despite his withered right arm became a genuine matchwinner. With a characteristic long run-up and a whippy action, the lanky Chandra didn't turn the ball much, but his googlies and top-spinners claimed 242 wickets in 58 Tests from 1964, with best figures of 8-79. \"I had a different grip, like a seam bowler's with my fingers spread across, so I could get bounce off the deadest pitch - I didn't do too much thinking,\" he said. \"I couldn't flight the ball - everything I bowled was fast - it was like asking (Dennis) Lillee to flight the ball.\" Chandra fielded and threw left-handed, and was a terrible batsman, finishing with 23 ducks and an average of four. Touring Australia in 1977-78, he was presented with a special Gray-Nicholls bat with a hole in it to commemorate his four ducks. Then he bowled India to victory in Melbourne. Named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1972, he retired in 1979.</p><p>A road accident a decade later left him partially paralysed. But cricket lovers will always remember him charging in, his long-sleeved shirt buttoned at the wrist whipping over, with the edges flying to Eknath Solkar at forward short leg.</p><p>9. Geoff Blethyn</p><p>HUNDREDS of league footballers have played with contact lenses, but Essendon great Geoff Blethyn was rare in that he played in glasses. Slim and agile, the bespectacled Bomber kicked 216 goals in 84 VFL games, mostly at full-forward. Debuting in 1968, he was rushed into the grand final against Carlton in only his second game after Essendon skipper Ken Fraser was ruled out with injury, the then 17-yearold kicking four of Essendon's eight goals to lose by just three points. In 1972, in his trademark black-rimmed specs, Blethyn became only the second Bomber to top the ton - in one game he kicked 11 of 13 goals in a losing side to Footscray - and finished the year with 107. The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers reports that when he booted his 100th, the police horse protecting him \"slobbered all over his glasses\".</p><p>10. MacKinzie Kline</p><p>AMERICAN golfer MacKinzie Kline was born with a congenital heart defect and her parents were told that with groundbreaking surgery at eight weeks old, their single-ventricle daughter could live until she was five. Now 15, and with only 80 per cent of the average person's oxygen and no aerobic capacity at all, she is ranked No. 1 for her age group in the world.</p><p>Unable to walk a golf course, she rides in a cart and breathes oxygen from a cylinder between strokes. \"I just need a little extra help so I can play,\" she told the Observer.</p><p>In her spare time, she's the national spokesperson for the US' Children's Heart Foundation.

But isn't the whole story about the use of special effects on a giganticscale -the creation of an artificial world indistinguishable from the real one?</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of a long-running TV soap, transmitted round the clock to a devoted audience. We join him on Day 10,909 of the show -it has been running for 30 years -as he leaves for work one typical morning in the pretty white-picket-andtimber-frame town of Seahaven. But Seahaven in reality is an enormous studio set and all the people in it (except Truman) are actors and extras. Truman doesn't know this. He was born in Seahaven (\"the only child ever legally adopted by a corporation\") and has lived his life believing that his familiar world, enclosed by a gigantic invisible dome, is the real one.</p><p> Jaques's words in As You Like It are for Truman the literal truth: \"All the world's a stage / And all the men and women merely players . . .\"</p><p> Everything is done to keep Truman in ignorance of reality.</p><p>His every movement is filmed by hidden cameras. The movements of the players (\"their exits and their entrances\") are directed by the allpowerful Christof from his console in the sky; even the weather can be regulated with rain machines and sunlamps. If something by chance goes wrong, and Truman catches a glimpse of something he shouldn't see, a benign explanation is provided on a subsequent newscast. One such incident occurs at the start of the film: a floodlight from the set drops from the sky like a bomb. Truman picks it up and has no idea what it is, but a newsflash soon afterwards talks of an aircraft breaking up in flight.</p><p> Although Truman spends his life in a prison, it is a far from uncongenial one.</p><p>This is a secure and comfortable world in which everyone maintains a mask of geniality and nothing too unpleasant is allowed to happen. The sponsors' product placements -the beers, the clothes and kitchen gadgets -are so unobtrusive that Truman is scarcely aware of them, and when a character makes a brief pitch to camera (\"That is a beer!\"), it is accepted as a natural part of conversation.</p><p> All this is very funny -everything in the film shines with wit and intelligence -but the mood becomes gradually darker. Truman, though living with a wife of Donna Reed-like sweetness and practicality (Laura Linney), spends his nights in virginal seclusion; the universe of sexual experience is closed to him. Occasionally he suspects that something is wrong with his world, even that he is under surveillance. And one day an actor in the show (Natascha McElhone) tips him off and urges him to escape.</p><p> But escape is impossible. His dreams of travel to faraway places are thwarted or discouraged. Even the posters in tourist offices warn of the likelihood of aircraft disasters; and escape by sea is ruled out by Truman's phobia for water, a state of mind conditioned by the show's producers.</p><p> Weir has worked from a screenplay by New Zealander Andrew Niccol, and what makes The Truman Show at once sinister and hilarious is the seamless ingenuity of its construction and the confidence of Weir's direction. Audiences can be privy to the secrets of the show while Truman remains in ignorance. But the artificiality of Truman's world is never so extreme that we cannot accept it ourselves as some sort of alternative to the real world of stress and squalor. This calls for exquisite timing and judgment from the cast, and all of them deliver.</p><p>Even the extras manage to behave like extras, walking too purposefully around the fringes, a shade too eager and conspicuous.</p><p> And Carrey's presence is a masterstroke of casting: he has always been funny to watch and our readiness to discern a higher pathos in the antics of a familiar clown guarantees him a measure of sympathy. His features -buoyantly fresh and trusting, a study in unsullied gullibility and openness suggest the dimness and exuberance that enable Truman Burbank to survive.</p><p> More than 40 years ago, Frederik Pohl, one of the century's great science fiction writers, published a story called The Tunnel Under the World. I read it in a Penguin anthology in 1963 and it has stuck in my mind ever since. The hero, an innocent called Burckhardt, lived in an ideal, picture-postcard city called Tylerton (\"the sky was cloudless, the buildings were clear and inviting\") which turns out to be an artificial environment, devised and constructed by a millionaire advertising guru, Dorkin, who manipulates Burckhardt's entire waking life from an overhead control room. Burckhardt has no idea that he is being used to test advertising techniques. One day in Tylerton is exactly like another; all the people around him are fakes; and, of course, there is no escape.</p><p> I mention this coincidence to make the point that the fears explored in The Truman Show are part of a familiar contemporary nightmare: the sensation that none of us is truly master of ourselves, that our lives are regulated by endless pressures to conform, and to that extent we are less than human.</p><p>This is the stuff of countless dystopian fables. There is no great distance between the worlds of Seahaven (or Tylerton) and the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four. People are controlled by technology in the service of political or commercial ambition; the individual is crushed; everyone is subject to Big Brother's scrutiny. Electronic snooping shows such as Candid Camera have been a TV staple from the beginning. Today, when there is no privacy even for a president of the US, Weir's film has a special urgency.</p><p> There is no particular logic in the story. The TV show might be just as popular if Truman, too, were played by an actor. Why does he have to be deceived? But that is the point. Watching The Truman Show is to be reminded fleetingly of many films -The Manchurian Candidate, Groundhog Day, The Stepford Wives, Logan's Run, Westworld, Capricorn One. All were about illusion, simulated states of reality. But most of them were more or less conventional scientific thrillers. Where Weir excels is in creating a mood of humorous fantasy that leaves us both charmed and anxious. The message isn't rammed home but is impossible to avoid. It gives this wholly enchanting entertainment its weight and relevance. Its pleasures fall as lightly as the Mozart piped from the Seahaven sky; and when we walk in the street, it wouldn't surprise us to hear an off-stage voice calling \"Stand by all extras!\" and discover a familiar doorway with nothing behind it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9809261R21402150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:457Y-X060-0197-5345-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1174\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE WEEKEND AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>September 26, 1998, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000975B</classCode><className>PRODUCT PLACEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000975B</classCode><className>PRODUCT PLACEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOOG</classCode><className>CAMERAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DMP3</classCode><className>ED HARRIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>PE000C5I4</classCode><className>JIM CARREY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He shakes his head.</p><p>\"It is very sad to fly over East Kalimantan on a daily basis,\" he said.</p><p> \"Everywhere you go you see wildlife running out of the jungle with nowhere to go. They are getting trapped, sold or killed.\"</p><p> Randolph, 33, is on one of his regular water-bombing runs, missions that involve dumping a mixture of water and retardant on fires from a large bucket tethered to the helicopter.</p><p> He is one of a handful of pilots helping efforts to control the hundreds of fires in East Kalimantan. Many of the blazes are deliberately lit by plantation owners and farmers clearing the land, while smouldering peat and coal seam fires spark others. Peat and coal fires can burn for years just below ground level.</p><p> Adding to the gloom is a prolonged drought that has made the province tinder dry. Water for fire-fighting is also scarce and a choking smog has enveloped much of the area, making thousands of people ill.</p><p> Neighbouring South-East Asian nations fear smog from the fires, and those burning in Brunei and the Malaysian side of Borneo island, will create a repeat of last year's smoke haze which blanketed the region, sparking a health scare and casting a pall over the tourism trade. The haze has already crept over Singapore.</p><p> Randolph said the situation had become so desperate in East Kalimantan that he and his colleagues, an Australian and two Indonesians, worked for free to battle the blazes. An Indonesian company, National Utility Helicopters, provides the aircraft and pays for the water-bombing sorties.</p><p> \"We're not trying to save the world, just a piece of it. I've just seen too much of this area burning and I decided with some friends that we can't let it happen any more,\" Randolph said.</p><p> \"The point is that the fires, economic crisis and drought have made this a terrible year,\" he said.</p><p> Since January, fires have scorched 224,000 hectares of forest, plantations and brushland, official figures show. Last year, fires destroyed about 30,000 hectares of the province.</p><p> Environmental agencies and government officials say plantation companies are most to blame as they take advantage of the dry conditions and poor law enforcement to clear forest for new palm oil, rubber and timber plantations.</p><p> Wildlife, including the endangered orang-utan, have suffered badly from the fires, which have destroyed their habitat, while the drought means many animals are starving and vulnerable to villagers hunting for food to replace failed crops.</p><p> Yesterday, an Indonesian environmental official said dozens of deer had burnt to death in the forest fires.</p><p> \"We have found about one tonne of charred deer carcasses in the forest,\" said Awang Faroek Iskak, head of East Kalimantan Environmental Impact Management Agency.</p><p> Iskak said by telephone from Samarinda that the forest fires had also killed other animals, including orang-utans.</p><p> Last week, the local press reported about 60 orang-utans were saved from the fires while four orang-utans that ran into a village were killed by villagers.</p><p> Newspaper reports said some of the baby orang-utans had been captured and sold for 500,000 rupiah ($\u00a0A100) each.</p><p> Klaus Toepfer, head of the United Nations Environment Program, recently said the fires were potentially one of the greatest ecological disasters of the millennium.</p><p> At the weekend, Randolph was playing his part in controlling the fires, even though the scene looked like David and Goliath.</p><p> The pilot who used to help film Hollywood productions and ferry television news crews reduces altitude to just above the trees, plunges into a thick column of smoke and releases the water.</p><p> A small curtain of water-retardant mix rains on the blaze but seems to have little impact. As he pulls up to return to base near the city of Balikpapan other forest fires come into view and it seems he is tackling a lost cause.</p><p> The problem, he says, is that there are not enough trained fire-fighters or money and that the fires are simply too numerous to tackle. Forecasts of rain being months away depress him further.</p><p> But he explains his efforts are not a waste of time. It is all about coordinating water-bombing with ground fire-fighting crews and concentrating on one area to try to save what is left. Often, though, it was difficult to link up regularly with local ground crews, frustrating his, and his colleagues' efforts.</p><p> \"We have to prioritise,\" he said.</p><p> \"We decided to coordinate as much as we can and try to combat specific areas that we might be successful in,\" he added. One of those areas was the Sungai Wain forest reserve near Balikpapan.</p><p> A large area of the forest in the reserve has already been destroyed and fires late last month nearly burned down the park's Wanariset Orang-utan Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, said to be the world's largest rescue project for the primates.</p><p> The park is also home to many orang-utans, although local environmentalists say the fate of the primates there has not been fully determined.</p><p> Saving the park's orang-utans has become another of Randolph's projects.</p><p> With the help of National Utility, the Balikpapan Orang-utan Society and locals donating money, he and his colleagues have set up an organisation called East Kalimantan Forest Fire Rescue, which in part aims to douse fires in Sungai Wain, but also air-lift threatened orang-utans.</p><p> The animals would be sent to the Wanariset centre, although the scheme, in its infancy, relies heavily on donations and volunteers, said Yindra Rusmiputro, National Utility's direction.</p><p> \"We are funding all our own helicopter operations now but of course it is not unlimited, so we are expecting help from foreign agencies,\" he said. Locals were doing much to help, he said.</p><p> Back at the base, Randolph is preparing for another run and, despite the fire disaster, says he values the experience.</p><p> \"I ended up in East Asia because of the adventure and opportunity that comes with helicopter flying. Before I came to Indonesia nearly two years ago, I had 4,000 hours of flight time doing various jobs from shooting films for Hollywood productions and television news, to sling work and putting up Christmas trees.</p><p> \"I came here to have another life experience and it's been incredible, diverse,\" he said, adding that his work had taken him to Sulawesi and Irian Jaya as well.</p><p> Now he is battling some the worst forest fires in the region and they show no sign of stopping. But neither does he.</p><p> \"We wanted to start someplace, to win one small battle, not win the overall war because the war is pretty big,\" he said.</p><p>REUTERS gr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SFT-NXC0-0048-T2PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1183\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 AAP Information Services Pty.

However, the historical parallel has not been lost.</p><p>Over the past week hundreds, and even thousands, have gathered daily on campuses across Java and in the major port city of Ujung Pandang, on the island of Sulawesi, unfurling anti-Government banners and calling for an end to the same New Order the student movement helped usher in.</p><p>In Bandung, west of Jakarta, two students were injured and two arrested when hundreds clashed with police this week as they attempted to march through the city. In Ujung Pandang, the military watched on as thousands from two campuses gathered to rally in the city. In the industrial city of Surabaya, the rector joined students in a major demonstration. In at least three cities, several students announced hunger strikes.</p><p>In Jakarta, where 25,000 troops are deployed to secure the People's Advisory Assembly meeting, which is due to re-elect President Soeharto for a seventh five-year term next week, rallies have been confined to university grounds. Rows of trucks of armed soldiers, police with rattan canes, and anti-riot squads have remained at the gates.It is still unclear whether the re-emergence of the student movement will be a turning point in the anti-Soeharto movement or whether it will be stamped out by the security forces before it even breaches military road blocks.</p><p>The outgoing Defence Minister, Mr Edi Sudradjat, said this week that he had no objections to the student demonstrations and to a string of key former New Order figures, such as a former Cabinet minister, Mr Emil Salim, appearing on campus to discuss their opposition to the Soeharto Government.</p><p>A former student leader, Mr Hariman Siregar, said: \"These universities are the national centres of excellence; the students are mainly from the middle class. These are the princes in the palaces and once they go out on to the streets, I think the people will join them.</p><p>\"They have seen that this Government is too corrupt and in power for too long and they are united around a real issue, the economic crisis, and so the students can again become the vanguard for change.\"</p><p>WHAT the students' agenda is and how far their network extends remains vague.</p><p>So far, protests have called for a total reformation of the political and economic systems. Student leaders say they will step up their actions in coming weeks.</p><p>However, three decades under the Soeharto Government's tight controls weigh heavily on political activists of any kind. In 1974, when Mr Hariman led student demonstrations against foreign investment, the protest spun out of control and scores were killed and injured when the military opened fire in city streets. He spent three years in jail.</p><p>Four years later, the Campus Normalisation Law was introduced, effectively banning political activity and supposedly sending students back to their books. Several underground anti-Government organisations have survived on the most progressive campuses, but students were again hit by a 1996 security crackdown on the leftist People's Democratic Movement which began on campus in the central Javanese city ofYogyakarta.</p><p>A commentator and former editor of the banned magazine Tempo, Mr Goenawan Mohamad, said: \"It should be expected that students will take to the streets because of the economic crisis and the sluggishness of the Government to respond.</p><p>\"The student movement has been blunted, but over the past five years discussion groups have been created and links across campuses set up and the students have quietly begun to hone their political skills.\"</p><p>At the moment, he said, \"there is no direct danger to the Soeharto Government\".</p><p>\"In 1965, Jakarta was a small place and 5,000 people in the streets was a revolution. Nowadays the city is huge, so it would be visible and significant but localised.</p><p>\"IF YOU engage with the enemy too early, you lose and in this case the enemy is a well-equipped army. But the middle class which gained so much economically in the past is losing a great deal because of the economic crisis, so in the future the students may be significant.\"</p><p>In the smokey student union meeting room on the Depok campus of the University of Indonesia, banners are piled up for the day's \"free-speech forum\", a series of thumping lectures about how people have had enough of the Soeharto regime.</p><p>In the lunchtime heat several hundred endure the sun to clap and cheer. Apart from the 10 trucks of troops, riot squads and scores of police posted outside the campus gates, a police helicopter circles overhead. It may seem like security overkill for a bunch of young idealists.</p><p>\"The Government has failed in channelling the people's aspirations,\" say two young men, predictably perhaps.</p><p>However, of more importance is the immediate impact of the economic crisis on their personal political motivation. The middle-class academic elite of this university can no longer afford to buy books, photocopy their lessons or get by ontheir old lunch allowances, they complain.</p><p>A 22-year-old social-science student said: \"We feel we don't have anything to lose now. It will be difficult to finish our studies anyway, in the current economic conditions.</p><p>\"Our families are worried about our activities but we have to do this.\"</p><p>The new wave of activism on campus began last year with the economic crisis and forest fire outbreak, which sent a pall of smoke across the region. Before the economic crisis, the students said, they held token demonstrations on issues such as human rights or stuck to discussion groups.</p><p>NOW, they say, they are contemplating breaching military road blocks.</p><p>\"It is not easy to do,\" one student said.</p><p>\"We don't want our actions to be premature and to help form another regime like this one. We are also afraid of infiltrators provoking violence and the whole thing becoming a riot.</p><p>\"But we feel at this university we have an historical burden.\"</p><p>However, like the disparate array of anti-Government groups, there appears to be no tight network holding the students together. Mr Goenawan said: \"The tragedy of Indonesia is we don't have potential leaders because of the habit of fear and the fact that those who have broken the habit are in jail.</p><p>\"Unless you have a good organisation that can mobilise students at the same time in different places, then the armed forces can still control sporadic uprisings.\"</p><p>However, Mr Hariman said: \"If you have 10,000 workers protesting in the factory belt then the Government can dismiss it as `just a riot', but if you have students not going to lectures from the middle class, that is another thing; they are the country's future.</p><p>\"The Government doesn't need to be afraid of radicals; it needs to be afraid of the middle ground.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhvvt3w5jc1hixle7qz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P85-1CP0-TXN5-R22P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1998 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>March 7, 1998 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Indonesia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Demonstration</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp;

Detail how you feel. After the phases of shock, grief and anger pass, and the hard work of rebuilding commences, I am certain communities will welcome support.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By this stage you may have forgotten how you felt, and the media attention will have moved on. The journey to rebuild lives and communities will have only just begun, and at this stage your renewed concern and support will be seen as kindness rather than charity. Simple things such as providing cuttings to plant out a community garden, or supporting charity events, will no doubt make a difference to friends we are yet to meet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Glenda Key, Upwey</p><p>Tireless heroes</p><p>MANY people who work for the Department of Sustainability and Environment are stars. They spend their time in the bush fighting fires non-stop, saving the lives of people and animals and caring for the broken-hearted. Nothing is too big or too small. Our in-law is one of these. He has had one day off in three weeks. We must pay full respect to these heroes.</p><p>Genevieve and David Ross, Myers Flat</p><p>ABC radio a lifeline</p><p>IF EVER again there is a side of politics intent on undermining the role of the national broadcaster, they should be reminded of the role our ABC has played in the bushfire tragedy of the past week. Without exception, everyone on air, and I am sure those behind the scenes, have reported on this most horrifying time in our state's history with sensitivity, responsibility and humanity.</p><p>ABC radio 774 has been quite literally a lifeline for many affected directly by the fires and a source of critical information for the rest of us that has helped our understanding of the scale of this disaster and so framed our personal response.</p><p>Mary Dalmau, West Brunswick</p><p>A hand of friendship</p><p>I AM wondering, in relation to the fire disaster, whether a buddy system could be put into operation? A family in the city could be paired with a family in the bush fire area and the city family, their friends and larger family could help that family in a specific way. It may already be too late for this to work for this disaster, but perhaps in the future?</p><p>Mary Squires, Kooyong</p><p>Pity the animals</p><p>IT IS wonderful to see the number of people donating to support those who have suffered as a result of the recent bushfires. Perhaps people might also consider donating to some of the organisations supporting animals which have similarly become victims of the fires, like the RSPCA and Wildlife Rescue.</p><p>It is estimated that up to one million domestic and wild animals perished in the recent fires. Even more have been left seriously injured and without their natural habitat, and it is important that we also consider them.</p><p>Caroline Spry, South Yarra</p><p>Caring for others</p><p>THE Victorian bushfires have shown us how sick of being greedy and selfish we are. People are so hungry to help one another and work as a community again like they did in past times of hardship (such as World War II and the Great Depression). It makes life more meaningful and valuable to care for others.</p><p>Linda Pearson, Eltham</p><p>Spare us the ivory tower advice</p><p>DON Driscoll (Letters, 13/2) should come out of academia and have a look! Surely he cannot really believe that fuel-reduction burning has not proven effective. Anyone who has fought a forest fire knows how much simpler and safer it is to attack once it enters a fuel-reduced area. There is loads of empirical data and experience to demonstrate that beyond any possible doubt.</p><p>He goes on to propose \"engineering solutions around our infrastructure\" as an alternative to fuel reduction. What on earth does that mean? Surely not that fuel can be allowed to build up in the forest hinterlands and fires allowed to build up there until they come roaring out to destroy whatever puny defences we might have been able to place around every farm, house, hospital, school, road, railway line, bridge and transmission line?</p><p>We need a sensible dialogue on this crucial issue rather than academic obfuscation.</p><p>Peter Sheehan, Camberwell</p><p>Left in the dark</p><p>OUR niece, in her 30s, was staying at our Marysville house when fire threatened the town. Anticipating hazardous weather, we had impressed on her that the emergency assembly area was Gallipoli Park. Fortunately, from previous visits, she knew where it was. However, would a casual visitor have known or been advised of this important information? Could this have led to people's deaths?</p><p>No prominent signs advise where to evacuate to in an emergency, and, even if people knew the name of the assembly area, there are few signs directing them to it. Marysville was undoubtedly not alone in these deficiencies.</p><p>Furthermore, apart from being told by a neighbour to leave our house, there was no recognisable warning to advise evacuation and, having assembled at Gallipoli Park withabout 100 others, it seemed, at least for some considerable time, that nobody knew what they should do.</p><p>It cannot be assumed that an adequately trained leader will be there in a timely manner, therefore such emergency assembly areas require obvious instruction notices. Besides town signs, should every house/cottage/room be given a fridge magnet with appropriate advice? These things need to be seriously considered for the future. Incidentally, our house, like most others in Marysville, did not survive.</p><p>John Vietz, Macleod</p><p>Tune in, stay safe</p><p>MY WIFE was in constant mobile phone contact with friends on that horrific Saturday night in Kinglake. They had lostall other communication with the outside world. On Sunday morning they lost that also. They had to defend their homes (successfully) after the mobile service failed with no information from outside theirpatch. May I suggest thateverybody at risk should buy what we used to call a transistor radio and set it to ABC radio 774.</p><p>Barry Norman, Armadale</p><p>Have a heart</p><p>IMAGINE you are a firefighter and after a long day risking your life to save others, defending wildlife, treasured bushland and homes, you hear you are being accused of not notifying some residents early enough about approaching fires.</p><p>If I recall, weren't people in threatened towns specifically told to stay alert and judge for themselves? Come on, firefighters are only human. Sorry, they can't be everywhere. I am appalled at the people who have the audacity to accuse them of this absurd \"crime\". I'd like to see you out there fighting monstrous flames. Just give them a break.</p><p>Taissa Usatoff, Emerald</p><p>Siren no substitute</p><p>for good preparation</p><p>I WAS at the Healesville residents' meeting on Thursday night, when there were impassioned calls for fire warning sirens. The emotion, especially after the swift and utterly tragic obliteration of Marysville, is easy to understand. But the logic needs to be examined.</p><p>A large town such as Healesville, which extends for kilometres in all directions over varying terrain and along arterial roads, would be impossible to fully service with a single siren. As also evidenced by the Donnelly's Weir fire, some parts of the town may be in danger while others are quite safe.</p><p>Most significantly, if alerting by siren were possible, what would happen next can only be imagined. Panic-stricken householders taking to the reduced number of roads still open or safe to traverse could conceivably result in far greater tragedy than if they had calmly adopted the fire plan that basically remains viable today: monitor the situation by radio, internet or phone and stay anddefend your house if you feel capable, or leave of your own volition (as many here havealready done) well beforethere is any imminent danger.</p><p>David Johnston, Healesville</p><p>Words worthless without action</p><p>WHERE is the morality in the Brumby Government, which expresses public sympathy in the face of this devastating fire tragedy, yet makes it illegal for people to take such fire safety measures as tree, shrub, bush and ground fuel removal to lessen the fire risk? This is a joke, Mr Brumby.</p><p>Peter Baulch, Baxter</p><p>Safety in suburbs</p><p>IF PETER Mitchell (The Age, 13/2) wants to be safe from bushfires, why doesn't he live in the suburbs? People who choose to live in forest take the risks.</p><p>We can't just go on clearing trees to reduce the risk of fire for those people, otherwise there will be no forest left. Mitchell says that when he rebuilds he will clear the forest around his home regardless of whether he has permission. He has already lost his house, why must countless animals lose theirs as well?</p><p>Graham Castles, Chelsea</p><p>Cradle of love</p><p>THE wooden cradle that Reg Evans made (The Age, 13/2) provides a beautiful legacy for his community. My son Simon was one of the babies who slept in the cradle (1980). Perhaps some of the families who used it might come together to mourn those who died in St Andrews.</p><p>Joanna Baevski, Clifton Hill</p><p>Symbols of sorrow</p><p>AS I DROVE past Parliament House this morning, I wondered why the steps weren't covered with flowers as they had been soon after the Bali bombings. Has our State Government banned this commemorative recognition of deep trauma? Or do we simply care less when the many bushfire victims are our fellow Victorians?</p><p>I hope it is, instead, that we have put our personal funds towards providing practical services to those in need.</p><p>Elizabeth McDowall, Hawthorn</p><p>Selective facts</p><p>ALAN Barron (Letters, 13/2) says the fires were not caused by global warming but by arsonists. He then tells us we have \"not experienced anything outside normal weather patterns\". Is this why the Bureau of Meteorology issued a special climate statement for January and February in which it lists all the temperature records that have been broken and tells us that Melbourne has experienced its driest start to a year on record?</p><p>For years, climate scientists have been warning of more extreme weather conditions. It is absurd to suggest that recent conditions have not been extreme.</p><p>Barron makes the usual denier claim that average temperatures have declined since 2002. One only needs to look at a graph of global temperatures to see that the relentless upward trend is within a highly variable year-to-year pattern. Short-term trends are meaningless.</p><p>Indeed, given that we are at a low in the solar activity cycle and a low in the El Nino cycle, we should expect lower-than-normal temperatures. In a few years we will be at a high in those cycles. What then?</p><p>Keith Burrows, Fairfield</p><p>Taking advantage</p><p>SHAME, shame, shame on animal rights extremists for exploiting Victoria's bushfire tragedy to push their anti-hunting agenda (Letters, 13/2) . Most appalling of all is that the handful of zealots who oppose duck season are the same vocal minority who oppose fuel-reduction burns in areas at risk of bushfires.</p><p>Brett Parker, Creswick</p><p>Let's provide a roof for all</p><p>THE general homeless in Victoria and around Australia, living in cars or squatting in other people's lounge rooms, can only wish that they were bushfire refugees - with no disrespect meant to those who are. It is time we realised that all Australians are entitled to a good roof over their heads (and good food in their bellies) and widened our concern to all who are caught without a place to call home. The Federal Government's stimulus package is just the beginning.</p><p>Loucille McGinley, East Brighton</p><p>Extend a hand-out</p><p>I WILL be donating my portion of the stimulus package to the bushfire relief appeal. This money should be used to rebuild the devastated communities in an environmentally sustainable manner - solar systems, grey-water recycling - combating the effects of climate change and hopefully preventing another catastrophe as has been witnessed this week. My thoughts are with all those who have been touched by this tragedy.</p><p>Chiara Centra, Sale</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUSTRATION BY DYSON</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5nxpfodzllw86nwqjik</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7V0X-08W1-2RR2-D1VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 14, 2009 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNK2</classCode><className>DIARY KEEPING &amp; JOURNALING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLGZ</classCode><className>ANIMAL SHELTERS &amp; RESCUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000092</classCode><className>ANIMAL WELFARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DRME</classCode><className>COMMUNITY GARDENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001840</classCode><className>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We at this time have 25 confirmed deceased from the fires but look those numbers are going to change as we move forward during today. We have concerns that those numbers are going to be quite substantial.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have concerns about what's taken place in the Kinglake fire. Certainly out around Marysville, Whittlesea, up around Kilmore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So you know, we're only just getting into those fire zones now and you know we'll have a lot of work, a very difficult task for our police and emergency services today to do the searches. And obviously we're going to locate more deceased.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: Now take us through where those confirmed deaths have occurred.</p><p>KIERAN WALSHE: We have some confirmed deaths in the St Andrews, Strathewen area, Kinglake, Kinglake West, Bendigo and also around just, I'm just trying to recall now, there is another locality - oh, Humevale, sorry.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: And we're getting unconfirmed reports of deaths in Gippsland as well and other reports of people just now being found in their cars.</p><p>KIERAN WALSHE: Look, we expect that to take place. One of the difficulties we've had as I said is trying to get into these fire zones. We have to make sure that the environment is safe for the investigators.</p><p>We have a number of disaster victim identification personnel who are being deployed this morning along with some investigative teams to do this particular work for us. It's not going to be a pleasant day for them.</p><p>I suppose the message I really want to continue to put out to the community is that there is a lot of work to be done, a lot of very difficult work to be done. And I'm asking the community to respect that work, respect those difficult tasks and if they don't go to those areas. Please stay away.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: And when you hear about these reports of people, six people in one case being burnt to death in their cars and yet you see the devastation at Marysville, you don't stay surely when a town is burning like that? But then what hope have you got when you try and outrun it?</p><p>KIERAN WALSHE: Well these fires have been very, very fast and very, very violent and ferocious I suppose is the word. One of the difficulties is that you know our fire service is always saying to residents, you know if you're going to leave, leave early. If you're going to stay and defend, well you stay and defend.</p><p>We don't really know what the circumstances are of these people who have died in these vehicles. We will have to wait 'til we get some investigators on scene just to see what has taken place. We don't really know at this stage whether they've been involved in collisions or if they've run off the road; whether the vehicles have broken down. We just don't know and we won't know for quite some hours yet, maybe even some days, 'til we get to identify and validate what's taken place.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: And Deputy Prime Minister <person><nameText>Julia Gillard, </nameText></person>a Victorian yourself of course, what's your reaction this morning?</p><p><person><nameText>JULIA GILLARD, </nameText></person>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: Well I of course lived through Ash Wednesday and many other Melbournians would have and I think the emotions are the same. It's just the breadth of it, the fact that so much is still unknown, the concern about family and friends; it's just an awful, awful day.</p><p>And I would certainly echo what is being said that people I think have to prepare themselves for continuing bad news and people have to respect the instructions of the police and our emergency services workers at this time.</p><p>The Federal Government obviously is going to assist in any way we can. The Prime Minister spent a section of last night, very late last night and into the early hours of this morning being briefed by our emergency management experts and talking to the Premier John Brumby.</p><p>And the Prime Minister is coming here today. Indeed he'd be on the ground in Melbourne by now to get on the spot reports and to work with Premier Brumby on the disaster relief arrangements. But clearly that is going to unfold today and the days beyond as we continue to work through exactly what has happened with these incredibly devastating fires.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: In 1983 when the bushfires broke out in Victoria it was in the middle of an election campaign and Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke called the campaign off for a few days.</p><p>You've got important work to do at the moment but it's going to be very difficult I'd imagine to focus on the politics for a while.</p><p><person><nameText>JULIA GILLARD</nameText></person>: Well the key focus here is going to be on you know getting these fires out obviously. We're still in the midst of it actually, putting fires out and working out what has happened and then rolling out the disaster relief arrangements. So that's the Prime Minister's focus. It's what he was doing into the early hours of this morning and what he is doing here today.</p><p>Because the information is still patchy even with the best of the emergency services advice, we don't know precisely what's going in each part of the State. Having the Prime Minister here I think means he's going to be in the position to get the best possible information today.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: And you talk about disaster relief and right now the Government is trying to spend money and you're trying to spend it fast. Now it just seems to me there are going to be whole towns that will need rebuilding in Victoria.</p><p><person><nameText>JULIA GILLARD</nameText></person>: There are going to be whole towns that need rebuilding. There are going to be people who need emergency income support. There may be a need for additional assistance and work at our hospitals as they deal with people who have got injuries.</p><p>All of it obviously is in front of us to deal with as we work our way through this process. We're going to do everything we can as quickly as we can. We're obviously in a situation now where people are still on the ground fighting fires and trying to work out where everybody is and what has happened to families and friends.</p><p>But we'll be here with the emergency relief arrangements. Already there was a request to the Federal Government for example for emergency bedding that's been responded to. We have the ability to move the defence forces as necessary to assist and then there will be the income relief and the rebuilding work.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: Kieran Walshe, at one stage I heard yesterday there was something like 400 fires around the State. How many are now out of control and how do you coordinate an effort where there are so many fronts?</p><p>KIERAN WALSHE: Yes, look I was about 350 incidents yesterday. There's still nine fires that are still causing concern and that are not yet contained.</p><p>We have been able to set up an integrated emergency coordination centre of all the fire services and emergency services. And that's been operating and all the activities are being coordinated through there and it's a cooperative effort between all of the emergency services to ensure that we are able to do the best we can for the people in the State of Victoria.</p><p>It hasn't been easy. It's not going to be easy into the future but you know, we're confident that the arrangements we have in place will make sure that we can get the resources to where the resources are needed.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: And there's a situation at the Loy Yang power station as I understand it and if things were to go terribly wrong there then that would deny power, wouldn't it, to Melbourne?</p><p>KIERAN WALSHE: Well there's always a risk. You know, Loy Yang is a considerable supplier of electricity to Melbourne and we'll need to make sure that we keep that facility protected so that we can maintain the power through to Melbourne.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: And the property losses - what's your understanding on where the greater number of houses were lost? As I understand it there were some 50 homes or so around Bendigo and that was in the outer suburbs of Bendigo.</p><p>KIERAN WALSHE: Well that's right on the outer suburbs of Bendigo, yes, and I'm advised of 50 houses there. Look, I think this morning the collective figure that's being put out is around about 100 houses.</p><p>Again, I would expect that to rise considerable as we move forward into these fire zones today. You know, we'll have considerable housing losses around the Kilmore Whittlesea Kinglake fire. We know we've had considerable losses out at Marysville. We've had losses down in the Bunyip State Forest fire. We'll have losses out at Horsham and other parts of the State. And it will take a bit of time for us to get the collation of all those losses together.</p><p>BARRIE CASSIDY: And I understand that now we're hearing reports that at least two children are among those who have been killed and I guess that's no surprise.</p><p>At the hospitals two are right now at the Austin and Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. As I understand it <person><nameText>Julia Gillard </nameText></person>there are some seven to 10 very seriously injured patients being treated. So it's, these sorts of stories are going to come through as the day unfolds.</p><p><person><nameText>JULIA GILLARD</nameText></person>: They absolutely are and I think there would have been people yesterday I mean obviously in the city we saw the, felt the cool change and ironically people would have thought, well that's going to make things better whereas really it's just made it more unpredictable and difficult to know where these fire fronts are going to go.</p><p>And I think there would have been many people who went to bed last night not realising they were going to wake up to news as bad as this.</p><p>And I would say to Kieran, to people who have got up this morning and seen the sort of footage that we're seeing now, what should they do if they're absolutely frantic to try and find out what's happened to a family member or friend in these circumstances?</p><p>KIERAN WALSHE: Look they can ring in to the Red Cross. There is a Red Cross hotline. And we've been doing some work with Red Cross this morning to get some additional resources around that particular line.</p><p>(On screen text: \"RED CROSS INFORMATION LINE: 1800 727 077\")</p><p>We know that there will be a lot of people in the State who are unable to contact family and friends and they will be desperately trying to get some information. We're doing our best we can to get that going for them this morning.</p><p>But I think the other part of the message is, and you did mention there, the temperatures are quite cooler in Melbourne today but they're still extreme in the northern parts of the State. There is a major fire going up at Beechworth.</p><p>And I'd just like to say to the community, look it's not over yet. You know, there's still a lot of work to be done by the emergency services. It's certainly going to go right through today. It'll go through the next couple of days and when you look at some of the enormity of some of these fires it is going to take maybe a couple of weeks before they're totally blacked out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-2485349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7TYS-MK70-Y9Y8-N00X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473394</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1820\"/><timeReceived>9:13 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 8, 2009 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Emergency Incidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law, Crime and Justice/Police</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>PE000D1BW</classCode><className>JULIA GILLARD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Bolt after bolt of lightning crashed through the tinder-dry mountain ash forests of the Great Dividing Range as a storm swept across.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It brought a barrage of lightning but precious little rain. The bases of the trees that conducted these bolts to earth burst into flames and before long authorities were battling more than 80 fires spread over hundreds of thousands of hectares.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">''We had mass ignition over a relatively short period of time, about 12 hours I reckon: virtually a dry thunderstorm right across the ranges,'' the Government's chief fire officer Ewan Waller recalls.</p><p>Helicopters were soon flying low over the ranges, unloading teams of firefighters via ropes to try to snuff out the blazes. Waller says that before long his crews began to report strange and worrying signs for what were supposed to be small fires. The messages being radioed back told of exponential fire growth, searing heat and an almost impossible task.</p><p>''What they were finding when they got in there was they weren't half a hectare, they were 5ha. They were just so hard to put out,'' Waller says. ''The fires were spreading quickly: every stump and every log was alight and the crews had to physically stay longer. We weren't getting anywhere near capturing the the 80 fires, we were only capturing a small percentage of them.</p><p>''Within days we had a whole array of fires in difficult country and all developing very quickly. What we were finding was the aircraft weren't having their normal impact. They were holding to a certain degree, but not like they normally would.''</p><p>Within two weeks these fires had combined into a single mountain inferno that has loomed over the country's southeast corner like a brooding giant, ready to unleash destruction on communities to its south, east and west.</p><p>Before it's extinguished, this fire may well burn out one-fifth of the state and experts have warned it may burn to the coast in the south and the NSW border in the northeast.</p><p>The freakish dryness in the state's forests has led this fire to do extraordinary things. Firefighters have reported that on hot nights it is still crowning -- racing from treetop to treetop with a deafening roar -- at 2.30am, when even a fearsome fire is normally dormant.</p><p>At times it has run before the northerly winds at up to 5km an hour, laying waste to the forest in its path. Several times last-ditch efforts from fire crews and last-minute wind changes have saved communities from being burned to the ground. Crews carving a firebreak in Melbourne's water catchment completed their line just hours before the fire arrived and they were able to prevent it from burning out the watershed and jeopardising the city's supply.</p><p>Just as the fire behaviour has changed this summer, so too has the community response to it. Although almost 1,000,000ha of land and 32 houses have been burned and a serious fire is still out of control after almost six weeks, there is little sense that the state is in crisis. Alert but not alarmed seems to be the attitude.</p><p>Fire agencies have worked hard to shift the emphasis to individual responsibility, compelling landowners to make arrangements for preparing and defending their properties. They have also held countless community meetings in a concerted effort to provide timely information for residents to make that crucial decision: should I stay or should I go? There also seems to be an acceptance among some rural dwellers that the drought or climate change has made a serious fire this year inevitable.</p><p>Victorian Nationals leader Peter Ryan, who has been touring the fire-affected regions in his electorate of Gippsland South and beyond, agrees the public's understanding and anticipation of fire danger has grown.</p><p>''I think there has been a culture change, but I also think there's a sense of frustration in that the management of the public land issue has been able to spill over again,'' he says.</p><p>He says people are grateful for the heroic efforts of the up to 2400 firefighters tackling the blaze, but they are tired after six weeks on tenterhooks, dreading the next day of hot northerly winds.</p><p>The tensions that have bedevilled relations between the mainly volunteer Country Fire Authority force (whose main responsibility is private land) and the Department of Sustainability and Environment's paid firefighters (whose principal concern is public land) have been far less than in previous fires, the Nationals leader has found.</p><p>But, according to Ryan, people feel let down by the fact that the DSE has not done enough to burn off in the autumn and reduce the fuel load in the forests. The DSE burned off just 50,000ha from a target of 135,000ha: a failing Waller blames on the lack of rainfall in autumn and unfavourable weather that made it too risky to conduct fuel-reduction burns.</p><p>Ryan says the department needs to employ far more year-round fire fighters so it can do these burns in a broader range of conditions.</p><p>Athol Hodgson, a former chief fire officer in Victoria who is now a consultant and campaigner for reform of land management practices, says the DSE has stripped rangers from the field in remote locations, hampering its ability to respond quickly to lightning strikes and push for fuel reduction burns when fuel loads in the local forests got too high.</p><p>He says blaming the fire on climate change obscures the real cause of this summer's extraordinary blaze. ''I think that's a red herring. I think it's the result of the lack of the right kind of fire in theforests over the last two or three decades,'' he says.</p><p>Hodgson believes the crucial rapid access to lightning strikes is being hampered because the DSE has allowed many fire trails to grow over or has simply closed them off.</p><p>Waller, a level-headed man who fought this kind of forest fire when he was a young forest ranger, seems willing to accept some of the criticism over the missed fuel reductions.</p><p>But he says that although the target was missed, there was a lot of burning around vulnerable communities, and towns such as Woods Point were saved because of this.</p><p>And he seems determined to learn from the mistakes of the past. In a key policy shift this summer, the department has decided to turn hundreds of kilometres of temporary fire breaks -- 40m-wide swaths of bulldozed land -- into permanent bushfire barriers, instead of revegetating them.</p><p>Victorian Environment Minister John Thwaites says the Government boosted resources for this fire season, hiring more aircraft and bringing forward preparations, but the key improvement had been the decision to hold the community meetings in affected areas as often as possible.</p><p>Thwaites stops short of saying major fires are inevitable every year in this part of theworld but he is convinced climate change is making them much more frequent than in the past. ''No one can say what proportion is due to drought or long-term climate change. I certainly would say climate change is increasing the risk of major fires,'' he says.</p><p>''Since the 1950s we have had an increase of an extra five high fire risk days a year. We are looking to have 20 per cent more high-fire risk days by2020.''</p><p>On average, about 135,000ha are lost to fire each year in Victoria: this year it will be more than 1,000,000ha, and there are almost two months of high fire risk left. Just four years ago, the 2002-03 season saw another 1,200,000ha burned out.</p><p>This level of destruction -- the present fire has cost almost $150 million to fight -- has decision-makers thinking about better ways of tackling the yearly summer menace.</p><p>Enthusiasm is growing among some in fire agencies and the South Australian Government for a German-engineered plan to launch a network of mini-satellites that would locate and photograph fires as soon as they are larger than a campfire.</p><p>The system can produce infra-red and photographic images of the chosen point every 90 minutes, providing vital information for the firefighters on the ground and for agencies to direct aircraft to tackle lightning strikes.</p><p>The AUSBIRD satellite system will cost $300 million to launch and will need paying clients in Australia and perhaps abroad to proceed. Nevertheless, the South Australian Government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the consortium behind it, comprised of German aerospace agency DLR, two German firms and Australian company Euro Pacific Strategies, and it has locked in Adelaide as the project's base, if it proceeds.</p><p>However, even well-directed aircraft cannot completely snuff out such spot fires: this requires rain or direct human intervention. So, although a satellite system would be useful, it wouldn't be a panacea.</p><p>But there seems to be broad agreement that prevention is far cheaper and more effective than even the best efforts of the crews of volunteers and professionals fighting the fires.</p><p>With employers in the drought-stricken rural regions losing large chunks of their work force to firefighting duties and tourist numbers plummeting in many country towns, some businesses could be bankrupted by the present blaze. The eventual impact on Victoria could be far greater than the $150 million spent so far and the death toll among those fighting the fire, which stands at one, may wellrise.</p><p>However, relief from the punishing El Nino climate cycle that has kept this part of the country labouring in the yoke of drought appears nigh. The Bureau of Meteorology reports that falling sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific and rising trade winds show the El Nino may be starting to wane.</p><p>The bad news is relief may not arrive until February or March, by when time the fires may have become among the worst in southeastern Australia's history.</p><p><person><nameText>Rick Wallace </nameText></person>is The Australian's Victorian political reporter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0701121011760631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4MT0-52R0-TX52-F2TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian (Australia)</publicationName><edition>All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>January 12, 2007 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE000A4IK</classCode><className>RICHARD P WALLACE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3C5</classCode><className>GREAT DIVIDING RANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

On one hand the commissioners emphasise the need to jettison euphemistic talk when it comes to bushfires. They recommend warnings be written in simple, direct language.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But on the other hand they invent new euphemisms of their own. For all intents and purposes the \"relocation\" spoken of in the interim report is nothing more or less than the selective, voluntary evacuation that had been discussed throughout eight weeks of hearings.</p><p>No witness had seriously advocated forcing people from their homes. Indeed the discussion had centred on whether there should be mass departures from areas under threat - of residents' own accord but assisted by authorities.</p><p>But lawyers for the Victorian Government had opposed even that, proposing no change to the state's evacuation policy in time for this fire season. In their report the commissioners have accepted the notion put forward by the Victorian Government that evacuation carries an unacceptable connotation that people will be forced to leave. Perhaps it does for some, but its strongest connotation is one of urgency. That sense of urgency is all but lost in a word like \"relocation\" which sounds more leisurely than urgent.</p><p>On the question of refuges, too, the commissioners have couched their recommendations in terms favoured by the Government. Refuges are advocated, but the interim report also endorses the concept of \"neighbourhood safer places\" - despite being considerably vague on what exactly they are and how they are different from refuges.</p><p>Safer places</p><p>The closest the Premier John Brumby has come to defining \"safer places\" is to say they might be an oval or a brick house in a street of timber ones.</p><p>But ovals were among the refuges that previously existed but were progressively decommissioned around the state because of liability concerns. What's new here except the name?</p><p>And if there's one thing Black Saturday showed it's that brick houses can burn alongside wood ones in intense fires. The respected fire ecologist Dr Kevin Tolhurst has expressed serious reservations about \"safer places\" of this ilk.</p><p>Perhaps the semantics that lace their way through the report are part of Commissioner Bernard Teague's softly, softly approach - a conscious judgment that beating the Government about the head would only serve to alienate the powers that be less than halfway through a Royal Commission that will depend for its success on the political will to implement its recommendations. But it's an approach that's muddied what were already decidedly cloudy waters.</p><p>Scathing assessment</p><p>Make no mistake, the interim report is a scathing assessment of the bushfire system in place on Black Saturday. Among other things, the commissioners note that the state's two most senior firefighters - Country Fire Authority chief Russell Rees and forest fire chief Ewan Waller from the Department of Sustainability - only considered the devastating potential of the forecast wind change after it blew through, turning the flank of the fire into a massive front.</p><p>The commissioners also note that Mr Rees saw no fire prediction maps for the Kilmore fire that destroyed Kinglake and made no use of fire behaviour analysts to the point where it was \"difficult to understand how Mr Rees could properly carry out a strategic statewide coordination\".</p><p>It's no small criticism and one the Victorian Premier has failed to adequately address. Protestations that such criticisms are only \"preliminary observations\" ignore the gravity of the failings identified.</p><p>Relying on the interim nature of the findings to undermine their import is plainly out of kilter with the express purpose of the interim report - to allow changes to be made so that Victorians might be safer this summer.</p><p>Perhaps the most disturbing criticism in the report has evidently gone entirely unheeded as both the CFA and the Victorian Government continue to back Mr Rees as the best man to lead the fire agencies into a season that's predicted to be at least as bad as the last.</p><p>Legitimate questions about the way he performed his role on Black Saturday are consistently brushed aside with assurances that \"everyone tried their best\".</p><p>Spin</p><p>The spin surrounding the Royal Commission is now such that it's bordering on impossible for journalists to deliver intelligible reports. On the day of the interim report's release journalists were at first offered just an hour and a quarter to examine the report before a conga line of fire chiefs, police chiefs and ministers were made available to take questions.</p><p>In the end, reporters corralled in the Park Hyatt ballroom were given trays full of sandwiches and biscuits and bottomless cups of tea and coffee but scarcely an hour to scrutinise the document, which arrived late. John Brumby talked over most of that time with a power point presentation outlining what the Government had already done about each of the recommendations.</p><p>The focus of the measures put in place by the Victorian Government in the days after the commissioners released their interim recommendations was an announcement of 52 towns at particular risk of bushfire this summer - and the declaration of a \"bushfire preparedness\" week in October.</p><p>The Premier posed on ladders clearing out gutters and shovelled leaves into wheelbarrows. Community education is, of course, important. And the 52 towns will no doubt benefit from the \"township protection plans\" that are developed - although the concept is not new and existed before Black Saturday.</p><p>But pointing to bushy, densely populated areas that haven't burned yet and saying they're susceptible to bushfire is no great revelation. To offer announcements like these in the two days immediately after such damning revelations smacks of tokenism.</p><p>Without exception the most serious failures identified in the report happened within the fire agencies themselves - not on the part of individuals. The Brumby Government's response to the interim report is reminiscent of the early days at the Commission where the tactic of Government lawyers was to put the onus back on the community.</p><p>The Premier is fond of saying that until Black Saturday Victoria's bushfire systems were considered the best in the world. But it's a hollow claim in light of what's contained in the pages of the interim report, which Mr Brumby says he's read.</p><p>In order to improve warnings to the community, the commissioners have in fact recommended that warnings issued by the CFA comply with principles laid out in reports that date back to 2008 and even 2004. That CFA practice could be improved by reference to material that existed five years before Black Saturday is damning.</p><p>Stay or go revamp not new</p><p>When it comes to the stay or go policy too, the revamp that's been recommended is little more than a restoration of what the policy should arguably have been in the first instance.</p><p>The proposed emphasis on the fact that some homes will not be defendable against high intensity bushfires - and on leaving early - is there in black and white in an Australasian Fire Authorities Council paper written in 2005.</p><p>But critical caveats like these, while known, were not incorporated into the literature produced by the CFA. The AFAC position statement also explicitly recognises the need for people to have \"contingency plans\" in case their stay or go decision doesn't work out. But again the commissioners have found that the CFA literature fails to grapple with the need for plans B and C.</p><p>The stay or go policy also states that \"there will be cases where ordered evacuation will be considered by the authorities\". But the Victorian policy as it stood on Black Saturday not only rejected mandatory evacuation but also expressly forbid CFA personnel from advising residents to undertake any particular response when threatened by bushfire.</p><p>The problem, according to the commissioners, is not the stay or go policy, but the way the Victorian authorities saw fit to translate it into practice. Surely this calls into serious question the judgment of those presiding over the policy's implementation in this state and is far from the Premier's claims of \"best practice\"?</p><p>Warnings failed to cut through</p><p>All is not well either when it comes to the education campaigns in the lead up to the fire season. The fire chief and the Premier frequently refer to how diligently they tried to warn the public ahead of Black Saturday - and the interim report does praise these efforts.</p><p>But the fact remains that only one in five of the Victorians interviewed by the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre since Black Saturday said they were aware of the heightened level of risk predicted for the day.</p><p>Very few people indicated the forecast and the warnings prior to February 7 had resulted in them changing their behaviour. For all the effort, the authorities just weren't effective in achieving the desired outcome. All this points to the need for drastic change in the approach to fire safety in Victoria.</p><p>The commissioners' comments that the Victorian fire agencies are defined by a \"drive for philosophical purity and theoretical consistency\", by \"rigidity and uniformity where flexibility and appreciation of diversity are called for\" perhaps hint at the enormity of the cultural change required above and beyond the policies themselves.</p><p>So far the CFA and John Brumby's actions have spoken louder than their words on this front - with no change to the leadership team at the helm of the fire agencies.</p><p>Lost in the system</p><p>A detailed reading of the report prompts other questions too. One of the recommendations suggests incident controllers should be the ones to make an assessment of whether people should urgently relocate and then include that advice in warnings.</p><p>Already incident controllers are ultimately responsible for warnings. But the Commission has heard several incident controllers in charge of the Kilmore fire on Black Saturday never saw what warnings were going out - many of which were hopelessly late or inexplicably lost in the system.</p><p>What the commissioners propose will lump even more responsibility on incident controllers who have been demonstrably unable to manage their existing tasks. Keeping the decision making close to the fire ground makes sense, but how will incident controllers find the time to manage yet another critical task?</p><p>For all the hope pinned on it and all the anticipation of its findings, the Brumby Government has effectively neutralised the fallout from the interim report. The Premier's media train took up every last gasp of air time for two days running. It seemed as though John Brumby hardly gave a press conference without orange fire suits conveniently placed over one shoulder.</p><p>Mr Rees dutifully ran the gauntlet of breakfast television, batting away the questions of increasingly exasperated journalists. But most of these questions were asked before there'd been time to closely examine what was really in the interim report. And - apart from a few stinging newspaper editorials - by the third day the public appetite seemed to have waned.</p><p>In the weekend papers the interim report barely rated a mention and by the following week there was barely a bushfire question for John Brumby to field. The heat was gone from the report before most of the journalists reporting on it had done more than scan its pages.</p><p>Besides, much of the detail of safer places and neighbourhood protection plans had become far too convoluted to be tackled in the average news story. Governments spin things because it works and this was masterfully done.</p><p>And still the Premier is calling the fire \"unprecedented\" as if that somehow explains away the indisputable fact, borne out in evidence at the Commission, that so many of the breakdowns acknowledged and admitted by the fire chief were so fundamental that they arguably had nothing to do with the fire itself.</p><p>Ambiguous warning messages, ill-prepared incident control centres and fire chiefs who paid scant attention to the science of prediction might not have such disastrous consequences with a less intense fire but that's a case of good luck rather than good management.</p><p>Such failures boil down to plain bad practice, practice that the authorities have perhaps gotten away with to an extent until now. It was 44 years between Black Friday and Ash Wednesday. Surely the big fire, the once-in-a-generation, catastrophic fire is the one fire agencies should plan for?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-2673451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WHP-FXG1-2RG7-2032-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2162\"/><timeReceived>4:32 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>September 1, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Flowerdale 3717</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Kilmore 3764</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Kinglake 3763</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Event/ROYAL COMMISSION.

Cole was a founder of the Hudson River School and one of the pioneers of 19thcentury American landscape painting; in The Course of Empire, he beautifully captured a theory of imperial rise and fall to which most people remain in thrall to this day.</p><p>Each of the five imagined scenes depicts the mouth of a great river beneath a rocky outcrop. In the first, The Savage State, a lush wilderness is populated by a handful of hunter-gatherers eking out a primitive existence at the break of a stormy dawn. The second picture, The Arcadian or Pastoral State, is of an agrarian idyll: the inhabitants have cleared the trees, planted fields and built an elegant Greek temple. The third and largest of the paintings is The Consummation of Empire. Now, the landscape is covered by a magnificent marble entrep\u00c3\u00b4t, and the contented farmer-philosophers of the previous tableau have been replaced by a throng of opulently clad merchants, proconsuls and citizen-consumers. It is midday in the life cycle. Then comes Destruction . The city is ablaze, its citizens fleeing an invading horde that rapes and pillages beneath a brooding evening sky. Finally, the moon rises over the fifth painting, Desolation. There is not a living soul to be seen, only a few decaying columns and colonnades overgrown by briars and ivy. (See illustration, page 11.)</p><p>Conceived in the mid-1830s, Cole's great pentaptych has a clear message: all empires, no matter how magnificent, are condemned to decline and fall. The implicit suggestion was that the young American republic of Cole's age would be better served by sticking to its bucolic first principles and resisting the imperial temptations of commerce, conquest and colonisation.</p><p>For centuries, historians, political theorists, anthropologists and the public at large have tended to think about empires in such cyclical and gradual terms. \"The best instituted governments,\" the British political philosopher Henry St John, first viscount Bolingbroke, wrote in 1738, \"carry in them the seeds of their destruction: and, though they grow and improve for a time, they will soon tend visibly to their dissolution. Every hour they live is an hour less that they have to live.\"</p><p>Idealists and materialists alike have shared that assumption. In his book Scienza nuova (1725), the Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico describes all civilisations as passing through three phases: the divine, the heroic and the human, finally dissolving into what Vico called \"the barbarism of reflection\". For Hegel and Marx, it was the dialectic that gave history its unmistakable beat. History was seasonal for Oswald Spengler, the German historian, who wrote in his 1918-22 book, The Decline of the West, that the 19thcentury had been \"the winter of the West, the victory of materialism and scepticism, of socialism, parliamentarianism and money\". The British historian Arnold Toynbee's universal theory of civilisation proposed a cycle of challenge, response and suicide. Each of these models is different, but all share the idea that history has rhythm.</p><p>Although hardly anyone reads Spengler or Toynbee today, similar strains of thought are visible in contemporary bestsellers. Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers is another work of cyclical history - despite its profusion of statistical tables, which at first sight make it seem the very antithesis of Spenglerian grand theory. In Kennedy's model, great powers rise and fall according to the growth rates of their industrial bases and the costs of their imperial commitments relative to their gross domestic products. Just as in Cole's The Course of Empire, imperial expansion carries the seeds of future decline. As Kennedy writes, \"If a state overextends itself strategically... it runs the risk that the potential benefits from external expansion may be outweighed by the great expense of it all.\" This phenomenon of \"imperial overstretch\", Kennedy argues, is common to all great powers. In 1987, when Kennedy's book was published, the United States worried that it might be succumbing to this disease. Just because the Soviet Union fell first did not necessarily invalidate the hypothesis.</p><p>More recently, it is Jared Diamond, an anthropologist, who has captured the public imagination with a grand theory of rise and fall. His 2005 book, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, is cyclical history for the so-called Green Age: tales of past societies, from 17thcentury Easter Island to 21stcentury China, that risked, or now risk, destroying themselves by abusing their natural environments. Diamond quotes John Lloyd Stevens, the American explorer and amateur archaeologist who discovered the eerily dead Mayan cities of Mexico: \"Here were the remains of a cultivated, polished and peculiar people, who had passed through all the stages incident to the rise and fall of nations, reached their golden age and perished.\" According to Diamond, the Maya fell into a classic Malthusian trap as their population grew larger than their fragile and inefficient agricultural system could support. More people meant more cultivation, but more cultivation meant deforestation, erosion, drought and soil exhaustion. The result was civil war over dwindling resources and, finally, collapse.</p><p>Diamond's warning is that today's world could go the way of the Maya. This is an important message, no doubt. But in reviving the cyclical theory of history, Collapse reproduces an old conceptual defect. Diamond makes the mistake of focusing on what historians of the French Annales school called la longue dur\u00c3\u00a9e, the long term. No matter whether civilisations commit suicide culturally, economically, or ecologically, the downfall is very protracted. Just as it takes centuries for imperial overstretch to undermine a great power, so, too, does it take centuries to wreck an ecosystem. As Diamond points out, political leaders in almost any society - primitive or sophisticated - have little incentive to address problems that are unlikely to manifest themselves for 100years or more.</p><p>Did the proconsuls in Cole's The Consummation of Empire really care if the fate of their great-great-grandchildren was destruction? No. Would they have accepted a tax increase that would have financed a pre-emptive strike against the next millennium's barbarian horde? Again, no. As the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen last December made clear, rhetorical pleas to save the planet for future generations are insufficient to overcome the conflicts over economic distribution between rich and poor countries that exist in the here and now.</p><p>The current economic challenges facing the US are also often represented as long-term threats. It is the slow march of demographics - which is driving up the ratio of retirees to workers - and not current policy, that condemns the public finances of the US to sink deeper into the red. According to the Congressional Budget Office's \"alternative fiscal scenario\", which takes into account likely changes in government policy, public debt could rise from 44percent before the financial crisis to a staggering 716percent by 2080. In its \"extended-baseline scenario\", which assumes current policies will remain the same, the figure is closer to 280percent. It hardly seems to matter which number is correct. Is there a single member of Congress who is willing to cut entitlements or increase taxes in order to avert a crisis that will culminate only when today's babies are retirees?</p><p>Similarly, when it comes to the global economy, the wheel of history seems to revolve slowly, like an old water mill in high summer. Some projections suggest that China's GDP will overtake the US's GDP in 2027; others say that this will not happen until 2040. By 2050, India's economy will supposedly catch up with that of the US, too. But to many, these great changes in the balance of economic power seem very remote compared with the timeframe for the deployment of US soldiers to Afghanistan and then their withdrawal, for which the unit of account is months, not years, much less decades.</p><p>Yet it is possible that this whole conceptual framework is, in fact, flawed. Perhaps Cole's artistic representation of imperial birth, growth and eventual death is a misrepresentation of the historical process. What if history is not cyclical and slow moving but arrhythmic - at times almost stationary, but also capable of accelerating suddenly, like a sports car? What if collapse does not arrive over a number of centuries but comes suddenly, like a thief in the night?</p><p>Great powers and empires are, I would suggest, complex systems, made up of a very large number of interacting components that are asymmetrically organised, which means their construction more resembles a termite hill than an Egyptian pyramid. They operate somewhere between order and disorder - on \"the edge of chaos\", in the phrase of the computer scientist Christopher Langton. Such systems can appear to operate quite stably for some time; they seem to be in equilibrium but are, in fact, constantly adapting. But there comes a moment when complex systems \"go critical\". A very small trigger can set off a transition from a benign equilibrium to a crisis - a single grain of sand causes a whole pile to collapse, or a butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazon and brings about a hurricane in south-eastern England.</p><p>Not long after such crises happen, historians arrive on the scene. They are the scholars who specialise in the study of \"fat tail\" events - the low-frequency, high-impact moments that inhabit the tails of probability distributions, such as wars, revolutions, financial crashes and imperial collapses. But historians often misunderstand complexity in decoding these events. They are trained to explain calamity in terms of long-term causes, often dating back decades. This is what Nassim Taleb rightly condemned in The Black Swan as \"the narrative fallacy\": the construction of psychologically satisfying stories on the principle of post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this therefore because of this).</p><p>Drawing casual inferences about causation is an age-old habit. Take World WarI. A huge war breaks out in the summer of 1914, to the great surprise of nearly everyone. Before long, historians have devised a story line commensurate with the disaster: a treaty governing the neutrality of Belgium that was signed in 1839, the waning of Ottoman power in the Balkans dating back to the 1870s, and malevolent Germans and the navy they began building in 1897. A contemporary version of this fallacy traces the 9/11 attacks back to the Egyptian government's 1966 execution of Sayyid Qutb, the Islamist writer who inspired the Muslim Brotherhood. Most recently, the financial crisis that began in2007 has been attributed to measures of financial deregulation taken in the US in the 1980s.</p><p>In reality, the proximate triggers of a crisis are often sufficient to explain the sudden shift from a good equilibrium to a bad mess. Thus, World WarI was actually caused by a series of diplomatic miscalculations in the summer of 1914, the real origins of 9/11 lie in the politics of Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, and the financial crisis was principally due to errors in monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve and to China's rapid accumulation of dollar reserves after 2001. Most of the fat-tail phenomena that historians study are not the climaxes of prolonged and deterministic story lines; instead, they represent perturbations, and sometimes the complete breakdowns, of complex systems.</p><p>To understand complexity, it is helpful to examine how natural scientists use the concept. Think of the spontaneous organisation of half a million ants or termites, which allows them to construct complex hills and nests, or the fractal geometry of water molecules as they form intricate snowflakes. Human intelligence itself is a complex system, a product of the interaction of billions of neurons in the central nervous system, or what Charles Sherrington, the pioneering neuroscientist, called \"an enchanted loom\".</p><p>The political and economic structures made by humans share many of the features of complex adaptive systems. Heterodox economists such as WBrian Arthur have been arguing along these lines for decades. To Arthur, a complex economy is characterised by the interaction of dispersed agents, a lack of central control, multiple levels of organisation, continual adaptation, incessant creation of new market niches, and the absence of general equilibrium. This conception of economics goes beyond both Adam Smith's hallowed idea that an \"invisible hand\" causes markets to work through the interactions of profit-maximising individuals and Friedrich von Hayek's critique of economic planning and demand management. In contradiction to the classic economic prediction that competition causes diminishing returns, a complex economy makes increasing returns possible. In this version of economics, Silicon Valley is a complex adaptive system; so is the internet itself.</p><p>Researchers at the Santa Fe Institute, a non-profit centre devoted to the study of complex systems, are currently looking at how such insights can be applied to other aspects of collective human activity, including international relations. This effort may recall the futile struggle of Edward Casaubon to find \"the key to all mythologies\" in George Eliot's novel Middlemarch. But the attempt is worthwhile, because an understanding of how complex systems function is an essential part of any strategy to anticipate and delay their failure.</p><p>Whether the canopy of a rain forest or the trading floor of Wall Street, complex systems share certain characteristics. A small input to such a system can produce huge, often unanticipated changes - what scientists call \"the amplifier effect\". A vaccine, for example, stimulates the immune system to become resistant to, say, measles or mumps. But administer too large a dose, and the patient dies. Meanwhile, causal relationships are often non-linear, which means that traditional methods of generalising through observation (such as trend analysis and sampling) are of little use. Some theorists of complexity would go so far as to say that complex systems are wholly non-deterministic, meaning that it is impossible to make predictions about their future behaviour based on existing data.</p><p>When things go wrong in a complex system, the scale of disruption is nearly impossible to anticipate. There is no such thing as a typical or average forest fire, for example. To use the jargon of modern physics, a forest before a fire is in a state of \"self-organised criticality\": it is teetering on the verge of a breakdown, but the size of the breakdown is unknown. Will there be a small fire or a huge one? It is very hard to say: a forest fire twice as large as last year's is roughly four or six or eight times less likely to happen this year. This kind of pattern - known as a \"power-law distribution\" - is remarkably common in the natural world. It can be seen not just in forest fires but also in earthquakes and epidemics. Some researchers claim that conflicts follow a similar pattern, ranging from local skirmishes to full-scale world wars.</p><p>What matters most is that in such systems a relatively minor shock can cause a disproportionate - and sometimes fatal - disruption. As Taleb has argued, by 2007, the global economy had grown to resemble an over-optimised electrical grid. Defaults on subprime mortgages produced a relatively small surge in the US that tipped the entire world economy into a financial blackout, which, for a moment, threatened to bring about a complete collapse of international trade. But blaming such a crash on a policy of deregulation under US president Ronald Reagan is about as plausible as blaming World War I on the build-up of the German navy under Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz.</p><p>Regardless of whether it is a dictatorship or a democracy, any large-scale political unit is a complex system. Most great empires have a nominal central authority - either a hereditary emperor or an elected president - but in practice the power of any individual ruler is a function of the network of economic, social and political relations over which he or she presides. As such, empires exhibit many of the characteristics of other complex adaptive systems - including the tendency to move from stability to instability quite suddenly. But this fact is rarely recognised because of the collective addiction to cyclical theories of history.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous story of imperial decline is that of ancient Rome. In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788, Edward Gibbon covered more than 1400years of history, from 180 to 1590. This was history over the very long run, in which the causes of decline ranged from the personality disorders of individual emperors to the power of the Praetorian Guard and the rise of monotheism. After the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180, civil war became a recurring problem, as aspiring emperors competed for the spoils of supreme power. By the fourth century, barbarian invasions or migrations were well under way and only intensified as the Huns moved west. Meanwhile, the challenge posed by Sassanid Persia to the Eastern Roman Empire was steadily growing.</p><p>But what if fourth-century Rome was simply functioning normally as a complex adaptive system, with political strife, barbarian migration and imperial rivalry all just integral features of late antiquity? Through this lens, Rome's fall was sudden and dramatic - just as one would expect when such a system goes critical. As the Oxford historians Peter Heather and Bryan Ward-Perkins have argued, the final breakdown in the Western Roman Empire began in 406, when Germanic invaders poured across the Rhine into Gaul and then Italy. Rome itself was sacked by the Goths in 410. Co-opted by an enfeebled emperor, the Goths then fought the Vandals for control of Spain, but this merely shifted the problem south. Between 429 and 439, Genseric led the Vandals to victory after victory in North Africa, culminating in the fall of Carthage. Rome lost its southern Mediterranean breadbasket and, along with it, a huge source of tax revenue. Roman soldiers were just barely able to defeat Attila's Huns as they swept west from the Balkans. By 452, the Western Roman Empire had lost all of Britain, most of Spain, the richest provinces of North Africa and south-western and south-eastern Gaul. Not much was left besides Italy. Basiliscus, brother-in-law of Emperor Leo I, tried and failed to recapture Carthage in 468. Byzantium lived on, but the Western Roman Empire was dead. By 476, Rome was the fiefdom of Odoacer, king of the Goths.</p><p>What is most striking about this history is the speed of the Roman Empire's collapse. In just five decades, the population of Rome itself fell by three-quarters. Archaeological evidence from the late fifth century - inferior housing, more primitive pottery, fewer coins, smaller cattle - shows that the benign influence of Rome diminished rapidly in the rest of western Europe. What Ward-Perkins calls \"the end of civilisation\" came within the span of a single generation.</p><p>Other great empires have suffered comparably swift collapses. The Ming dynasty in China began in 1368, when the warlord Zhu Yuanzhang renamed himself Emperor Hongwu, the word hongwu meaning \"vast military power\". For most of the next three centuries, Ming China was the world's most sophisticated civilisation by almost any measure. Then, in the mid-17thcentury, political factionalism, fiscal crisis, famine and epidemic disease opened the door to rebellion within and incursions from without. In 1636, the Manchu leader Huang Taiji proclaimed the advent of the Qing dynasty. Just eight years later, Beijing, the magnificent Ming capital, fell to the rebel leader LiZicheng, and the last Ming emperor hanged himself out of shame. The transition from Confucian equipoise to anarchy took little more than a decade.</p><p>In much the same way, the Bourbon monarchy in France passed from triumph to terror with astonishing rapidity. French intervention on the side of the colonial rebels against British rule in North America in the 1770s seemed like a good idea at the time - a chance for revenge after Great Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War a decade earlier - but it served to tip French finances into a critical state. In May 1789, the summoning of the Estates-General, France's long-dormant representative assembly, unleashed a political chain reaction that led to a swift collapse of royal legitimacy in France. Only four years later, in January 1793, Louis XVI was decapitated by guillotine.</p><p>Although several narrative fallacies suggest that the Hapsburg, Ottoman and Romanov empires were doomed for decades before World WarI, the disintegration of the dynastic land empires of eastern Europe came with equal swiftness. What was impressive, in fact, was how well these ancient empires were able to withstand the test of total war. Their collapse only began with the Bolshevik Revolution of October1917. A mere five years later, MehmedVI, the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire, departed Constantinople aboard a British warship. With that, all three dynasties were defunct.</p><p>The sun set on the British Empire almost as suddenly. In February 1945, prime minister Winston Churchill was at Yalta, dividing up the world with US President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. As World WarII was ending, he was swept from office in the July 1945 general election. Within a decade, the United Kingdom had conceded independence to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Egypt, Eritrea, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Libya, Madagascar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Suez crisis in 1956 proved that the UK could not act in defiance of the US in the Middle East, setting the seal on the end of empire. Although it took until the 1960s for independence to reach sub-Saharan Africa and the remnants of colonial rule east of the Suez, the UK's age of hegemony was effectively over less than a dozen years after its victories over Germany and Japan.</p><p>The most recent and familiar example of precipitous decline is, of course, the collapse of the Soviet Union. With the benefit of hindsight, historians have traced all kinds of rot within the Soviet system back to the Brezhnev era and beyond. Perhaps, as the historian and political scientist Stephen Kotkin has argued, it was only the high oil prices of the 1970s that \"averted Armageddon\". But this did not seem to be the case at the time. In March 1985, when Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, the CIA estimated the Soviet economy to be approximately 60percent the size of the US economy. This estimate is now known to have been wrong, but the Soviet nuclear arsenal was genuinely larger than the US stockpile. And governments in what was then called the Third World, from Vietnam to Nicaragua, had been tilting in the Soviets' favour for most of the previous 20 years. Yet less than five years after Gorbachev took power, the Soviet imperium in central and Eastern Europe had fallen apart, followed by the Soviet Union itself in 1991. If ever an empire fell off a cliff - rather than gently declining - it was the one founded by Lenin.</p><p>If empires are complex systems that sooner or later succumb to sudden and catastrophic malfunctions, rather than cycling sedately from Arcadia to Apogee to Armageddon, what are the implications for the US today? First, debating the stages of decline may be a waste of time - it is a precipitous and unexpected fall that should most concern policymakers and citizens. Second, most imperial falls are associated with fiscal crises. All the above cases were marked by sharp imbalances between revenues and expenditures, as well as difficulties with financing public debt. Alarm bells should therefore be ringing very loudly, indeed, as the US contemplates a deficit for 2009 of more than $US1.4trillion - about 11.2percent of GDP, the biggest deficit in 60 years - and another for 2010 that will not be much smaller. Public debt, meanwhile, isset to more than double in thecoming decade, from $US5.8trillion in 2008 to $US14.3trillion in 2019. Within the same timeframe, interest payments on that debt are forecast to leap from 8percent of federal revenues to 17percent.</p><p>These numbers are bad, but in the realm of political entities, the role of perception is just as crucial, if not more so. In imperial crises, it is not the material underpinnings of power that really matter but expectations about future power. The fiscal numbers cited above cannot erode US strength on their own, but they can work to weaken a long-assumed faith in the US's ability to weather any crisis. For now, the world still expects the US to muddle through, eventually confronting its problems when, as Churchill famously said, all the alternatives have been exhausted. Through this lens, past alarms about the deficit seem overblown, and 2080 - when the US debt may reach staggering proportions - seems a long way off, leaving plenty of time to plug the fiscal hole. But one day, a seemingly random piece of bad news - perhaps a negative report by a rating agency - will make the headlines during an otherwise quiet news cycle. Suddenly, it will be not just a few policy wonks who worry about the sustainability of US fiscal policy but also the public at large, not to mention investors abroad. It is this shift that is crucial: a complex adaptive system is in big trouble when its component parts lose faith in its viability.</p><p>Over the past three years, the complex system of the global economy flipped from boom to bust - all because a bunch of Americans started to default on their subprime mortgages, thereby blowing huge holes in the business models of thousands of highly leveraged financial institutions. The next phase of the current crisis may begin when the public begins to reassess the credibility of the monetary and fiscal measures that the Obama administration has taken in response. Neither interest rates at zero nor fiscal stimulus can achieve a sustainable recovery if people in the US and abroad collectively decide, overnight, that such measures will lead to much higher inflation rates or outright default.</p><p>As Thomas Sargent, an economist who pioneered the idea of rational expectations, demonstrated more than 20years ago, such decisions are self-fulfilling: it is not the base supply of money that determines inflation but the velocity of its circulation, which in turn is a function of expectations. In the same way, it is not the debt-to-GDP ratio that determines government solvency but the interest rate that investors demand. Bond yields can shoot up if expectations change about future government solvency, intensifying an already bad fiscal crisis by driving up the cost of interest payments on new debt. Just ask Greece. - it happened there at the end of last year, plunging the country into fiscal and political crisis.</p><p>Finally, a shift in expectations about monetary and fiscal policy could force a reassessment of future US foreign policy. There is a zero-sum game at the heart of the budgetary process: if interest payments consume a rising proportion of tax revenue, military expenditure is the item most likely to be cut because, unlike mandatory entitlements, it is discretionary.</p><p>A US president who says he will deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan and then, in 18 months' time, start withdrawing them again already has something of a credibility problem. And what about the US's other strategic challenges? For the US's enemies in Iran and Iraq, it must be consoling to know that US fiscal policy today is preprogramed to reduce the resources available for all overseas military operations in the years ahead.</p><p>Defeat in the mountains of the Hindu Kush or on the plains of Mesopotamia has long been a harbinger of imperial fall. It is no coincidence that the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in the annus mirabilis of 1989. What happened 20 years ago, like the events of the distant fifth century, is a reminder that empires do not in fact appear, rise, reign, decline and fall according to some recurrent and predictable life cycle. It is historians who retrospectively portray the process of imperial dissolution as slow-acting, with multiple overdetermining causes. Rather, empires behave like all complex adaptive systems. They function in apparent equilibrium for some unknowable period. And then, quite abruptly, they collapse. To return to the terminology of <person><nameText>Thomas Cole, </nameText></person>the painter of The Course of Empire the shift from consummation to destruction and then to desolation is not cyclical. It is sudden.</p><p>A more appropriate visual representation of the way complex systems collapse may be the old poster, once so popular in thousands of college dorm rooms, of a runaway steam train that has crashed through the wall of a Victorian railway terminus and hit the street below nose first. A defective brake or a sleeping driver can be all it takes to go over the edge of chaos.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a9 2002-2010 by the Council on Foreign Relations. <person><nameText>Thomas Cole </nameText></person>painting courtesy of the New-York Historical Society.</p><p>Distributed by Tribune Media Services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS and ONE ILLUSTRATION: Sabratha, former Roman city in North Africa.

The Anglican Church has been tearing itself apart over the issue, but now the conservatives are winning. By Barney Zwartz.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANGLICAN leader Rowan Williams labours hard for the King, but even he cannot put Humpty Dumpty back together again. His \"theological reflection\" this week proposing a two-tier worldwide church not only recognised but would finally cement the barrier dividing conservatives and liberals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual head of the world's 77 million Anglicans, is a gentle man, a fine scholar and a peacemaker, but bridging the gap between groups so heavily polarised is simply insuperable for anyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All sides agree it's about much more than homosexuality, the immediate battleground: it goes to the core of how churches should relate to their culture and each other. But the dissension is intensified because sexuality is such an emotive issue - for the progressives, it's a matter of justice and human rights; for the orthodox, it's about truth and fidelity.</p><p>The issue hit the headlines in 2002 when a Canadian bishop approved a blessing for same-sex unions, then again in early 2003 when a celibate gay was proposed as Bishop of Reading in England (he withdrew). But the sparks became a forest fire later that year when Gene Robinson, a man in an active gay relationship, became bishop of New Hampshire in America.</p><p>Williams was virtually forced to act this week to buy the worldwide church more time after last week's national convention of the Episcopalian Church of the United States of America (ECUSA) did not retreat enough to satisfy those who resented their appointment of a gay bishop in 2003. Just yesterday, Nigerian Anglican leader Peter Akinola provocatively appointed Canon Martyn Minns of Truro Church in Virginia as missionary bishop to Nigerian churches in the United States.</p><p>Williams sent his reflection, which has been widely admired as peaceable yet realistic, to the 38 Anglican primates (national leaders). He conceded that he could not fix the fractures over sexuality, recognised that the faultlines ran inside national churches as well as between them, and criticised the Americans for acting unilaterally.</p><p>He suggested a two-tier church, built around a \"covenant\" of shared beliefs that churches would have to choose to sign. Those churches that opted out could be associate members, in a reduced relationship and without a vote on the church's ruling councils. Clearly, conservatives would dominate.</p><p>According to Australian primate Phillip Aspinall, everything hinges on what kind of covenant. \"A legalistic document that is coercive is unlikely to win support, especially in Australia. Autonomous national churches will be reluctant to relinquish power. If one or two members of a family have caused distress to the rest of the family who see them as transgressing the norms and expectations of family life, a family will discuss what those norms and expectations are. A covenant of that sort, which makes explicit what has been tacit until now, has a chance of winning the hearts and minds of the communion.\"</p><p>To Australia's leading Anglican conservative, Sydney Archbishop Peter Jensen, it's a turning point. The reflection \"is a very helpful piece of work. It's cautious, but he's bound to be cautious. It contains hope, though I think it's a little romantic. It identifies where the problems are and, best of all, he brings us back to the Bible. The man who is charged with the responsibility of keeping us together and has exhorted us to stay together has recognised that it's nearly impossible.\"</p><p>How did matters get so far awry? As with any global political dispute, it's a mixture of principle, posturing and pragmatic politics on all sides, of complex motivations, divided loyalties and shifting agendas. For example, the Africans who have led the opposition to the American liberals have been influenced not only by theological conviction but also by cultural misunderstandings and colonial resentment. It's rather a thrill to tell the Americans where to get off.</p><p>How events unfold from here is hard to predict. But developments do highlight several important trends in the worldwide church - and not only the Anglicans. Most churches are wrestling with similar issues, and the Uniting Church of Australia faces a challenging national assembly dominated by a discussion of sexuality next week.</p><p>First, internationally, Williams' recognition highlights the shift in gravity from the Western church to the global south, especially Africa. In some ways, the most important Anglican today is Peter Akinola, whose flock numbers some 18 million. On any given Sunday, more Anglicans go to church in Nigeria than in Britain, the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia combined. The faith may be stagnating in Western churches, but it is flourishing in Africa, Asia and South America.</p><p>\"It's very clear that Western churches do not call all the shots,\" says Aspinall. \"The new balance has been emerging for some years.\"</p><p>Leading Anglican laywoman Dr Muriel Porter says Africans will increasingly dominate \"by sheer force of numbers and sheer force of willpower. More progressive forms of Anglicanism, by their very nature, are willing to tolerate more points of view, or don't crusade in so determined a fashion.\"</p><p>But conservative First World forces who have allied with the Africans, including the Sydney diocese, have brought considerable sophistication in dealing with the media, and lots of money, she says.</p><p>A second trend is the rising dominance of the conservative, evangelical wing of the church, whose numbers are growing while most liberal churches are in decline. Evangelicals say this is because they are faithful to the Christian message, including sexuality, rather than floating in the winds of culture.</p><p>Sydney lawyer Robert Tong, a member of the international commission dealing with disputes over homosexuality, says the conservatives are the faithful Anglicans. \"They have not moved from the Anglicanism they inherited, whether high church or low. It's the other folk who have innovated.\"</p><p>But Porter has a different account: to her, the bullies are winning. \"The sad thing is that more moderate people have not stood up to it. They've been respectful - or negligent. They haven't said 'we hear you but we actually have this point of view'. It's how to deal with schoolyard bullies 101: stand up to them. If you don't, you're looking at worse.\"</p><p>Third, the church boundaries will increasingly be determined less by geography than theology. Already, Anglicans are creating networks across geographical boundaries, such as the Nigerian church in the United States. Peter Jensen says that dual churches will emerge or churches within churches. For example, there may be two distinct Anglican churches in the United States, a big liberal one and a small conservative one. Otherwise, individual dioceses may opt out of ECUSA and be linked to other churches or directly to Rowan Williams. Three orthodox dioceses there have already sought his oversight.</p><p>Paradoxically, with that, the influence of the Archbishop of Canterbury will be reduced. Jensen says: \"His leadership cannot have the power it once did. It's not his fault.\" But his moral authority has been ebbing away. For example, he criticised the American church, but they have not accepted his criticisms, Jensen says. And as churches or dioceses opt out of his proposed covenant, his circle of influence will shrink.</p><p>A fourth point to emerge from the Anglican crisis is the difficulty of grappling with moral and theological questions from within very different cultural and social contexts. Cultural differences can be more influential than shared theology.</p><p>Dr Bruce Kaye, a historian and until recently Australia's top Anglican administrator, observes that American culture is distinctively built on inalienable rights. \"Everything they approach is based on that individualist attitude to society, culture and community groups. It shapes how moral questions are dealt with, in churches and even by the Boy Scouts. It's quite a significant issue.\"</p><p>Africa, in contrast, inherited the British model of legal structures, reinforced by tribal connections. \"It's a more communitarian outlook, but also more hierarchical. That's a big issue that will take more than our lifetimes to resolve,\" Kaye says.</p><p>Jensen agrees. \"The American church has been greatly impacted by the civil rights movement, for blacks, women and gays. Put that with the missionary culture, exporting freedom to the world. They feel they are out ahead of the game, their business is to show us how to treat people, and we'll fall into line in the next 20 years. That's very American, very cultural.\"</p><p>Fifth, it highlights the power of the internet. Muriel Porter says: \"It used to take longer for people to know what others were doing, there was time for debate, and not the same impetus for it to be an issue of who has power, which this is very much about.\"</p><p>With bloggers running daily accounts of last week's American convention, outsiders learnt not only the resolutions passed, as they always would have, but the discussions that led to them. It opened up their inner workings.</p><p>Sixth, notwithstanding some of the gloom above, another factor that leaps out is the resilience of the church. For ordinary Anglicans in the pews - in Melbourne, San Francisco or Lagos - not much will change, at least, not soon. As Peter Jensen says, Anglicans will become a loose federation - like the British Commonwealth, rather than the British empire - but they will recognisably remain Anglicans.</p><p>Aspinall says Australia is not standing on the edge of this precipice, even though the alignments found internationally are also found here. And internationally, too, he believes the church is heading in a positive direction.</p><p>One thing Williams may have achieved, and his primary ambition, is to buy enough time for the Anglican Church to reach its next Lambeth Conference, the 10-yearly conference of the world's bishops, in one piece.</p><p>Mind you, according to Robert Tong, funding for Lambeth is something no one talks about, but last time is was largely American-subsidised. \"If they are made division 2 they may not be so generous.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>THREE PHOTOS: Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams delivers a sermon in St Patrick's Church of Ireland, Armagh, above.

It is early July, and three friends and I are determined to see the Statue of Liberty by sea. Not by ferry, though. We want to paddle there, and we've found a pocket-sized outfit, Manhattan Kayak Company, willing to guide us to Liberty Island from Pier 63 on New York's West Side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">None of us knows a spray skirt from a rudder (only my wife's brother, Bill, has kayaked before) but we're happy about our adventure and feel confident as we make the rounds to buy disposable cameras and boxes of energy bars.</p><p>Paddling day dawns with an eerie smog that is like nothing I remember from growing up here. The newspaper blames forest fires in Quebec and at the top of the front page there's a warning from the New York City Department of Health to ``refrain from strenuous outdoor activities''. As it turns out, we've got more pressing worries. We find out that, due to the ever-present threat of terrorism, there is a 138m exclusion zone around Ellis and Liberty islands. Manhattan Kayak founder Eric Stiller tells me that when kayakers accidentally got too close a few days ago, army Black Hawk helicopters buzzed in out of nowhere and circled the little craft until they paddled off.</p><p>``They'll be watching us today,'' warns Stiller as we get fitted for life jackets at the pier and check out the Necky Amaruk two-man sea kayaks. I knock on the flank of the baby blue one that Bill and I will be piloting: it is solid plastic.</p><p>Stiller and his colleague Ray Fusco roll out an oversized map of New York City's rivers, bays, inlets and islands. To get to the Statue of Liberty we will have to pull off a 10 nautical-mile round trip while wrestling with two and three-knot currents. ``The Indians called it Great Waters Constantly Moving,'' Stiller says. ``Twice a day the Atlantic shoves saltwater almost 100 miles [161km] up the Hudson.''</p><p>What really worries me is Stiller's passing remark that he used this harbour trip to train for his recent kayak circumnavigation of Australia. Then it's time to load up the boats.</p><p>Pushing off from the dock, our Amaruk moves slowly at first, like a clownishly scaled-down version of the ocean-going ships that used to sail from here. When Bill barks at me from his seat directly behind, I realise our slow progress is because I'm drenching him with river water instead of digging in with my blades as I dip down and backward.</p><p>I can see this is not the Hudson I knew as a kid: that swirling mass of yellow bubbles, empty boxes of Cracker Jacks, and bobbing bottles and cans. I don't see any fish, but, according to Stiller, shad and striped bass started coming back after the Federal Clean Water Act of 1976, and someone he knows is trying to grow oysters by hanging a net off one of the Manhattan piers.</p><p>As we bounce around, trying to get used to the chop, I am staring into the haze to see if I can get a look at the Statue of Liberty. ``There she is,'' shouts Fusco, who is leading the flotilla. When I follow his finger, I can just make out a sculptural smudge in the direction of JerseyCity.</p><p>Fusco herds us expertly, like seagoing broncos, and we buck and wobble south past Manhattan's Chelsea Pier, with its gigantic golf range aimed out over the river, and powerful fireboats such as the John McKean which, we are told, pitched in with plumes of well-aimed water on September 11, 2001. We paddle past abandoned Pier 54 where the Titanic would have docked if it had made it and where you can still make out the sign, Cunard White Star Lines. Five avenues east into Manhattan, I find the turreted brick building where I grew up. Once, when I left the city aboard a ship, my mum waved goodbye by flapping a red-white-and-blue sweater from up there.</p><p>Fusco is yelling orders all of a sudden and we turn to see a Circle Line ferry bearing down hard to starboard. We've got the right of way, but sometimes boats can't see kayaks and we paddle furiously towards shore. We get the wake full blast and I shake water off my sunglasses and out of my ears.</p><p>We are at the place where we will have to power across the busy Hudson to New Jersey, and I am impressed to find Bill is ready. ``Fifteen strips of bacon,'' he keeps saying, referring, I guess, to breakfast, and the bacon must be working since we are moving fast. Fusco instructs us to aim for Jersey's Lackawanna Ferry Terminal, but we can barely see it and we are keenly concerned about other boats. Fighting the current, our kayaks snake between garbage barges, tugboats, sailboats, cigarette boats, another Circle Line ferry and, looming out of the smog, a ghost-pale cruise ship, the Nordic Empress.</p><p>Making it to the Jersey side of the river gives us a sense of accomplishment and, since we're out of the two-lane nautical highway, we take a break. Here in Hoboken and Jersey City the only landmark is the Ferris wheel-sized Colgate-Palmolive clock. Our cameras come out for snapshots of the Manhattan skyline.</p><p>Fusco is worried the Hudson's mighty tides may turn against us if we don't push on. That would mean not making it to the Statue of Liberty, so we stash our snacks and grab our paddles again, working closer to what I think is Ellis Island with a Victorian-looking brick building and tree-dotted grounds. Then I realise I have been admiring an abandoned train station at the end of a spit of land.</p><p>We do reach Ellis Island, but I'm distracted by blobs of sunscreen that are melting off my forehead and blurring my eyes. And here are the restricted area buoys we were promised, keeping us back, with an insignia that reminds me of the 1960s civil defence signs that used to point out bomb shelters in Cold War New York.</p><p>We are coming close. I am eager and my strokes are getting splashier and even less efficient as my forearms tire. I can hear Bill grunting, paddling harder to make up for this, and then, out of the blue, our kayaks pull upshort.</p><p>There is the pointed crown, suddenly clear of smog, and Liberty's torch reaching and stretching higher than I could remember. The sea-green statue is glowing in the sun, staring down and beyond our knot of boats, clutching its tablet, thinking quiet copper thoughts.</p><p>We say nothing. This is not the Liberty we know from ferries and from spiralling up the staircase inside. It is as if we've discovered her ourselves, finding an artistic shape in some wild and remarkable place.</p><p>It is time for congratulations. We try to arrange the kayaks to allow everyone to shake hands. I chug a ginger ale I've been saving in my spray skirt, and one of the guides, Theresa, yanks out her bilge pump and fires off a couple of festive rounds. For a second, with these salvos of water, it feels like a holiday.</p><p>To Page 2</p><p>From Page 1</p><p>The flame of Liberty's torch is gold leaf and as we paddle around to the south, then the west side of the island, it is a bright and perfect focus of our arc. At one point Bill and I are between buoys and forget about the restricted zone until Fusco yells. We have not gone far into it, but Fusco is frantically pointing at the coast guard cutter Bainbridge Island, which is anchored nearby.</p><p>We hear Fusco's command to paddle back hard and, as we struggle and tug our blades, we can just make out white-uniformed officers and a mounted machinegun on the cutter deck. A US Park Police boat comes screaming out of the haze on our port side and for a second we are sure it's coming for us.</p><p>But the target is a motorboat that has whizzed way past the buoys and gone all the way in. The US Park Police take only seconds to get to it and as we paddle away we keep turning back to see what the cops will do. ``Yep, they're being arrested,'' reports Fusco, who has sharp eyes. ``Now they're towing the boat.''</p><p>Bill and I paddle harder and harder, churning north, leaving the statue and the buoys behind. A breeze kicks up to escort us up past Ellis and along the Jersey coast and, like a wand, it changes the Hudson into fat and lazy swells. The skyline is clear now, catching the first red edge of evening and spreading it out from sharp piers to ships along the shore. Finally, as we move across the Hudson, it tints our tiny kayaks in alien colours.</p><p>We have made it to Liberty, in the teeth of barges and cruise ships, despite coast guard cutters and police boats and forest fire air. And as I search for a certain turreted building five avenues deep within the city, I am aware of one thing: that if mum were still alive, she would be watching from her terrace, scanning the river to pick out our plastic flecks of blue and orange and green. She would be watching us float slowly home along the coast of Manhattan and slip into our pier.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>&amp;t;&amp;t; Peter Mandel is an author of children's books, including Boats on the River and My Ocean Liner.

There is parking (that you must pay for) in a lot near the pier, or go by taxi, subway or bus. Instruction and rentals are available year-round but there is more to choose from in spring, autumn and (especially) summer. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.manhattankayak.com\">www.manhattankayak.com</url>.</p><p>New York Kayak Company operates from Pier 40 farther downtown on the West Side. Although it primarily sells kayaks, basic tours are offered. More: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nykayak.com\">www.nykayak.com</url>.</p><p>Also on the menu: Manhattan Kayak Company runs adventures such as the so-called Sushi Paddle across the Hudson to Edgewater, New Jersey, where kayakers dock and fuel up with maki rolls at a waterfront Japanese restaurant.</p><p>There's also a gruelling all-day Manhattan Circumnavigation which, as the name suggests, lets kayakers do battle not only with Hudson River and harbour currents but with those in the East and Harlem rivers. Other tours include paddles to the George Washington Bridge, Governors Island, Coney Island and the Tappan Zee Bridge.</p><p>Dressing up: In summer or early autumn, most New York-area paddlers are warm enough wearing shorts, T-shirt and rubber-soled or running shoes, but prepare to get sprayed and, quite possibly, soaked through. A windbreaker is a good idea if it's breezy or in case of rain. If you're kayaking in spring or late autumn, add layers and, in winter, thicker layering: wetsuit, wool or fleece hat, neoprene socks and gloves, and wetsuit booties.</p><p>In all seasons, it's best to avoid cotton since it doesn't provide much warmth when wet. Kayak firms rent wetsuit and paddling top for $US10 ($13.70) an outing.</p><p>Stow away: Take dry clothes to change into after your paddle; for the trip, you'll need a bottle of water, sunscreen and a snack. There's a handy little pouch in the top of most sea-kayaking spray skirts to zip these items in, along with, say, a waterproof disposable camera or small, inexpensive pair of binoculars. One well-prepared kayaker I know always carries a compass and a paddler's version of a pedometer, which lets him know exactly how far he's gone.</p><p>Peter Mandel</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS200905165001758201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VP9-T490-YBDY-R0WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Weekend Australian</publicationName><edition>5 - NSW Travel Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 16, 2009 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DKM5</classCode><className>CANOEING &amp; KAYAKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000814</classCode><className>BOATING &amp; RAFTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WT4</classCode><className>SAILING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DREB</classCode><className>PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX002018</classCode><className>TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0AY</classCode><className>MARINE VESSELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000DOOG</classCode><className>CAMERAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A snuff movie?</p><p> Eight days ago, the prospect of a serious fight cannot have figured anywhere in their expectations.</p><p> Seldon, whose brief tenancy of the WBA title was due largely to King's manipulative influence on the sanctioning bodies of the world's worst regulated sport, was blatantly incapable of delivering that.</p><p> His antics in Las Vegas suggested he would have struggled to beat the first man he met at a bus stop. He started by going down from a punch that did not connect and then responded to a respectable left hook with a thespian simulation of delayed disintegration.</p><p> It was behaviour that declared a simple truth about the current attitudes of heavyweight contenders. Where once a challenge for the championship was an opportunity, now it is an end in itself.</p><p>Getting into the ring with Tyson and then getting out of it quickly (and in good health) has become the limit of ambition for countless large men in dubious possession of a boxer's licence. And given the determination of the Tyson-King alliance to reap maximum rewards for minimum risk, the halt, the weak and the helpless are assured of a warm welcome to the abattoir.</p><p> Seldon made sure he took his $5m bloodlessly.</p><p> These days the majority of heavyweight aspirants, while maintaining the traditional familiarity with most of the seven deadly sins, are conspicuously short of wrath.</p><p> Tyson himself exhibits plenty of anger. But there are signs that the element of it traceable to his resentment of what he sees as American society's maltreatment of him, and above all his imprisonment for rape, is being expressed through his contemptuous accumulation of wealth from ridiculous mismatches.</p><p> \"Up yours,\" is what Mike seems to be saying to all the people who are clamouring for him to prove himself in real fights, one perceptive student of Tyson's conduct told me from California last week.</p><p> \"All the stuff he used to give us about wanting to beat the best out there and establish himself as a true great in the history of boxing has been put on hold while he has averaged something like $20m-$25m a shot for knocking aside four stiffs.</p><p>It is easy to believe there is some gloating in the exercise.\"</p><p> One certainty is that the present script owes as much to Tyson's inclinations as to the virtuoso deviousness of King.</p><p> The popular misconception that King is the ringmaster and Tyson little more than a brutal strongman performing to order can be dismissed by those of us who have monitored the latest phase of their relationship at first hand.</p><p> \"Shut up, Don,\" the fighter said on one occasion in Philadelphia, instantly damming a verbal Niagara and taking over the microphone.</p><p> He has the unmistakable demeanour of the man in charge and the selection of Holyfield as his next opponent proves that he has no objection to grave-robbing when the price is right. The WBC is moving to strip Tyson of the title he won from Bruno, which will leave him with just the WBA belt, but he is the dictator of the division and preservation of that status is made easier by two crucial factors.</p><p> One is the extent to which his prison sentence reversed the decline as a fighter that was threatening his career before his conviction. In addition to imposing a rejuvenating physical discipline, the jail experience may have recharged the rage that was fundamental to the violent supremacy of his youth.</p><p> Perhaps he will never again be quite as devastating as he was then, but that is where the second helpful factor comes in.</p><p> Tyson may not find it necessary to recapture all of the old ferocity, since he has returned to a heavyweight era populated almost exclusively by men lacking either the talent or the will (in some cases both) to alarm him. Examine the list of those who are set to scramble through eliminators for the right to earn off his drawing power: Michael Moorer, Frans Botha, Lennox Lewis, Oliver McCall, Riddick Bowe and Andrew Golota.</p><p> Astonishingly, the only one with impressive recent form is Golota.</p><p>But most Americans refuse to believe that a true heavyweight champion can come out of Poland.</p><p> Is there no hope, then, of a prolonged and dramatic conflict?</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p> There are powerful rumours in the US that, at the conclusion of his six-fight deal with the MGM Grand, Tyson will seek to break with King.</p><p> In the past such stories have always turned out to be groundless but this time it is said he has hired Johnnie Cochrane, the black lawyer who became notorious as the low-blow specialist of the O. J. Simpson trial, to check his contract with the promoter for loopholes.</p><p> Cochrane versus King. That could be worth the pay-per-view fee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9609161029054424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:457Y-DSW0-0197-528P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>September 16, 1996, Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MGM GRAND HOTEL LLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GHG (ASX)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS722110 FULL-SERVICE RESTAURANTS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0NAICS721120 CASINO HOTELS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0SIC7011 HOTELS &amp; MOTELS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001502</classCode><className>ROBBERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813990GM</classCode><className>SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00098QN</classCode><className>SPORTS REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000227</classCode><className>BURGLARY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A4JU</classCode><className>CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001303</classCode><className>PAY PER VIEW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX468</classCode><className>LAS VEGAS, NV, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Not all gardens have space where annuals can be planted to achieve the maximum effect. However, they can be presented in containers such as hanging baskets, small tubs, window boxes and ground-level planters, provided the growing mix is first-class. It only takes a few annuals to provide a dazzling display. The depth of soil need be only 25cm as the roots of annuals seldom extend further. The soil should be well enriched with decomposed organic matter to help conserve moisture evenly, as annuals are intolerant of a wet then dry situation. Commercial soil mixes are useful as a base material, to which additional compost or peat moss can be added. Blood and bone-based fertilizers are excellent, although slow-release granules also can be used to maintain the level of available nutrients. Liquid formulas are useful as a supplement as annuals reach the last stages of growth before flowering. The containers for growing annuals need to be sited in good light for most of the day. However, there are a number of varieties which will grow sheltered. These include Impatiens, Browallia speciosa major, and bedding begonias. All three are short-lived perennials used for seasonal displays. Annual plants which can be placed in containers at this time of year include any of the following: Ageratum _ seedlings only, best suited to window boxes; Begonia semperflorens _ ideal for shallow containers in a semi-shaded situation, also useful for small hanging baskets; Browallia speciosa major _ ideal for sun or semi-shade, looking much like a blue petunia but more dainty; Celosia plumosa _ for window boxes use the dwarf to semi-dwarf range, for tubs try the tall strains such as pampas plume mixed or forest fire and golden triumph; Cleome _ a little known plant, it is ideal for large tub presentation, thrives in hot weather and can reach 1m; Cockscomb _ a stiff plant best suited to window boxes; Impatiens _ can make a wonderful splash of color, small varieties suit hanging baskets or shallow troughs in semi-shaded situations while tall forms suit tubs; Marigolds _ both African and French are hardy plants for warm high light situations, with the French varieties being most suited to hanging baskets; Nasturtiums _ dwarf forms can look very attractive in either baskets or window boxes, high light and a lower than average soil nutrient level is recommended otherwise plants will make foliage to the exclusion of flowers; Petunias _ recognised for the brilliance of their display over a long period, but do not make the mistake of planting them too close as one petunia of the dwarf or compact varieties can spread further than most other annuals.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>In a 30-40cm diameter basket one petunia would be adequate, in troughs or window boxes space at 40cm; Phlox _ another spreading plant but it grows much lower than petunias, two or three plants would be sufficient in a basket with spacings in a trough of 30cm; Salvia farinacea; Blue bedder, Salvia splendens _ varieties such as the tall bonfire and the mid-size red rocket are excellent in tubs, the smaller St Johns fire and scarlet pygmy are ideal for troughs; Zinnia _ suited to open, sunny sites with the persian carpet variety and Z. linearis being the best for baskets. ] ] ] YOUNG plants in containers will quickly bush up if finger pruned early. The tips are pinched out to encourage lateral branching and sturdier plants. It is possible to have up to three distinct flower displays each year by using annuals in containers. Containers also allow the gardener to experiment and appreciate a wide range of plants at little expense, as few plants are needed to create an impact. ] ] ] GREVILLEAS are among the most popular Australian native plants, each year seeing new hybrids for sale. Recently Queensland nurserymen had two new varieties, both outstanding in their class, on display at a trade fair. A tall growing variety, Majestic, with rich burgundy red flowers, is going to please gardeners and birds alike as it is a prolific bloomer. A hybrid between the red form of Grevillea banksii and the cultivar misty pink, it grows to about 5m. However, with pruning in early growth it could be trained to stay smaller. Both parents adapt to a wide range of soil types, therefore this variety should prove reasonably easy to grow. A dwarf compact cultivar, rhondeau, will appeal to gardeners looking for a plant for a well-drained open situation. They are a light rosy red. Many dwarf forms of grevillea have a limited life along the coastal fringe. A clipping after the main flush of bloom will keep the bush shapely and help prolong the life span. Grevilleas have a low nutrient requirement and are intolerant of phosphorous, except in small amounts. The best means of establishing plants is to see that the soil is well drained, with nutrients coming from compost or some blood and bone. Sulphate of ammonia can be applied around established plants for supplementary feeding. Wherever grevilleas are grown care must be taken not to unduly disturb the root system. ] ] ] SOMETIME during the next few weeks well-established hibiscus plants can be pruned. The operation is simple and is undertaken mainly to keep the bushes shapely and induce vigorous lateral growths, upon which the new blooms will develop. Shortening back the bush overall by one third, then eliminating all weak growth, is a sound practice. It also pays to remove any branches which may be growing close to the ground. August-September pruning is followed by a tip pruning in mid-February. About one month after pruning, apply a liberal amount of complete fertilizer to the surrounding soil. ] ] ] EARLY in the life of a young garden, it may become apparent the shrubberies have been overplanted. Should this be so, surplus plants can be lifted readily and transplanted. Overplanting is the most common mistake. From mid-August to the end of October is ideal for lifting shrubs. A light pruning prevents wilting due to the shock from severed roots.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML8608092016P202951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49K0-22J0-01S8-G0TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1025\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>COURIER-MAIL</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1986 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"1986\"><dateText>August 9, 1986 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FAV</classCode><className>FERTILIZERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Yet, for the majority, February 7 was just another hot and windy total fire ban day. What they needed to understand was just how extreme the danger was.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agencies calculate a fire danger index (FDI) that incorporates not only temperature and wind speed but humidity and a measure of how dry the forest or grasslands are. Over summer, the forest FDI generally ranges from about 10 to 80. If it gets above 50 the consensus is that, due to fire spotting behaviour, it is nearly impossible to fight a running forest fire front.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On February 7 the FDI was well over 200. No matter how many fire bombers or tankers were on hand, if a fire got into the forests it would run until the fuel ran out or the weather changed. If the weather forecast had included a fire danger index that was understood to be four times that of a controllable event, the community might well have acted differently.</p><p>This would be a simple and cheap recommendation the royal commission can make and something we can all learn to appreciate before it happens again.</p><p>Rowan Reid, forest scientist, University of Melbourne</p><p>Lives too valuable to lose</p><p>I WOULD never allow my family to stay and fight again. My husband and three sons saved our house and sheds. Everything else was destroyed. I left just before to take my daughter and dogs to safety and then proceeded to return to help. I felt that if four members of my family died in this fire, I would want to die with them.</p><p>On my way back my phone rang. My youngest son tried to tell me the fire had hit but the reception was so bad I could not understand him. He realised this and jumped in his car and drove through three to four-metre-high flames for 150 metres to stop me. The temperature gauge in his car went as high as it could. He got to me as I was about to turn into our road and saved my life.</p><p>My husband and two of my sons stayed, fought and saved our home. In doing so they thought they were going to die. There was a period of 40 minutes that I thought they were dead, a feeling I never want to live through again.</p><p>We are all going to need emotional support to eventually heal. Life will go on, but it is too valuable. My advice in future is go early while it is safe.</p><p>Sharyn Canobie, Drouin West</p><p>Safety in truth-telling</p><p>ROYAL commissions on fires and their effects can make massive improvements to safety. There is a real need for the media, politicians and the community to recognise the need to identify mistakes and fire-fighting methods that don't work without the need for unnecessary blame.</p><p>Groups such as the CFA, police and others will need to be highly critical of their response to the fires to ensure they are well prepared for the inevitable future fires of the same ilk. They may feel the need to hide problems if the community starts a witch-hunt over the issue. The bipartisan response in Victoria shows the way forward for us all. Let's identify what went wrong, and prepare a better defence against such fires in the future.</p><p>Peter Baxter, Ararat</p><p>Racism the problem, not Indian students</p><p>INSPECTOR Scott Mahony says it's crucial for Indian students to overcome their distrust of police and to \"not openly display signs of wealth with iPods and phones\", nor talk \"loudly in their native language\" (The Age, 19/2). This blame-the-victim response will further decrease the trust of Indian students in the police.</p><p>His statement is equivalent to telling women not to wear mini-skirts to avoid being raped or Muslim women to take off their hijab to avoid being called terrorists. The crime is people's violent and racist reaction to difference, not the difference itself. Next police will be advising Indian students to go back to India to avoid racism here.</p><p>While it is shocking that police treat the victims of racially motivated crimes in this way, of greater concern in terms of changing this practice is that in 2009 police openly admit to it without a clue of the racism that underlies their approach.</p><p>Tamar Hopkins, Brunswick</p><p>Shame, my country</p><p>I WAS saddened and ashamed to read of criminals targeting Indians in Australia. This is just the latest in the post-White Australia policy cycle of xenophobia that began with the vilification of Indo-Chinese asylum seekers in 1975.</p><p>During the 1980s, my family and I lived for seven years in India, where we travelled extensively, occasionally to areas where the people had rarely if ever seen Westerners.</p><p>Our kids roamed the town on their bikes, and rode Indian trains and buses by themselves. We often experienced frustration and irritation, but never, despite the fact we stuck out and were better off than most of the Indians we met, did we ever encounter prejudice, hatred or threat of violence.</p><p>On the contrary, we remember regular instances of friendliness and assistance.</p><p>Of course, countless appalling things go on in India, including attacks on foreigners. However, India's best, which we were fortunate enough to experience, is something Australia should work to emulate.</p><p>Bill James, Bayswater</p><p>Blaming the victim</p><p>RE \"INDIANS told to keep low profile\". Wow, so instead of increasing policing in the affected areas to keep the crime rate low, Indians should just be quieter. Why did I not think of that before?</p><p>Ammu Ruby, Wheelers Hill</p><p>Kosky must go</p><p>YOU have to feel for John Brumby at times like this. As Premier at a time of a horrendous disaster, he is doing as much as he can to deal with all of the issues that have arisen. What he does not need is for one of his ministers to again publicly demonstrate that she should not be left in charge of the transport portfolio.</p><p>Lynne Kosky's close ties to the union that was mainly responsible for the disgraceful nine-hour closure of the Sandringham rail line on Wednesday (The Age, 19/2), and her failure to act quickly to use her influence to fix the matter, shows she should be sacked immediately. The Premier must put the interests of the public ahead of internal Labor Party factional dealings.</p><p>Robert Cooper, Mount Eliza</p><p>Right on the money</p><p>THE comments by Professor Mick Dodson (Comment &amp; Debate, 19/2) should be read and endorsed by every Australian. The first building block for indigenous Australians is education. Let's not stint with the dollars, because every dollar spent thereafter will be far better spent than now and in the past.</p><p>Lionel Parrott, Croydon</p><p>Some revolution</p><p>THE Federal Government removes $2.5 billion from future education spending (The Age, 18/2) so we can buy consumer goods, just as unemployment turns people to further education as a way out. Not the education revolution we expected!</p><p>Julia Thornton, Surrey Hills</p><p>Bump or thump?</p><p>THE gabardine overcoat brigade are beating their chests over the Nick Maxwell case, claiming that the bump has been outlawed and that football has been turned into a non-contact sport (Sport, Letters, 19/2). What a steaming pile of ordure. Maxwell was not suspended because he executed a fair bump. He was suspended because he executed a bump to the head.</p><p>It is against the laws of football to make contact with the head of an opponent. When the contact to the head is made with considerable force and vigour, it is not only illegal but highly dangerous - witness the broken jaw in this case.</p><p>If you believe that charging into the head of an opponent who is trying to win the ball, while making no effort to win the ball yourself, is an act that exemplifies toughness, then your definition of toughness needs a lot of work.</p><p>Scott McIntyre, St Kilda</p><p>Taken for granted</p><p>THE farce of the Edgars Creek parkland in Coburg is symbolic of the disregard elected representatives have for constituents of super-safe ALP state and federal seats. The argument for the public ownership of the parkland is overwhelming but will not be advanced one iota by a letter from Kelvin Thomson, who is hardly acknowledged byhis own party, given the safety of his political position in Wills.</p><p>Electors in safe ALP seats never get a fair slice of government support from either party. The Liberals know they can never win the seat and the ALP knows it will always win. If Edgars parkland was in a swinging electorate, it would be acquired, beautified and handed over at a gala event presided over by the PM.</p><p>Peter Robertson, Coburg</p><p>Wishes to fishes</p><p>THE letter by Janine Bjorkman (19/2) stirred a memory. As a young fisherman off the west coast of Scotland one winter's day, I said something to the effect that I wished it wasn't so cold. The old skipper rolled his eyes and replied: \"Aye, Stuart! And if wishes were fishes, we'd all be rich!\"</p><p>At one time we had many of the communities that Bjorkman wishes for, and I am fortunate enough to still live in one. We have a wonderful health system in place, and although we have a few characters around, not too many suffer from mental disorders.</p><p>My comfortable cottage is a mere eight or nine squares in size and my car is hardly in the luxury class. But the community spirit is strong and supportive. This is where we translate wishes into fishes.</p><p>W.

Yet somehow you take the intellectual high ground and hope to enlighten others if they cannot \"be intelligent enough to work it out\". Are you sure you don't work for the church? You seem to share such similar condescending, arrogant and closed-minded arguments.</p><p>David Hegan, Kensington</p><p>Say 'no' on troops</p><p>AUSTRALIAN troops are in Afghanistan simply because of John Howard cosying up to George Bush. Since these two men are no more (politically speaking) and because we are not even a member of NATO, Australia can safely say \"no additional troops for Afghanistan\".</p><p>Jim Banks, Yarrawonga</p><p>Threatened species?</p><p>DR GREG Moore is so right when he states just how important trees are in our gardens and the danger all trees are in due to the drought (The Age, 19/2). The drought is not the only cause of the lack of trees. The area I live in was once full of lovely trees and gardens but now is being taken over by huge houses and hideous extensions to existing homes that take up the whole block. No room for trees or shrubs, just plenty of concrete.</p><p>No wonder they all need noisy air-conditioners running day and night.</p><p>Linda Jarvis, North Balwyn</p><p>Forecasting fantasy</p><p>I WOULD humbly and respectfully like to suggest that the most profoundly useless and fundamentally misleading piece of information printed on your website daily would have to be the 28-day rainfall outlook for Melbourne (theage.com.au).</p><p>We all know that the Bureau of Meteorology struggles to get precipitation predictions even 24 hours out correct, so why persist with these preposterous 28-day fantasy forecasts? Much better that I receive a text message from the bureau when they can actually see the rain falling from their office windows.</p><p>David Coorey, Brunswick</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CARTOON BY LEUNIG</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5o0rz5wzw5wq29q7jik</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7V25-YMF1-2RR2-D27V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 20, 2009 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CA0Z</classCode><className>THERMAL SENSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A team of international scientists has dared to put a $US33 trillion a year price tag on the critical life support systems that provide us with air to breathe, clean our water, break down waste and maintain the fertility of the soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They started a forest fire of debate that is still burning with great intensity. Detractors described it as bad economics and bad ecological science.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mostly the critics were fearful of the effect that a figure nearly twice the size of the world's GDP would have on the provision of goods and services should they ever be required to take the cost of these ecosystem \"services\" into account.</p><p>The scientists, mostly American university academics, published their findings in the magazine Nature in 1997 because they thought it would be useful to ecologists, economists, policy makers and the general public. They said ecological systems contributed to human welfare, directly and indirectly, and therefore represented part of the total economic value of the planet.</p><p>So what is nature worth in Australia, where salinity threatens vast tracts of agricultural land and passions raised by logging native forests obscure the economics of the debate?</p><p>Don Henry, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, has complained about the low priority assigned to the other values and services that forests provide, such as biodiversity habitat, water quantity and quality, and employment in tourism and recreation industries.</p><p>Mr Henry raised the issue last year in a foreword to an ACF-commissioned report on the application of national competition policy to forestry. The report found that the playing field was tilted against plantations and farm forestry in favour of the exploitation of state-owned native forests.</p><p>He said other values had been under-stated relative to timber. And, although water, telecommunications, electricity and gas had to stand on their own, forest departments remained insulated and protected from competition.</p><p>Work on the economics of nature seems to be in its infancy. Comparative studies have been able to pinpoint instances in which the water from forests left standing might have a greater value than the timber felled. However, the abandonment of the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse emissions has retarded efforts to put a dollar value on carbon sinks vital to the development of market-based carbon trading systems.</p><p>Dr John Wamsley, managing director of the eco-company Earth Sanctuaries, proved a point by using the international accounting standard AASB 1037 on self-generating and regenerating assets to value his wildlife. It let him book an operating profit of $2 million in 2000, but later the debt-laden company had to sell some properties and change its structure.</p><p>Bureau of Tourism Resource surveys of visitors as they leave Australia show that over 50 per cent visit a national park, but it has been left to researchers like John Ward, a lecturer in eco-tourism at Griffith University to flesh out the details. He has surveyed people in forest car parks to establish comparative values of logging and tourism.</p><p>The CSIRO division of wildlife and ecology is midway through the most ambitious research of all, a $1 million project funded by the Myer Foundation that seeks to put a dollar value on Australia's ecosystem services.</p><p>The project co-ordinator, Dr Steven Cork, says that in economic analyses, close to zero value has been put on filtering, purifying, stabilising and revitalising processes that would be hugely expensive to replace with technology even if such capacity</p><p>existed.</p><p>Conservation seems not to pay when compared with the economic return that society gets from converting natural assets into commercial ones. People believe they would be better off by giving up natural assets for pastures, roads and other developments.</p><p>Professor Pearce, in a Naturearticle, says this is an illusion that stems from the fact that services provided by ecological systems are not usually traded.</p><p>\"Because we do not buy and sell clean air, tranquillity, watershed protection, nutrient cycling or carbon storage, the value of such services is naturally perceived to be zero (or nearly so) and conservation loses. Governments everywhere make the odds against conservation even worse by subsidising irrigation water, energy, fertiliser, pesticides, agricultural output, fishing and transport. Few subsidise conservation on any significant scale.\"</p><p>The most obvious and most contentious environmental economic arguments in Australia centre on the forests, from which more than 23 billion cubic metres of timber is cut each year from 164.4 million hectares of native forest and woodland, and 1.5 million hectares of plantation.</p><p>According to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, Australia's forest production is valued at almost $14 billion a year and provides about $2.27 billion in wages for nearly 9000 workers.</p><p>However, Australia's consumption runs well ahead of production, and the nation remains a net importer of timber products to the value of almost $2 billion a year.</p><p>Victoria's contribution is about one-third - 794 million cubic metres of timber from 7.7 million hectares of native forest and woodland, and about 320,000 hectares of plantation.</p><p>The State Government says the native-forest industry is worth $540 million a year and creates direct employment for 4000 people. Indirectly it creates another 6000 jobs, mainly in regional industries that in 1999 contributed $1.8 billion to the state's total output of $151 billion.</p><p>The native-forest industry is contentious because the most desirable trees for timber cutters - particularly for furniture but also flooring and some house framing - are also the most aesthetically desirable and environmentally sensitive. Virtually all of Victoria's sawn hardwood is grown on public land, an important element for the tourism industry.</p><p>The 2001 National Forest inventory shows that Australia has 42.5 million hectares of open forest, of which 5.4 million hectares are in Victoria. Only 5.13 million hectares of closed forest remain, of which 3 million hectares are in Queensland and only 19,000 hectares, the smallest figure for any state, are in Victoria.</p><p>Under its new forestry policy the Victorian government has reduced the area of public land it considers suitable for timber harvesting from 1.2 million hectares to 700,000 hectares and, having established the biologically sustainable yield at 567,500</p><p>cubic metres a year, it is trying to cut logging licence levels by 30 per cent.</p><p>Among a range of industry reforms it has set up a new commercial forest service entity, VicForests, to achieve an ecologically sustainable management regime.</p><p>The state has committed up to $80 million to its reforms which Judy Clark, a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at the Australian National University, describes as unusual. She says the timber industry has been undergoing a big structural change prompted by the development of private plantations. She says the government is compensating an industry as it enhances its competitiveness.</p><p>The Bracks Government is trying to walk a fine line between the timber industry workforce in the electorally sensitive regions and media-savvy environmentalists.</p><p>During a recent clash over clear-fell logging, the Otway Ranges Environment Network made the most of the alternative economics argument, using research on the West Barwon and Gellibrand water catchments serving Geelong and Warrnambool respectively. The global engineering consultancy Sinclair Knight Merz predicted improvements of 10.5 per cent and 28 per cent in long-term water flow if the forests were left standing.</p><p>It found that royalties from logging in the West Barwon catchment at present value would yield $2.1 million between 2000 and 2100. The additional water from the uncut forest, at $800 a megalitre, would yield $11.8 million. Value-added, the timber would be worth $9.2 million, but the Otway group argued that in a catchment, where water is already scarce, additional supplies to water-reliant industries would have an equal, or even greater, multiplier effect.</p><p>Before John Ward became a lecturer in eco-tourism at Griffith University he ran his own timber business, and he claims to know forest economics from both sides. He has surveyed 4000 motorists in the car parks of NSW state parks and national forests to find out how much people are ready to spend travelling to a forest for a fishing trip or a walk in the woods.</p><p>He says his surveying will show that the value of recreation is statistically and significantly greater than logging in five sites while in six other sites it is difficult to discern the difference.</p><p>Meanwhile, an analysis of global timber needs by Judy Clark at CRES in Canberra suggests that the real price for wood is likely to fall.</p><p>She believes this will discourage plantation investment on agricultural land, intensify forest management and increase the clearing of native forest for plantation.</p><p>She fears biodiversity will be the loser.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Water can be worth more than timber.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P0N-6D00-TXN5-S2JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yidowvee20e59f651i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2002</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2002 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>April 27, 2002 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>AUSTRALIAN CONSERVATION FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Nature/Environment/Conservation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places Locations/Water</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places Locations/Forests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Price</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Research</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp;

Little wonder he is dubbed \"the minister for everything\"!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Under our system of government, ministers rely on advise from their departments. Indeed, departmental public servants usually compose letters of response (to constituents such as Mr Davoren) which are duly signed by the minister. Little wonder then that both ministers and the public can be misled simultaneously. There are numerous recent instances of ministers, even prime ministers, seemingly being misled by bureaucrats . . . (Nigel Hawthorne is dead, but Sir Humphrey lives on!)</p><p>This is a systemic problem with the administration of public governance. However, elected ministers and the public are entitled to receive \"the whole truth and nothing but the truth\". Regrettably, time and again truth is the first casualty when precious personalities and prestige are at stake.</p><p>David Obendorf</p><p>West Hobart</p><p>Buy an</p><p>Incat vessel</p><p>How can Premier Jim Bacon expect anyone to buy one of Incat's vessels when the message he is sending the world is that they aren't good enough for Tasmania?</p><p> Governments don't have their own money, they have taxpayers' money. It is vital and timely that Tasmanian taxpayers' money be invested in Tasmanian jobs.</p><p> We still have debt on the Spirit of Tasmania. It should be retained on its run and, as all the experts have been saying for years, the right Incat vessel purchased and run on the correct route, allowing two crossings a day, boosting visitor numbers.</p><p> It would also be a cheaper service to operate and a win-win-win situation for all involved; increased carrying capacity, more reliability and a good commercial solution for Incat as it restructures its business and job protection for Tasmanian workers.</p><p> Please Mr Bacon, don't send Incat jobs down the gurgler by spending $200 million in Europe.</p><p>Hugh Carter</p><p>Brighton</p><p>Mobile phones</p><p>I.

Last August, my father was watering his front garden in Brisbane when a young girl lost control of her car while answering her mobile phone, killing my father.</p><p> On February 22 she was sentenced to one year in prison (suspended, with community service) and five years suspension from driving.</p><p> But apart from this, she has to live with what she has done for the rest of her life.</p><p> Silly really, when she could have pulled up on the quiet, wide open street for maybe 10 seconds.</p><p>S. Thompson</p><p>Moonah</p><p>Mission</p><p>I recently had the privilege of attending the Singapore Commemoration Mission as a Tasmanian delegate.</p><p> As we become older, it is easy to become cynical about politicians and younger generations and to think that the 1941-42 campaign in Malaya and Singapore served no useful purpose.</p><p> But, the mission to commemorate the fall of Singapore on February 15, 1942, has altered my thoughts on both scores.</p><p> The leader of the mission and Minister for Veteran Affairs, Danna Vale, proved not only to be a delightful person but also delivered thoughtful speeches -- sometimes up to three a day -- with total clarity and sincerity.</p><p> Her speech at the Kranji Memorial Cemetery was the best I have heard on such an occasion.</p><p> Senator Mark Bishop, the Shadow Minister for Veteran Affairs, also accompanied the mission and accepted his lesser role with unobtrusive dignity and friendly attention.</p><p> The mission planning and subsequent implementation under Maj-Gen Paul Stevens was remarkable for its attention to the smallest detail and flexibility.</p><p>Gordon Hale</p><p>State President</p><p>Tasmanian Ex-POW Association</p><p>Austins Ferry</p><p>Safe cycleway</p><p>I refer to Jack Buzelin's letter (\"When cycling is a health hazard\", February 25).</p><p> Jack will be pleased to know that the Hobart and Glenorchy City Councils are combining resources to develop and install directional signage for the Intercity Cycleway. The planning for this is well advanced and works will occur this financial year. Jack mentions a lack of warning signage along the cycleway which I find difficult to understand.</p><p> There is in place already all the necessary warning and regulatory signage to control cyclists and motorists on those roads that cross the cycleway and they are all to the standards required by the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources.</p><p> Jack's implication that cycling on the cycleway is in some way unsafe is alarmist. Most citizens would consider the cycleway a wonderful, safe, easy to use facility which has done much for the health and recreational needs of Hobart residents and visitors.</p><p> Jack, get that bike off the hook in the back shed and have another realistic look at the cycleway -- it's really not that dangerous and we are working to make it even safer.</p><p>(Ald) Jeff Briscoe</p><p>Chairman</p><p>Hobart Bicycle</p><p>Advisory Committee</p><p>Hobart</p><p>Hypocrisy</p><p>In commenting on the position of Governor-General Peter Hollingworth, Prime Minister John Howard was recently quoted as saying, \"These are not issues that should be determined by the volume on talkback radio or on the front page of the newspapers\" (The Mercury, February 26).</p><p> If this test was consistently applied to all issues of national importance, it would be a credible statement. Unfortunately, given recent events, it is nothing short of gross hypocrisy.</p><p>Tim Moltmann and Julie Carr</p><p>West Hobart</p><p> I sit in my office bewildered and lost for words at this senseless act of vandalism and destruction forced upon two fellow contractors, their employees and families.</p><p> All anti-logging movements and members (Doctors for Forests, Lawyers for Forests and the like) should hide their heads in shame. It's their militant and one-sided views that incite this form of extreme vandalism.</p><p> Now everyday city folk can see how extreme these people are. They are not interested in balanced, sustainable world's best logging practices; they want no logging at all. It's plain to see this is their ultimate agenda. If the perpetrators of this act are apprehended they should be dealt with in the same contemptible way they have shown Mr Howells and Mr Hazelwood.</p><p> Our personal business insurances skyrocketed last year. I would expect we can look forward to much the same this year. Don't give up Rodney and Terry; we are all behind you.</p><p>Michael Woods</p><p>Managing Director</p><p>Eastern Tiers Logging Pty Ltd</p><p>Triabunna</p><p> My first reaction to the news of the destruction of machinery in the Southern Forests was speculation about a variety of motives that could lead to such an irresponsible act of vandalism. Having no solid facts, I will keep those theories to myself. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to respond with the following: For the past 18 years I have been involved with the conservation movement, and in particular, the campaigns to save our Tasmanian native and old-growth forests.</p><p> I feel confident to say, we as a group, oppose all kinds of vandalism, whether it be the destruction of the forests or the demolition of the machinery employed to do so. Over the past few years the support for this movement has grown at least as fast as the woodchip piles.</p><p> Going by my past experience, the anti-conservationist lobby groups will not be able to resist the temptation to exploit these incidents in order to undermine the support for the strictly non-violent forest campaigns. (It may have already started by the time this letter is in print). I hope that the media and the public have learnt from the so-called \"children overboard\" situation. After all, a state election is imminent and we have to be aware of all kinds of trickery and manipulation in the ruthless fight for power.</p><p>Helmut Schwabe</p><p>Ulverstone</p><p> Thanks to Peg Putt we now know that the Greenies weren't responsible for the destruction of $3 million of forest machinery in the Geeveston area.</p><p> That now makes it easier to identify the real culprits. It must have been a forest fire out of control associated with very high winds. If that's not the case, I hear that foxes are quite intelligent and are probably responsible.</p><p>Matthew Riggs</p><p>Rokeby</p><p> Mike Heywood (Letters, February 27) is mistaken in naming the perpetrators of recent vandalism in the Southern Forests as \"environmental terrorists\".</p><p> These as yet unidentified people are industrial vandals or saboteurs. The true environmental terrorists are the industries which rely on the destruction of old-growth forests and rainforest habitat and the Bacon/Lennon Government that provides overwhelming support for these industries.</p><p>David J.

The battle is all about coming second, behind Channel 9.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Geraldine Doogue, co-reader of Channel 10's Eyewitness News Hour, says: \"We want to be number two.\" So much for ambition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Geraldine's problem is that Channel 10's news is NOT number two. Not any more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Way out in front is the unflappable, affable Brian Henderson at 6pm, followed by TV's iron butterfly, Jana Wendt, at 6.30pm.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, second place has switched from Steve Liebmann and Doogue on Channel 10 to the soap opera, Home and Away, and the news-reading team of Richard Zachariah and Ann Sanders on Channel 7.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Media analyst Garry Maddox, who with Stephen Wall, of Horan, Hall and Walker, has just prepared a Federal Government report on quality programming for SBS, blamed the one-hour news format.</p><p>STILL CONFIDENT</p><p>\"With a one-hour news, there always tends to be a dead spot,\" he said. \"Once you get the main news out of the way, there tends to be a slackening of pace somehow before you get to the sport. It's a problem they find very difficult to overcome.\"</p><p>The incumbent Eyewitness News Hour presenters, Doogue and Liebmann, have no answer to why they have gone down, down, down.</p><p>\"I don't understand it, I just don't understand it,\" said Doogue.</p><p>\"Perhaps Home and Away is biting more than we thought - you never can tell with soaps. When a soap takes off, you just have to sit it out.\"</p><p>Doogue remains confident, however. \"By the end of this year, we will be nice and stable and sitting on number two,\" she said.</p><p>Said Liebmann: \"If we knew the answer, it would be that much easier. The volatility of the figures is confusing. I just don't know why one week you can get 21 ... 22, and the next week you can be down to 15.\"</p><p>According to Liebmann, there will be no panic moves at Channel 10 to counteract the fall. \"The whole approach here is steady as she goes,\" he said</p><p>\"There's no panic, contrary to all the rumours. A half-hour news, that's one of the stories, with Page One in at 6.30. That's ridiculous. They're not changing anything.\"</p><p>Two previous Channel 10 newsreaders, Eric Walters and John Bailey, have their own theories about the demise.</p><p>Walters, now with Channel 9's Today Show, said: \"I put it down to 60 minutes of double heads.</p><p>\"We only had a single head up to 1978 when I left. People would accept the hour but they wouldn't accept the double head.</p><p>PULLED PLUG</p><p>\"I've never been able to understand either 10 or 7 never twigging that it was the double header that people didn't want.\"</p><p>Walters recalled that last Sunday was the 10th anniversary of his sacking by Channel 10.</p><p>\"They brought in American consultants who wanted to turn the news into a circus,\" he said. \"I kept saying, 'I'll do whatever you want, but I'll do it professionally. Don't ask me to become part of the circus,' and then finally they just pulled the plug.\"</p><p>Walters was replaced by John Bailey, who is now John Laws' producer at 2UE</p><p>Bailey, who co-read the news with Katrina Lee - and was in turn replaced by Ron Wilson, who was replaced by Tim Webster - said he now believed the one-hour news format was a mistake.</p><p>\"I think they have to look at going back to 30 minutes,\" he said.</p><p>\"I feel 10's news is a bit tired, so I tend to watch Hendo because of the crispness of Channel 9's news. I don't think I'm getting more news on 10, just that it's a bit more laboured.</p><p>\"And I'm still not sure that a full rapport exists between Steve and Geraldine. Individually, they are very good.</p><p>\"It's been a bugbear of mine for years that there seems to be this strange thinking with management here that you can just take two good people and throw them together and it will automatically work.</p><p>\"It's a lot more complex than that. The chemistry has to be just right. It's a very delicate thing.\"</p><p>Tom Barnett was director of news at Channel 10 for both the launch of the one-hour bulletin in 1975 and the two-headed, one-hour bulletin which followed in 1978.</p><p>Barnett, now director of programs and operations for Sky Channel, said the problem with both the Channel 7 and Channel 10 news bulletins was that there had been too many changes.</p><p>\"The formula for success is consistency,\" he said. \"At Seven and Ten there have been too many changes in front of the camera and too many changes behind the camera.</p><p>\"If you look at the most successful news in Australia, which is the Channel 9 news, there have been no changes.\"</p><p>A REAL CANING</p><p>Out at Channel 7's Epping studios, where this week's ratings brought renewed smiles to the faces of the newsroom personnel, Richard Zachariah was incredulous.</p><p>\"Are you actually going to write about this?\" he said. \"This is the great untold story, the fact that we've been giving them a caning.\"</p><p>Forget about the much bigger caning from Channel 9. This is, after all, a battle for second place in the news ratings and Zachariah has every reason to be pleased that it has happened.</p><p>\"Look, I know what the problem was at the beginning,\" he said. \"I was the new kid on the block. I'd been reaching five per cent of the market with Eleven AM but this was prime time.</p><p>\"All it needed was time. No-one thought it was going to be easy and no-one thought it was going to happen overnight,\" he said.</p><p>Like Tom Barnett, Zachariah also recognised the importance of consistency. \"It just doesn't happen overnight. News is about people getting used to you, like an old armchair.\"</p><p>And, now with the rumour mill working overtime at Channel 10 (\"We're not going to half-an-hour,\" said Liebmann), all is quiet, for the time being, at Epping.</p><p>\"Exactly,\" said Zachariah. \"We've put the forest fire out.\"</p><p>Not quite! Zachariah is about to go on holidays, to be replaced by the former Channel 7 news reader, Ross Symonds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Three Illus: RUNNERS-UP SMILES: Seven's Ann Sanders and Richard Zachariah.

THERE'S A RADICAL PLAN - BUT CAN A CRACK TEAM OF REMOTE AREA FIREFIGHTERS PULL IT OFF?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It isn't such a bad day. The winds are light, it's forecast to reach a pleasant 23 degrees and there's no fire ban; a relief after weeks of unseasonal highs and evil westerlies. It's the morning of Wednesday, October 16, and a posse of army engineers is deployed to the Marrangaroo Army Camp near Lithgow, NSW. They are training to search for improvised explosive devices - the home-made bombs that have killed and disfigured so many of their comrades in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sweeping the ground with metal detectors, the sappers locate their deadly foe lurking in the dirt. The bomb disposal expert lays a demolition charge, lights the 30-second fuse and shouts \"Fire on!\" as they retreat to safety. Boom! A piece of white-hot shrapnel fizzes through the air, landing in a patch of parched grass, sparking a fire that spreads quickly on the live firing range.</p><p>Army fire crews are dispatched and firefighters sent from Lithgow. The first half-hour is crucial to containment - if they can reach it before it grows to a hectare in size, they'll have a chance. They arrive well within time but are unable to attack it, fearing the blaze will set off unexploded bombs. They wait for it to emerge onto safer terrain but the beast has been unleashed. The State Mine fire is on the rampage.</p><p>In his office at the Blue Mountains Fire Control Centre in Katoomba, David Jones, 57, the local Rural Fire Service (RFS) manager, sees the fire alert pop up on his computer screen at around noon. That afternoon, he and the area's police superintendent, Darryl Jobson, drive to Lithgow, 40km away. It's a neighbourly visit. They want to know how they can help and what containment strategy will be used to halt the fire's spread onto their patch in the mountains. They drive home late that night and Jones rises early the next morning; already he can hear an ominous wind howling outside. It is going to be a horrid day.</p><p>He gathers his wife and two daughters, aged 17 and 19. \"Righto,\" he says, \"what are your survival plans for today?\" Same plan as always, Dad, they chorus - we'll all meet up at the Fire Control Centre. \"Goodo.\" He hugs and kisses his girls and his wife. An almost-reformed smoker, Jones pops into a shop on the way to work, buys a packet of ciggies and sucks the smoke deep into his lungs to settle the nerves.</p><p>He and Jobson drive back to Lithgow for another briefing. The situation is grim: the fire is advancing at a phenomenal rate, so they return to the mountains to prepare. At 12.20pm, as they are pulling into the car park of his office, they hear a radio report that another fire has started at Mt York and is heading towards Mt Victoria, a town of 800 people 16km south east of Lithgow. It was ignited by a power line, downed by the 80km/h gusts. This is Jones's patch. \"Oops,\" he says to the policeman, \"here comes our first fight.\"</p><p>Four fire trucks are dispatched and RFS strike teams are alerted. Jones and his team move to his operations room, with its giant map of the Blue Mountains on the wall. Dozens of emergency calls flood in; so many that his staff are unable to answer them all and the overflow is diverted to RFS headquarters. The crews on the ground almost have things contained when a huge gust of wind thunders through, picking up a chunk of fire and hurling it over the firemen, who are forced to retreat. It is now heading directly towards Mt Victoria. Jones takes a call on his personal mobile - it's RFS headquarters. Two elderly people are trapped in their home in the path of the fire. He scribbles down the details and a crew is diverted to rescue them. Every available unit is dispatched to Mt Victoria.</p><p>Just as this is happening, at 1.27pm, another fire alert flashes across his screen. The high winds have downed a power line at Springwood and flames are galloping towards homes and 6000 residents at nearby Winmalee, 80km west of Sydney. Some of the trucks heading to Mt Victoria are diverted. They are now fighting a battle on two fronts, 50km apart. Jones looks around the operations room and watches the colour drain from the faces of his staff. He says to himself what everyone is thinking. \"I hope we don't lose anyone. Please don't let people die.\"</p><p>An RFS Airview helicopter happens to be above Winmalee and streams live video footage of the fire's advance into the operations room. Jones, a 32-year veteran, has never seen a forest fire move this rapidly. At 1.50pm he strides into his office and dials the Red Phone at RFS headquarters in Homebush, in Sydney's west. Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons and his senior staff gather to hear his call. It is now considered too late for people to flee. \"Gentlemen,\" Jones says. \"We need to issue an emergency warning for a 'stay and shelter'.\" Within minutes the fire has jumped Hawkesbury Road and houses in suburban streets with nice, comforting names like Sunny Ridge Road and Buena Vista Road are engulfed in a terrifying inferno.</p><p>Jane Boys, a nurse, is on a day off and is checking the web and listening to the radio, but the first she hears of imminent danger is an explosion in her backyard in Emma Parade. Out the front, an off-duty policeman is running from house to house, banging on doors, screaming, \"Just get out! Just get out!\" Boys and her neighbours scramble up the road to safety with pets and photos and iPads. Within a few hours the fire has raced 10km down the mountain, jumped the Nepean River and destroyed almost everything in its path.</p><p>People tell Jones they can see when he's processing information because he starts to blink rapidly. Today his lids are pumping like the shutter of a paparazzo's Canon. He's almost overloaded. Information is coming in from headquarters, from crews on the ground, from the public, from the Bureau of Meteorology, from helicopters and planes circling above, from the media. All the while he is trying to direct his resources to where they are needed most. One of the most disturbing images is relayed from a helicopter hovering above the dense smoke at Winmalee. From its thermal imaging camera, Jones can see dozens of neatly spaced blocks of red. He knows these are images of burning houses. He can only hope there are no people inside. Late in the day the RFS padre arrives. He takes one look at Jones and says, \"Mate, you look like you need a coffee.\" He returns with a warm brew. \"You look absolutely shell-shocked.\"</p><p>Late that night Jones walks into his house, exhausted and emotional, to be greeted by his wife Judith. \"It's an absolute bloody shambles,\" he says. \"I think I've lost 50 or 60 houses.\" He still doesn't know if there are any bodies in those houses. \"There was just nothing we could do. If we'd had 1000 tankers lined up it still would have overrun them.\" Still, he can't shake the guilt he feels that so much destruction has occurred on his watch. That evening, Fitzsimmons is briefing his minister and the NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell. \"I think we'll be counting bodies in the morning,\" he tells them bluntly. They'd had unconfirmed reports of bodies floating face down in swimming pools.</p><p>Volunteers from around the state pour in - the RFS is a giant, well-organised army of 70,000 volunteers and 4000 fire trucks - assisted by fighters from Fire and Rescue NSW and the National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service. Come morning, 366 fire fighters in 54 trucks are battling the two fires on the mountain, assisted by eight helicopters, each dropping 1000-litre water bombs. Hundreds more volunteers are battling to contain the State Mine fire to the north.</p><p>Later that day, Friday, October 18, one of Jones's staff walks into his office and says, \"Boss, I've got some numbers.\" He reads out his list: 195 houses destroyed at Winmalee; 10 at Mt York; 146 badly damaged. \"You're joking,\" Jones says, stunned. Incredibly, nobody is dead.</p><p>Jones doesn't have time to dwell on it as fires are still burning uncontrolled throughout the mountains. One of his fire analysts unfurls a big map of the Blue Mountains on his desk with crayon markings all over it; the planner and his team have been predicting what might happen in the days ahead by studying wind and weather forecasts. Red lines run deep into the major population centres of Blackheath, Katoomba, Leura and Springwood. \"How many houses are we talking about here?\" Jones enquires. \"Eight to ten thousand,\" the planner says. Jones pats his pocket. It might be the time for a quick durry.</p><p>Dr Simon Heemstra is watching all this unfold from RFS headquarters at Homebush. He's a worried man. On the Thursday, when Winmalee was devastated, the State Mine fire burned an incredible 35km in less than six hours through the eucalypt forests. Heemstra, the RFS's senior fire behaviour scientist, is leading a team of analysts trying to predict what may happen next. These three fires that have caused so much destruction - the State Mine fire, the Mt York fire and the Winmalee fire - were caused by three tiny sparks. They now have more than 150km of active fire front to deal with. What happens if they get another day like they've just had? Or worse?</p><p>Heemstra has an impressive array of tools in his kit bag. The entire state has been mapped for its vegetation mix. Fires will burn faster through low, shrubby country than through forests, for instance; eucalypts with loose bark are more likely to cause spotting than those with a smooth trunk. His team is examining these maps in great detail, along with the fire history in various parts of the national park to determine fuel loads. This information is being overlaid onto topographic maps - the terrain is an important factor because fires burn rapidly uphill and then slow on the downward slopes. A meteorologist from the Bureau is on hand to provide instant wind and weather information. Real-time information about the fire is provided by an aircraft flying overhead, using a multi-spectrum scanner which takes images through the smoke. And then there are pictures being emailed from helicopters, crews on the ground and the public on social media, giving them vital information about the formation of the smoke clouds. They are collating all this information with the weather predictions for the days ahead.</p><p>The data is being crunched manually by analysts to allow them to make informed predictions. At the same time it is being fed into supercomputers using the latest fire simulation modelling. The conclusions reached by both humans and machines are very, very frightening.</p><p>What troubles Heemstra most is a terrifying phenomenon known as pyrocumulus, or pyroconvective, where a large fire marries up with unstable atmospheric conditions to form giant smoke clouds. These monstrous clouds can rise to a height of 15km and cause violent winds and lightning - a firestorm. They have the potential to drop burning embers and cause lightning strikes 20km in front of the advancing fire. If the fire progresses another 35km in one day, as it has just done, tens of thousands of homes in the western suburbs of Sydney and the Blue Mountains are at grave risk and burning embers could land as far east as Parramatta, the geographic heart of Australia's largest city. This is a worst-case scenario, but a real possibility - and while the weather conditions are nowhere near as severe as Victoria's 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, where 173 people perished and 2030 houses were destroyed, these fires are threatening much larger population centres. The lesser scenarios aren't pretty either, still involving the loss of many thousands of homes.</p><p>Everything points to Wednesday, October 23, as being the horror day when unstable atmospheric conditions could lead to pyrocumulus. It is now late on Friday, October 18. Armageddon is approaching.</p><p>Heemstra seeks out his boss, Commissioner Fitzsimmons, to deliver his predictions. He explains the worst-case scenarios and works back from there - it's the RFS's creed to \"plan for the worst, hope for the best\". Fitzsimmons listens and then asks a series of searching questions about the likelihood of each scenario; he's overseeing this vast operation like a wartime general, making sure his troops are properly resourced and deployed to where they are most needed.</p><p>As a 15-year-old kid, Fitzsimmons joined up as a volunteer and has watched the service evolve from a disjointed, poorly funded outfit run by local councils to a professional, centrally coordinated organisation with proper training and standardised equipment. He is acutely aware of the dangers his firefighters face, having lost his father, George, in 2000 when a backburning operation went horribly wrong. A number of his volunteers have just lost their homes at Winmalee, but are refusing to stand down. He's been up to visit and they've been touched by his empathy. He's a man who's not ashamed to cry.</p><p>For a long time Fitzsimmons lived in the shadow of his charismatic former boss, Phil Koperberg. But the public has grown to know and trust him. They like him. He fronts the media with blunt warnings of the dangers, his delivery like a nightclub bouncer explaining the dress code. The pressure on him is immense. He is thinking, \"None of these fires is contained, they are all burning very aggressively, and within a week we are going to see a day similar, or worse, to the day that caused all these fires to run and spread as badly as they did.\" Some radical decisions need to be taken and Fitzsimmons is in the mood to approve them. He knows that \"tens of thousands of houses are at risk - it is that serious. We either fight, or we retreat and let them burn.\"</p><p>One of the most audacious plans is known as The Plug, a strategy to stop the Mt York fire advancing further into the Grose Valley with an offensive backburning operation. If it fails, those who approve it will probably end up before a coroner, having to explain their actions. But that will be nothing compared to the guilt they'll feel if more houses are lost, or worse. Fitzsimmons' overriding concern is for the safety of his firefighters. He tells his commanders that if things don't go to plan they'll all have his full backing should they later have to face the lawyers. Still, he's apprehensive.</p><p>Fitzsimmons informs Barry O'Farrell of the plans. \"The option to do nothing is not an option,\" he tells the Premier. \"If we don't do something these fires have the potential to cause incredible damage. It can't get much worse. I have extraordinary confidence in my team, but this is a high-risk strategy that has the potential to go wrong.\" The Premier nods and wishes him the best of luck.</p><p>The Grose Valley is only a two-hour drive from Sydney CBD yet it's one of the most rugged places in Australia. It's not all that far from where the prehistoric Wollemi Pine grew undiscovered until 1994. When Charles Darwin visited the valley in 1836 he stood atop a sandstone cliff and looked across the impressive forested valley to the other side and remarked that it was \"stupendous ... magnificent\". Darwin was overlooking where they now plan to put The Plug.</p><p>The idea comes from senior Parks ranger Richard Kingswood, who walks into Jones's office and says, \"Have you thought about this?\" Kingswood's plan requires cutting a 5km containment line across the Grose Valley, by hand, to form part of the northern strategic line, what they call the Blue Mountains \"Armageddon Line\". The hope is that they can backburn enough of the Grose Valley to starve the advancing fire of fuel, come Wednesday. The danger is that it could all so easily backfire and they'll have a fire on the doorstep of the urban areas of the Blue Mountains.</p><p>Just cutting the fire trail across the steep and thickly forested valley is a mammoth task. An elite team of 40 remote area firefighters, drawn from the RFS and NPWS, is assembled. Nigel Holland, 40, a Parks field officer with 20 years' firefighting experience, is part of the team. Over the weekend he and his team work day and night. They descend into the Grose Valley with the fire front 6km to the west of them; they carry chainsaws, leaf blowers, axes, rake-hoes and litres and litres of drinking water for the backbreaking task of clearing a one to two metre-wide path across the entire valley - the thin dirt line. They then wait for favourable weather to light the backburn.</p><p>That time comes late on the afternoon of Monday, October 21 - two days before the predicted Pyrocumulus Day. Holland is at home when he gets the call; it's his daughter's birthday party and he's in the garage, cooking a barbecue. He doesn't usually get nervous doing backburns but this call induces \"a crook feeling in my guts\". His initial reaction is, \"I don't think we should be doing this.\" One of his mates at the barbie says, \"Are you sure about this?\" His wife, too, is unhappy but says she trusts his judgment. \"It's up to you,\" she says. He reassures her and says he'll re-evaluate, \"minute by minute\". He gives her and their two kids a big squeeze and then drives to the nearby Parks depot, on the lip of the Grose Valley. It's just on dusk.</p><p>Holland finds that his fellow rangers and the RFS crews are equally nervous. Because the operation is being conducted at night they'll have no air support - no choppers to water-bomb should the fire get away. However, they are told an ambulance helicopter with night-vision equipment will be on standby at Blackheath. It's been specifically assigned to support Holland and his team and ordered not to attend any other jobs.</p><p>The firefighters are briefed by a Parks field officer, Mick English, a guy whom Holland trusts with his life. His briefing is sombre and direct. English reinforces that this is a voluntary mission; that anyone who doesn't want to participate is free to leave. A couple of people opt out. Holland thinks to himself, \"I don't disrespect their decision. I wouldn't go down there either if I didn't know the terrain.\" There's no swagger; nobody is saying, \"She'll be right, mate.\"</p><p>The remaining group discusses the mission and the consensus is that the plan is the only way to stop this fire. \"There are only a few people who can pull this off,\" Holland says to his mates, \"and so if we don't do it, who else is gonna do it?\" They gear up and head off to the valley.</p><p>A couple of fire hoses, several kilometres long, run down the cliff face from the southern Blackheath side. A pump has been dropped down to the Grose River to supply water to the northern side. It pumps water up to a bladder where another pump forces the water further up the hill to another bladder, and so on. However, it only reaches so far up the northern slope. Holland has been assigned to this section at the end of the containment line, where the fire hoses don't reach. A place where, if things go tragically wrong, there will be no escape.</p><p>At around 8pm he sets off for the two-hour, 5km walk, descending a vertical 700m through the blue gum and turpentine forests to the river below. He then scales the other side. One section is so steep that he has to use a rope. He is armed with a drip torch, packets of matches, a back-up lighter and a rake-hoe. All he can hear is the crunch of his boots, his own breathing and the chirping of the night forest as his helmet-torch lights up the track ahead. At around 10pm he scrambles up the last shaley section to be halted by a giant sandstone cliff.</p><p>Holland catches his breath for a moment before radioing his supervisor. \"Boss,\" he says. \"Are you sure you want me to do this?\" Go ahead, comes the reply. He asks again, and then a third time. He then checks the wind direction one final time. If it jumps the break, he'll fight it with his rake-hoe, or flee. Holland has a drip torch, but doesn't want the fire to spread too quickly and so opts for a single match. He strikes it and flicks it into a patch of grass. The fire takes hold, spreading slowly westward, the right direction, away from the containment line. For a minute or more he stands, enchanted by the incredible beauty of it all, as it flickers and flows across the forest floor like a dancer, illuminating the giant eucalypts and the sandstone cliff in a soft, warm glow. A few minutes after that he thinks, \"This just might work.\"</p><p>He then begins his descent to the valley floor, flicking matches at intervals as he goes. The fire burns slowly through the undergrowth, behaving just as they had hoped. All night he and his team patrol up and down the containment line, making sure it doesn't jump. After dawn helicopters arrive to drop aerial incendiaries - small fireballs - to deepen the backburn, to reinforce The Plug.</p><p>At 8am on Tuesday, Holland begins the long trudge out of the valley. Two hours later he and his team arrive back at the depot where someone has put several cases of beer and soft drinks on ice. Holland cracks one open and sits down on the ground, exhausted, allowing himself a moment to feel very proud of what he has just been involved in. He thinks to himself, \"This strategy has never been used before - a 5km hand-line that's been lit by a small group of guys in the middle of the night. Normally a backburning operation has vehicles and helicopter support and all those other things and we didn't have any of that.\" He thought it had about a 30 per cent chance of success, but it held. He takes a long swig and it barely touches the sides. Someone tosses him another can. They've organised drivers to ferry them all home.</p><p>As Wednesday, October 23 unfolds, Shane Fitzsimmons is allowing himself to think he may soon get to sleep in his own bed again. The Plug appears to be holding. Other aggressive backburns to halt the State Mine fire also appear to have worked. And the weather - so vengeful the week before - has, overnight, delivered some relief. Fitzsimmons arrives at RFS headquarters to the news that 5mm of rain has fallen across much of the fire ground. If the fire is going to spread rapidly it will need to be up and running by mid-morning, but at 11am he is looking at live video feeds showing \"fire dormancy across large areas of the fire ground\". By mid-afternoon, Fitzsimmons is feeling like he dodged a bullet. It worked!</p><p>Heemstra is in his office on this day, clicking his heels each time he pulls up a new piece of data on his computer. The unstable atmospheric conditions the Bureau predicted are not quite as bad. The wind is not quite as strong - a drop of just 10km/h can mean the difference between a fire advancing 5km a day rather than 40km. The rain was a godsend and he smiles as he looks at the measurements from each and every gauge. He knows that the work of the firefighters has been heroic but it could so easily have gone the other way. It was a case of good management combining with an enormous dollop of good luck. He turns to one of his colleagues and says, \"We just kept a tiger in a cage with paper walls.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TAM-20131214-1-014-488563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B21-FJ71-JD3N-52ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Magazine</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>December 14, 2013 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

This was Yugoslavia. Morning was rising over a civil war. The shutters seemed to yawn - and a shell blast blew them open. He died on the splintered kitchen tiles where he fell. Our shepherd dog, Chobi, also injured in the explosion, stood over his still body and howled and howled, until a neighbor took a gun and killed him too - out of pity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the memoirist to lose one parent is unfortunate, but to have lost neither is unforgivable. So I have my \"missing\" - that which the memoirist sets out to find - as author Martin Amis termed it in his memoir, Experience. Amis' voyage was around a literary father, Kingsley Amis. Mine was a literary father, too. I was the son of a poet, and because I want to write, perhaps I should write about that. On my voyage I might discover not just him (for we all want to understand our parents) but myself; who I am and from which experiences, rooted in bittersweet childhood, I might bloom as a writer.</p><p>It's a convenient metaphor (of the king-is-dead variety) that my father and I would play imaginary games of chess on the black and white tiles of the kitchen floor. In my childhood I learnt to live in my mind. This was communist Yugoslavia. My father would publish books and then have his passport revoked. I was born in that house in Dubrovnik where my father died; I was raised among artists and eccentrics - a Gen-X child of a disenfranchised family in a 14thcentury seaside town under a totalitarian regime. This is all good.</p><p>On the memoirist's checklist I can cross off: Climactic Event, WellKnown Parent, Unique Childhood, and Personal Tragedy. Let's add Historical Resonance.</p><p>For better or worse, my father was a Yugoslav - not a Croatian, not a Bosnian, not a Serb. He was born and died along with his problematic country. Fifty years earlier, around the time Yugoslavia came into being, my grandmother fled fascist-held Dubrovnik with her one-month-old son, my father, on a train bound for Sarajevo.</p><p>Croatian Ustase militia stopped the narrowgauge train she was on, dragged off the Serbs and threw them into a pit to die. But my grandmother kept screaming to the Ustase, \"Look at this child! Look at this child!\" And one of them felt pity and said to the group, \"Let them go, at least as far as Sarajevo\". My father wrote a poem about it.</p><p>So I have a story, and no one can take it away. But here's the rub: I can't write it.</p><p>Not everyone is a memoirist, though it often seems that way.</p><p>Memoir is our most dynamic literary form. It darts and lurches and is checked and continues on every month with a slew of new releases.</p><p>There was Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes, The Beatles Anthology, Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius; Martin Amis' Experience. We are not all celebrities; we are not all supertalented; but in one way or another, we are all witnesses. \"Reality\" defines our vision of the world. And what we have seen, we must tell others.</p><p>That goes double for the young writer, whose first novel is a patchwork of true stories. How can fiction compete with the sheer authenticity of experience? The young writer is well advised to drop the pretence and debut with a powerful slice of autobiography. He should find memoir easier to compose, for the facts aren't negotiable. Though, to me, facts are their own problem. Can I remember those formative moments? Can I crawl back down the stem and capture the raw sensations of my lost childhood and bottle them? I can't fully recall the smell of this morning's madeleine. But others have done so.</p><p>And some have done so without as powerful a brain or delicate a touch as Vladimir Nabokov, who in Speak, Memory summoned sensational memories like this: \"I registered simultaneously and with equal clarity not only (the schoolmaster's) wilting flowers, his flowing tie and the blackheads on the fleshy volutes of his nostrils, but also the dull little voice of a cuckoo coming from afar, and the flash of a Queen of Spain settling on the road, and the remembered impression of the pictur</p><p>es \u00a4 in the well-aerated classrooms of the village school \u00a4 (and) the throb of some utterly irrelevant recollection (a pedometer I had lost) \u00a4 and the savor of the grass stalk I was chewing.\"</p><p>Speak,Memory was Nabokov's own paean to his father. Memory will guide me, if I invite it. And where it fails, my best guess will be authoritive enough. After all, I was there. Tobias Wolff, author of This Boy's Life, described the memoir as \"the story that memory tells you about yourself\". Wolff gave his tale of a child and a parent the momentum of fiction - and a real truth remained.</p><p>Wolff's case serves to remind me that history belongs to its writers; history, in fact, exists only in the telling.</p><p>Without that barrier between truth and \"novelisation\", the wouldbe memoirist might find himself overwhelmed by the vast landscape the form presents. With the canvas so wide, new attempts at the texture of experience seem almost obligatory.</p><p>Eggers' Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius pushed the boundary of the innovative memoir to metafiction. What can one offer in its wake? Formlessness? A memoir presented as an index to a nonexistent memoir? Say: Father winterwear (cable-knit, Christmas '85, Sarajevo), 189 wit, examples of, 34, 35, 56, 166, 169171, 205, 213 woken by: with hand on forehead, 72; to go fishing, 111; the forest fire, 130 You get it. And what the work might lack in drama, perhaps it could make up for in flair. Actually, no.</p><p>Eggers' story of the death of his mother and father taught us that even the most painful events of a life could - had to be - treated comically. The work was questioning of content and form, but Eggers' professed sincerity of feeling, and the hundreds of thousands of Americans who read his book sensed that. Sincerity is the keynote of the successful memoir.</p><p>And that requires self-awareness, honesty, bareness.</p><p>But bareness is tough. It has a difficult relationship with integrity.</p><p>Could I really disinter the circumstances of my father's bloody death and my upheaval to England with the unembarrassed egotism of a daytime TV show? I suppose if my father had told me that it took such honesty to achieve The Truth, I'd accept it as the writer's uncomfortable duty. I wouldn't be the first - Eggers admits in the appendix of the recent paperback edition of his book: \"So because I knew that many people would be saddened by the appearance of this book - those who cared about my father, for instance, and feel I was unfair - I figured that after its publication I'd be in hiding somewhere.\"</p><p>To make one's own parent - particularly if that parent is famous - the hero of one's memoir is an onerous task. The viewpoint is both wholly personal and hopelessly myopic. So the final picture may be skewed, but it will be valid. But then, not everyone is a memoirist. Not every checklist becomes a pile of typed pages. Not all writers turn so directly to themselves. There are good reasons. Mine is fear.</p><p>First, and rather mundanely, I'm afraid that I'll fail. I doubt my strength as a storyteller and myself as a story.</p><p>And it's hard for the first-time writer to separate the two. I put myself on trial every time I sit down at the keyboard.</p><p>I don't trust myself not to be wasting my time, not to be deluding myself, not to be creating themes where there are none. And when that happens, one question will remain: Was my life at fault, or my writing?</p><p>Then I'm afraid that I'll succeed and thus ultimately lose what I set out to find: my missing. Write it down and you don't have to remember it, right?</p><p>Once a real document for your memories exists, it gradually becomes their sole repository. And that certain quality that is impossible to fully capture in print - a body's warmth, if you will - is lost. My father, the bundle of words, will be available to all. But how could the real, warm man who used to walk to his kitchen not get lost in the imperfect house I'd built for him - trapped in unfamiliar surroundings, confounded by a misplaced door, a hidden year, an invention of plot? He'll slip away a second time.</p><p>That, for me, would mean more suffering. And I'm not sure I can pay that price again.</p><p>This article originally appeared in Brill's Content, an American media industry magazine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illustration by ROSANNA VECCHIO.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8B-R810-TXN5-S1DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yidetstnmwt77f951i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2001</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>November 10, 2001 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Culture/Literature</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6V</classCode><className>BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6S</classCode><className>EXPLOSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UI0</classCode><className>LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000181</classCode><className>PROFILES &amp; BIOGRAPHIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQKS</classCode><className>FASCISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UCO</classCode><className>POETRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001289</classCode><className>PARAMILITARY &amp; MILITIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CNTG</classCode><className>CIVIL WAR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CMP5</classCode><className>INFANTS &amp; TODDLERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DQQN</classCode><className>COMMUNISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N511130CC</classCode><className>BOOK PUBLISHING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX034</classCode><className>SARAJEVO, BOSNIA &amp; HERZEGOVINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC583</classCode><className>BOSNIA &amp; HERZEGOVINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC585</classCode><className>CROATIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Spring flower gardens can be an unforgettable sight. They are so outstanding, many gardeners think all annuals bloom only in spring. This is not the case, although selections are limited in other seasons. The life of a summer display can be short because of the effect heavy summer rains and the attendant disease problems have on some varieties. A summer showing can be worthwhile, despite the shortcomings. Growth is usually much quicker and more vigorous in summer, because of warmth and humidity, than may be stated on seed packets or the labels which accompany a punnet of seedlings. Plantings should be adequately spaced so they obtain free air movement around them in the early growing stages and then just meet as they reach flowering maturity. Good air movement around the plants helps resist diseases. It produces much more flower power over a longer period than do etiolated close-planted varieties, when given plenty of room to develop. Only about 10 annuals can be successfully used along the coast in summer, with three of these only marginally suited for the humid months. There is however a wide varietal range within each type, offering a choice of color and height. Annual balsam, a form of impatiens, is ideally suited for semi-shaded, sheltered situations. It is a fast, upright grower.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>Space at 20 cm for best results. The double camellia flowered mix is popular. The flower color ranges through shades of pink and red to pure white. A smaller variety, Tom Thumb, is attractive, but the flowers get dirty in heavy rain. Celosia is a great standby for summer. Varieties may be obtained ranging in height from 40 cm to almost 1 m. Self colors are available as well as mixtures. Seedlings transplant best when handled while small. The smallest variety is the fairy fountains range which comes as a mixture of six or more colors or separate in pink, red, gold and pale yellow. Spacings should be 20 cm. The medium-height range comprises red fox, with striking brick-red plumes of bloom. It grows to 50 cm. Dwarf fiery feather red, golden feather and apricot brandy are slightly lower growing. The tall varieties are forest fire improved, which is a glowing red, golden triumph and a mixture of at least six colors. Tall varieties make wonderful cut flowers. Celosia should be removed from the garden beds as soon as the main flush of flower shows signs of deterioration. It is a free seeder and if allowed to run to seed, the problem with germination can be as bad as with most weeds. Celosia needs only moderately rich soil but must have a good supply of moisture. A watch may have to be kept for small caterpillars which skeletonise the leaves. Cockscomb is a stiff, low-growing annual best suited for borders rather than bedding. It is a monstrosity or fasciated form of celosia obtainable as a mixture called coral garden, which includes a range of interesting pastel tones. There is also a dark red called fireglow. Cockscombs need a minimum spacing of 30 cm. Gomphrena dwarf purple buddy is a zinnia look-a-like with mauvy purple pompom flowers. It relishes full sun and does not need rich soil or a lot of water. Maximum height is about 35 cm. Gomphrena is popular in public parks where it is used combined with the lower growing orange-flowered Zinnia linearis. Impatiens is almost an all-year-round subject along the coast, however puts its best showing in the hotter months. The varieties vary considerably in height range and color. It is a free seeder and tends to self-sow itself and become a permanent colonist. The second and third generation of seedlings usually grow very tall and the flower color may differ considerably from the parents. Light shade and constant soil moisture are the main prerequisites for a good show however bright displays may be obtained when planted in full exposure. The futura strain, available as a mixture or in about eight self colors, is most popular. It grows from 25 to 30 cm. The low-growing sparkles strain offers two-toned or variegated flowers. Impatiens strike readily from cuttings, therefore a particular color which may appeal can be quickly created. French marigolds just make the grade in summer. They are better in the cooler, less humid periods, because they make excess foliage and fewer flowers in humid weather. There is also a greater likelihood of them being troubled by white flies. French marigolds need full exposure and free-draining, moderately fertile soil. Petunia is an all-year-round plant, although in Brisbane is best from September to December. Good soil drainage with the plants spaced a little further apart is needed for mid to late-summer flowering. Phlox is in the same class as petunia. It will grow and flower in summer. Best results are obtained pre-Christmas, although displays will be excellent if planted in late January or early February to flower at the end of March, April and early May. Torenia is a delightful blue-flowering annual for borders and small bedding schemes. It is a real tropical species and thrives in summer. The flower is not always shown to advantage because the foliage turns a russet color with the blue bloom lost against it. Torenia should be spaced 20 cm apart. Zinnia is a real success story in the summer months. It grows quickly and flowers freely. The tall varieties are sometimes at risk in storms or from heavy rain. Zinnias are excellent as cut flowers if the blooms have fully matured before picking. Otherwise the stem bends just below the flower when severed from the parent. The Thumbelina range is excellent for small beds and borders because it grows to only 15 cm. The pompom or Lilliput strain has delicate flower color and is a compact plant to 35 cm. The tall-growing dahlia-flowered types are a favorite for cut flowers and large beds along with the fluted, petalled happy-talk mix. Zinnia linearis with bright-orange single flowers is wonderful for bedding, as are the strong-colored Persian carpet types in haageana and old Mexico. Zinnia needs well-drained soil, not over enriched, and plenty of light. AVID gardeners who may want a holiday with the accent on a different type of gardening experience should contact Debra Laws, better known as the fuchsia lady of Tamborine Mountains. A trip is being organised to Hawaii in February to inspect tissue-culture laboratories and horticultural establishments. Arrangements need to be finalised by November 15. Debra can be contacted on (075) 45 1595.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML8711072015P73334</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49KD-6G40-01S8-G1M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>COURIER-MAIL</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1987 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"1987\"><dateText>November 7, 1987 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000773</classCode><className>GARDENING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

By this he means that pigs tend to form societies among themselves and that humans are usually close by - we have always found their company not only delicious but of social and ritual significance. According to Watson, this mutual attraction is based in part on that fact that pigs, in common with primates, are one of the more intelligent species of the animal world. He quotes Winston Churchill on the subject (his references are from the general culture as well as scientific): \"Cats look down on you; dogs look up to you; but pigs look you in the eye asequals.\"</p><p>Watson argues that pigs can and do distinguish between self and non-self and they behave towards each other in a manner that suggests they are conscious of the consequences. In short, in common with man, the pig's most useful tool is its brain. It was no accident, says Watson, that George Orwell cast pigs as the rulers of the farm yard.</p><p>Watson delivers his hypothesis after studying wild and domestic pigs and then examining the history of human/pig relations; a relationship that, in some cultures, inspires reverence and in others, downright loathing. Watson writes with such flair and affection for pigs that it will be a few days, I can tell you, before I'll be able to tackle the barbie pork chops with my usual insouciance. -- Reviewer, Dianne Dempsey</p><p>NOVEL</p><p>Now is the Time to Open Your Heart, Alice Walker, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson $29.95</p><p>THE Colour Purple, Alice Walker asserts in the preface to the 10th anniversary edition of her popular Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, is \"a theological work examining the journey from the religious back to the spiritual\", a book about \"the desire to encounter the Ultimate Ancestor\". But, she writes, it is rarely identified as such and her preface exudes a sense of frustration that it has not always been interpreted by her readers as she would wish.</p><p>In her latest novel, Walker ensures her \"theological\" points about humanity's spirituality, its connectedness with nature, cannot be missed. But in doing so, she has created a new-age treatise rather than good fiction. Kate - author, woman of colour, 50-something - searches for and finds enlightenment on two pilgrimages, purging by the Colorado River and consuming hallucinogenic plants in the Amazonian jungle. She discovers the Grandmother, an un-God-like divinity who is present as much in Kate as the natural world. Her lover Yolo also experiences spiritual awakening, among the locals in Hawaii. Kate and Yolo's primary function is to relay the new-age lessons they learn on their journeys. Like her characters, Walker's familiar themes of race and gender are subordinated to her desire to sermonise on the spiritual.</p><p>Now Is the Time to Open Your Heart is as much directive as title. Those who share Walker's interest or belief in her brand of new-age philosophy may well obey such a command when reading this book. But my heart, and my head, stayed closed. -- Reviewer, Lorien Kaye</p><p>MEMOIR</p><p>My Ear at His Heart: Reading My Father, Hanif Kureishi, Faber &amp; Faber $35</p><p>ALL the time Hanif Kureishi was growing up, his father wrote. None of the novels and stories he wrote was published, but he persevered and encouraged his son's efforts in the same direction (when he was still at high school, Kureishi was mentored by Jeremy Trafford, an editor with Anthony Blond, and has never looked back). Eleven years after his father's death, Kureishi came into possession of one of his manuscripts, an autobiographical novel about his father's childhood in Bombay. This book examines the novel, and Kureishi snr's other productions, in the light of his biography, his son's relationship with him and Kureishi's feelings about ageing and becoming a father and writer himself.</p><p>You also get some self-congratulatory detours into the wonders of London bohemia; you sometimes wonder if the story of Kureishi's father is just a prop for Kureishi's own fairly serious self-absorption to do its stuff. (He talks about how much his father competed with him for attention, for instance when Hanif had his girlfriends around: is there a little bit of tit-for-tat here?) You also get some more interesting vignettes of what it is like to grow up between two worlds: when Peter Brook was working on The Mahabharata, he tried to pick Kureishi's brains about India, but was disappointed as Kureishi's artistic education was entirely English and American - \"a mishmash of British sit-coms, contemporary American literature and pop\" - and he didn't know much more about traditional Indian culture than Brook. \"From this point of view I was a failed Indian, a fake.\" -- Reviewer, Owen Richardson</p><p>PHILOSOPHY</p><p>Wild Figments, Michael Leunig, Penguin $29.95</p><p>THIS collection of Michael Leunig's work, taken from 40 years of cartooning and writing, emphasises Leunig's longer prose. For the most part, the cartoons sit on the page as an aside or embellishment to the more often than not melancholy words.</p><p>Leunig's voice is similar in style to his artwork: whimsical, fanciful and at times sad and dark. Leunig's intention is always to give the reader a shake - to force us to see with his eyes the scabrous texture of our daily lives. Take gunk for example. \"Gunk is the material which holds the modern world together\", it is \"a mish-mash blend of a million and one varieties of 100 per cent bullshit, and we're all absolutely covered in it\". Then there's stuff. \"Stuff has become a major threat to freedom and happiness . . . It fouls beauty.\" Leunig is not always comfortable reading. We are all implicated in the loss of innocence; all responsible for Mr Curley and his friends awash in a sea of shit and stuff.</p><p>Leunig is vague about how we right the wrongs. Should we throw away our possessions and follow him to the countryside? Grow our own babies? Vote Labour?</p><p>Make love often? Will these actions change the world, stop Leunig from feeling sad? Then again, is it necessarily the responsibility of the artist to come up with the answer as well as the question?</p><p>Occasionally Leunig puts aside the angst and is simply funny, as in Thoughts About Saint Valentine's Day: \"Firstly, do not under any circumstances attend something like a women's writing workshop on erotic fiction. Secondly, do not wear underpants and beware carpet burns.\" -- Reviewer, Dianne Dempsey</p><p>MUSIC</p><p>Beds are Burning, Mark Dodshon, Viking $29.95</p><p>MIDNIGHT Oil always defined itself as unique. It was the band with a social conscience that refused to sell out. So it's fitting that a book about the band is more than a discography or tour diary. One-time music journalist and radio DJ Mark Dodshon does devote plenty of space to describing the recording of albums, the writing of songs and the staging of live shows, but there is just as much about the band's politics, external and internal. There is not, however, intimate personal detail, a deliberate decision. Nor is there, because of the focus on the band rather than individuals, any exploration of Garrett's recent move to join the ALP.</p><p>Dodshon's thematic rather than chronological approach results in a sometimes analytical book, but one that can be disorienting for those who aren't versed in the who, what and when of the band's career. Through the mosaic, though, one gets a sense of the development of a band that went from gigs at oxygen-starved pubs to airplay on 2JJ and 3RRR to the cultural icons who donned \"Sorry\" suits at the Sydney Olympics.</p><p>Beds Are Burning is not an \"authorised\" biography, but Dodshon describes himself as a friend, fan and occasional employee of the band, and he interviewed all band members but guitarist Martin Rotsey. Guitarist Jim Moginie (in only his second interview) was the most enthusiastic about the book, but warned against a hagiography. Certainly, this is a balanced account, but Dodshon's respectfor the band does verge on the reverential. -- Reviewer, Lorien Kaye</p><p>THRILLER</p><p>The Silent and the Damned, Robert Wilson, HarperCollins $29.95</p><p>ROBERT Wilson's thriller, his eighth, opens early in the morning in a wealthy suburb of Seville; the bodies of the successful builder Rafael Vega and his wife, Lucia, are discovered in their home. He appears to have drunk a bottle of drain cleaner; she has been knocked unconscious and then smothered. Is it a murder-suicide? It is up to police detective Javier Falcon to find out and to sort out what relationships the murdered couple had with their neighbours: the American couple, the Krugmans, he old and jealous, she young and provocative, and the fading actor Pablo Ortega, whose son, Sebastian, was imprisoned for kidnapping and apparently abusing a 12-year-old boy. Various people connected with the case commit suicide or go off the rails in other ways; a forest fire rages outside the city, leading to a macabre discovery; and pedophile rings, the RussianMafia and the Chilean coup and the CIA are all implicated at one point or another.</p><p>Making his way through all this is the saturnine Falcon who, like many a crime novel hero, has a lot of baggage to carry with him (ex-wife, dodgy dad, mental problems - his blind therapist gets involved in the case as well).</p><p>Some of the writing can be off-key and slightly pretentious, particularly when dwelling on the vagaries of Falcon's emotional life, but Wilson can tell a story and the Seville atmosphere is sketched in well without taking over too much. Wilson also manages to suggest cruelty and depravity without seeming over-exploitative. -- Reviewer, Owen Richardson</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>SIX PHOTOS</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P0N-JVF0-TXN5-S20H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-52ixxshov7c1e3f55etx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2005</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>January 8, 2005 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009R8L</classCode><className>ALLEN &amp; UNWIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000092</classCode><className>ANIMAL WELFARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DIRB</classCode><className>THEOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N112200CC</classCode><className>HOG &amp; PIG FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He was walking in the Sherbrooke Forest near Kallista one weekend in 1918 looking for pilotbirds, which were plentiful in the Dandenong Ranges, when he suddenly came across a male Superb Lyrebird (Menura novaehollandia) in full display. The startling beauty of its long, silver-white tail, feathers shimmering against the deep greens and browns of the forest, and its melodious calling, captivated Tom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following weekend was just as momentous. This time, he pushed through the tall bracken and scrub into a damp rainforest gully of sassafras and tree-ferns and discovered two freshly scraped mounds scattered with tell-tale prints. He also came across an enormous hollow log lying amid the ferns on the forest floor. It was about five metres long and 2.5metres wide, burnt out by a forest fire; probably a reject from an early logging operation.</p><p>In 1918, the lyrebirds were facing extinction. For thousands of years, the Aborigines had made seasonal visits to the lower slopes of the mountain forests with the specific purpose, according to Robert Brough Smyth in 1878, \"of obtaining woods suitable for making weapons, feathers for ornaments,</p><p>birds and beasts for food\". European settlers also hunted the birds for their beautiful tail feathers and cooked their bodies like pheasant.</p><p>On his second weekend at Sherbrooke Forest, Tom made a decision that was to prove crucial to the lyrebirds' survival. He would awaken public interest in these remarkable and little-known creatures, which were unique to specific forests in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, and ensure their protection. To do it effectively, he needed to study them at close quarters, and what could be closer than the hollow log.</p><p>From an early age, Tom Tregellas was remarkable for two things: his love of nature and his skill with his hands. His hands earned him a living making iron lace work at a foundry in South Melbourne, as a dental mechanic in Collins Street, and finally working in a factory in Collingwood. His love of birds earned him a place in Victoria's history as a pioneer in the study of the Superb Lyrebird.</p><p>Tom was not a young man in 1918 _ he had been born at Whitehills near Bendigo in 1864, and spent his childhood roaming the bush, often in trouble for skipping domestic chores. He trained as a blacksmith but, when he married, he moved to Melbourne. He was bored by his various jobs and hated suburban living. His \"real\" work, which earned him an international reputation but no money, was as an amateur naturalist.</p><p>Although he never left Victoria, he was well-known for his entertaining and informative lectures on Victorian flora and fauna and his articles in prestigious nature magazines such as `Emu'.</p><p>Between 1918 and 1931, Tom spent so much of his spare time living in his log in Sherbrooke Forest that he became known as \"the hermit of Kallista\". To make the log habitable, he chipped out the charcoal, boarded up one end, levelled the floor and built a shelter of corrugated iron and brushwood over the entrance. Inside were a shelf, an old meat safe, lanterns, billy cans, tin plates, a frying pan, spade and rough hewn tables and stools. He called it Menura.</p><p>Fellow bird lovers begged for the privilege to share Tom's camp. He would meet them on a disused timber track up the hill as his path to Menura was concealed to keep weekend walkers away. Naturalist and journalist Michael Sharland wrote in 1981 about the time he stayed with Tom between 1929-31: \"Tom was selective in who he asked. Very few persons ever knew the log was there. Smoke from the camp fire occasionally brought inquisitive visitors.</p><p>Sharland described the log as \"large enough to accommodate four persons for sleeping, side by side and head to toe, and it was entered on hands and knees without lowering the back, and with sitting room if necessary\". Another guest at Menura was the Earl of Stradbroke, Governor of Victoria.</p><p>From Menura, Tom acquired an extensive and detailed knowledge of the Superb Lyrebird. With incredible patience and many disappointments, he took clear and vivid pictures of the lyrebird's life cycle, using an old Premo quarter-plate camera with no flash. The two highlights of his life were to be the first to photograph the male bird in display and the first to broadcast the lyrebird's song live _ for the ABC in July 1931.</p><p>Esther Hardware has been working on a biography of Tom Tregellas for several years and says she is amazed at how famous Tom was in his day.</p><p>His articles were read by naturalists all over the world and his photographs made into postcards entitled, `Tom Tregellas Nature Series', which gave a complete pictorial history of the lyrebird.</p><p>When Tom died in 1938, two tins of precious glass slides, photographic negatives and prints were thrown on the Dandenong tip. They ended up at a local market, were bought by someone who realised their value and given to the Bird Observers Club and the Victorian Museum of Birds in Abbotsford.</p><p>A short time after Tom's death, the Forests Commission placed a sign at Menura, proclaiming it an historic site and commemorating Tom's work with lyrebirds. The log and his few possessions have been reclaimed by the earth _ but the lyrebirds in Sherbrooke Forest are both protected and treasured as Tom would have wished. Currently there are about 70 birds in Sherbrooke Forest. Their main threat is domestic pets.</p><p>While gathering material for her book, Mrs Hardware has built up a vivid picture of Tom Tregellas as an extraordinarily reclusive and quiet man, only truly happy alone in the bush. A story told to her by one of his nieces, Thelma Fry, typifies the man. Thelma was one of the few children in the family allowed to stay at Menura, because of the solitude and unpleasant creepy crawlies.

Helen Verlander investigates a burgeoning genre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WHEN Peter Mayle quit his advertising job in London and moved to Provence to pursue the good life and produce a trilogy of memoirs on life in Provence pursuing the good life, he unleashed a tidal wave of seachange memoirs that are still washing through the best-seller lists. In Australia, Frances Mayes's Under the Tuscan Sun has sold more than 140,000 copies and is still attracting new readers while two Sydney journalists, Sarah Turnbull and Sarah Macdonald, have sold more than 100,000 and 50,000 each of their respective</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">accounts of living elsewhere, Almost French and Holy Cow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Harper Collins's marketing manager, Kate Wright, these books are literature lite and appeal to a less discerning reader than travel books, with even the less stellar exemplars, such as Ferenc Mate's The Hills of Tuscany, doing 25,000 in</p><p>sales, on the back of the Frances Mayes's phenomenon.</p><p>The seachange books occupy the space between autobiographies (Emilie Carles's Wild Herb Soup) and memoirs (Daphne Phelps's A House in Sicily), rooted in place, and travelogues in which the author is a transient in an unfamiliar landscape, such as the recent Sicilian travel story The Stone Boudoir by Theresa Maggio.</p><p>Driven by downshifters and romantics, these books depict the ultimate seachange, moving to another country, mostly to live out rustic idylls in sunny places around the Mediterranean. Lady Winifred Fortescue's Perfume from Provence, first published to popular acclaim in the 1930s and re-released in 1992, is the earliest example of the genre. But it took mass tourism and the extension of basic services such as electricity and water in the rural backwaters of Europe to make a pastoral dream for a foreign middle class viable only in the past 15 to 20 years. The most quixotic new homes in the seachange memoirs are the grand palazzo of Lisa St. Aubin de Teran's A Valley in Italy and the Romanesque monastery in Rosemary Bailey's Life in a Postcard.</p><p>There have been memorable, personal accounts of living in foreign places before such as Mermaid Singing, Charmian Clift's ode to the Greek island of Kalymnos in the 1950s when all the locals dreamed of emigrating to Australia, or Norman Lewis's story</p><p>of living in Spain after the Second World War before the deluge of tourism diluted and destroyed its traditional identity. This new genre within a genre, a Clayton's travel book, is something else again.</p><p>The Lonely Planet anthology, A House Somewhere, edited by Don George and Anthony Sattin, published at the end of 2002, has picked up on this trend, and made it into Dymock's best-seller list. As George points out, this is \"not the literature of movement but rather of staying put\".</p><p>A House Somewhere presents extracts from some of my favourites such as Annie Hawes's Extra Virgin about two sisters buying a run-down shack in Liguria and Chris Stewart's A Parrot in the Pepper Tree (a worthy sequel to the lovely Driving Over Lemons about buying an old farm in Spain), which are distinguished by a self-deprecatory humour and sense of irony. Other extracts, like Emma Tennant's A House in Corfu, lead one back to the book for a fuller savouring of local colour.</p><p>Among the eight commissioned pieces in A House Somewhere, some, like Lily Brett's terse account of having the family's New York apartment burned down by a visitor, sound more interesting than they are. There's no romance in bodies corporate wherever they are, and in the seachange world, New York is just one of those grungy places from which to effect your escape to a villa somewhere.</p><p>Random House Australia publisher Fiona Henderson, who published the blockbuster of the moment, Almost French, says that if there were a \"magic ingredient\" for these books, she'd be off renovating her own Italian villa. Still, the seachange books have some things in common with the predictabilities of popular romance. There is the chance meeting, with the future owners often finding the property by accident, the overwhelming feeling of the house's rightness, the blind failure to see the chosen ruin's large deficiences such as the absence of walls or roofs, the legal tying of the knot in an incomprehensible foreign language, the subsequent rebuilding or tasteful renovation, and interaction with the friendly but quirky natives.</p><p>As John Hobday reminds us in his In the Valley of the Dragonflies, the seachange books are the testaments of only the happy renovator survivors and the expensive renovations mask the hardship and poverty of the agricultural workers who once lived there. Only Tom Stone's The Summer of My Greek Taverna, another recent release, differs in this respect and he and his partner are back in California as a result.</p><p>In the cosmopolitan variations on the theme, Marlena De Blasi's A Thousand Days in Venice and Sarah Turnbull's Almost French, there is also the happy ever after with the foreign chap who comes with the charming, if bijou, flat in Venice or Paris.</p><p>As with the popular romance, escape is all. All the seachange writers to one degree or another are in flight from the violence, isolation and disconnectedness of big-city living. In Tony Cohan's On Mexican Time, an American visitor weeps from culture shock when Mexican strangers take it on themselves to care for him after he falls ill in the street. Especially in the case of Italy, rural life overseas is experienced as a return to an Eden where tradition and community count, food still has real taste and there is time to sit on a stone wall, shelling peas in the sun. In Macdonald's Holy Cow, which lacks most of the middle-class \"good life\" trappings such as renovations and good food, the author experiences lessons in patience and life's priorities.</p><p>Where Charmian Clift and Norman Lewis, for all their willingness to be charmed by their surrounds, could not help but explore the societies they found themselves in, the seachange memoirs are extended picture postcards, celebrating middle-class preoccupations with fine food and real estate. Even when they attempt to colour in the mis en scene as in the bestselling Vanilla Beans and Brodo by Australian Isabella Dusi, they seem more like effortful tourist guides. While the authors provide teasing but slight autobiographical detail, there is no detail related to food and drink or home improvements that is too mundane for inclusion. Every meal is lovingly regurgitated through careful diarising. It is Enid Blyton meets Burke's Backyard. Reading Mayle is like overdosing on souffle as we follow his resolute pursuit of nothing more taxing than a nice truffle.</p><p>The seachange books would not work at all if they did not appeal to our envy. It was fitting that Sarah Turnbull should have recently been voted by Sydney Morning Herald readers \"most envied person\", a description she reportedly found ironic as she huddled with her dog over a small radiator in wintry Paris. Although Almost French is mercifully mostly free of foodyism and offers not a single recipe, it still stays true to character in its celebration of middle-class consumption when the author nearly dies of pleasure drinking hot chocolate in Les Deux Magots in St Germain.</p><p>Even where the seachange books try to explore the foreign milieu of neighbours, artisans, shopkeepers and assorted festivals, it is more wading pool than deep-sea navigation, \"banal but efficient\" as a friend offers of Almost French. The book's \"insights\" into French culture make it relaxing and unchallenging armchair travel.</p><p>The projected movie of Mayes's Under the Tuscan Sun makes the mind boggle. Mayes is brilliant at conveying the sensual immediacy of things and her feeling response to them. We can almost taste the artichoke \"drizzled\" with the purest green olive oil but at its worst her writing degenerates into terminal solipsism. In the sequel, Bella Tuscany, she spends no less than seven pages, for example, raving about her love of monogrammed antique linen.</p><p>The thing about the seachange books is that they are almost totally incident free, taking as their \"little bit of ivory\" only the daily business of eating, house-fixing and buying provisions, with the occasional tourism, guidebook on lap, to other parts. Carol Drinkwater's The Olive Farm is singular in mentioning a forest fire that comes close to their French farmhouse, the death of her father, the illness of her husband, hiccoughs with the blended family and a nearly missed acting performance in London because of bad weather.</p><p>Publishers say that cashed-up baby boomers with a desire to travel mean that there is no glut to the seachange memoirs in sight. Even the threat of terrorism can only boost a market that relies on our dreams of playing the shepherdess in a quaint cottage. As Alain de Botton puts it in The Art of Travel, what we find exotic abroad may be what we hunger for in vain at home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Three photos: Off the road: Peter Mayle, above, and Sarah Macdonald, top right, and Sarah Turnbull.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P78-1640-TXN5-S383-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yi0ay1bugw1da4jmku0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2003</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2013-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2003 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>April 27, 2003 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Culture/Literature</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6V</classCode><className>BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000181</classCode><className>PROFILES &amp;

Aditjondro.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, Indonesian President Soeharto called for the International Monetary Fund to patch Indonesia's financial system, after the rupiah suffered a dramatic 20 per cent plunge over the previous two weeks. But who will fight the forest fires which have been raging since July in many of the main islands of Indonesia, at the same time as the rupiah's exchange rate began its dramatic plunge?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this case, it is not only a problem of extinguishing the fire. It is a matter of halting the alarming rate of tropical deforestation in Indonesia. In this case, nobody has more power than Soeharto himself. Yet the President, two of his brothers, five of his children and one grandchild are the most reluctant to make the necessary sacrifices, due to their logging operations, oil palm plantations, a mega-project to convert 200,000 hectares of peat swamp in central Kalimantan into rice fields for transmigrants from overcrowded Java, coal mines, pulp and paper production, as well as palm oil marketing.</p><p>Many of those companies were targeted when the Forestry Department issued a list of 176 companies, which had fires burning on their properties. On October 3, licences were revoked for 29 of those companies, since they still had not managed to extinguish those fires. Several companies in Kalimantan owned by Soeharto's charities and managed by the timber tycoon Bob Hasan were among those 29. So were companies from the Raja Garuda Mas (RGM) Group in Sumatra, owned by another businessman, Sukanto Tanoto, who also has joint ventures with Soeharto's children and in-laws.</p><p>The initial Forestry Department blacklist of 176 companies indicates the major culprits of tropical deforestation in Indonesia since the New Order began in 1967. Most are plantation companies, mostly rubber and oil palm, followed by timber estates to grow the raw material for pulp and paper factories. And a smaller group of land-clearing contractors for transmigration schemes exposed tens of thousands of hectares of peat soil, which sprang into flames in the heat of fires from neighbouring forests and timber plantations.</p><p>Oil palm illustrates the power of Indonesia's First Family, since three generations of the Soeharto family are involved in this lucrative business. It began in the mid-1980s, through a joint venture of the Salim and Sinar Mas Groups, which involved Soeharto's eldest son, Sigit Harjojudanto, his youngest brother Tommy Soeharto and Soeharto's cousin, Sudwikatmono.</p><p>In the late 1980s, Salim and Sinar Mas split their joint venture and all its properties, and each group developed its own crude palm oil (CPO) division. The Soeharto family interests were still represented in both groups, especially in Salim Group, where apart from Sudwikatmono, two Soeharto siblings, Sigit Harjojudanto and Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, are major shareholders in the group's Bank Central Asia (BCA).</p><p>In the meantime, Sinar Mas developed its edible oil division in co-operation with Soeharto's second son, Bambang Trihatmojo, who is also a minor shareholder in a plantation company of another conglomerate close to the First Family, the Bakrie Brothers.</p><p>Bambang's younger sister, Siti Hediyati Hariyadi, also got involved in this business. She and her brother-in-law, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, formed a joint venture with a Sino-Malaysian tycoon, Robert Kuok, to open a 44,000-hectare oil palm plantation in South Sumatra in 1994.</p><p>This is when the third generation came into the picture. A company owned by Sigit's eldest son, Ari Harjo Wibowo, received a quota from the Indonesian Logistics Board (Bulog) to market 70,000 tonnes of crude palm oil a month more than the crude palm oil marketing quota for the Salim and Sinar Mas Groups. Ari, however, not only wanted to sell other companies' palm oil but wanted to manage his own plantations. So the Transmigration Minister gave Ari a contract to develop an 80,000 ha oil palm plantation in East Kalimantan, using transmigrants as \"captive labour\".</p><p>Capital was no problem for Ari, as grand-uncle Sudwikatmono would lend to him from Salim's cement factory. And with his First Family connections in March 1996 Ari signed a memorandum of understanding with a Pakistani trading corporation to export $US1.24 billion ($1.7 billion) worth of crude palm oil to Pakistan.</p><p>This oil palm (family) story and the cancerous growth of plantations, timber estates, and mining operations in primary forest land indicate the extent of nepotism of the Soeharto family and its effect on Indonesia's economy and ecology.</p><p>This nepotism has often been justified by playing on Indonesian nationalism, by making the people proud of becoming \"the largest plywood producer\", then \"the largest paper and pulp producer\", and eventually \"the largest oil palm producer\" in the world. But this misplaced nationalistic pride has contributed to Indonesia's growing public and private debt, as well as to the displacement of tens of thousands of local farmers and tribal communities by the logging concessions, timber estates and other major mega-projects. And it may also boomerang on the Australian economy and on Australian consumers.</p><p>The most immediate effect of the forest fires will be on edible oils. As mentioned, most companies on the Forestry Department blacklist are plantations which were growing, or at least were supposed to grow, oil palm. Most of them were members of the Sinar Mas and the Salim Groups, or were involved in marketing arrangements with Sinar Mas, Salim, or Ari Haryo Wibowo's Arha Group.</p><p>This will affect Goodman Fielder's edible oil supply from Indonesia. This largest Australian food producer has two 50:50 joint ventures with Sinar Mas: one in cooking oil and the other in snack foods, a total investment of $47 million. The first produces the well-known brands of cooking oil and margarine, Meadow Lea and Mother's Choice.</p><p>The Indonesian forest fires will force Goodman Fielder - and so ordinary Australian consumers - to pay more for their palm oil- derived margarine, cooking oil, and soap. As an an oil palm marketing manager told the Business Times in Singapore last week, the haze will shrink yields more after the natural three-month cyclical fall in production. Oil palm needs sunlight and rain. The prolonged drought caused by El Nino and the lack of sunlight due to the smog will take their toll on yields in six months time, so he predicted.</p><p>The second commodity in Australia which may be hit is paper. The second-largest group of forest fire culprits are the timber estates which were developed to produce the raw material for Indonesia's growing paper and pulp factories. The two largest paper and pulp producers in Indonesia are Raja Garuda Mas and Sinar Mas, which have listed their paper and pulp offshoots in Singapore and New York, respectively, as APRIL (Asia Pacific Resources International) and APP (Asia Pulp &amp; Paper).</p><p>With their domestic and overseas mills, these two Indonesian paper tigers have assaulted the Australian market.

Midway through an interview at New York's Regency Hotel, Clooney jumps out of his chair when friend and Syriana co-star Damon stops by for a visit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After apologising to a reporter for the interruption, Clooney gives Damon a bear hug and then playfully grabs his backside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Matt's hot,\" Clooney teases.</p><p>\"Look at him. He deserves to be People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive!\"</p><p>Later, Damon admits that he's happy to see his friend back on his feet and feeling chipper, as the past year has been rather tough for Clooney. During the process of mourning the deaths of a number of family members, including his aunt Rosemary, his grandfather and brother-in-law, the weight the actor put on to play one of the protagonists of Syriana - 16kg in 30 days - had a rather adverse effect on him.</p><p>\"It changed him,\" Damon says.</p><p>\"It made me think of that movie Super Size Me, where the guy gets depressed as he gains weight. George was like that, like I've never seen him before. He's normally so fun and vibrant and playing pranks, [but] he wasn't like that at all.\"</p><p>Clooney might have had a tough year personally but, professionally, the 44-year-old is surely at his creative peak. After finishing up Syriana , Clooney co-wrote, directed and co-starred in Good Night and Good Luck. The latter, which has received almost universal critical praise around the world, focuses on the 1950s battle between Communist-obsessed senator Joe McCarthy and US TV newsman Edward R. Murrow (played by David Straithairn). The films garnered multiple Oscar nominations, with Clooney collecting the Best Supporting Actor prize for Syriana.</p><p>Far from basking in the limelight personally, he directs attention towards the films themselves.</p><p>\"The actual victory for me is that Good Night and Good Luck is making money, and it's getting good reviews. We're really excited about the fact that it's sparked discussion among TV news reporters.</p><p>\"So I feel like it's been a great thing. The same with Syriana.</p><p>[That's] being reviewed very well, and we're having a really enjoyable time with the idea that debates will be raised by the film. To me, that's the real issue.\"</p><p>Clooney has never transformed himself for a role quite as rigorously as he did for Syriana. Initially, he had signed on as executive producer, knowing that his name would help director Stephen Gaghan raise money for the film. But when the actor signed on to play CIA man Bob Barnes dropped out, Clooney stepped in, growing a beard and putting on weight for a character whose decision to question the misplacement of a missile leads to a tragic set of circumstances. It's a dark film, perhaps Clooney's most sinister to date, but then as <person><nameText>Matt Damon </nameText></person>has already attested, the actor was himself in a dark place during much of its filming.</p><p>\"A lot of bad things were going on in my life,\" Clooney says of the multiple bereavements he'd endured, \"so it wasn't hard to be depressed. I thought that it was a good space to stay in while I was doing the film because this character feels like he's been deserted and betrayed all along.</p><p>I wanted to concentrate on that, and I wanted to blend into the wallpaper and not really be noticed at all.\"</p><p>Epic in scope, Syriana probes the ways in which oil companies, law firms, the US government and the Middle Eastern regimes conspire to control the flow of oil throughout the world. A rap against American consumer culture, the film overflows with characters as varied as Islamic fundamentalists, Justice Department investigators and energy consultants.</p><p>While a critical hit in the US, it has nevertheless received some flak for being anti-American.</p><p>But the actor insists the film is wholly patriotic. \"I don't think that it's an anti-American movie at all,\" he says. \"I think that it's as pro- American as you can get. The whole idea of America was based on dissent and bringing questions to the forefront.</p><p>It's your right and your duty to ask questions. I know we're not providing answers, but we're certainly asking a lot of questions.\"</p><p>Something he has been doing rather a lot of late.</p><p>But then, perhaps it's in the blood.</p><p>The son of an army helicopter pilot- turned journalist and a former beauty queen, <person><nameText>George Clooney </nameText></person>was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1961. His initial ambitions were to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a TV anchorman. Nick Clooney's life was largely defined by principles, and he often walked out on jobs over ethical issues. As a result, George and his younger sister, Ada, were forced to move home and change schools frequently.</p><p>Settling in Ohio, he briefly attended college before bailing.</p><p>Having ditched the idea of becoming a TV anchorman on the grounds that \"I wasn't going to be any good at it\", he thought about becoming a professional baseball player. Instead, he settled on temporary jobs: harvesting tobacco, selling insurance and even ladies' shoes.</p><p>Ultimately, spurred on perhaps by his movie star good looks, he fell into acting, though he was anything but an overnight sensation. A decade of daytime soap operas and unsuccessful pilots would follow, Clooney increasingly convinced that a big break would never come his way.</p><p>But then, at 33, fate finally smiled upon him when he landed the part of Dr Ross on the TV medical drama ER. His character may have personified TV cliche - he was the hunky doc who saved children's lives while bedding a good chunk of the nursing staff - but he played it with a nice line in arched eyebrow irony. The show was an instant hit.</p><p>At last, Clooney was a star.</p><p>But when he quit the show in 1996 for the big screen, many considered it a reckless move. Countless TV stars before him - Tom Selleck, Ted Danson, David Caruso - had attempted similar, only to fail and then crawl back to the small screen, cap in hand.</p><p>But Clooney triumphantly bucked the trend, becoming not just hot property but also an increasingly versatile performer. With fluff like 1996's One Fine Day alongside Michelle Pfeiffer, he proved himself adept at gloopy rom com in the manner of a latter-day Cary Grant.</p><p>But it was the box office success of 1998's Out of Sight that cemented his leading man credentials, with him as a bank robber trailed by US marshall Jennifer Lopez - the two leads smouldering like cigarettes in a forest fire. He was now a genuine A-lister, but would go on to subvert his standing in Hollywood with a vigour that would give him more in common with, say, Ken Loach than Tom Hanks.</p><p>Forming a production company (Section Eight) with the latter's director, Steven Soderbergh, Clooney went on to co-create thoughtful, almost belligerently uncommercial films more concerned with art than artifice. For every mainstream film he appeared in - from the sublime (O Brother, Where Art Thou?) to the ridiculous (Intolerable Cruelty) - he would do deep- thinking sci-fi (Solaris), sea-faring calamity (The Perfect Storm) and twitchy drama (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, his impressively low-key directorial debut).</p><p>And while the majority of his peers seek bigger bucks for each new project, Clooney seems little taken with financial gain. For Syriana, he took an actor's fee of just US$250,000, ($339,000) about 1 per cent of the going rate for male superstars. And for Good Night and Good Luck, he accepted symbolic pay only: a dollar for writing the script, and another for directing it.</p><p>The whole film cost a paltry US$7million ($9.5million), and it has already earned three times as much in the US alone, but Clooney will see none of it. He signed his rights away in order to get the film distributed.</p><p>\"I've actually had a very good career once I realised it wasn't about trying to make money,\" he said recently.</p><p>And in this pursuit of such leftfield, often polemical, projects, he has effectively become Michael Moore with added sex appeal. If Good Night and Good Luck prompted some of America's more hysterical critics to label him borderline anti-American, then Syriana's main thrust - which documents the gradual transformation of two innocent Pakistani boys into suicide bombers - has prompted accusations of him as a terrorist sympathiser. Nonsense, he says.</p><p>\"Obviously I'm not condoning or defending horrible, heinous acts, but there is a reason these things happen.\"</p><p>And it is his motivation to find out why. \"So yes, I'm a liberal,\" he concludes, \"but I'm sick of it being a bad word.\"</p><p>During the filming of Syriana, Clooney suffered an injury that, it was reported, pushed him to the brink of suicide. In one scene, he was tied to a chair for the purposes of interrogation, but he fell backwards, banging his head on the concrete floor. Crippling headaches started soon afterwards, and the man who first came to prominence pretending to be a doctor in a TV show, immediately decided he'd had aneurysm and was about to die. In fact, he explains, \"I tore my dura [the membrane that surrounds the brain].\"</p><p>He underwent two medical procedures over the course of the following year, in which three small bones were removed from his neck and back.</p><p>Very gradually, the headaches began to ease, life slowly returning to normal. The reports of suicidal contemplation, he explains, were exaggerated to say the least.</p><p>\"I had done [a TV interview] and [the host] said, 'How bad did the pain get?' I said, 'Well, you couldn't live like that', and the next thing I heard was I wanted to kill myself. That's not exactly what I was saying.\"</p><p>And so his fanbase breathes a sigh of relief, greeting the news that 2006 is shaping up to be his most industrious year yet. Within months of his latest two releases, there will be a further three Steven Soderbergh's The Good German, in which he plays a reporter on the trail of his former mistress (played by Cate Blanchett); Michael Clayton, about a defence attorney facing retirement; and another Coen Brothers comedy, Burn after Reading.\"It'll be the end of my trilogy of idiots that I've played for the Coens,\" he says, grinning. \"Finally, I'll be back with the idiots.\"</p><p>And, it must be said, he does play them rather well. Perhaps because, in real life, the man is anything but.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-5836400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4JFH-5X00-TX4S-M38X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>March 11, 2006 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DHZP</classCode><className>ACADEMY AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DQQN</classCode><className>COMMUNISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D0L8</classCode><className>TELEVISION NEWS SHOWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DHZP</classCode><className>ACADEMY AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009UYD</classCode><className>GEORGE CLOONEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009UYC</classCode><className>MATT DAMON</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

For a moment the streaked gargoyle face looked as though it had turned to stone. Then he was gone. Sobbing, Perdita collapsed on the bed. There was a knock at the door. frantically hopeful, Perdita looked up. But it was Red _ not Luke _ who stood in the doorway, grinning from ear to ear. \"\"Hi Godiva,\" he said softly. Perdita told him about the row with Luke. \"\"I'm not hanging round here any more. You'd better come with me. The press are going to annihilate you, Lady Godiva.\" \"\"But I can't walk out on Ricky and Dancer,\" wailed Perdita. Red crossed the room and kissed her properly for the first time. \"\"I'll come with you,\" said Perdita helplessly. From that moment Perdita was a leaf, ripped untimely and whipped hither and thither by the whirlwind. Back in Rutshire on an October afternoon, Ricky, having worked young ponies all day, by way of light relief was hacking through the Eldercombe woods. He passed Daisy's cottage. Ricky thought for a moment how comforting it would be to go in for tea, crumpets and fruitcake. But he didn't want to inflict his black gloom on poor Daisy who was unhappy enough over Perdita's defection. A dark blue Ferrari roared up the driveway scattering an appropriately red carpet of beech leaves and screeched to a halt.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>It was Bas and Rupert, on their way home from hunting. Both were in tearing spirits. Ricky thought for the hundredth time how well being happily married suited Rupert. Rupert grinned. \"\"Tell it not in Gath, but I have actually been faithful to Tag for a whole year, and I want to get home to her, but first we've got a proposition to make to you. We are definitely going to revive the Westchester in America next year. We want you to act as consultant. \" Ricky went very still; the color drained from his face. \"\"The plan,\" added Rupert, \"\"Is to transmit it in America, the UK, Europe, certainly Australia and Argentina and God knows where else in October. You'll captain the English team.\" If Chessie really loved him, reasoned Ricky, she'd have come back by now. On the other hand he could go to ten, he could win the Gold Cup and now there was the possibility to win the Westchester. It was worth a try. Since Perdita has run off with Red she had rung her mother twice, the first time from Kenya to say she was deliriously happy. But when Daisy reproached her gently for hurting Luke and walking out on Apocalypse, Perdita had hung up and cut off all lines of communication. Few people realised how much Luke suffered. Because he was unhappy, he didn't see why the rest of the world should suffer. And it was difficult to forget Perdita when every newspaper carried pictures of her and Red entwined and laughing. It was the last tournament of the Palm Beach season with six crack teams playing each other over 10 days for a huge silver cup topped with rearing horses. On the hottest Sunday of the year, the Alderton flyers were only leading the O'Briens by two goals at half time. Perdita had had a lousy first half, not helped by a ball on her arm in the second chukka which was now agony. As she cantered back to the little tent where the other Flyers were taking a break she saw them standing in a huddle outside looking deadly serious. Then she heard Bart say, \"\"Well for Chrissake, don't tell Perdita.\" \"\"Tell Perdita what?\" the dust made her hoarse. Red who'd gone very pale, was lighting a Black Sobraine with a trembling hand. \"\"Bobby Ferraro hit Luke with a ball yesterday,\" he said. \"\"Broke his hand in three places. they've just operated and taken out 50 chips of bone.\" Four days later Perdita disobeyed everyone's advice and flew up to see Luke. She didn't tell Red. \"\"Darling Luke have you forgiven me?\" Then she dropped her parcels all over the floor for sitting on Luke's bed was an incredibly attractive girl. Her second almost more agonising impression was how desperately ill Luke looked. \"\"Who's she?\" she asked Luke, nodding rudely in the girl's direction. \"\"Margie Bridgwater.\" Luke made no attempt at explanation. \"\"For the first time I can suddenly see how like Red you are,\" she said. \"\"I've seen pictures,\" Margie put her hand over his. \"\"I like my men more rugged.\" \"\"Red's the handsomest man in the world,\" exploded Perdita. \"\"Not as good looking as Rupert Campbell-Black,\" said Margie. \"\"Wow! He came to see Luke this morning.\" Margie followed her out into the passage. Forcing her hand furiously into her trousers pocket, Perdita pulled out a bottle. \"\"Give it to Luke,\" she said. \"\"Morphine for when the pain gets too bad.\" \"\"He needed that in August when you shoved off with Red,\" said Margie. As she went back into the room to grip Luke's other hand as the doctor started to undo his bandages, he said through gritted teeth, \"\"I've just realised who Perdita's father is. RED'S temper was blazing like a forest fire when Perdita got home. All in all Perdita wasn't in a ve ry chipper mood to go to a barbecue that evening, particularly when Red was immediately collared by a comely, female feature writer in a groin-level, blue suede skirt from Vanity Fair. One more drink, thought Perdita, and I'll separate them. \"\"Hi aren't you Perdita Macleod?\" said a soft voice. \"\"Who are you?\" she asked aggressively. \"\"Simpson Hastings.\" If Perdita had been less drunk she would have heard warning bells. Simpson Hastings seemed to know a lot about polo and particularly about her. \"\"They say you're a phenomenon beyond genius. Where did the skill come from? D'your parents ride?\" \"\"My mother's never been on a horse in her life.\" \"\"And Hamish?\" \"\"Hamish isn't my father.\" Suddenly an Ancient Mariner compulsion to tell all swept over her. Back in Rutshire, Daisy had had a long day finishing off a painting. She felt quite faint with happiness. Ricky had become such a friend recently and her painting was going wonderfully. She clambered over Ricky's padlocked gate, raced up the path and then gave a gasp. Outside the door was a glamorous, if slightly grubby-looking blonde. With her was a man carrying a camera. \"\"Mrs Macleod?\" said the girl. \"\"We're from The Scorpion. Can we have a word?\" \"\"What about?\" stammered Daisy. \"\"Perdita told Simpson Hastings in Florida yesterday that she'd no idea who her father was.\" Nothing prepared Daisy for the horror of The Scorpion next day. \"\"Gang, bang, thank you, Mum,\" said huge front-page headlines. \"\"Poor old Daisy,\" said Bas Baddingham to Rupert. \"\"Didn't we used to know a creep called Cosgrave? Used to give wild parties in the sixties?\". Jackie Cosgrave hadn't prospered in later life. Women were no longer so keen to buy his paintings, nor girl students to sleep with him. Picking up The Scorpion, Jackie looked long and hard at Daisy. Picking up the telephone he rang The Scorpion news desk. \"\"I'll tell you who Perdita's father is, but it's going to cost you.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PIC OF ARTIST'S ILLUSTRATION</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML9112172020P127014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49N1-62Y0-01S8-G4H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>COURIER-MAIL</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1991 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"1991\"><dateText>December 17, 1991 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>GC337</classCode><className>ARGENTINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>GC359</classCode><className>KENYA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was as if my eyes had suddenly remembered how to see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was a freshly divorced woman, momentarily released from pain, and everything I was struck me as flawlessly clear and fantastically colored: rocks, mountains, ocean, sky reared up in front of me, fiercer than dream.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My divorce had been finalised weeks before and, although I had been physically separated from my former husband for some time, it was not until the moment that I stepped on to Corsican soil that I suddenly felt a rushing sense of release. A sadness was loosed from me, some inner catch sprung open.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I remember the anticipatory spasm of joy I felt as the plane from Paris swooped dangerously low over Corsican mountains. Calvi's Sainte-Catherine airport is famous for its death-defying approach, where planes and mountains engage in a complex choreography. All around me French women and men laughed nervously, some bracing their feet against the floor in unconscious preparation for collision.</p><p>From the air Corsica was a delirious smear of colors and shapes, but the looming mountains held no terrors for me personally. The minute I stepped from the plane and the rich smell of summer and fruit and pine trees rushed to meet me, I felt loose in my skin again.</p><p>Simone, my friend from Paris, was waiting in the terminal, brown from the sun, all untied like a girl. She had clearly abandoned the slick of the city and as she led me outside to her old white battered Volkswagen with the hood folded back, I noticed that her feet in her sandals were cracked and weathered. She had paint stains on her fingers.</p><p>Before I got into the car I took off my cotton sweatshirt: it was at least 10 degrees hotter than Paris, The car didi not go fast, or rather Simone didn't, and as we moved along the road I tipped my head back and looked up at the soaring shape of Monte Grosso and the perfection of the Mediterranean sky. The smell of burning was in my nostrils.</p><p>Simone was wearing a hat turned up at the brim and I thought only her driving betrayed her age: she sat too close to the steering wheel, clutching it tightly as if it had alternative powers she had not yet divined.</p><p>\"This is a place of violence,\" she announced in English, \"violent people, violent beauty. Regard.\" She indicated towards distant mountains where smoke was rising from a forest fire. \"Every summer, Corsica burns.\"</p><p>The rushing air in my face smelt sweet to me, of oranges and fire and escape. As the car began to climb towards the mountains, we passed olive groves, the sensuous green of orange and lemon orchards and I could see, high above us, walled towns built into cliffs. Here and there a church spire was visible.</p><p>I knew that Simone was lucky enough to own property in Corsica only because her late husband was a Corsican. Complicated laws usually prevent anyone but Corsicans from owning or inheriting property (with the glaring exception of fabulously wealthy Italians with names likes Agnelli whose house regularly get bombed by Corsican patriots).</p><p>Nothing Simone had told me had prepared me for the beauty of her house. Monte Grosso sat immediately behind it, looming, beautifully preposterous, a cartoon mountain, while the house itself was made of several different cubes, joined together by passages and walkways, ponds, rock gardens, and each section of it had a distinct and memorable character.</p><p>On top of one cube was a roof garden, which led to all the other roofs, with 360-degree views. The mountain behind, the sea far, far away, the folds and sweeps of the valley below. In the garden around the house(s) were fig trees, grapes, cherries, insects, birds: the very air was quick with life.</p><p>Inside the house, Simone's drawings and collages hung from the walls. And everywhere there were mementoes of her late husband: an old raincoat, still hanging behind the door; all his jazz records; his books. He had spent a complicated working life writing parliamentary reports for the French Parliament, but I immediately knew what Simone meant when she said he was a peasant at heart.</p><p>In Corsica they had lived a life of the body: swimming, climbing the enormous mountain in both summer and winter, skiing in the depths of winter when all the tourists had gone home. They had no children and he had died skiing on a different mountain back in France, falling down dead in the snow.</p><p>Together, and separately, they had many friends and invited guests to the house in Corsica every summer. The summer of 1993 was no exception and we ate every meal on the roof, hearing the peal of church bells from the town perched on top of the next hill. We ate hard local cheese, sharp on the tongue, and drank Corsican wine tasting of fruit and earth.</p><p>In my memory, every day after that was perfection. We travelled to little town and ate cabrettu a l'Istrettu, a kind of Corsican tomato stew with kid; we swam in water so clear and blue I could not have imagined it (I saw my toes and the depths of the sea far beneath them); we travelled to the tops of mountains and swam in freshwater streams so cold and transparent they might have come from freshly melted ice.</p><p>We drank diabolo menthes in tacky tourist cafes in Calvi and in Ajaccio, Napoleon's birthplace, and took long walks along white sandy beaches. I had never seen a place of such extremes: near-desert, alpine forests, beaches, ancient towns, lush farmland.</p><p>I fell heedlessly into the arms of one of Simon's other guests, a man I had known before in Paris. Because he was Italian-American he could understand the local dialogue, a mix of French and Italian, and together we walked through browned summer fields, speaking of our lives as if they belonged to other people.</p><p>At the time I wasn't really living anywhere. I had left Australia for Paris in 1989, inadvertently ending up in Hong Kong, married to a British lawyer. The marriage was brief and incendiary: I had gone back to Paris, back to Sydney for a while, returned to Paris.</p><p>I couldn't decide where my life was. On those long walks with the Italian-American, I talked about wanting to live in Australia, about wanting to live in France, about wanting someone else to decide my life for me.</p><p>I willed myself to fall in love with my companion but his lips were too thin and every time I kissed him it felt wrong. My lost husband was physically gone from me but my lips remembered the imprint of his mouth.</p><p>Still, my husband's ghost was not at that summer's feast. Corsica had somehow banished him and when I dozed in the after noon heat I felt only weightless. And once, when my new lover and I were walking in an abandoned village, an old man insisted on accompanying us, telling stories of an Australian sea captain who fell in love with a local woman and never went home again.</p><p>I wondered if Simone would let me live in her house forever, until I grew old like some wizened monk in a cave. I would clean out the fireplaces in winter, prevent fires and learn to talk like a peasant.</p><p>But when everyone went home it was just here an dme and she sadly informed me of plans for a mineral-water plant right next door. \"I intend to fight,\" she said, looking out over the hills, a tanned general preparing for war.</p><p>I thought of the film Manon des Sources and the metaphorical implications of water. \"A factory,\" Simone said, \"a factory of water, Can you imagine?\"</p><p>I looked out over the trees below to the land next door where the mineral spring had been found. There was a kind of buzz in the air, wasps perhaps, busy French bees. I could not imagine.</p><p>The next morning it was my turn to leave. As I climbed the stairs to the plane I actually had tears in my eyes, whether from joy or grief I could not tell. I was 34 year old, but I felt my life was beginning.</p><p>Even now, all these years later, whenever I think of Corsica I fell free again.</p><p>Susan Johnson is a novelist and editor of Saturday Extra.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Two photos</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NF40-TXN5-S0CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yi2z004alszve432o4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1999</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1319\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1999 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"1999\"><dateText>December 28, 1999 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>N111310MM</classCode><className>ORANGE GROVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N111320MM</classCode><className>CITRUS GROVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>GX115</classCode><className>PARIS, FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS0008X1U</classCode><className>CORSE, FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Michael Bachelard and Melissa Fyfe explain the key questions facing the royal commission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1 BURNING OFF</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Royal Commissioner Bernard Teague does not know what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in for. His inquiry must make sense of one of the most complex and ideological debates that has dogged Victoria since the 1939 Black Friday fires: how to reduce the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fuel\u00e2\u20ac in the bush to prevent or mitigate fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last person to try to make sense of it was the current Emergency Services Commissioner, Bruce Esplin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the Alpine fires of 2002-03, Esplin found that between 1988 and 1998, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fuel reduction burning - lowintensity fires that remove flammable bush build-up such as bark and leaf litter - had dropped off. He concluded that fuel reduction, or prescribed burning, was not a panacea, would not necessarily prevent bushfires and its effectiveness was almost impossible to measure. But more should and could be done.</p><p>The rub was this: his inquiry found that governments faced real constraints. Expert advice concluded that the government had a window of only about 10 to 12 days each year in which to safely conduct fuel reduction burns. It needs to be cool enough, with benign winds, the correct humidity and conducted when the forest is not too wet and not too dry.</p><p>If any of these factors goes awry, houses and other assets can be burnt, fires can race out of control across private land and national parks can be accidentally crisped.</p><p>Some say that on those days of opportunity a massive effort should be put into starting safe, low-intensity fires across the state. Since Esplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, the Department of Sustainability and Environment has boosted its resources for burning opportunities, but this is where another major constraint comes in: human health. The smoke generated by fuel reduction burning affects people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respiratory health, particularly asthma sufferers. Another constraint is the environment itself. Despite claims last week that green groups were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ecoterrorists waging a jihad\u00e2\u20ac on prescribed burning, many environmentalists have no problem with it. Many of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grasslands, woodlands and forest systems have evolved with fire and need it to regenerate. The problem for conservationists is the frequency of prescribed burning. And this is a complex matter. As Esplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiry pointed out, some forest types need five-year cycles of burning, others 12, others 30.</p><p>Despite the constraints, after Esplin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, the government ramped up its burning regime.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>We want to do more, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt,\u00e2\u20ac the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief fire officer, Ewan Waller, told The Sunday Age. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we have to have the weather with us.\u00e2\u20ac Last financial year, the department burnt 153,578 hectares of land.</p><p>This was the largest amount burnt in Victoria since 1993 and 18 per cent more than the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual target of 130,000 hectares. While it is comforting to look at figures, Esplin noted the numbers of hectares was not necessarily a good measure; it was how strategic the burning program was in protecting community assets.</p><p>In the Royal Commission, it is likely Justice Teague will need to find answers to these key questions: did the Government do enough burning off in the fire-destroyed areas and would that have made any difference to the number of people killed?</p><p>Waller said he was yet to look at the fuel reduction maps but some areas burnt on Black Saturday had been either burnt in previous bush fires, or the target of fuel reduction burns.</p><p>Other areas had not been, he said.</p><p>2 COMMUNICATION</p><p>THE stories emerging from some of the most devastated towns of Marysville, Kinglake and St Andrews are similar - there was precious little warning of the devastating fires.</p><p>Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency communications - from the 000 line, to CFA internal radio and paging services, to emergency notifications on CFA and Department of Sustainability and Environment websites, and then ABC Radio - were inadequate to the task of last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency.</p><p>Even those listening avidly to ABC Radio for official risk warnings were often not warned in time.</p><p>Bushfire experts also query whether the warnings that did get out were sufficiently detailed and personal enough to engage individuals under threat. A key issue for the Royal Commission will be a close forensic study of warnings and delays.</p><p>The problems follow years of procrastination at a state and national level about whether to introduce a telephonebased warning system for individuals. The system could have the potential to contact each of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 22 million mobile phones if needed.</p><p>Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emergency Services Commissioner Bruce Esplin has promised a large state-based trial of SMS warnings to mobile phones within three months.</p><p>A senior emergency services source told The Sunday Age that, in the midst of Saturday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis, people were ringing 000 to report emergencies, but not every call was answered.</p><p>Emergency radio channels for internal communications also were stretched. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The operators did a fantastic job, but the pressures were enormous.</p><p>The question is whether they had enough channels. It seemed to be asking too much from each operator - they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with the volume of calls coming in from the (fire) trucks.\u00e2\u20ac The source said the CFA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal paging system was so slow that some messages came through hours after they were sent.</p><p>CFA Kilmore fire captain Greg Murphy was less critical of the communications system, saying it was going \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as well as could be expected with the fire intensity\u00e2\u20ac.</p><p>Records of CFA warnings issued on the day are no longer available on the website, and DSE was reluctant to give briefings on the subject.</p><p>But a Sunday Age analysis of records on the Twitter website (which re-broadcast official CFA warnings within minutes of them going online) shows that warnings for the Kilmore- Kinglake fire were sparse at crucial times.</p><p>The first warning of the fire hit the Twitter website at 12.15pm on Saturday, 25 minutes after CFA officers arrived at the scene on a country property outside Kilmore and reported the fire was out of control and growing fast. There were long gaps between warnings during the afternoon as the speed of the fire, at up to 100 km/h, outpaced the CFA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications ability.</p><p>For long periods, the DSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website and fire maps were inaccessible.</p><p>Risk and community safety professor John Handmer has launched a research project into the timeliness of warnings.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>The system definitely got overloaded, and there are a lot of internal issues there,\u00e2\u20ac he said.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t escape the fact that people need to get notice and warnings.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>3 STAY OR GO</p><p>DR DAVID Packham has spent years spreading the word about bushfires: if you stay and defend your house, your life and your property are more likely to emerge unscathed. But, after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inferno, Packham, one of the policy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s originators, believes it should be reviewed by the Royal Commission.</p><p>Since 2005, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go early or stay and fight\u00e2\u20ac approach has been official Australian policy.</p><p>The impetus came from a 1991 analysis of the deaths in the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires.</p><p>Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach is unique. In the United States, for instance, evacuation from a looming wildfire is the norm and houses are often sacrificed to save lives.</p><p>Packham, a bushfire scientist, based his view partly on his own experiences during the Ash Wednesday fires. He and his wife, along with two friends, saved their Upper Beaconsfield house.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>If it turns out the analysis is that the conclusions of 1983 are wrong, then either it should be scrapped or modified.</p><p>The key is the work should be done carefully and extremely honestly,\u00e2\u20ac Packham says. He believes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stay or go\u00e2\u20ac will be vindicated but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undoubtedly things can be refined\u00e2\u20ac.</p><p>Previous scientific work showed that whether the house is occupied and defended is the second biggest factor in whether it will survive. The most important factor is the fire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intensity and, according to Packham, the positioning of houses. Dwellings with trees close to them, on north-facing slopes, made of flammable materials are probably indefensible, no matter how knowledgeable or fire-prepared their occupants are. That message had not necessarily been understood.</p><p>Survivors of the fire, as well as Premier John Brumby and the CFA, are also calling for a thorough study as to whether the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fight or flight\u00e2\u20ac policy still works in changing climate conditions.</p><p>Risk expert Professor John Handmer, from RMIT, said the approach to staying and protecting property from bushfires emerged as early as the 1930s when, in rural communities, it was the best (if not only) option.</p><p>A 1940 CSIRO report into the Black Friday fires in 1939 found that most houses burned down from ember attack, not from direct flame contact. Then, through the Hobart fires of 1967 and the Ash Wednesday fires in 1983, studies were made of those who survived, and those who died, and the stay or go policy emerged more strongly.</p><p>But the reality of Saturday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fire, when well-prepared people were overwhelmed by flames and others only narrowly escaped, now puts a big question over the previous evidence.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf we are heading into warmer, drier conditions, then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a serious problem,\u00e2\u20ac Handmer said.</p><p>4 CLIMATE CHANGE</p><p>IN THE wake of the tragic fires, January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heatwave has been almost forgotten, but it is this event - not the record heat on Black Saturday - that climate scientists are most interested in.</p><p>The heatwave, they say, is the climate change clue behind why the fires were so ferocious.</p><p>Two caveats need to be declared before any discussion of climate change and the events of last weekend. The first is that experts agree that blazes would have been sparked whether people pumped greenhouse gases into the atmosphere or not.</p><p>The mix of weather - hot day, huge northerly wind followed by a dry, cool change - was unusual, but has happened many times in Victorian summers. The second is that no climate scientist will say that one event, no matter how extreme, is the manifestation of climate change.</p><p>But the royal commission will study the role of climate change in the fires. The question is: did the changing climate make the fires more lethal? One of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top fire experts, the Country Fire Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief officer Russell Rees, believes the answer is that climate change had a big role to play. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is my belief, 100 per cent.\u00e2\u20ac The fires came after 12 years of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hottest and longest drought, a string of the hottest years on record in the last decade, a 35-day dry spell for Melbourne through January that was equal second-longest in history, one of the most severe heatwaves on record and the hottest day ever recorded in Melbourne and Victoria. Also, places to Melbourne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s north and north-east that were hit by the fire, especially the Marysville area, have had more significant declines in average rainfall than many other parts of the state.</p><p>Monash University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Professor Neville Nicholls, who has spent 35 years researching climate, said the scene for Black Saturday was set with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chronic drying\u00e2\u20ac of the environment due to the 12-year drought. Then came the January heatwave which, in terms of temperatures - with recordbreaking jumps of more than two degrees in places - was so extraordinary Nicholls describes it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mind-boggling\u00e2\u20ac.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>The really crucial thing linking this to climate change is the three-day heatwave rather than the really hot temperatures on the day of the fires. By then, the situation was already primed . . .\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>I think it is beyond reasonable doubt that global warming and the enhanced greenhouse effect has exacerbated the severity of this tragedy,\u00e2\u20ac said Nicholls, who for decades worked at the Bureau of Meteorology as a senior principal research scientist.</p><p>On the day before the fires, the bureau did its calculations for one of many predictions it provides, called the Forest Fire Danger Index. This is a calculation based on how dry forests are, air temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. This calculation then gets converted to the fire danger ratings heard on the radio. Low is up to 5, high is 12-25 and it goes through to extreme, which is 50-plus; Ash Wednesday was 102.</p><p>The reason Premier John Brumby told the state that February 7 would have the sort of fire danger to make it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the worst day in Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history\u00e2\u20ac was because areas of the state had values of 150 to 180.</p><p>Kilmore, where at least one fire started, had a fire danger index of around 180.</p><p>In 2007, a group of fire and climate researchers from CSIRO and the bureau studied what will happen with fires and climate change in south-east Australia. The headline from this analysis is often reported as the usual increases in extreme fire days. But the research also looked at what has happened with fire danger indexes in the past few decades. They found that from 1980-2000 and 2000- 2007, the increase in fire index ratings was around 10 to 40 per cent. They found we could be in a natural cycle of high fire danger made worse by climate change and two new categories of fire risk needed to be created: 75-100 should be called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very extreme\u00e2\u20ac and more than 100 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catastrophic\u00e2\u20ac.</p><p>The most disturbing thing about the research was that the number of extreme fire danger days being seen now equal or exceed what the climate change models predicted for 2050 - in other words, this is what living with fire in a climate changed world is like, 40 years early.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO.

Don't compare it to the events of the past decade or so: the Asian financial crisis, the bursting of the dotcom bubble or 9/11 - all of which are fading from economic consciousness much faster than anticipated. Accept, instead, that this is a huge dislocation, an earthquake that has cracked the landscape apart so that the freeway of progress must take a different route.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Accept that the financial markets will be utterly transformed, that trust between counterparties needs to be rebuilt using new and yet-to-be-invented structures and that the way we do business in the future will be different to that of the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If that's the case, what ideas will we be using to build the new world, and who are the most articulate proponents for change?</p><p>Over the past three months, column inches devoted to analysis of what happened and where to now would reach the moon and back. But through all this, several strands of thought have emerged as having strong explanatory power and providing ideas for leaders concerned with both risk management and regulation. A key premise is that capital markets are characterised by two interconnected facts. On the one hand, cutting-edge finance is disproportionately populated by intelligent people with powerful tools - they are good at growing their business; on the other hand, they are just people.</p><p>RATIONAL SELF-INTEREST</p><p>In 2007 finance took up four times the proportion of the US economy than it did in the 1960s (up from 10 per cent to 40 per cent), but the sector doesn't actually produce anything.</p><p>In The Ascent of Money, a timely exposition of the rise - and now crash - of finance, Harvard economic historian Niall Ferguson writes: \"In 2006, the measured economic output of the entire world was around US$47 trillion. The total market capitalisation of the world's stockmarkets was $51 trillion - 10 per cent larger. The total value of domestic and international bonds was $68 trillion, 50 per cent larger. The amount of derivatives outstanding was $473 trillion, more than 10 times larger. Planet Finance is beginning to dwarf Planet Earth.\"</p><p>Dr Paul Woolley, a former fund manager and IMF economist, believes it is the \"agency problem\", or the inside knowledge of financial professionals, that has caused such capital misallocation. It's the disproportionate grab on growth by financial intermediaries. These intermediaries include corporate executives who, according to Standard &amp; Poor's in the US, claimed stock-option-based remuneration in 2002 equivalent to 20 per cent of reported profits. They also include investment bankers, fund managers, trading commissions, fees and the rest. According to Woolley, by the time the money gets to your super account, returns that should have gone to you and other shareholders have shrunk to less than 1 per cent. It is no surprise then that politicians are looking at ways to reign in this excess.</p><p>All is not lost for the free-marketeers, however. Bill Emmott, former editor of The Economist, believes the swing towards state intervention has been overblown, if only because the cost of intervening in the financial markets has been so high that governments won't be able to extend themselves any further.</p><p>IRRATIONAL SELF-INTEREST</p><p>The growth of Planet Finance might be less of a worry if its rise had corresponded with a smooth upward growth curve. It would be less worrisome if more people making decisions about price and value had actually led to better calculation of risk, capital allocation and a tempering of speculative excesses - if, in other words, markets had been efficient.</p><p>But 2008 provided clear evidence that this is not the case. Billionaire George Soros puts much of it down to reflexivity - the idea that markets react to what has happened in the markets themselves, rather than to any underlying analysis of value.</p><p>Joseph Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize in part for showing that investment practitioners have little incentive to actually do any original research themselves, relying on the wisdom - or madness - of others. It's known as momentum investing. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, a psychologist and an economist respectively, won the Nobel Prize for showing that people have a lopsided and perverse approach to risk-taking: we are risk averse for positive prospects, but risk-seeking for negative ones.</p><p>Planet Finance, in other words, is populated by human beings. We base decisions on facts we remember or data that is close to hand, rather than information that might actually have a bearing on the issue. We look around for confirmation of our biases, accept confirming data and reject ideas that speak against our prejudices. As humans we are subject to a host of fallacies, overconfidence issues and logical missteps. This grates against the base assumption driving capital markets: that the aggregate decisions of a large number of people are a more or less accurate indicator of value.</p><p>\"Orthodox economic models are not wrong, as such,\" says economist Pete Lunn, author of Basic Instinct: Human nature and the new economics, \"but rather sloppy, biased approximations of how our economy works. They present a cartoon characterisation of economic life, greatly exaggerating one side of our nature at the expense of others.\"</p><p>REAR VISION</p><p>Nobody could argue that a financial crisis was unforeseeable. Many did foresee it: Nouriel Roubini of New York University had been sounding the alarm for years before events proved him correct - he has now found world fame as he shuttles between global economic summit and commentary gigs. It is the precise circumstances, the chain of events, and the implications and severity of those events - the all-important details - that are the modern-day black swans, as expressed in Nassim Taleb's book The Black Swan: The impact of the highly improbable.</p><p>The tools that we use to predict the future - from weather models to revenue forecasts to capital markets trading systems - are inadequate because they are unable to take into account what their creators never imagined. But the unimaginable happens far more often than we give it credit for.</p><p>Our propensity to rely on yesterday as a predictor for tomorrow is built into just about every form of analysis western business uses every day. Corporate quarterly profit forecasts, banks' daily value-at-risk models, insurers' earthquake and hurricane models, strategic plans and budgets, performance and remuneration systems - each of these uses techniques developed to extrapolate the future from the past. But what if the future is much less predictable? This is Taleb's Ludic fallacy, or \"the misuse of games to model real-life situations\".</p><p>Still, statistically, the best predictor of tomorrow's weather is today's. It may be that the only tool we have is the rear-view mirror, and all we can do is invent innovative ways of using it.</p><p>Reinventing the species</p><p>Financial historian Niall Ferguson says that financial history is an evolutionary one, governed by the laws of Darwin. The financial world shares a number of features with the natural world, including \"genes\" that preserve organisational memory; spontaneous mutation; competition for resources within species; natural selection through the market allocation of capital and human resources; scope for the creation of new species, and for extinction.</p><p>Ferguson predicts the death of the global banking dinosaurs because economies of scale and scope are not always the driving force in financial history. \"More often, the real drivers are the process of 'speciation' - whereby entirely new types of firm are created - and the equally recurrent process of creative destruction, whereby weaker firms die out.\"</p><p>Essay: Satyajit Das</p><p>Deleveraging is the only means of restoring the body financial to full health, but it will take time</p><p>In the classic tale, The Arabian Nights, the beautiful princess Scheherazade buys one day of life at a time by recounting fantastic fables that enchant the King who has condemned her to death. Investors and traders are currently telling each other fairytales to buy one day at a time and stave off the inevitable.</p><p>The drama and tumult of recent events are not symptoms of the disease but the cure. The \"disease\" is the excessive debt and leverage in the financial system, especially in the US, the UK, Spain and Australia. In the lyrics of the Bruce Springsteen song - many have \"debts that no honest man could pay\".</p><p>The \"cure\" is the reduction of the level of debt known as the great deleveraging\". In 1931, US Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon explained the process to President Herbert Hoover: \"Liquidate labour, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. Purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down ... enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.\"</p><p>There is widespread acknowledgement that an extraordinary level of debt and leverage precipitated the current financial crisis. However, there is limited understanding of how the deleveraging purge works. Leverage is the tool that amplifies returns; it is also the means of accelerating losses.</p><p>Deleveraging requires willing buyers with capital and the liquid cash to purchase the assets. Selling inevitably results in more selling as lower prices trigger additional margin calls and further reduction in debt levels. Ultimately, prices of risky assets must adjust to market clearing levels as the system reduces debt. The initial phase of the cure is the reduction in debt within the financial system. The overall loss to the financial institutions (net of re-capitalisation via new equity issues) is $400 to $600 billion and may well go higher. This requires reduction in financial sector balance sheets through reduction in lending and asset sales.</p><p>The second phase of the cure is the higher cost and lower availability of debt to the real economy. This forces corporations to reduce leverage by selling assets, reducing investment and raising equity. This also forces consumers to reduce debt by selling assets (where available) and reducing consumption.</p><p>Feedback loops mean reduction in investment and consump-tion lowers economic activity, placing stresses on corporations and individuals, setting off defaults that trigger losses for the financial system, which further reduces lending capacity.</p><p>RACE TO THE BOTTOM</p><p>Deleveraging continues through these repetitions until overall levels of debt reach a sustainable level determined by lower asset prices and cash flows available to service the debt. The process of destruction echoes WB Yeats' words: \"All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.\"</p><p>Within the financial sector, deleveraging is well advanced. In the real economy it is in its early stages.</p><p>Fairytales in financial markets focus on the \"superhuman\" abilities of regulators and governments to avoid the deleveraging under way. Central banks and governments have taken progressively more aggressive actions to try to influence events. Central banks have aggressively supplied liquidity to the money markets, accepting an increasing range of collateral types in return. Governments and central banks have also bailed out a number of financial institutions using a variety of strategies to limit contagion. Most recently they have resorted to injecting equity into selected banks and providing extensive guarantees supporting bank borrowings.</p><p>Banks are being forced to write-off bad loans without delay. Banks' capital needs are being addressed by forced mergers and restructuring, new equity issues and (in the absence of other options) nationalisation or liquidation.</p><p>Central bank guarantees of all major borrowings and other transactions to reduce solvency risk for banks are designed to enable normal transactions between parties in the financial market to resume. The necessary co-ordinated global action appears at last to be under way.</p><p>Lower interest rates and increased government spending have also been used to try to reduce the effects of the financial crisis on economic activity in the \"real\" economy. The initiatives are sensible short-term measures to stabilise markets. In the longer run, they transfer the problem onto the government and the taxpayer balance sheet.</p><p>CAPITAL IDEA</p><p>It remains to be seen whether these global initiatives achieve the required re-capitalisation of banks, improve the normal supply of credit to sound borrowers and reduce fears of default allowing normal activity between institutions to resume. The key issues remain the availability of capital and liquidity. The perceived abundance of liquidity was, in reality, merely an illusion created by high levels of debt and leverage. As the system deleverages, it is becoming clear how little capital there really was.</p><p>The risk of a severe dislocation in global capital flows remains a real risk in the present environment. As China's Premier Wen Jiabao observed, the US financial crisis may affect the whole world. As Wen noted: \"If anything goes wrong in the US financial sector, we are anxious about the safety and security of Chinese capital...\" All creditors have much to lose if the deleveraging process becomes disorderly.</p><p>Ultimately, \"all the king's horses and king's men\" cannot prevent the deleveraging of the financial system under way. The extent of deleveraging is substantial and likely to take time. In recent years, money was cheap and other assets were expensive. As each of the global economy's credit creation engines breaks down and systemic leverage reduces, money becomes scarce and more expensive, triggering substantial adjustments in asset prices in a reversal of the process.</p><p>David Roche, principal of the London consulting firm Independent Strategy, estimates that $4 to $5 of debt is now required to generate $1 of economic growth. As credit creation slows and debt levels fall, the sustainable level of global economic growth may fall as well.</p><p>At best, the government and central bank actions can smooth the transition and reduce the disruption to economic activity in the transition to a lower debt world. The risk is that well-intentioned steps prevent the required adjustments from taking place, delay recognition of problems and discourage action that must be taken by financial institutions, corporations and consumers.</p><p>Like a giant forest fire, the deleveraging process cannot be extinguished. Thoughtful actions can create firebreaks that limit preventable damage to the economy and the international financial system until the fire burns itself out.</p><p>The Arabian Nights had a happy ending. The King, after 1,001 nights of enchantment and three sons, pardons the beautiful Princess Scheherazade, who becomes his queen. Despite the fairytales that investors are putting their faith in at the moment, the deleveraging at the heart of the current financial crisis may not have such a happy ending.

The cross is covered in the wax from melted candles. A few plastic flowers are scattered on the ground, along with a young sapling in a plastic grow-bag. Other than that, there is just the constant sound of birds and the chatter of insects on an afternoon so damp and humid that one's clothes stick to the skin like cling-film. Deep inside the rainforest the trees are so huge, the soaring canopy so dense, that there is an echo that makes noises ring out. Vicente Paulo Suera, a small farmer who scrapes by growing rice and manioc on a tiny plot nearby, heard gunshots on the morning of February 12 when the Catholic nun was shot to death by gunmen allegedly hired by a local rancher. The rancher, Vitalmiro Moura, has just surrendered to police, claiming he is innocent. She was left face down in the mud, her Bible at her side. \"We have lost a great defender. No one else will help us,\" said Suera, leaning against an upright timber in his mosquito-infested shack. The Amazon rainforest is an extraordinary and other-worldly place. Vast, dense and hugely rich in plant and animal life, there is nowhere else like it on earth. When you stand inside it, beneath vast trees that chase up into the sky, you can feel it pulsating -vigorous, alive, untamed.</p><p>It accounts for 40percent of the world's remaining rainforest and the Amazon basin contains perhaps a fifth of its fresh water. It is so rich in flora that an average hectare contains more than 100 different species. Critically, it absorbs much of the planet's greenhouse gases and produces 20percent of its oxygen.And yet it is under threat like never before. Since 1970, perhaps 20percent of the Amazon rainforest has been lost to logging and development. Campaigners say that 6500ha are being lost every day. The unceasing and illegal devastation of the Amazon rainforest of Brazil is best seen from the air. Flying west from the regional capital, Belem, the forest stretches ahead like a vast, black-green carpet that races to the horizon. Yet when you look straight down you cannot miss the strips and patches of bare brown earth where the logging has eaten into the jungle. Around 80percent of the logging is believed to be illegal. On the ground, when you actually visit these slash-and-burn sites in what was once pristine forest, fire-scarred rocks and debris of the burned timber stand forlorn and alone in the middle of what are now grassy paddocks grazed by white cattle. It is like being at the scene of some terrible arson in which nothing and no one survived. Stang, 73, a lifelong activist, was apparently murdered as a result of the latest land dispute in which she had become willingly involved in this remote part of north-eastern Brazil. Her murder, like that of Chico Mendes in 1988, was quickly seized on by environmentalists around the world as a sign of the bitter land battles still being fought here. And yet her death six weeks ago represents a great deal more than that. Her murder did not take place in a vacuum. Economic and social forces are battling over the future of the Amazonian rainforest and the left-leaning government of Brazil is struggling to balance a desire for \"sustainable development\" with domestic and international demands for economic growth. Given the role of the Amazon as a provider of oxygen, it is no exaggeration to say the outcome of that tussle will effect all our futures. We all have a stake in the battle that cost Stang her life. Originally from Ohio, the nun spent the past 30 years on the front line. Having joined her order after leaving school, she arrived in the Amazon in the mid-1970s. She worked as an educator but after witnessing what was happening around her, her focus turned to environmental and lands-rights issues. In Anapu, 30 hours by dirt road from Belem, many people turned to her for help. The small town, all but unreachable at the height of the rains when the unpaved Transamazonian Highway becomes rutted and churned, is one of the flash points in the battle over the forest. In Anapu, as elsewhere across the state of Para, loggers and ranchers are pitched in an often deadly fight against small farmers and environmentalists. The deforestation and the development of ranches all around Anapu show which side is winning. Stang's case was far from unique: since 1985, 1400 people have been murdered in land disputes -half of them in Para. Death threats have become a way of life. \"They apparently have lists of those they want to kill,\" said Sister Mary Gillespie, another nun from the order. Francisco de Assis dos Santos Souza knows all too well about threats. The 36-year-old, known as Chiquinho, is president of the local branch of the Rural Workers Union, which worked with Stang to stop the illegal occupation of land set aside for the poor. Before the latest murder, Chiquinho had received plenty of threats. Two days after his friend was shot, he received a letter that read, \"Dorothy has been killed -you are next\". When Chiquinho spoke to The Independent at the union's simple headquarters a thick-set armed policeman sat next to him. He has apparently been instructed never to leave his side. \"When you are against the financial interests you are a target,\" he said, explaining that the small farmers had no way to resist the intimidation of the land thieves, or grileiros from the Portuguese word for cricket. But here the crickets carry guns or arrive at the homes of peasants shaking handfuls of ammunition. \"The small ones cannot say no. If they do they eat bullets.\" Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva, Brazil's President, hoped to put an end to such violence. In a country where the poorest 20percent own just 2percent of the wealth, Lula campaigned during the 2002 election as a champion of environmental protection and promised to provide land for 400,000 landless peasants. Despite the devastating recession he inherited, he was also critical of taking international loans from groups such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). So far, Lula has failed to match rhetoric with deeds. Rather, say analysts, he has had to confront the political reality of Brazil's recession and the pressure for growth. As a result, instead of acting convincingly to protect the rainforest, he at least tacitly encouraged the development of it. In the days after the killing, Lula announced new logging restrictions and the establishment of 4 million hectares of new reserve. But nothing has altered the pressure to maintain economic growth and to maintain the jobs that the ranchers and others provide. Though he was opposed to an IMF loan, Lula inherited a decision made by his predecessor to take the $A39 billion which came with a series of stringent austerity demands and a requirement for Brazil to control the ratio between public debt and GDP, as well as to pay off its huge international debts. Last year Brazil's economy grew by 5.2percent. The Amazon is inextricably linked with Brazil's economy. Logging may only account for a fraction of Brazil's export earnings, but the rainforest is also a source of gold and minerals and has provided much of the land for the recent expansion in cattle production and agriculture. Agriculture, including the rapid increase in soy bean production, is now a $A194 billion business and accounts for more than 40percent of exports. Meanwhile, the country last year overtook the US as the world's biggest producer of beef. Annual overseas sales of beef earns Brazil $A3.2 billion. A recent paper by the council on Hemispheric Affairs, the independent, inter-American think-tank, said: \"The issue [of Brazil's environmental and economic situation] are interdependent and unfortunately, one's success is the other's loss.\" Around 15percent of Brazil's total external debt is owed to the IMF. When The Independent contacted the fund, a spokesman scoffed at the suggestion that fiscal requirements attached to its loan, such as the need for Brazil to produce a primary surplus of 4percent, in any way contributed to the struggle over land use in the rainforest. William Murray, a spokesman, said such a suggestion was \"outrageous\" and \"harebrained\". He said Brazil's economy was widely diversified and the country's \"economic growth [was] not significantly linked to logging\". \"Deforestation is not something we support. It never has been.\" Others see the situation differently. Carlos Rittl, a Brazilian-based Greenpeace campaigner, said there were historically two important debts faced by the Lula administration. \"One is the international debt and the other is the social debt,\" he said. \"Both are very important but it seems the international one is more urgent. This causes all the problems we face in the Amazon. Policies to pay external debts promote the development of agriculture and cattle ranching, which are quickly advancing into the heart of the Amazon. This is increasing forest destruction and causing social disruption.\" Stang wanted it both ways. The white-haired woman believed it was possible to use the forest's resources without destroying it. She was an outspoken champion of sustainable development. She promoted reforestation and worked to educate local people about the rainforest and its value. She tried to make them feel they had a stake in its survival. She also tried by every means she could to obtain land for small farmers and to help them and their families make a living. \"I don't know what she was not involved with,\" said her brother, David Stang, who recently travelled to Anapu from Colorado to visit his sister's grave. \"I'm very proud. I never dreamed she did so much.\" In theory at least, Dorothy Stang's views had the support of the Brazilian government. Everton Vargas, the country's foreign minister with responsibility for the environment, said his government's policy was based on sustainable development -a seemingly magical mixture that would allow economic growth without leading to deforestation.\"Promoting preservation when at the same time promoting economic growth and better social conditions for the people, you will imagine, is a very complex and difficult challenge,\" he said. \"There are no simple responses for this problem and for the challenges we have in that region.\" In regard to international pressure for growth, Vargas said that foreign debt had \"historically been an important pressure on Brazilian fiscal and economic policy\". He also said that US subsidies to products such as cotton were a factor on the development of land for agriculture. Another problem is the difficulty of policing so huge an area and the corruption within the police. -The Independent</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-3545045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FVS-NTV0-0045-5115-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"1793\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited</copyright><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>April 4, 2005 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000309</classCode><className>CLERGY &amp; RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000A0RH</classCode><className>CATHOLICS &amp; CATHOLICISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N111160MM</classCode><className>RICE FARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

North-westerly winds and the ridge topography generate the updrafts that transport hawks, eagles and falcons southwards over the ranges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alarmed at the decimation here of hawks by the merciless hunters of the day, in 1934 Rosalie Edge set up the world's first refuge for migratory birds. The aims of the non-profit Sanctuary Association have since widened to encompass the conservation of the central Appalachian environment. A private initiative has been harnessed to the public good - in the land where the pursuit of profit has been elevated to an art form.</p><p>Typically some 20,000 raptors of 14 species are tallied during the four-month autumn migration season, peaking about September/October. The reserve has also become a crossroads of naturalists: more than 80,000 people visit each year including many biologists, authors and artists of note.</p><p>Hawk Mountain Sanctuary's 963 hectacres straddle the Kittatinny Ridge, within three kilometres of Bill Bryson's never-ending nemesis, the Appalachian Trail. Panoramic views unfold from commanding overlooks, sharp-edged ledges of limestone - some looking on to densely forested valleys, others out over a very Germanic patchwork of fields, forests and streams. This is PennsylvaniaDutch country, and \"Dutch\" is a corruption of the original \"Deutsch\" or German.</p><p>Habitat gardens and a bird-watching hide near the visitor centre have been meticulously planned and planted out. A soaring eagle frozen in bronze honours charter members of the Sanctuary Association, whose membership has reached 8500.</p><p>At South Lookout, eager young interns (graduate trainees) in khaki ranger garb greet visitors who have made the short stroll uphill from the main gate. An engraved plaque set into a cairn depicts the silhouettes of species most likely to be seen soaring above. Amid the trees, high-rise timber \"restrooms\" complete with panoramic balcony views offer a wry amusement to the foreign visitor unused to such earnest attention to detail.</p><p>Across the valley below spreads the River of Rocks, a glacial boulder field reached by a rough, rocky train down from the ridge.</p><p>From South Lookout, the track forks out along the ridge line, one arm looping around the former quarry workings. On a busy autumn day, there may be close to 100 people at North Lookout, all armed with binoculars and telephoto lenses.</p><p>Some way further on, Sunset Overlook is reached after a boulder scramble. The peaceful landscape unfolding below recalls immediately those lush, populated valleys of western Europe's heartland: manicured tongues of forest, rectangular fields in variegated shades of emerald green, stitched into an agrarian quilt with the bare brown of fresh-ploughed land.</p><p>There are forest-rimmed river banks, distant ridges fading into the haze. Compact settlements - houses are no more than dots yet the church steeples remain distinct - appear at crossroads wherever the ridges part to offer a passage.</p><p>But the grandest views of all unfold from the 500 metre-high North Lookout, an escarpment commanding the valleys to the west, the forested Appalachian ridge stretching north east then the sweeping, shallow valleys to the south east, fecund farmlands unfolding a cornucopia of the fruits of the earth.</p><p>In spring there are relatively few birds of prey to be seen but city dwellers can revel in the fresh apple-green forest foliage. On the ground the grass is as soft as an overgrown lawn; moss covers many rocks. A fortunate few may spy the pink lady slipper, a delicate and endangered pitcher plant.</p><p>It takes precise timing to catch June's full-bloom display of native rhododendron and mountain laurel, the Pennsylvania state flower. Blooms or not, the deciduous forests are dazzlingly green - a dense mosaic of oak, maple, hemlock, beech and rhododendron. Small red berries adorn the bushes. Chipmunks scamper up and down tree trunks. Fallen leaves form a soft, dense floor. American robins, common flickers and blue jays all dart by.</p><p>Down in the valleys below, roadsides are fringed with the spheroidal heads of clover, en masse a pinkish purple haze, the day lily, a garden escapee distinguished by its tawny red colouring, and sweet peas, profuse in purple, indigo and white.</p><p>From the Sunset Overlook, golden strips of corn are now interleaved with the wedding cake layers of green below. Turkey vultures soar overhead, an extraordinary ugly bird at close quarters yet graceful in equal measure in its own element.</p><p>August, the beginning of the migration season, is traditionally heralded by the flight of the first bald eagle, that avian icon of America. By September, Hawk Mountain welcomes the arrival of ospreys and thousands of broad-winged hawks.</p><p>By returning in October to admire the autumn foliage as well as the migration flights, we may reasonably expect to witness the greatest variety of species, including sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks. Autumn colours are speckled but lightly across the hillsides: golden birch, rose-red maple. The leaves are mostly burnt orange, just waiting to fall and the effect is almost like the aftermath of a low-intensity bushfire in Australia.</p><p>Now the Sanctuary is crowded on weekends; arm-banded volunteers with walkie-talkies marshall traffic along the narrow main road. Forty or more eager bird-watchers crowd the boulders at North Lookout but today the changeable, gusty weather must have deflected the south-bound bird formations.</p><p>On a clear, crisp November Monday, I hope to experience the ridge-top in an agreeable solitude, before winter really sets in. No chance. It's cold enough to see your breath or to regret sitting still too long on a bare boulder, yet the car park is almost full and the trails are spotted with people; school groups and seniors are out in force.</p><p>Local newspapers are reporting an excellent start to the flight season after six years of mysterious no-shows. Once more I take to the trail to join 20-odd enthusiasts at North Lookout. November's chill winds should draw red-tailed hawks and golden eagles, yet today, despite calls of \"three birds ... four ... above number two ... just above the hump\" from hopeful voices, there never seems to be more than a solitary black dot visible with the naked eye. Nearest thing to a bird in sight is the plaster decoy on its pole like some pagan totem invoking the eagle spirit.</p><p>I'll pick my way instead to the Sunset Overlook, there to spend 10 minutes entranced by the gentle tapping of a black and white, red-crested woodpecker, which eventually thwarts me by retreating to utter instead a high-pitched chirp.</p><p>A young woman approaches cautiously: she is trying not to alarm the songbird but no, she can't confirm the bird's identity. For her this is just \"such a neat place to hang out\". The hacking cough of a ruddy-faced older man spoils our shared reverie. Both newcomers agree the autumn colours are not the best this year, probably because of the long, dry summer. Just a few specks of gold or rust remain to dispel the forest fire image. Where are these famous raptors? Better to have enjoyed a brief intimacy with a more humble songbird than squint in vain for these elusive monarchs of the skies.</p><p>FACT FILE</p><p>Hawk Mountain is north of Interstate 78 between Allentown and Harrisburg.

HOMEX - Melbourne - Half Yearly Report 3. EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES PPL 189 - Papuan Basin, PNG (14.141% Interest) During the half year, additional processing was undertaken on the 13 kilometre Pit Pit seismic line over the Barikewa gas field. The line ties the Barikewa-1 and 2 wells. A reassessment of other structural leads in the licence was completed and preparations were begun for a geological survey over the north-western part of Barikewa and the Kopi lead in southern most PPL 189. PPL 190 - Papuan Basin, PNG (10.535% Interest) During the half year, the landowner dispute over ownership of the Healy-1 drilling site remained unresolved. The Minister, at the request of the Joint Venture, suspended the licence conditions for a minimum of twelve months. Consequently, the Parker Rig 125, which was to drill Healy-1 was demobilised and an alternative rig will be used, possibly around mid year 1999. PPL 193 - Papuan Basin, PNG (7.5% Interest) In October 1998, Cue announced that it would earn a 7.5% interest in PPL 193 Papua New Guinea and would participate in the drilling of the Kimu-1 and Koko-1 wells. Subject to necessary PNG Government approvals, Cue is obtaining a 3.75% interest from Oil Search Limited and a 3.75% interest from Gedd Inc by paying 15% of the costs of drilling the Kimu-1 and Koko-1 wells up to a total Cue share of US$1.651 million.</p><p>Any drilling costs above a gross cost of US$11,006,667 for the two wells will be paid by Cue at its earned equity level of 7.5%. The Kimu-1 well spudded on 21st November 1998. Subsequent to the end of this half year Kimu-1 encountered a 32 metre gas column in the Alene sandstone. Drill Stem Test (DST) 1 was conducted over the interval 1620-1642 metres in the Alene sandstone using open hole straddle packers. The well flowed gas at a rate of 7.79mmscfg/d through a 0.5 inch choke with a well head flowing pressure of 1205psia. The well flowed with a draw-down of only 2.7 psi showing a highly productive sand with an interpreted permeability of approximately 8,000md. There was no pressure depletion as a result of the test with the initial pressure agreeing with the final shut-in pressure (2316.4psia). Samples taken during the course of the test will be analysed for compositional information. The results of the DST indicated that the Alene sandstone is a highly prolific gas producer at the Kimu location. Based on the results of the DST the Alene sandstone has the potential to produce at rates well above 50 mmscfg/d from an optimised well bore. Due to the small hole diameter in the Kimu well over the gas zone, which limits the ability to effectively produce gas, the well was plugged and abandoned. A series of pressure date points (SFT's) and sidewall cores were collected over the open hole interval. The pressure data indicated that the Kimu-1 well had penetrated a 32 metre gas saturated Alene interval with an interpreted gas/water contact coincident with the shale break at the base of the Alene sand at 1649 mKB. Updip potential remains at the Kimu location. Samples taken from the deeper intervals confirmed that the Toro, Hedinia and Iagifu sandstones were water saturated, however, one sample from the top of the Hedinia Sandstone at 1873.5 metres recovered formation water with an oil film. The wireline logging and DST program in the Kimu well has confirmed the well as a new gas field discovery in the Alene sandstone. Kimu-1 tested a prospect in the northern Omati Trough within the foreland basin of Papua New Guinea. The gas saturated Alene sandstone and the fluorescence noted in the Hedinia and Iagifu reservoirs while drilling and during sampling after the well reached total depth has confirmed the Omati Trough area as an active petroleum system. Kimu-1 is the first of a two well program in PPL193, Koko-1 will be drilled immediately following Kimu-1 and will test a large old structure on the leading edge of the Komewu Fault that bounds the southern margin of the Omati Trough. Koko-1 is located substantially updip and 28 kilometres west of Kimu-1. Subsequent to the end of the half year, Koko-1 was drilled to a total depth of 1,363 metres. Natural gas was recovered by wireline sampling from the Upper Hedinia Sandstone and natural gas and 200 cc of heavy oil were recovered from the Lower Imburu Sandstone. The well has been plugged and abandoned as a sub-commercial oil and gas discovery. The oil and gas accumulations defined in Koko-1 and the Kimu-1 gas discovery, demonstrate that an active and significant hydrocarbon charge is present in the Foreland of Papua New Guinea, which further upgrades the prospectivity of the licence and the eastern Foreland area as a whole. Additional studies will be required to fully understand the results of the Kimu-1 well and Koko-1 drilling program and the impact on hydrocarbon potential in this lightly explored area. PPL 194 - Papuan Basin, PNG (100% Interest) In November 1998, the Minister granted Toro Oil Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cue Energy Resources No Liability, Petroleum Prospecting Licence PPL 194 in the Papua New Guinea highlands. PPL 194 covers 6,200 square kilometres and is situated to the north east of the Paua and Moran oil fields in the central fold belt. Tanjung Jabung PSC - South Sumatra Basin, Indonesia (76% Interest) The Tanjung Jabung Production Sharing Contract is nearing the end of Contract year 2 (15 May 1999). The contract requires the expenditure of US$15.2 million on seismic and drilling in the initial three year period. Despite being content with its 42.2885% holding, during the half year, Cue involuntarily increased its not effective interest in the PSC from 42.2885% to 76% by virtue of a default by Wirabuana Petrolindo Ltd. At the end of the half year, the planned initial seismic survey had not been undertaken due to access being denied by the Department of Forestry and Plantation, to acquire seismic over the two most promising prospects which lie within the Berbak National Park. The Park occupies the most prospective portion of the contract area. The existence of the National Park was not disclosed at the time the Production Sharing Contract area was offered and was not known at the time of the award to the Joint Venture. The Berbak National Park is the first wet land area in Indonesia designated as a Wildlife Reserve and is bound by the Convention on Wetlands and on the Protection of Weiland Birds and other Migrating Birds. The National Park is home to some three hundred species of permanent and migrating birds as well as river mouth crocodiles, tapirs, rhinoceros and several species of monkeys. Within the National Park an integrated swamp development project is being funded by the World Bank and a forest fire control project has attracted international funding. The custodian of the National Park, the Department of Forestry and Plantation, has stated categorically that it will not grant a permit for any exploration (or exploitation activities within the National Park areas (see copy of translated letter attached). Cue is examining various options for its interest in the Production Sharing Contract, including the possibility of withdrawing from the Tanjung Jabung Joint Venture, in order to concentrate the Company's energy and resources on other areas that have more potential to increase shareholder value. Sampang PSC-Madura Strait, East Java, Indonesia (15% Interest) During the half year, a 564km in-fill grid of new seismic data was acquired in the contract area. Processing of the new 1998 seismic data and reprocessing of the existing seismic data continued during the half year. A biostratigraphic review of wells in the Sampang PSC area was completed and a geological field survey was conducted on Madura Island and onshore East Java. The survey was designed to examine selected rock outcrops and to sample oil and gas seeps to gather information that could impact on the prospectivity of the offshore Sampang block. EP 363 Carnarvon Basin - Western Australia (17.65% Interest) In July 1998, Apache Energy exercised an option to acquire an additional 25% interest in the permit. Apache will acquire its additional equity by paying 37% of the costs for the acquisition and processing of 3D marine seismic to a cap of AUD2 million. Apache also assumed operatorship of the permit as of 1st September 1998. As a result of the exercise of the option Cue's interest reduced from 25% to 17.65%. The Joint venture is considering the acquisition of non proprietary 3D seismic data over a significant portion of the permit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1999</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3W02-5X20-0048-T23H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1456\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1999 AAP Information Services Pty.

As TONY FEATHERSTONE reports, this could be a costly oversight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GO EAST young man, Eastern Europe that is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the roar of the Asian tigers beginning to slowly fade, this emerging market is letting off a scream so loud it has foreign investors flocking in droves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, if Eastern Europe is one of the world's few remaining investment frontiers, its cries of massive investment returns have, for the most part, fallen on deaf ears here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even local fund managers specialising in emerging markets have given it a tiny portfolio weighting, while most investors are more comfortable with Korea than the Czech Republic.</p><p>This may soon change, with bourses in Warsaw, Prague and Bratislava, having gone through gruelling corrections this year, rewarding investors with hefty returns.</p><p>For punters keen on Eastern Europe, it appears the markets have bottomed. But caution must still be exercised. Bourses there are young and volatile, the quality of investment information is generally poor, insider trading is still rife and currency risks major.</p><p>That's not to say sophisticated investors should overlook Eastern Europe, with smart operators finding ways to get solid exposure while minimising risk. \"In Eastern Europe it's like wildflowers coming up after a forest fire,\" says Tom Presby - in Australia for the international representatives meeting for Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu hosted recently by chief executive Ian Blair.</p><p>As the head of Deloitte and Touche Eastern Europe SA, Presby, having watched the downfall of communism, knows better than most the pitfalls and possibilities.</p><p>Investors at the Warsaw Stock Exchange earned around 2,000 per cent in 1993 and while some economies are slowing, most argue the boom on Eastern European bourses is far from over, despite being weaker this year.</p><p>\"It's not too late to make big opportunities or big mistakes there,\" says Presby. \"Both are still available in abundance.\"</p><p>But it's the volatility that concerns most. The Czech sharemarket, for instance, fell from a high of 1,002 points in May to around 560 points in November. The fast-moving Polish bourse hit 20,760 in March but is now languishing around 7,150, while the Hungarian exchange has jumped from 667 points in May to about 1,550 now.</p><p>Even debt-laden Russia has jumped from 100 points in December 1993 to around 1,000 in November. \"The potential for big profits is clearly there,\"says Presby.</p><p>\"But it's not for the faint-hearted. And it's certainly not for mum and dad investors.\"</p><p>Indeed, a vice-president at Bankers Trust Australia, Mark Burgess, says small investors should avoid Eastern European markets - or at least only place a small asset weighting there - in preference of Asian and Latin American economies.</p><p>\"The thing investors often forget,\" says Burgess, \"is that while Eastern Europe is an emerging market it's not like South-East Asia where the markets continue to grow.</p><p>\"The region is going through a major readjustment process and so growth is going to be much more volatile.\"</p><p>Burgess says the bourses may also be held back by an oversupply of privatisations as Eastern European Government rush to sell off their\"silverware\".</p><p>Certainly, research supplied by GT Management Australia shows the private sector's share of gross domestic product in Eastern Europe has soared since 1989.</p><p>In the Czech Republic and Russia, private involvement rocketed from below 10 per cent to more than 60 per cent, while Hungary and Poland have also roughly doubled in four years.</p><p>GT director Andrew Hutchings says cheap labour and infrastructure are behind much of this growth.</p><p>Indeed, average gross hourly wages range from US63c in Russia to $US2.35 in Slovenia, while cement at $US40 per tonne in Central Europe compares with$US162 in Western Europe.</p><p>GT Australia describes itself as an emerging economy specialist but has only 2 per cent of its emerging markets portfolio in Eastern Europe although this may rise to 5 per cent within a year.</p><p>\"There is a possibility for large speculative gains but there a number of risks in Eastern Europe that investors should not discount,\" Hutchings says. \"It is really only for speculators.\"</p><p>For those prepared to lose the lot in search of astronomical gains, the question is then whether you should should invest directly on an Eastern Europe bourse, buy shares in a company with a heavy focus on the region or go through a managed fund.</p><p>Deloitte's Tom Presby says punters should have an investment horizon of three to five years due to volatility.</p><p>He breaks the area down into three regions: the fast movers including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic which have attracted most investment; the slow movers like Romania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia; and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which includes Russia.</p><p>But in many of the economies it's not what you know but who you know, he explains. \"These companies often have information that investors are simply not privy to. You really should not even consider investing directly in an Eastern European company.\"</p><p>There are pitfalls, he says, in investing in Western companies doing business there.</p><p>Presby says investors should, for the most part, avoid companies involved in joint ventures there due to the high proportion that fail.</p><p>\"Many of these arrangements don't work because you have differing levels of expectations between the companies and different practices,\" Presby says, adding that Western companies are no longer legally obliged to form joint ventures.</p><p>\"You should only invest in a company that has its own people there calling the shots.\"</p><p>The Eastern European expert also says investors must consider carefully any purchases in formerly State- owned enterprises. Other commentators believe these organisations are \"genetically\" defective because of outdated business practices and vague accounting methods still deeply embedded in the culture. At the same time, implicit and explicit subsidies \"which are invisible to the naked eye\" may distort the organisation's true performance.</p><p>Another trap, Presby says, is investing in large ventures with long-run loss forecasts.</p><p>\"You have to be careful of anything big over there,\" he says. \"The difficulty of doing business is geometrically related to size. If something is twice as big in Central Europe, particularly Russia, it will usually be four times harder. And companies with big loss forecasts usually realise them. I have seen companies come in and agree to lose money as a matter of good faith. You really don't need to invest in a company with big future losses on its books.\"</p><p>It all gets down to having good people \"on the ground\" with a solid understanding of how Eastern European business is evolving, Presby says.</p><p>\"Success in this part of the world is directly related to your knowledge of the area.\"</p><p>So much so, that the only viable route for most investors appears to be managed funds, where experienced investment professionals do the legwork.</p><p>The problem is that there are no funds in Australia with a specific Eastern European bias, although many local investment houses have exposure through their emerging markets or European funds. There are, however, overseas funds that invest solely in Eastern Europe.</p><p>It's understood some players such as Morgan Stanley, First Boston, Credit Suisse, Baring Securities and Deutsche Bank are setting up Eastern European funds.</p><p>Some Austrian banks - due to their close ties to the region - have had funds in place for three years, most notably the GiroCredit Bank, Creditanstalt Bank and Bank Austria. *</p><p>DIVIDEND IMPUTATION</p><p>THE worked example in last week's report on imputation, while referring to the gross-up process, should have pointed out that tax at 21.4 per cent would be payable on the extra $330 notionally added to the investor's other income as a result of the gross-up.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: Ian Blair (left) and J.

From 1976 to 1980, it is estimated that the national deforestation rate was about 5,500 square kilometres a year.</p><p>Between 1981 and 1985, it climbed to 6,000 a year. More recently, rates of 7,000 square kilometres have been reported, and there are fears the rate may have gone as high 12,000 a year.</p><p>Fire is wreaking such devastation because more than just rainforest is burning, says Mr Phil Cheney, a forester with the CSIRO Bush Fire Unit in Canberra. Much of East Kalimantan, for instance, is covered by tropical grassland.</p><p>Normally, the grassland can retain enough moisture to stay green even through the dry season. But after three years of below-average rainfall, it's now bone dry.</p><p>\"The problem with the grassland is that it provides a source of fire running up to the rainforest,\" Mr Cheney says. Once a grassland blaze reaches the rainforest, it burns along the forest floor, fueled by dried leaves, dropped by the trees during the drought.</p><p>The persistent dry weather guarantees dry grasslands and stop scorched rainforests from regenerating. As a consequence, increasing numbers of thin-barked rainforest trees are killed.</p><p>As the trees die, more sunlight reaches the forest floor, encouraging potentially flammable grasses and shrubs to invade the rainforest in a process called \"conversion\".</p><p>Shifting agriculture, too, hastens conversion. Similarly, logging promotes conversion because fires burn through the \"slash\" left behind by loggers and grass and shrubs quickly fill the void.</p><p>Vast coal seams close to the surface also contribute to fire and conversion. \"These coal seams catch alight and can persist from year to year as a constant source of new ignitions,\" says Mr Peter Moore, a fire management expert with NSW State Forests.</p><p>Huge peat swamps are additional sources of \"ignition\", Mr Cheney says, with dry \"pockets\" of peat catching alight.</p><p>Peat and coal fires are hard to detect and stop since they often burn under the ground. Fire breaks to the surface through cracks in the soil, triggering a major fire.</p><p>Mr Moore says battling these Indonesian blazes is a two-stage process. First, the fires must be tackled and then a management strategy must be developed for fighting future outbreaks.</p><p>On the ground, firefighters face technical and organisational difficulties. For instance, many fires are virtually inaccessible.</p><p>Further, coal and peat fires can only be stopped by cutting off oxygen, using heavy earthmovers or sophisticated - and dangerous - systems for squirting fire-retardants underground.</p><p>Firefighting is further complicated by poor co-ordination, Mr Moore says.</p><p>\"Unlike NSW or other States, there is no structured force to fight fires and the training provided to people who do fight fires is not well organised,\"Mr Moore says.</p><p>This state of affairs is exacerbated by a thriving - and self-interested -logging industry. Logging concessions have been granted over about 540,000 square kilometres but because the concessions are granted for only 20 years -less than the 35-year harvest cycle - some loggers have used crude and destructive techniques, apparently because they think they are unlikely to be able to take a second harvest.</p><p>This, too, has promoted fires and conversion to grassland. Less than half of Indonesia's forest land (49 million hectares) is set aside as rain-catchment areas and parks in which, theoretically, no logging is permitted.</p><p>But 53.6 million hectares of prime tropical rain forest have been allocated to more than 540 logging companies, many run by ethnic Chinese businessmen with high-level political connections.</p><p>One of Indonesia's most prominent ethnic Chinese businessmen, Mr Prajogo Pangestu , has 5.5 million hectares of forest concession area. Another, Mr Bob Hasan , controls two million hectares.</p><p>Many concessionaires have been felling timber at an unsustainable rate, a problem that is only now being addressed.</p><p>As well, shifting cultivation by small landholders is on the rise. It is now the dominant form of agriculture - notably in Kalimantan - with an estimated one million families carrying it out.</p><p>Population pressure is another major threat. A 1989 World Bank study says half a million hectares are lost each year to agriculture as land-hungry settlers and shifting cultivators encroach on forests in Kalimantan, Sumatra and Irian Jaya.

So, in honour of Easter, we salute some</p><p>of the stars of the rabbit world.</p><p>THE EASTER BUNNY: Given that the Easter egg is the emblem of renewed</p><p>life after death and of resurrection, and the rabbit has always been</p><p>considered a symbol of, shall we say this politely, fertility, then</p><p>the northern hemisphere tradition of eggs and rabbit seem to be</p><p>associated with pre-Christian pagan spring festivals.</p><p>The rabbit symbolised birth in ancient Egypt. Chinese children</p><p>traditionally believe in a rabbit who lived in the moon and a</p><p>well-known legend in the East says that the future Buddha was once</p><p>born as a hare and offered his life to help a hungry Brahman. As a</p><p>reward he was transported to live on the moon, which, you will</p><p>remember, determines the date of Easter.</p><p>A German belief of a poor woman's dyed eggs being discovered by</p><p>children during a famine, just as a rabbit hopped away, further spread</p><p>the idea of rabbits bringing Easter eggs.</p><p>Nineteenth century Poland saw the advent of the chocolate Easter egg.</p><p>On behalf of the world's chocaholics, thank you.</p><p>THE WHITE RABBIT: Lewis Carroll's contribution to the world of bunnies</p><p>dates back to 1865 when the lecturer in mathematics at Oxford</p><p>published his classic story Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. His real</p><p>name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and he was shy and withdrawn, while</p><p>the real Alice was Alice Liddell, daughter of the dean of Christ</p><p>Church, whom he first met when he was 23 and she was a mere three</p><p>years old.</p><p>Preferring the platonic company of little girls, he enjoyed taking</p><p>them out and entertaining them with fantastic stories. On one such</p><p>excursion in 1862, the tale he told the then 10-year-old Alice would</p><p>include the character of the White Rabbit who took a watch out of its</p><p>waist-coat pocket. When Alice went after the bunny, a legendary story</p><p>would begin. It took eight months to write and was published at</p><p>Carroll's own expense.</p><p>Alice would later be courted by Prince Leopold, son of Queen Victoria,</p><p>and eventually marry one of the author's pupils, Reginald Gervis</p><p>Hargreaves. Carroll would write some 255 books on many subjects and</p><p>nearly 100,000 letters before his death in 1898, aged 66.</p><p>One probably apocryphal story tells of Queen Victoria requesting</p><p>another book by him, anticipating something as enchanting as</p><p>\"Alice,\" but receiving Dodgson's Syllabus of Plane Algebraical</p><p>Geometry instead. Presumably she would have remarked, \"We are not</p><p>amused\".</p><p>PETER RABBIT: Beatrix Potter was born in London in 1866 and her</p><p>sheltered early years were most happily relieved when she and her</p><p>brother would escape into the Scottish woods on the family's annual</p><p>holidays. This love of nature sustained her through a lonely childhood</p><p>and her first story The Tale of Peter Rabbit, was originally written</p><p>as a letter to a sick child. The classic tale sees the high-spirited</p><p>bunny disobey his mother and almost end up as rabbit pie. You probably</p><p>remember the names of the other three rabbits _ Flopsy, Mopsy and</p><p>Cotton-tail _ who lived with their mother under the root of a very big</p><p>fir-tree. You'll have to read the book to know what happened next.</p><p>OSWALD THE RABBIT: Before Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, there was</p><p>the lesser-known Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Born out of a desire to</p><p>compete with the highly successful Felix the Cat series, the Disney</p><p>studio came up with a black rabbit that bore a not-so-coincidental</p><p>resemblance. Early in 1927, Universal Pictures released the first of a</p><p>project series of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons, called Trolley</p><p>Troubles. Initially mistakenly identified as Oscar the Rabbit, the</p><p>cartoon received rave reviews and merchandising soon followed.</p><p>According to their contract, though, the name Oswald and the tag \"The</p><p>World's Luckiest Rabbit\" belonged to the Winkler Film Corporation.</p><p>Faced with defeat, Walt relinquished all claims to the Oswald</p><p>character and went on to create a new character based on a real mouse</p><p>that used to live in his old Kansas City office. Wald thought to call</p><p>him Mortimer, but his wife, Lillian, suggested Mickey instead,</p><p>insisting Mortimer sound \"too sissy.\" Showbiz history has recorded</p><p>which character became the more successful.</p><p>THUMPER THE RABBIT: The Disney studio was in trouble by early 1944,</p><p>with no features scheduled and the 1942 release of Bambi proving a</p><p>disappointment at the box office. Described by one wag as \"the</p><p>ultimate stag movie,\" the anthropomorphic cartoon feature created a</p><p>great comic character in Thumper the Rabbit and a genuinely thrilling</p><p>climatic forest fire. It took a few years, but the film eventually</p><p>made money, earning $2,000,000 on its re-release in 1957, vindicating</p><p>Walt's faith in it.</p><p>CRUSADER RABBIT: The creators of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Jay Ward and</p><p>Alexander Anderson, originated the long-eared rabbit, Crusader, and</p><p>pal Ragland (Rags) P. Tiger in 1948, becoming the \"first cartoon</p><p>serial\" and \"first limited animation series\" made for television.</p><p>Test marketed on local US TV stations that year, the series went</p><p>nationwide the following year. Initially, 130 five-minute</p><p>cliff-hanging episodes were produced in the 1949-51 series, while a</p><p>new color serious was produced in 1957. Episode titles included</p><p>\"Tales of Schmerwood Forest\" \"Apes of Rath,\" and \"Gullible's</p><p>Travels.\"</p><p>HARVEY: James Stewart earned an Oscar best-actor nomination for his</p><p>portrayal of Elwood P. Dowd, a middle-aged drunk with an imaginary six</p><p>foot three inch invisible rabbit friend named Harvey, in the 1950</p><p>movie of the same name. As Elwood, James describes his first meeting</p><p>with Harvey in this way: \"I'd just helped Ed Hickey into a taxi. Ed</p><p>had been mixing his drinks, and I felt he needed conveying. I started</p><p>to walk down the street when I heard a voice saying: \"Good evening,</p><p>Mr Dowd.\" I turned, and there was this big white rabbit leaning</p><p>against a lamp post. Well, I thought nothing of that! Because when</p><p>you've lived in a town as long as I've lived in this one, you get used</p><p>to the fact that everybody knows your name...\"</p><p>Stewart also tells his doctor, \"I've wrestled with reality for 35</p><p>years, and I'm happy, doctor, I finally won out over it.\"</p><p>THE \"WATERSHIP DOWN\" COLONY: Nature-loving novelist Richard Adams,</p><p>originally a civil servant, scored a smash hit with his 1972 tale of a</p><p>colony of rabbit who seek a new home following a vision of the</p><p>destruction of their warren. The 1978 animated film version featured</p><p>the voices of celebrities such as John Hurt (Hazel), Richard Briers</p><p>(Fiver), Sir Ralph Richardson (Chief Rabbit), Denholm Elliott</p><p>(Cowslip), Zero Mostel (Kehaar) and Nigel Hawthorne (Campion). Art</p><p>Garfunkel also sang two songs.</p><p>ROGER RABBIT: The star of the 1988 movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</p><p>proved endearing, but nowhere near as memorable as the sexiest cartoon</p><p>character ever in Jessica Rabbit, voiced by Kathleen Turner (speaking)</p><p>and Amy Irving (singing). Some disrespectfully dubbed the flick \"Who</p><p>Rogered Jessica Rabbit?\". Frank Sinatra played the Singing Sword and</p><p>Mel Blanc voiced Daffy Duck in this unparalleled technical achievement</p><p>for its time.</p><p>BUGS BUNNY: Voiced by Mel Blanc as well, this wise-cracking cartoon</p><p>character first appeared in A Wild Hare in 1940, but evolved from a</p><p>rabbit seen in the 1937 Pork's Hare Hunt. One of Bug's creators</p><p>claimed that the character was inspired by the sight of Clark Gable</p><p>eating a carrot in the smash film, It Happened One Night from 1934.</p><p>However it happened, his catchphrase, \"what's up Doc?\" and his</p><p>ability to maintain his aplomb in all situations has contributed to</p><p>his ongoing popularity. He even became an Oscar winning rabbit for</p><p>real in 1958 with Knightly Knight Bugs, putting an Academy Award on</p><p>his burrow's mantel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-MER9804070027027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOBARTMERCURYLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:459P-KK20-0197-T3V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1386\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>April 7, 1998, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XN1</classCode><className>EASTER SEASON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp; OBSERVANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000092</classCode><className>ANIMAL WELFARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But sometimes it can be hard to see the wood for the burning trees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why is it that some societies in the past collapsed while others did not? I am thinking of such famous collapses as those of the Anasazi in the south-west United States, C lassic Maya civilisation in the Yucatan, Easter Island society in the Pacific, Angkor Wat in South-East Asia, Great Zimbabwe in Africa and Fertile Crescent (a strip of land stretching from Jordan to Iraq) and Harappan Indus Valley societies. These are all societies that we've realised, from archaeological discoveries in the past 20 years, hammered away at their own environments and destroyed themselves in part by undermining the resources on which they depended.</p><p>For example, the Easter Islanders Polynesian people settled an island that was originally forested, and whose forests included the world's largest palm tree. They gradually chopped down that forest to use the wood for canoes, firewood, transporting statues, raising statues and carving. Eventually they felled the forests to the point where all the tree species were extinct, which meant they ran out of canoes and could no longer erect statues. There were no more trees to protect the topsoil against erosion, and their society collapsed in an epidemic of cannibalism that left 90 per cent of the islanders dead.</p><p>The question that most intrigued my students was one that I, a geography professor, hadn't registered: how could a society make such an obviously disastrous decision as to cut down the trees on which they depended? For example, my students wondered, what did the Easter Islanders say as they were cutting down the last palm tree? Were they saying: \"Think of our jobs as loggers, not these trees\"? Were they saying: \"Respect my private property rights\"?</p><p>Surely they must have realised the consequences of destroying their own forest. It wasn't a subtle mistake. One wonders whether if anybody is still around 100 years from now people in the next century will be as astonished about our blindness as we are about that of the Easter Islanders.</p><p>This question why do societies make disastrous decisions and destroy themselves? also astonishes professional historians. The most cited book on the subject is The Collapse of Complex Societies, by the historian Joseph Tainter . He rejected the possibility that these might be due to environmental mismanagement because it seemed so unlikely to him. \"As it becomes apparent to the members or administrators of a complex society that a resource base is deteriorating,\" he wrote, \"it seems most reasonable to assume that some rational steps are taken towards a resolution. With their administrative structure and their capacity to allocate labour and resources, dealing with adverse environmental conditions may be one of the things that complex societies do best. It is curious that they would collapse when faced with precisely those conditions that they are equipped to circumvent.\"</p><p>Yet it is now clear that those ancient societies did make bad mistakes.</p><p>My students, and Tainter, identified a surprising phenomenon: namely, failures of group decision-making on the part of whole societies, or governments, or smaller groups, or businesses, or university academic departments. The question of failure of group decision-making is similar to that of failures of individual decision-making. Individuals make bad decisions they enter bad marriages, they make bad investments, their businesses fail. But there are some additional factors in failures of group decision-making notably, conflicts of interest among the members of the group.</p><p>I suggest there is a road map of four factors in failures of group decision-making. First, a group may fail to anticipate a problem. Second, when the problem arrives, the group may fail to perceive it. Third, after they perceive the problem, they may fail even to try to solve it. Finally, they may try to solve it but may fail.</p><p>The first item is that groups may do disastrous things because they don't anticipate a problem. There may be several reasons for this. One is that they may have had no experience of such problems, and so may not have been sensitised to the possibility. For example, consider forest fires in the American west. My family spends parts of the summer in Montana and, each year when we fly there, I look out the plane window to see how many forest fires there are.</p><p>Forest fires on that giant scale are unknown in the eastern US and in Europe. When settlers from those places arrived in Montana and a forest fire arose, their reaction was to try to put out the fire. The motto of the US Forest Service for nearly a century was: our goal is that every forest fire will be put out by 10 the morning after the day it is reported.</p><p>Easterners and Europeans had that attitude about forest fires because they had no previous experience of them in a dry environment where there's a big build-up of fuel. The idea that you should let a fire burn, and destroy valuable forest, was so counter-intuitive that it took the US Forest Service 100 years to realise the problem and to change strategy.</p><p>That's not the only reason, though, why a society may fail to anticipate a problem. Another is that they may have had experience but forgotten it. For example, a non-literate society is not going to preserve oral memories of something that happened long ago. The Classic Lowland Maya eventually succumbed to drought about AD800. There had been previous droughts in the Maya realm, but the Maya could not draw on that experience because, although they had some writing, it preserved only the conquests of kings, not droughts. Maya droughts recurred at intervals of 208 years, so the Maya in AD800 could not remember the drought of AD592.</p><p>Even in modern literate societies, we don't necessarily draw on our experience. We, too, tend to forget things. Americans, for example, behave as if they've forgotten the 1973 Gulf oil crisis. For a year or two after the crisis, they avoided petrol-guzzling vehicles, then quickly forgot that knowledge.</p><p>In the 1960s, Tucson, in Arizona, went through a severe drought, and the citizens swore they would manage their water better. But, within a decade or two, Tucson was back to its water-greedy ways of building golf courses and watering gardens.</p><p>The remaining reason why a society might fail to foresee a problem involves reasoning by false analogy. When we are in an unfamiliar situation, we fall back on reasoning by analogy with familiar situations. That's a good way to proceed if the old and new situations are truly analogous. But reasoning by analogy can be dangerous if the old and new situations are only superficially similar.</p><p>An example was the society of Norwegian Vikings who started settling in Iceland circa AD871. Their familiar homeland had heavy clay soils ground up by glaciers. Those soils were heavy enough that, if the vegetation covering them was cut down, they would not be blown away. Unfortunately for the Viking colonists of Iceland, Icelandic soils were as light as talcum powder. They arose not through glacial grinding, but through winds carrying light ashes blown out in volcanic eruptions.</p><p>The Vikings cleared the forests over those soils in order to create pasture for their animals. Unfortunately, the ash that was light enough for the wind to blow in was light enough for the wind to blow out again when the covering vegetation had been removed. Within a few generations of the Vikings' arrival in Iceland, half of the island's topsoil had eroded into the ocean.</p><p>The second step in my road map involves a society's failure to perceive a problem that has arrived. There are at least three reasons for this, all of them common in the business world and in academia. First, the origins of some problems are literally imperceptible. For example, the nutrients responsible for soil fertility are invisible to the eye, and only in modern times measurable by means of chemical analysis.</p><p>In Australia, French Polynesia, parts of the south-west US and many other locations, most of the nutrients had already been leached out of the soil by rainfall. People arrived and began growing crops, which quickly exhausted the remaining nutrients, so that agriculture rapidly failed. Yet such nutrient-poor soils often bear apparently lush vegetation; it's just that most of the nutrients in the ecosystem are contained in the vegetation rather than in the soil, so that the nutrients are removed when the vegetation is cut down. There is no way the first colonists of Australia and French Polynesia could have noticed that problem.</p><p>An even more common reason for a society's failure to perceive a problem is that it may take the form of a slow trend concealed by fluctuations. The prime example in modern times is global warming. We now realise that world temperatures have been slowly rising in recent decades, due in large part to changes in the atmosphere caused by humans. However, it is not the case that the climate grows inexorably warmer each year. Instead, it fluctuates widely and unpredictably from year to year: three degrees warmer in one summer than the previous summer, then two degrees warmer the next, down four degrees the following summer, and so on.</p><p>It takes a long time to discern the upwards trend within that noisy signal. That's why it was only a few years ago that the last professional climatologist who was sceptical about global warming became convinced. The medieval Greenlanders had similar difficulties in recognising that the climate was becoming colder, and the Maya of the Yucatan could not discern that the climate was becoming drier.</p><p>Politicians use the term \"creeping normalcy\" to refer to such slow trends concealed within noisy fluctuations. If a situation is very slowly getting worse, it is difficult to recognise that this year is worse than last year, and each successive year is only slightly worse than the year before, so that one's baseline standard for what constitutes \"normalcy\" shifts almost imperceptibly. lt may take a few decades of a long sequence of such slight year-to-year changes before someone suddenly realises that conditions were much better several decades ago, and that what is accepted as normalcy has crept downwards.</p><p>The other frequent reason for failure to perceive a problem after it has appeared is distant managers, a potential problem in any large society. For example, the largest private landowner (and largest timber company) in Montana is based not in that state but in Seattle, Washington. Not being on the scene, company executives may not realise that they have a big weed problem on their forest property.</p><p>The third step in my road map of failure is perhaps the most common and most surprising one: a society's failure to even try to solve a problem that it has noticed. Such failures frequently arise because of what economists term \"rational behaviour\" arising from clashes of interest between people.</p><p>Some people may reason correctly that they can advance their own interests by behaviour that is harmful for other people. Economists label such behaviour as \"rational\", even while acknowledging that, morally, it may be naughty. The perpetrators are often likely to get away with their rational bad behaviour because the winners from the bad status quo are typically concentrated (few in number) and highly motivated by the big, certain and immediate profits they will receive. The losers are diffuse (the losses are spread over large numbers of individuals) and are unmotivated because they receive only small, uncertain, distant profits from undoing the rational bad behaviour of the minority.</p><p>A characteristic of rational bad behaviour is, to put it bluntly, \"selfishness\". A few individuals may correctly perceive their self-interests to be opposed to that of the majority. For example, until 1971, mining companies in Montana typically dumped their toxic wastes of copper and arsenic directly into rivers and ponds because the state had no law requiring mining companies to clean up after abandoning a mine.</p><p>After 1971, Montana did pass such a law, but mining companies discovered that they could extract the valuable ore and then declare bankruptcy before going to the expense of cleaning up. The result has been billions of dollars of clean-up costs borne by taxpayers. The mining companies had correctly perceived that they could advance their interests and save money by making messes and leaving the burden to society.</p><p>One particular form of such clashes of interest has received the name \"tragedy of commons\". That refers to a situation in which many consumers are harvesting a communally owned resource (such as fish in the ocean, or grass in common pastures), and in which there is no effective regulation of how much of the resource each consumer can draw off.</p><p>Under those circumstances, each consumer can correctly reason: \"If I don't catch that fish or graze that grass, some other fisherman or herder will anyway, so it makes no sense for me to be careful about overfishing or overharvesting.\" The correct rational behaviour is to harvest before the next consumer can, even though the end result is depletion or extinction of the resource, and hence harm for society as a whole.</p><p>Rational behaviour involving clashes of interest also arises when the consumer has no long-term stake in preserving the resource. For example, much commercial harvesting of tropical rainforests is carried out by international logging companies which lease land in one country, cut down all its rainforest and then move on to the next country.</p><p>The international loggers have correctly deduced that once they have paid for the lease, their interests are best served by clear-cutting the rainforest on their leased land. In that way, loggers have destroyed most of the forest of the Malay Peninsula, then of Borneo, then of the Solomon Islands and Sumatra, now of the Philippines and, coming up soon, of New Guinea, the Amazon and the Congo Basin. In this case, the bad consequences are borne by the next generation, which cannot vote or complain.</p><p>A further situation involving rational behaviour and conflicts of interest arises when the interests of the decision-making elite conflict with the interests of the rest of society. The elite is particularly likely to do things that profit it but hurt everybody else, if it can insulate itself from the consequences.</p><p>Such failures to solve perceived problems are less likely in societies where the elite cannot do this. For example, the country with the highest proportion of citizens belonging to environmental organisations is the Netherlands. I never understood why, until I visited the Netherlands a few years ago and raised this question to my Dutch colleagues as we were driving through the countryside.</p><p>My Dutch friends answered: \"Just look around you and you will see the reason. The land where we are now is 6.5 metres below sea level. Like much of the area of Holland, it was once a shallow bay of the sea that we Dutch people surrounded by dikes and then drained with pumps to create low-lying land that we call a polder. We have pumps to pump out the water that is continually leaking into our polders through the dikes. If the dikes burst, of course, the people in the polder drown. But it is not the case that the rich Dutch live on top of the dikes, while the poor Dutch are living down in the polders. If the dikes burst, everybody drowns, regardless of whether they are rich or poor.</p><p>\"That was what happened in the terrible floods of February 1, 1953, when nearly 2000 Dutch people drowned. After that disaster, we all swore `never again' and spent billions of dollars building reinforced barriers against the water. In the Netherlands, the decision-makers know that they cannot insulate themselves from their mistakes.\"</p><p>In contrast to that so-called rational behaviour, there are also failures to attempt to solve problems that economists consider \"irrational behaviour\"; that is, harmful for everybody.</p><p>Such irrational behaviour often arises when we are torn by clashes of values within us all. We may be strongly attached to a bad status quo because it is favoured by some deeply held value that we admire.</p><p>Religious values are especially deeply held and hence are frequent causes of disastrous behaviour. For example, much of the deforestation of Easter Island had a religious motivation to obtain logs to transport and erect the giant stone statues that were the basis of religious cults.</p><p>Irrational failures to try to solve perceived problems also frequently stem from clashes between the short-term and long-term motives of the same individual.</p><p>Billions of people in the world today are desperately poor and able to think only of food for the next day. Poor fishermen in tropical reef areas use dynamite and cyanide to kill and catch reef fish in full knowledge that they are destroying their future livelihood, but they feel that they have no choice.</p><p>Governments, too, regularly operate on a short-term focus: they feel overwhelmed by imminent disasters and pay attention only to those problems on the verge of explosion. For example, a friend who is closely connected to the current US Administration told me that when he visited Washington for the first time after the 2000 elections, Government leaders had what he termed a \"90-day focus\": they talked about only those problems with the potential to cause a disaster within the next 90 days.</p><p>Economists rationally justify these irrational focuses on short-term profits by \"discounting\" future profits. That is, they argue that it may be better to harvest a resource today than to leave some of the resource for harvesting tomorrow, because the profits from today's harvest could be invested, and the accumulated interest between now and a harvest of that same quantity of resource in the future would make today's harvest more valuable than the future harvest.</p><p>The last reason for irrational failure to try to solve a perceived problem is psychological denial. If something you see arouses an unbearably painful emotion, you may subconsciously suppress or deny your perception in order to avoid the unbearable pain, even though the practical results of ignoring your perception may prove disastrous. The emotions most often responsible are terror, anxiety and sadness.</p><p>For example, consider a narrow deep river valley below a high dam, such that if the dam burst, the resulting flood would drown people for a long distance downstream. When pollsters ask people downstream of the dam how concerned they are about its bursting, it's not surprising that that fear is lowest far downstream and increases among residents closer to it.</p><p>Surprisingly, though, the people living immediately under the dam who are certain to be drowned if it bursts profess unconcern. That is because of psychological denial: the only way for them to preserve their sanity is to deny the finite possibility that it could burst.</p><p>Psychological denial is a phenomenon well established in individual psychology. It seems likely to apply to group psychology as well. For example, there is much evidence that, during World War II, Jews and other groups at risk of the developing Holocaust denied the accumulating evidence that it was happening and that they were at risk, because the thought was unbearably horrible. Psychological denial may also explain why some collapsing societies fail to face up to the obvious causes of their collapse.</p><p>The last of the four items in my road map is the failure to solve a problem. There are obvious possible explanations for such an outcome. The problem may be too difficult, and beyond our capacities to solve. Or our efforts are too little, too late.</p><p>For example, Australia has suffered tens of billions of dollars of agricultural losses, as well as the extinction or endangerment of most of its native small mammal species, because of the introduction of European rabbits and foxes for which there was no close native counterpart. Foxes prey on lambs and chickens and kill native small marsupials and rodents.</p><p>Foxes have been widespread over the Australian mainland for more than a century, but until recently they were absent from Tasmania, because they could not swim across the wide, rough seas of Bass Strait.</p><p>Unfortunately, two or three years ago, some individuals surreptitiously and illegally released 30-odd foxes on the island, either for their fox-hunting pleasure or to spite environmentalists. Those foxes represent a big threat to local lamb and chicken farmers, as well as to wildlife. When Tasmanian environmentalists became aware of this problem early last year, they begged the Government to exterminate the foxes quickly, while it was still possible. The fox-breeding season was expected to begin within a few months.</p><p>Once the foxes had produced litters and once those litters had dispersed, it would be far more difficult to eradicate 120 of them. Unfortunately, the Tasmanian Government debated and delayed, and it was not until last June that the Government decided to commit $1 million to eliminating the foxes. By that time, there was a considerable risk that the commitment of money was too little and too late, and that the Government would be faced with a far more expensive and less solvable problem.</p><p>These reasons for making disastrous decisions may sound pessimistic, as if failure is the rule in human decision-making. Of course, that is not the case. Many human societies have anticipated, perceived, tried to solve, or succeeded in solving, their environmental problems. For example, the Inca Empire, New Guinea Highlanders, 18th-century Japanese, 19th-century Germans and the paramount chiefdom of Tonga all recognised the risks that they faced from deforestation, and all adopted successful reforestation or forest management policies.</p><p>By recognising the signposts of failed decision-making, I hope, we may become more consciously aware of how others have failed, and of what we need to do in order to get it right.</p><p>Jared Diamond is professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of Guns, Germs, and Steel (W.

Bain</p><p>recalls how he read the literature on hydrogen.</p><p>\"Invariably,\" he says, \"the topic of Hindenburg would come up. At</p><p>the time, I didn't think a lot about it.\"</p><p>Over the years, however, as he continued his NASA work on hydrogen</p><p>systems, the references began to accumulate in his mind.</p><p>\"What I was starting to notice was that the authors were</p><p>inconsistent,\" he says. Hydrogen detractors said the gas was so</p><p>flammable it killed everyone on Hindenburg, which was not true: about</p><p>one-third of those aboard died.</p><p>\"On the other hand, hydrogen promoters rubbished safety concerns and</p><p>claimed that those who perished did so only because they jumped from</p><p>the burning airship, which also was not true.</p><p>\"I thought, 'wait a minute! Where are they getting their</p><p>information'?\"</p><p>Bain had also seen the famous photos of Hindenburg's bright,</p><p>blistering, hot fire and knew that hydrogen did not burn that way.</p><p>A hydrogen fire radiates little heat and is barely visible to the</p><p>unaided eye.</p><p>As a hydrogen expert, he knew that the pure gas does not explode. That</p><p>was enough. He donned a pair of protective gloves, and lost himself in</p><p>decades-old original documents in Washington's National Air and Space</p><p>Museum.</p><p>His research soon became something of a obsession.</p><p>He speculated that, perhaps, some of the airship's materials had</p><p>played a role in ignition. But, maddeningly, he could not find the</p><p>exact formulations used.</p><p>\"I had the idea of the problem, but needed enough evidence to back up</p><p>my story,\" Bain says.</p><p>That was as far as he went, until 1994, when he ran into Space Shuttle</p><p>technician Richard van Treuren, at a conference on hydrogen. Van</p><p>Treuren was a self-avowed \"helium head\" and member of the airship</p><p>aficionados' group called the Lighter-Than-Air Society, in Akron,</p><p>Ohio.</p><p>Through van Treuren, Bain learnt that pieces of Hindenburg's skin</p><p>still existed. Bain went throughout the US to procure them, also</p><p>spending hundreds of dollars buying original materials, books and</p><p>papers.</p><p>\"What I was trying to find out,\" he says, \"was what did they use</p><p>specifically in the coating?\"</p><p>Hepburn Walker, who had been stationed at Lakehurst in the early</p><p>1940s, was among those with pieces of Hindenburg. Walker had found</p><p>them in the soil. Another sample, a part of the swastika painted on</p><p>Hindenburg's side, was kept in a safe by Cheryl Gantz, head of the</p><p>Zeppelin Collectors Club in Chicago.</p><p>Materials in hand, Bain headed to NASA's Materials Science Laboratory</p><p>at nearby Kennedy Space Centre. Over the next 14 months, he carefully</p><p>laid out a systematic testing protocol involving about 14 researchers</p><p>who volunteered their spare time to assist in what became known as</p><p>Project H.</p><p>What was in that fabric? An infra-red spectograph and a scanning</p><p>electron microscope provided, respectively, the chemical signatures of</p><p>the organic compounds and elements present.</p><p>A startling variety of highly flammable compounds proved to have been</p><p>added to the cotton fabric base.</p><p>\"They used a cellulose acetate of nitrate as a typical doping</p><p>compound, which is flammable to begin with a forest fire is a</p><p>cellulose fire,\" says Bain.</p><p>\"OK, you coat that with cellulose nitrate nitrate is used to make</p><p>gunpowder.</p><p>\"And then you put (on) aluminium powder. Now, aluminium powder is a</p><p>fuel used in the solid rocket boosters on the Space Shuttle.\"</p><p>The wood spacers and fibrous ramie cord used to bind the structure</p><p>together, along with the silk and other fabrics in the ship, also</p><p>would have added to the fuel-rich inferno. Even the duralumin support</p><p>framework of Hindenburg's rigid skeleton was coated with lacquer,</p><p>ostensibly to protect it from moisture.</p><p>In a flame test, a fabric section ignited and burnt readily. The arc</p><p>test, in which 30,000 volts were zapped across a piece of fabric</p><p>several centimetres along, was even more revealing.</p><p>\"Poof, it disappeared. The whole thing happened faster than I can</p><p>explain it,\" Bain says. \"I guess the moral of the story is, don't</p><p>paint your airship with rocket fuel.\"</p><p>However, Bain is quick to point out it is not that the Germans and</p><p>other airship and aircraft makers of the era were simply foolish in</p><p>doping the fabric the way they did. They had a number of technical</p><p>problems to solve using the materials of the time.</p><p>The cotton or linen fabric skin was swabbed with the chemicals to make</p><p>it taut and reduce flutter for aerodynamics, and then painted with the</p><p>reflective red iron oxide and aluminium so the sun's heat would not</p><p>expand the gas in the cells, to help prevent gas escaping.</p><p>\"I'm not saying hydrogen didn't contribute to the fire,\" adds Bain.</p><p>It is, after all, a fuel, he notes and one he is hoping will develop</p><p>into a replacement or supplement to natural gas.</p><p>\"But it was a fuel-rich fire already, the hydrogen just added to</p><p>it.\"</p><p>Decades of speculation about the causes behind the start of the</p><p>zeppelin fire are academic, he says. All have blamed hydrogen, with</p><p>various ideas about how the gas became free and ignited.</p><p>One popular theory has it that a wire punctured a gas cell. Bain finds</p><p>this doubtful.</p><p>\"If that happened, it should have occurred during one of the final</p><p>manoeuvres.\" But, he says, the ship was stationary for four minutes</p><p>before fire was evident.</p><p>What about the possibility of loose hydrogen from the vents? Hydrogen</p><p>was released to help maintain level flight, and others have theorised</p><p>that a valve may have stuck open.</p><p>Bain says Hindenburg had an excellent venting system, with vents</p><p>between cells that measured about 60cm high and 200cm wide.</p><p>If hydrogen accumulated difficult to imagine for the lightest</p><p>element, which has the greatest dispersal rate in the universe why,</p><p>he asks, were none of the fires observed at the vent sites on top of</p><p>the ship?</p><p>What is perhaps most stunning about Bain's research is that what he</p><p>has discovered comes 60 years after some German airship experts</p><p>already knew it. While visiting an archive in Germany, he copied two</p><p>1937 letters, handwritten in German, that had not been seen by earlier</p><p>investigators.</p><p>Their contents were revealed to Bain only after he returned to Florida</p><p>and had them translated. They were written by an electrical engineer</p><p>named Otto Beyerstock, who had incinerated pieces of Hindenburg fabric</p><p>during electrical tests conducted at the behest of the Zeppelin</p><p>company.</p><p>In the notes, Beyerstock testily dismissed the idea that hydrogen</p><p>could have started the fire, stating that it could only have been</p><p>caused by the fabric's flammability in a charged atmosphere.</p><p>\"I beg you to kindly inform me about the corrective measures to be</p><p>taken or that have already been taken,\" Beyerstock wrote to Zeppelin.</p><p>\"They knew,\" Bain says simply.</p><p>But soon after the Hindenburg disaster, and probably because of it,</p><p>the great zeppelins were removed from service.</p><p>None of what Bain has learnt has diminished his admiration for the</p><p>engineering achievement in creating the great airships.</p><p>\"With all due respect,\" he says, \"the Germans did a fantastic job.</p><p>\"I admire their technology.</p><p>\"It was just an unfortunate little flaw, just like the flaw on</p><p>Titanic and the flaw in Challenger,\" he says, referring to the</p><p>\"unsinkable\" ship's sulphurous, brittle steel and the Space</p><p>Shuttle's O-ring both of which failed under prevailing weather</p><p>conditions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV9801241044305916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEADVERTISERLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4597-JG90-0197-D34P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1414\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Advertiser</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>January 24, 1998, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DP5A</classCode><className>PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DROP</classCode><className>PROTECTIVE CLOTHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DROP</classCode><className>PROTECTIVE CLOTHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
