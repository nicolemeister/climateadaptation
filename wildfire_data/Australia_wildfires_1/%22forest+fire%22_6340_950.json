But Covid almost wiped him out What do you buy the Lloyd Cole fan who has all 16 albums spanning his 40-year career, besides a ticket to his upcoming Adelaide gig at Hindley Street Music Hall which they probably already have? The lyrics of their favourite track penned by Cole - handwritten by the British-born singer-songwriter himself, of course.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At 62, he is best known for his hits such as Perfect Skin, Forest Fire, Lost Weekend, Cut Me Down and Brand New Friend with Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, which formed in Glasgow in 1982 and seven years later disbanded.</p><p>During Covid he began transcribing the words to Commotions' songs and solo offerings - starting with the 1990 single No Blue Skies - \"in the attic every night for a couple of hours\" to keep from going under during Covid.</p><p>Asked how the global pandemic had impacted his art, Cole answers: \"I'm not sure, to be honest. I'm not sure. It did almost bankrupt me.\" Back from touring, Cole had set himself the task of writing a new album, when two months into Covid he realised he needed to pivot because \"selling records isn't really making money\".</p><p>That was when he joined crowd-funding site Patreon, offering subscribers access to guitar lesson videos, bootleg recordings and pages of his songwriting notebooks.</p><p>\"Without this page we would certainly have lost our house,\" Cole says on the site.</p><p>The handwritten lyrics which fans bought for themselves or as gifts also played a part in paying the mortgage. \"There were people willing to pay quite a lot of money for (handwritten lyrics) and I think possibly knowing they were keeping me afloat, helped,\" he says.</p><p>\"I very much lost the impetus on the record because of Covid and it was only when there was a definite light at the end of the tunnel in terms of us being able to get back to something like normality \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was only at that point that I was able to get back to working on the record.\" Experimenting with electronic music and even autotune, the eight-track On Pain, is Cole's 12th solo album. It was co-written with his former Commotions bandmates Neil Clark and Blair Cowan and produced by Chris Hughes, who has worked with Tears for Fears.</p><p>On Pain was to be called Pain And The Untrained Heart before Cole's son William told him it sounded \"like a bad Paul McCartney album title\".</p><p>\"And I said really? Oh gosh. So I should shorten it down,\" Cole says. \"And I think everybody issued a sigh of relief. I think nobody was willing to tell me.\" The title track, written not on an instrument but from a soundscape he made, is the opener to the album which could easily find a space in the ambient minimalism genre.</p><p>\"I want to stretch myself artistically. I want to extend the range of possibilities of what I can create,\" Cole says. \"I wanted to take the minimalist concept further. I wanted to make the simple songs simpler and I wanted to make the complex, denser and more complex.</p><p>\"The most experimental song on the new record is probably a song called Wolf and it's about eight minutes long. It's got all kinds of different textures and different sections to it. It's quite abstract at first, then it becomes quite rigid.\" At gigs, Cole has played it after the Commotions' 1984 debut single \"which is three minutes long and very concise\".</p><p>\"It's been going down very well on social media and people seem to be singling out that track,\" Cole says of Wolf, adding his fans are \"enjoying the new songs, as much as the old songs, although probably just to be kind to me\".</p><p>As for Coles' personal favourite on the new album, it's More Of What You Are, which he says is the expression of \"an idea that I've been playing with for almost 20 years\".</p><p>\"As we age we become more extreme and sometimes almost more of a caricature version of ourselves \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 our features become more extreme versions of what they are,\" he says, adding of the song itself: \"Presenting an extremely famous person late in life was attractive.\" It is something Cole, who, with floppy hair and in a turtleneck, was the thinking music fan's sex symbol in the 1980s (like Morrissey, but better looking and with less angst), sees in his own reflection.</p><p>As for his songwriting, Cole says it has matured, too. \"I'm a little bit more precise with my songwriting, for better or worse, and it may or may not be a good thing but I do take longer over songs these days,\" he says.</p><p>That said, Cole says Late Night, Early Town from his 2003 album Music in a Foreign Language is, in his opinion, his best songwriting.</p><p>\"I think I was able to express a feeling of what it's like to be on the road,\" he says. \"I was very pleased with that song.\" It sounds as though it will be among the set list at Cole's Adelaide gig which he says is not a greatest hits concert.</p><p>\"It's a show to try and represent the body of work and at the same time trying to make sure it's not the same as the last tour I did,\" he says.</p><p>For Adelaide that was at Dunstan Playhouse in late 2019. Before Covid. \"After every tour I always put a few songs to bed for a few years and get a few songs out of storage,\" Cole says, adding he knows fans will want to hear \"the songs they know\".</p><p>\"Obviously, when you've grown up with a song and you have an emotional attachment to it, it's probably going to excite you a bit more than the new song, but people seem to be enjoying the fact that we're trying to cover 40 years.</p><p>\"I do still have a Patreon page and it is a form of insurance really, for if I can't work.\" The handwritten lyrics are also still a thing too should you need an IOU Christmas present. On Pain is out now. Lloyd Cole is performing solo at Hindley Street Music Hall on Thursday, December 14, at 7.30pm.

industry\".</p><p>Forest Wind has given an assurance to Timber Queensland the project will invest the necessary resources to adopt best practice fire management and hazard reduction.</p><p>A spokeswoman noted Forest Wind and HQPlantations was working on fire reduction arrangements including adequate fuel management zones around each turbine, a hard stand area and regular reduction of fine fuels like dry grass.</p><p>She said Forest Wind has been regularly informing and consulting the company on the proposal going forward.</p><p>\"Timber Queensland supports the project ... as it can provide a range of mutual benefits for the timber industry and regional economy,\" the spokeswoman said.</p><p>She said the benefits were upgraded plantation roads, crossings, an increased skills base and more diversified economic activity.</p><p>\"The timber industry supports over 1800 direct jobs in Wide Bay and Timber Queensland will work with Governments and stakeholders such as Forest Wind to ensure its sustainable future and growth.\"</p><p>\"The good news for timber is that it is a renewable carbon friendly industry with strong potential for growth given increasing demand,\" Mr Stephens said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It has always provided the key information our field officers need to best target the release of new strains of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (formerly known as calicivirus) to growing, high-density rabbit populations.</p><p>Without this knowledge, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to provide the same levels of effectiveness of rabbit management programs to keep their population to about 15 per cent of the potential unmanaged population.</p><p>Yet again, it is our producers who will bear the brunt of the cost of Labor budget cuts to rabbit management.</p><p>The estimated cost of lost production for the beef, lamb and wool industries due to rabbit damage is estimated at $200 million across Australia, and $30 million for Victoria and Tasmania. This is far more when you add in the cost of damage to crops, and does not include the additional cost and time for producers to manage increased rabbit populations on their private land.</p><p>Rabbits also have a devastating impact on our environment. Competition with Australian fauna for food has placed hundreds of native species under threat.</p><p>Rabbit damage to land is also placing native flora under pressure, and causing incredible damage to the banks of our most vulnerable waterways.</p><p>These cuts to the things that matter to regional Victorians come on the back of more waste by Victorian Labor. The mounting number of projects in Melbourne with cost blowouts, or worse, proves Labor is corrupt and cannot manage projects. The state debt has risen to $171 billion.</p><p>That's $22 million of interest paid to the big banks each and every day. More than 2km of road a day. A major redevelopment upgrade at your local hospital or a new school.</p><p>Or the cuts to the agriculture budget could be reversed in just 20 days. Labor must think country people are bunnies if they think we don't see Victorians are paying for Labor's financial incompetence. \" Emma Kealy is a Victorian Nationals MP and opposition spokeswoman for agriculture</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-58309c9e000611eea85abf82f76f837e1cc54c822a642d5b94718d9c972dba3b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DD-Y3H1-JD3N-54M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 7, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CW</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

was under threat from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/world/canadian-wildfire-smoke-lingers-in-the-us/video/a\">worst wildfires in Canadian history.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the fires raged, a call went out to firefighters in Australia, South Africa, the US, Europe and South America for aid, and Gowrie Little Plain Rural Fire Brigade First Officer Martin Hogg was one of the 5000 personnel who put their hand up to help.</p><p>Every day, for 28 days, Mr Hogg would strap on a backpack full of water, food and firefighting tools and trudge through melted permafrost and thick pine marsh country to help his Canadian colleagues protect the small town.</p><p>It was a gruelling task, but one Mr Hogg savoured.</p><p>\"I wanted the experience,\" he said.</p><p>\"I wanted to learn how people fight fires in a different country and hopefully bring back new ideas that could help us with our fires.</p><p>\"The Canadians also helped us in the Darling Downs with our fires in 2019-20 and I wanted to return the favour.\"</p><p>A team 34 Queensland Fire and Emergency Services volunteers left Australia late on May 25 for the month-long assignment.</p><p>When they arrived at Rainbow Lake, the fire threatening the town was only about 3 per cent contained, so they got to work.</p><p>The melting permafrost had turned the area to a swampy mess so it was almost impossible to get trucks into the affected area.</p><p>This meant most of the work had to be done on foot.</p><p>\"There were days when I was out for 10-12 hours where I had to carry everything I needed for my back,\" Mr Hogg said.</p><p>To further complicate matters, the area was home to large sections of peat marsh that would smoulder for days, often transferring fire underground and outside containment lines.</p><p>\"The fire sneaks underground then goes straight up the pine trees, then the trees explode,\" Mr Hogg said.</p><p>Despite the unfamiliar conditions, Mr Hogg said he always felt safe as the authorities had a close eye on the situation.</p><p>\"We only got called off the fire ground once,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Hogg's team landed back in Queensland on June 29, having contained about 67 per cent of Rainbow Lake fire.</p><p>Meanwhile the fires had destroyed more than 7.9 million hectares of forest.</p><p>A second team of 37 QFES and Queensland Park and Wildlife Service personnel was dispatched to help with wider effort as Canadian authorities grapple with what has been a horrific fire season.</p><p>The fires have affected eleven provinces and territories, with large blazes in Alberta, Nova Scotia and Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>Four days before Mr Hogg returned home the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre declared the 2023 wildfire season was the worst in recorded history.</p><p>Mr Hogg said he would relish the opportunity to volunteer overseas again as that spirit of service was hardwired into QFES personnel.</p><p>\"We all do our part,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think it is very important as it shows that we as Australians care about other people and other countries.</p><p>\"Volunteering a very rewarding experience, you are giving back to the community, helping people and nothing beats seeing the delight on someone's face when they see you are there for them.\"

start a fire in a forestry plantation at Geham. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">William John Kevin Horrigan, 19, faced the Toowoomba District Court yesterday and pleaded guilty to one count of wilfully setting fire to a standing crop of grass.</p><p>The court heard Horrigan and his co-accused filled a five-litre jerry can with petrol at a Toowoomba service station on June 8. </p><p>Crown Prosecutor Shontelle Petrie said Horrigan used the fuel to start a fire then fled when it was clear they lost control of the situation. </p><p>\"It is obviously very topical, but when setting fires, risks abound,\" she said. </p><p>The fire burnt an area about half the size of a football field and destroyed several young plantation trees.</p><p>\"It is unknown whether (the owner) will sustain a loss because the trees set on fire would not be harvestable for many years,\" Ms Petrie said. </p><p>Luckily the incident occurred in the middle of winter when cool, dewy conditions halted the fire. </p><p/><p>\"It is very fortunate that volunteers from the local fire brigade were able to bring it under control,\" Ms Petrie said. </p><p>Police investigating the scene found the jerry can nearby and linked it to Horrigan, who made full admission of his actions when interviewed by investigators.</p><p>Acting in his defence, barrister Jessica Goldie said her client had no criminal history and was going through a rough patch at the time. </p><p>She tended a written apology, expressing his remorse. </p><p>In sentencing Judge Deborah Richards accepted Horrigan's genuine regret but said his actions risked lives. </p><p>\"You were only 19 at the time,\" she said.</p><p>\"I can only put it down to the fact that you were at that age that you would be so incredibly stupid to do such a dangerous thing having seen the fires that raged in the Australia in December and burnt millions and millions of hectares of property, killed people and millions of animals.\"</p><p>Judge Richards ordered an 18-month period of probation with no conviction recorded. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

While FFMVic does a vital job managing bushfire risk, I encourage all Victorians to ensure they have the right information, tools and actions to prepare for fires.</p><p>This means familiarising yourself with the new Australian fire danger rating system. This system is the same across Australia, so you can assess risk and take action if needed, wherever you are.</p><p>If you live on or near land that is at bushfire risk, make sure to follow the Fire Ready Kit from CFA. If you're camping this summer, do not leave campfires unattended and make sure the ashes are cool to touch before you leave.</p><p>You can find out when planned burns are happening in your area by signing up at plannedburns.ffm.vic.gov.au and make sure you have the VicEmergency app on your phone.</p><p>Chris Hardman chief fire officer, Forest Fire Management Victoria</p><p>Numbers are impressive I HAD to be impressed with the statistics: 110,000 potholes found and fixed; 1617 bridges assessed; 36 landslips visited (\"State snubs road inspection\", TWT December 14).</p><p>One has to hope that, given accepted bureaucratic process and procedure, a full audit has been made of these figures before releasing them to an unsuspecting public.</p><p>If not, a government inquiry should be initiated immediately. Jim Cone, Glen Waverley</p><p>Hop to it to avoid label confusion THE simplest way to avoid objections from overseas producers (\"PM invites EU to pay a visit to Aussie prosecco growers\", TWT, Dec 2) would be to prefix our products with \"Australian\" - Australian prosecco, Australian feta.</p><p>Maybe even put a kangaroo on the label, then buyers will be aware of the source of their purchases.</p><p>Melva Stott, Anglesea</p><p>Flow modelling unreliable A KEY element of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is achieving predetermined flow targets at the South Australia border.</p><p>This has long been problematic, because past experience tells us that achieving the targets without causing upstream flooding to public and private land will not be possible, and unfortunately we have been seeing the damage this can cause.</p><p>Additionally, as we try to force so much water down the Murray River, we are turning it into a drainage channel while damaging river banks and improving the breeding conditions for European carp.</p><p>Yet the flow targets remain, because no-one in authority has the political courage to acknowledge these consequences.</p><p>This being the case, surely the upstream communities which are being sacrificed to achieve these politically motivated targets should reasonably expect accuracy in flow measuring, as well as the collection of any data needed to ensure that this water is being effectively used for the environment it is supposed to protect.</p><p>But no.</p><p>During this current flood event we learn that a report from the SA Department for Environment and Water tells us that SA flow calculations \"should be interpreted with a high degree of caution\" and that daily calculated flows \"should not be considered a useful measure in relation to the forecasted flow and water levels\".</p><p>We're also advised the Department for Environment and Water and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority are in the process of refining their modelling to allow for more accurate flow reporting.</p><p>So, for how long has flow measuring and modelling been at best unreliable, and possibly plain wrong?</p><p>Perhaps this is just another example of selective use of data to achieve the political objectives of the Basin Plan.</p><p>While I do not expect it will ever happen, if governments had any intention of delivering an effective plan with the balance we were originally promised we would have a full review of its implementation to date.</p><p>Doug Fehring, Leitchville</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-e5b9922a825011ed935f9df1b91f7513fccaeddb6e10324caac2b7ef944950c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6763-CTG1-F0JP-W2KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 28, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

which only provides \"four on the fire ground\".</p><p>When there is a fire at Portland, a Warrnambool appliance has to respond.</p><p>\"In areas like Portland we're unable to meet the safety standard because we don't have the appliances and we don't have the staff - so no truck, no crew,\" Mr Black said.</p><p>\"If Portland gets a structure fire today with a complexity - persons reported or similar - there will be a truck dispatched from Warrnambool to go and support the truck over there and create that seven on the fire ground.\"</p><p>However, he said this put firefighters and people affected by the fire at risk.</p><p>\"Everyone knows the travel time between Warrnambool and Portland is one hour and 20 minutes,\" Mr Black said.</p><p>\"If it takes you one hour and 20 minutes to get to a house fire, you're not not talking about saving lives, you're not talking about saving the structure - what you're talking about is being there for the tail end of the fire.\"</p><p>Mr Black said fire brigades across the state were calling for additional funds to replace ageing appliances and fund additional firefighter roles at cities including Portland.</p><p>\"The people in and around the city of Portland need to understand that they're getting a lesser service because of the lack of funding given to them by the state government and Fire Rescue Victoria,\" Mr Black said.</p><p>\"And then the people of Warrnambool need to understand that any time there is a fire in Portland, their coverage drops.</p><p>\"It's not overly common but it does happen where you have double header fires.\"</p><p>Mr Black said there was clear evidence Portland needed two active appliances.</p><p>\"The area of Portland has had two of the most expensive fires in terms of monetary value in the last 20 years - so the risk is there,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Black said these included a tar pit fire, which took days to extinguish and a fire on a livestock carrier.</p><p>\"Portland has a major harbour and a major transport route, which includes not only freight but logging as well.\"</p><p>Mr Black said there had already been an example of how crucial it was for Warrnambool to have two appliances available at all times.</p><p>\"On St Patrick's Day, Warrnambool was without a truck for in excess of five hours,\" he said.</p><p>\"We didn't have a pumper here in town to protect from structure fires.</p><p>\"Both appliances were committed -

It was great to see people really working together to protect the town,\" he said.</p><h>Slashing works conducted</h><p>It was\u00a0not the first time the people of Loch Sport had\u00a0come face-to-face with bushfire.</p><p>In 2012 an unplanned fire broke out south-west of the town, in a similar area to last week's blaze.</p><p>The following year, the Victorian Fire Services commissioner released a report detailing extreme\u00a0fire risks in the area.</p><p>It outlined the challenges the town faced, having just a single road access and significant areas of national park surrounding it requiring\u00a0fuel reduction.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said crews had conducted extensive mechanical slashing works along Longford-Loch Sport Road and that more than 300 hectares had been mulched on the edge of the township.</p><p>\"Since 2016, Victoria has used a risk-based approach to fuel management and planned burning, rather than a hectare-based target, so that we are focusing on areas with the greatest impact to minimise bushfire risk for communities and the environment,\" he said.</p><p>Loch Sport is also dependent on tank supplies for water, which are unusable when power supply to the town fails, as was the case last week.</p><p>Seven timber power poles that were destroyed\u00a0have each been rebuilt in concrete.</p><p>The Victorian Fire Services commissioner report recommended the use of concrete power poles to negate the risk of power loss in bushfire scenarios.</p><h>Impromptu meeting held</h><p>Nationals Member for Gippsland South\u00a0Danny O'Brien\u00a0hosted an impromptu community meeting in the town last Friday, which was attended by about 50 locals.</p><p>Among issues raised was the need to establish a safe boat harbour for use in case of emergency, greater fuel reduction efforts, and the exploration\u00a0of a helicopter or boat evacuation route if necessary.</p><p>Mr O'Brien said Wellington Shire Council had endorsed the plan to establish a safe boat harbour.</p><p>He said the environment context in Loch Sport was similar to Mallacoota in East Gippsland, where bushfires encircled the town during the Black Summer bushfires in 2019.</p><p>\"You're also surrounded by a different type of forest, and in some respects Loch Sport is worse,\" Mr O'Brien said.</p><p>\"That coastal banksia heathland is very flammable.</p><p>\"These issues aren't new and the community is certainly concerned.\"</p><p>Despite the risk and frustrations, Mr Kiely remained\u00a0committed to improving his home rather than leaving it behind.</p><p>\"You get silly remarks from people saying, 'Well, if you don't like it, then move', but if that was the answer then nobody would live anywhere,\" he said.</p><p>\"I love it, and I'm going to do as much as I can to try to\u00a0make sure it's safe, not just for myself, but for everybody else.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

which only provides \"four on the fire ground\".</p><p>When there is a fire at Portland, a Warrnambool appliance has to respond.</p><p>\"In areas like Portland we're unable to meet the safety standard because we don't have the appliances and we don't have the staff - so no truck, no crew,\" Mr Black said.</p><p>\"If Portland gets a structure fire today with a complexity - persons reported or similar - there will be a truck dispatched from Warrnambool to go and support the truck over there and create that seven on the fire ground.\"</p><p>However, he said this put firefighters and people affected by the fire at risk.</p><p>\"Everyone knows the travel time between Warrnambool and Portland is one hour and 20 minutes,\" Mr Black said.</p><p>\"If it takes you one hour and 20 minutes to get to a house fire, you're not not talking about saving lives, you're not talking about saving the structure - what you're talking about is being there for the tail end of the fire.\"</p><p>Mr Black said fire brigades across the state were calling for additional funds to replace ageing appliances and fund additional firefighter roles at cities including Portland.</p><p>\"The people in and around the city of Portland need to understand that they're getting a lesser service because of the lack of funding given to them by the state government and Fire Rescue Victoria,\" Mr Black said.</p><p>\"And then the people of Warrnambool need to understand that any time there is a fire in Portland, their coverage drops.</p><p>\"It's not overly common but it does happen where you have double header fires.\"</p><p>Mr Black said there was clear evidence Portland needed two active appliances.</p><p>\"The area of Portland has had two of the most expensive fires in terms of monetary value in the last 20 years - so the risk is there,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Black said these included a tar pit fire, which took days to extinguish and a fire on a livestock carrier.</p><p>\"Portland has a major harbour and a major transport route, which includes not only freight but logging as well.\"</p><p>Mr Black said there had already been an example of how crucial it was for Warrnambool to have two appliances available at all times.</p><p>\"On St Patrick's Day, Warrnambool was without a truck for in excess of five hours,\" he said.</p><p>\"We didn't have a pumper here in town to protect from structure fires.</p><p>\"Both appliances were committed -

nitf:lede=\"true\">Illegal firewood collectors have caused significant damage to parks, forests and reserves in recent years, with some areas like the Mansfield Swamp Wildlife Reserve in northern Victoria losing an estimated 50 per cent of its old mature trees through timber theft.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Birds and reptiles as well as a range of native mammals, such as possums, gliders and bats, rely on hollows in both standing and fallen trees for habitat and these homes can be compromised if taken.</p><p>The illegal collection of firewood, if made up of mature trees and limbs, also has potential to harm Aboriginal scarred trees.</p><p>Once gone, an important piece of Aboriginal cultural heritage is lost forever.</p><p>\"We can all do our part in protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage, wildlife habitat and biodiversity by knowing where, when and what firewood can be collected,\" Chief Conservation Regulator Kate Gavens said.</p><p>\"It can take hundreds of years for nature to create tree hollows and habitat loss from illegal firewood collection has a serious impact on the future of our iconic native species.\"</p><p>During the season, people can collect a maximum of two cubic metres of firewood per person per day and a maximum of 16 cubic metres of firewood per household per financial year.</p><p>Only fallen timber without hollows can be collected.</p><p>This year, the Conservation Regulator is targeting firewood theft with Forest Fire Management Victoria and Parks Victoria through Operation Hollows.</p><p>Authorised officers are educating the public about the rules and penalising thieves.</p><p>Anyone caught breaking firewood collection rules can face on-the-spot-fines of $740 under the Forests Act 1958 or a maximum penalty of $9246 and/or one year jail if the matter is taken to court.</p><p>Last year the Conservation Regulator laid 625 charges and issued 85 infringement notices and 16 official warnings for firewood offences, including cutting or taking fallen or felled trees, and disturbing, damaging or destroying wildlife habitat.</p><p>Cases which resolved in the Magistrate Court system faced convictions, fines and had chainsaws and trailers forfeited and destroyed.</p><p>It is also important firewood collectors understand their obligations under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006.</p><p>All Aboriginal places, objects and Ancestral remains are protected in Victoria and it is an offence to harm Aboriginal heritage and substantial penalties apply.</p><p>If you think you have found a scarred tree or other Aboriginal cultural heritage, contact your relevant Registered Aboriginal Party (if one has been appointed) or First Peoples - State Relations on 1800 762 003.</p><p>Autumn firewood collection season now open EARLIER: Residents can ensure they stay warm this winter as the autumn firewood collection opens in central Victoria.</p><p>Over the next three months, firewood can be collected from designated collection areas in state forests or parks across the region for personal use.</p><p>Firewood can only be collected from public land for domestic use during the autumn collection season - between March 1 to June 30 - and spring collection season between September 1 and November 30.</p><p>\"To ensure local communities have greater access to available firewood into the future, only residents from specified local government areas are allowed to collect firewood in central Victoria,\" Forest Fire Operations district manager Adrian Parker said.</p><p>MORE NEWS: Local artists chosen to illustrate new children's book</p><p>\"As a result of severe flooding, a firewood collection area is planned to be opened in Gunbower State Forest on April 1, providing the area is accessible and deemed safe.\"</p><p>Seasonal closures reduce the risks to people, the environment and infrastructure when the forests and tracks are wet.</p><p>The weather can be unpredictable as can the surrounding environment, so residents are urged to be aware of tree canopy and the surrounding environment.</p><p>People who rely on firewood for energy, heating and cooking should ensure they are using firewood in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>The Environment Protection Authority has recommended chimneys be regularly cleaned and collected wood be allowed to dry for at least eight months before burning.</p><p>OTHER

bushfires.</p><p>Bushfire locations include Duffy Road, Briagolong, Knotts Siding Road, Rawson, Loch Sport, Seacombe, and 10 kilometres south-west of Harrietville.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria also issued a community Information message for Boisdale, Briagolong, Heyfield, Maffra, Newry, Tinamba, Valencia Creek and surrounds.</p><p>Residents in these areas should monitor emergency warnings on VicEmergency, road closures on the VicRoads website, prepare evacuation and fire safety plans, and if evacuating from the Briagolong warning zone, head south towards Sale via Briagolong.</p><p>People should drive carefully in these areas with several active fires and visible smoke.</p><p>Meanwhile, a total fire ban is in place in the Mallee, with an extreme fire warning for hot and dry conditions, north-westerly winds and a risk of dry thunderstorms.</p><p>Country Fire Authority chief officer Jason Heffernan said since Saturday, there had been 220 bush and grass fires across Victoria with three fires not yet contained.</p><p>\"The next 24 hours will be interesting for fire authorities across Victoria,\" he said.</p><p>\"Today we see extreme fire dangers in the Mallee with temperatures to the mid-30 degrees and strong northerly winds.</p><p>\"We do anticipate some interesting fire weather behaviour into East Gippsland late this evening into the early hours of the morning.\"</p><p>He said there were currently no homes under threat at the Loch Sport bushfire, but it remained an active site.</p><p>Mr Heffernan said they expected the weather predictions to affect the fire grounds, particularly the Briagolong bushfire.</p><p>\"Our message to the communities in and around fire-affected areas is to make sure you have your bushfire survival plan, that you've decided now what you're triggers are should something occur,\" he said.</p><p>He said communities should continue monitoring available information and be \"ready to act\", and it was unlikely that fire authorities would be able to contain the Briagolong fire within the next 12 hours.</p><p>\"That may mean you need to take action in the very early hours of the morning,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Heffernan said the Briagolong fire started at 5.13am and was under investigation, but they understood many of the fires across Victoria were re-ignitions of private burns.</p><p>\"If you've had a burn in the past couple of days, please go and check it,\" he said.</p><p>One home, and several outbuildings and sheds, were destroyed by the fires.</p><p>Mr Heffernan said there had been significant grass growth and they expected the north-western parts of Victoria to reach its traditional bushfire season.</p><p>The bushfire south of the Rawson township spans 161 hectares and is not yet under control, the Briagolong bushfire area is 4743 hectares and Loch Sport is 338 hectares.</p><p>The Bureau issued a severe weather warning for damaging winds across central Victoria, East Gippsland, north central, north east and west, and south Gippsland.</p><p>The Bureau's warning included there would be peak gusts of about 100 kilometres an hour during Tuesday morning.</p><p>Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Christie Johnson said there could be five to 20 millimetres of rain across the state, between 20-50mm in eastern Victoria and 60-80mm in some parts.</p><p>\"We will see that heavy rainfall could cause heavy issues with flooding,\" she said.</p><p>\"The fires in Gippsland are likely to see 30-50 millimetres of rainfall, so a good drop of rainfall there for those fires, unfortunately ahead of that there will be quite strong winds.</p><p>\"There could be a further 30-60mm over those areas, they're just a little bit west of where the heaviest rainfall is likely to fall but there will be some decent follow-up rainfall throughout later in the week.\"</p><p>VicSES operations chief officer Tim Wiebusch said there would be the risk of minor through to moderate, to potentially major flooding in catchments across Victoria, particularly north and north-eastern Gippsland.</p><p>\"If you are confronted with floodwaters, do not attempt to drive through those waters, it could be the last decision you make,\" he said.</p><p>\"The highest risk of the Riverine and flash flooding is across the eastern part of the state.\"</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Rick Nugent said he urged communities to plan ahead.</p><p>\"Do your planning, understand the risks of your local area, chat to your family and chat to neighbours, understand some of that and you'll be well-prepared then for what may eventuate,\" he said.</p><p>No fire danger period restrictions are in place yet for most of the state, except for East Gippsland and Wellington, which start on October 9.</p><p>People can stay informed through the VicEmergency hotline on 1800 226 226, the VicEmergency app, Facebook or Twitter with the hash tag #vicfires, listen to an emergency broadcaster or visit the VicEmergency website.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

All must be in the \u201con\u201d position for a fire to take hold.  The drying out of fuel is particularly crucial for making a forest dangerously flammable. Indeed, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117861\">many</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149104\">researchers</url> are <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-3739-2014\">finding</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04325-1\">links</url> between vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and fire activity. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/497818/original/file-20221129-16-7joe79.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/497818/original/file-20221129-16-7joe79.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>Vapour pressure deficit is lowest when the air is saturated and we see water condensing to form dew, or clouds. (Anders Mellerup/Unsplash) VPD describes the difference between how much moisture is in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it\u2019s saturated. Once air becomes saturated, water will condense to form clouds or dew on leaves.  Importantly, warmer air can hold more water, which means VPD increases. We refer to the air being \u201cthirsty\u201d when the gap between full and empty air becomes bigger, meaning there\u2019s a greater demand (thirst) for the water to come out of living and dead plant material, drying it out.  This is a serious issue as climate change leads to rising global temperatures. Climate change and fire days We analysed more than 30 million <url normalizedValue=\"https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/\">satellite records</url> and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview\">global climate dataset</url> to find the maximum daily VPD, for each time and place a fire was detected.  We then measured the strength of the relationship between VPD and fire activity for different forest types in each continent. And we showed, for the first time, that in many forests there is a strong link between fire activity and VPD on any given day.  Our results show certain VPD thresholds beyond which forest fire becomes more likely than not.  For example, in boreal forests (predominantly northern European and American coniferous forests), this threshold is 0.7-1.4 kilopascals (a unit of pressure). In subtropical and tropical forests such as the Amazon, the threshold rises dramatically to 1.5-4.0 kilopascals. This means the air must be a lot thirstier to spark fire in the tropical forests of Borneo and Sumatra than in the spruce, pine and larch of Canada. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/497821/original/file-20221129-27-6d5d8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/497821/original/file-20221129-27-6d5d8u.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>Climate change is dramatically raising the risk of wildfires. (Shutterstock) We looked at both low- and high-emissions <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf\">scenarios</url> and found the risks are much greater if we fail to curb emissions.  If humanity continues to release greenhouse gas emissions unabated, the planet is expected to warm by around 3.7\u2103 by the end of the century. Under this high-emissions scenario, our study finds there are forests on every continent that will experience at least 30 extra days per year above critical flammability thresholds.  Under a lower-emissions scenario where global warming is limited to around 1.8\u2103, each continent will still see at least an extra 15 days per year crossing the threshold.  Parts of tropical South America including the Amazon will see the greatest increases in both scenarios by the end of the century: at least 90 additional days in a low-emissions scenario, and at least 150 extra days in a high-emissions scenario. What are the risks? Increasing forest fires will have serious consequences. This includes potentially destabilising patterns of fire and regrowth and disrupting the <url normalizedValue=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle\">carbon storage</url> we rely on forests for. Indeed, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03629-6\">research last year</url> showed the role of the Amazon rainforest as a \u201ccarbon sink\u201d (which absorbs more CO\u2082 that it releases) may already be in decline.  We can also expect increasing harms to human health <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/wildfires#tab=tab_1\">from wildfire smoke</url>. It is estimated that around the world, <url normalizedValue=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22456494/\">more than 330,000 people</url> die each year from smoke inhalation. This number could increase notably by the turn of the century, particularly in the most populated areas of South Asia and East Africa.  Our next research project will explore the links between fire, VPD and climate change in more detail in Australia, our home country. We\u2019re also interested in the forests and regions where VPD doesn\u2019t seem to be the main driver of fire, such as in Japan and Scandinavia.  Our discovery of reliable links between atmospheric dryness and forest fire risk in many regions means we can now develop better fire predictions, at both seasonal and near-term scales. This could bring significant benefits to those on the frontlines of fighting, managing and coexisting with wildfire.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Shiva Khanal from Western Sydney University to this article.</emphasis>  This article is republished from <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</url> under a Creative Commons license.

It can also be thought of as how \"thirsty\" the air is. </p><p>Our results show that forest fire becomes much more likely above a certain threshold of vapour pressure deficit in many regions. This threshold depends on the type of forest.</p><p>Alarmingly, climate change is increasing the number of days the planet passes these crucial thresholds. But by urgently bringing global emissions down, we can minimise the number of extra wildfire days. </p><h>How a forest becomes flammable</h><p>Wildfire is an ancient, highly diverse phenomenon. Four key <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00512.x\">conditions for a fire are</url>:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>fuel: the leaves, branches, twigs and everything else that can catch alight in a forest</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>fuel moisture: whether fuel is dry enough to burn</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ignition: the spark to set things off, such as a lightning strike</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>weather: conditions such as strong winds and high temperatures, which can aid a fire's spread.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>These four processes act as switches. All must be in the \"on\" position for a fire to take hold. </p><p>The drying out of fuel is particularly crucial for making a forest dangerously flammable. Indeed, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117861\">many</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149104\">researchers</url> are <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-3739-2014\">finding</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04325-1\">links</url> between vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and fire activity.</p><p>VPD describes the difference between how much moisture is in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it's saturated. Once air becomes saturated, water will condense to form clouds or dew on leaves.</p><p>Importantly, warmer air can hold more water, which means VPD increases. We refer to the air being \"thirsty\" when the gap between full and empty air becomes bigger, meaning there's a greater demand (thirst) for the water to come out of living and dead plant material, drying it out.</p><p>This is a serious issue as climate change leads to rising global temperatures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Global warming puts Arabica coffee at risk, and we're barrelling towards a crucial threshold</emphasis></p><h>Climate change and fire days</h><p>We analysed more than 30 million <url normalizedValue=\"https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/\">satellite records</url> and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview\">global climate dataset</url> to find the maximum daily VPD, for each time and place a fire was detected.</p><p>We then measured the strength of the relationship between VPD and fire activity for different forest types in each continent. And we showed, for the first time, that in many forests there is a strong link between fire activity and VPD on any given day.</p><p>Our results show certain VPD thresholds beyond which forest fire becomes more likely than not. </p><p>For example, in boreal forests (predominantly northern European and American coniferous forests), this threshold is 0.7-1.4 kilopascals (a unit of pressure). In subtropical and tropical forests such as the Amazon, the threshold rises dramatically to 1.5-4.0 kilopascals. This means the air must be a lot thirstier to spark fire in the tropical forests of Borneo and Sumatra than in the spruce, pine and larch of Canada.</p><p>We looked at both low- and high-emissions <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf\">scenarios</url> and found the risks are much greater if we fail to curb emissions.</p><p>If humanity continues to release greenhouse gas emissions unabated, the planet is expected to warm by around 3.7? by the end of the century. Under this high-emissions scenario, our study finds there are forests on every continent that will experience at least 30 extra days per year above critical flammability thresholds.</p><p>Under a lower-emissions scenario where global warming is limited to around 1.8?, each continent will still see at least an extra 15 days per year crossing the threshold. </p><p>Parts of tropical South America including the Amazon will see the greatest increases in both scenarios by the end of the century: at least 90 additional days in a low-emissions scenario, and at least 150 extra days in a high-emissions scenario.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Climate-fuelled disasters: warning people is good, but stopping the disaster is best.

Our changing climate means these events are becoming more frequent and extreme.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The recent State of the Climate report by the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO confirms that changes to weather and climate extremes are happening at an increased pace across Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the coming decades, we will see an increase in the number of dangerous fire weather days and a longer fire season for southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>Even though conditions have been wetter through most of the state this year, Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) has continued to take action to manage bushfire risk.</p><p>Victoria is Australia's most bushfire prone state. By investing in prevention, we aim to protect people, property and the environment by reducing the risk and impact of major bushfires.</p><p>We look for opportunities year-round to conduct planned burns that will protect people, and our environment - including forests, their wildlife and biodiversity - from bushfires this summer and in the drier years to come.</p><p>We burn to the conditions, not the calendar. Some burns that were planned for spring may take place this summer if conditions are right and it's safe to do so. Others could take place in autumn this year.</p><p>Although we don't expect many long-running or large forest fires this summer, areas across the north and west of the state may see increasing fire potential from mid-summer, especially in areas of high grass growth.</p><p>Drier forests, woodlands and heathlands are also at risk of fires with the onset of hot and dry weather conditions.</p><p>Going forward, we will prioritise planned burns in places with increased risk.</p><p>The wetter weather has presented opportunities for different types of burning. In some areas, the higher levels of moisture in the soil and natural gullies have allowed our crews to conduct lower-intensity burns. The gullies act as natural boundaries for the fire, which is not always possible during drier conditions.</p><p>Past events show us that planned burning can reduce the loss and destruction caused by bushfires.</p><p>As a world leader in bushfire risk management, we have many different tools in our toolbox.</p><p>Planned burning is not the only way we manage bushfire risk and reduce fuel like grass, leaf litter, twigs, bark and vegetation. We've increased our use of mowing, slashing and mulching.</p><p>We've also expanded our network of strategic fuel breaks to better protect against bushfires. These strips of land are in the highest priority locations - close to towns, water catchments and sensitive environments.</p><p>We have also upgraded our infrastructure, including forest roads, fire dams and fire lookout towers.</p><p>In addition to our bushfire risk management program, FFMVic, together with Country Fire Authority (CFA), is continuing to support Traditional Owners to use cultural fire on Country. Over 200 cultural burns are planned over the next three years.</p><p>We work with CFA, Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV), local government and communities to deliver the best local approaches to bushfire risk management in Victoria.</p><p>The combination of our actions helps communities and our environment to become more resilient.</p><p>Our crews will continue to keep communities safe all year by reducing the risk and impact of bushfires on Victoria's parks, forests and other public land.</p><p>While FFMVic does a vital job managing bushfire risk, I encourage all Victorians to ensure they have the right information, tools and actions to prepare for fires.</p><p>This means familiarising yourself with the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System. This system is the same across Australia, so you can assess risk and take action if needed, wherever you are.</p><p>If you live on or near land that is at bushfire risk, make sure to follow the Fire Ready Kit from CFA.</p><p>If you're camping this summer, do not leave campfires unattended and make sure the ashes are cool to touch before you leave.</p><p>You can find out when planned burns are happening in your area by signing up at plannedburns.ffm.vic.gov.au and make sure you have the VicEmergency app on your phone.</p><p>To find out more about what my team at FFMVic and I are doing to help keep Victoria safe, visit ffm.vic.gov.au/bushfire-management-facts.</p><p>Chris Hardman, Chief Fire Officer, Forest Fire Management Victoria</p><p>Have you tried The Courier's app?

It's a decision at least 1000 families in East Gippsland are grappling with after the Victorian government fast-tracked the end of native logging.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Have you thought about the people at the supermarket? Have you thought about the local tyre service? The local school, and the construction industry? It just spreads so far and wide. Tourism, hospitality, everybody's going to be affected by it because no one's going to be left here,\" said Booth, a workshop manager and father of three. \"This is the first time I've actually thought, 'is it worth hanging around?'. I don't know. The problem is, if the timber industry goes, is there going to be any other industry to go to?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Native logging was due to end in 2030, but a Supreme Court injunction temporarily stopped the work in November. The Victorian government, in its state budget last Tuesday, brought forward the ban to next January in a decision celebrated by environmentalists concerned about wildlife extinction.</p><p>Following the announcement, Nicola Rivers from Environmental Justice Australia said Victoria's forests were the lungs of regional communities, and the ban would improve the health of waterways, provide homes for threatened wildlife and support local tourism.</p><p>The Age spoke to a dozen workers, residents and employers, many of whom found out the industry was over on the radio or by word of mouth, and are concerned about whether they will find employment in their home towns.</p><p>\"I found out on Facebook,\" said single mother of two Ang Savage, who works with beams and columns at Australian Sustainable Hardwood in Heyfield. \"It's like we don't even exist.\"</p><p>An expanded support package valued at $875 million includes $8000 retraining vouchers. But the nearest TAFEs from logging communities Orbost and Swift Creek are about a one-hour drive away, and Savage said there would not be enough jobs in Heyfield or neighbouring towns anyway.</p><p>\"If the jobs aren't there, it doesn't matter how much training we get offered or how much training we have.\"</p><p>Michael O'Connor, national manufacturing secretary of the CFMEU, who resigned from the government's \"sham\" forestry advisory body in disgust, had little faith in the government to transition workers into appropriate jobs after blindsiding the industry without consultation.</p><p>\"Through ignorance or stupidity, they have increased the harm,\" O'Connor said.</p><p>\"What was the rush? You had to make the announcement on budget day, did you? When your media strategy becomes more important than public policy, that's a government that's lost the plot.\"</p><p>Richard Pelz - a hauler subcontracted to collect woodchips and sawdust from sawmills - has not received any government help since logging paused in November and does not know if his family-run business and 30 staff, including Booth, will be supported. \"That's a bitter pill to swallow. I don't want to swallow it, I want to get compensated like everybody else, and I don't think it's too much to ask,\" Pelz, in his 60s, said.</p><p>\"You'd think they'd have the balls to come up and see you.\"</p><p>Trucks make the journey out of Orbost with hauls from logging and return with freight for the supermarkets. Now, the journey would be empty one way and Pelz said the price of groceries could be forced up in the town as a result.</p><p>Median incomes in Orbost are almost half the state average, census data shows.</p><p>Most workers believed the government was chasing Greens votes in inner Melbourne at the expense of what was once considered Labor's traditional working-class base.</p><p>Garry Squires, a semi-retired forestry consultant in Orbost who once worked at the now Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA), said available work would be an hour's commute each way and expected the small population of about 2200 would be diminished. \"The whole fabric of your town is eroded,\" Squires said.</p><p>Forest fire management has relied on the industry to manage roads, create containment lines and lop dangerous or fallen trees. Squires and East Gippsland Shire Mayor Mark Reeves said there was not enough detail on how that would be taken over when the industry vacates.</p><p>Local National Party MP Darren Chester, who represents many of the affected towns, accused Victorian Labor MPs of being \"gutless\" and letting down blue-collar workers who were once the party's base.</p><p>\"If this timber ban goes ahead, it will devastate the social and economic life of small towns in my community. The flow on impacts are hard to predict, but as working-age people leave the district, things like footy and netball clubs will cease to exist and schools become unviable,\" the Gippsland MP told The Age.</p><p>\"No one wants a bloody handout from Dan Andrews, they want to have the decency of a job to provide for the financial security of their families in the towns they love.\"</p><p>Treasurer Tim Pallas on Wednesday confirmed bushfire management would need the industry's machinery, particularly from harvesting and haulage. A government spokesman said workers would be helped into jobs in land management and critical forest bushfire responses while others would be offered retraining in industries like renewable energy and construction.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria was contacted.</p><p>Ewan Waller, the state's former chief fire officer who also worked in forestry, said he believed a more targeted approach to native logging 20 or 30 years ago could have stopped the need for a ban.</p><p>\"Through mismanagement, we end up where we are. A cheap political decision which suits inner Melbourne and leaves remote parts of Victoria hung out to dry.\"</p><p>Industry workers also questioned whether imported timber, which Victoria would increasingly rely on, would have worse labour and environmental standards.</p><p>Vince Hurley, chief executive of Australian Sustainable Hardwoods, said the government could have staged the ban to allow businesses to exit with dignity. The business had started diversifying, but that was working towards 2030.</p><p>\"We would like to protect jobs, obviously, and we want to have a business going forward. I think we can manage a business going forward, but I don't know what that looks like,\" Hurley said.</p><p>\"I don't know what we're going to do, I don't know the answer yet.\"</p><p>A government spokesman said its priority was forestry workers, their families and communities.</p><p>\"We do not take the decision around an early transition out of native timber harvesting lightly, but the uncertainty from ongoing litigation and severe bushfires cannot continue,\" he said.</p><p>Workers at supply chain businesses would be offered training, employment and mental health support from ForestWorks.</p><p>Privately, not all Labor MPs agree with the decision. Three federal Labor MPs, speaking on the condition on anonymity, said they disagreed with the decision to bring forward the ban, and were furious with the way the news had been delivered to communities. \"This is not the way you do things,\" one said.</p><p>There are vouchers of up to $25,000 for impacted businesses to access financial support and diversification planning.</p><p>EDITORIAL Page 20</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7qec2ffyb8wg2eav7pm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68BC-6F01-F0J6-J3CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1193\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

These trees succumbed to a mysterious root disease and the patches expanded gradually. Spontaneous regrowth of seedlings in the patches died dramatically. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As in many other true crime dramas, the finger was initially pointed at the most likely suspect: the root-infecting <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phytophthora cinnamomi</emphasis>. Its name - plant (phyto) destroyer (phthora) - reveals its power to cause harm; the pathogen is known to cause disease in almost 5,000 different plants.</p><p>After further investigation and the collection of many samples, tree pathologists shifted the blame onto the fungus <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leptographium serpens</emphasis> (now known as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leptographium alacre</emphasis>). This fungus is well known to be transported by insects and was previously only known in Europe. It was visually identified from the roots of the dying trees. Now it was the prime suspect. </p><p>Doubts lingered, though. Most <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leptographium</emphasis> species are not known to act as primary disease agents and so <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">L. serpens</emphasis> was most likely not able to cause the disease. Other fungi were also found within the roots of the diseased trees but could not be identified at the time due to a lack of more advanced techniques.</p><p>Knowing that the then-available technologies could not provide the complete answer to this mystery, the pathologists took more samples from the dead and dying pine trees, and stored them carefully. The hope was that one day they would have a better idea of the cause of this disease outbreak. </p><p>Fast forward to 2023 and a new character enters the mystery: DNA sequencing. This modern technology did what wasn't possible a few decades ago, allowing our team of molecular mycologists <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-023-01502-1\">to identify the real culprit</url>.</p><p>This tale is a testament to the ever-evolving nature of scientific inquiry. It reinforces the idea that, in the pursuit of knowledge, no stone should be left unturned and no assumption should be taken for granted. Through a blend of perseverance, technology, and a touch of serendipity, it was possible to solve a decades-old mystery.</p><h>Tracking a killer</h><p>Back in the 1980s the samples were stored in the culture collection of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fabinet.up.ac.za\">Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute</url> at the University of Pretoria. In 2020, the samples were revived by a team that included ourselves and several others who recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-023-01502-1\">published a paper</url> on the topic. </p><p>We sequenced the samples' DNA to reveal their unique genetic code. By comparing this code against genetic databases, it was possible to figure out exactly what was causing the tree disease. And so, more than four decades after the disease was first described, the pathogen was finally identified as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rhizina undulata</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">L. serpens</emphasis>, the long time primary suspect, was finally exonerated. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rhizina undulata</emphasis> is <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00382167.1984.9629524\">well known</url> to cause tree disease and death, mainly in Europe. This fungus is known colloquially as the \"coffee fire fungus\" because the intense heat caused by fires made by campers in a forest to brew coffee activates its dormant spores. This allows it to colonise the roots of conifers, including pines. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R. undulata</emphasis> is also well known in South Africa, where it kills many pines in the aftermath of forest fire and when trees are felled to clear a plantation.</p><p>What remains a mystery, however, is the trigger that activated this fungus in the Western Cape plantations. No fires were known to have occurred during the relevant time period.</p><p>One potential clue to the trigger may lie in the soil in which these trees were planted. Known as Table Mountain sandstone, this soil is sandy and acidic. Acidic soil <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0007-1536(67)80014-7\">has been shown</url> in the laboratory to encourage <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R. undulata</emphasis> growth. This naturally occurring acidity may have been the nudge the pathogen needed to infect the pine trees. It is also possible that the fungus was activated by heat radiating from the quartz rocks that are common in the areas in which the dying trees were planted.</p><h>It pays to be patient</h><p>In the years since the mysterious Western Cape outbreak, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R. undulata</emphasis> has become well known to foresters in pine plantations in other parts of South Africa and has done great damage to newly planted trees after fires. These fires can be accidental or due to what is known as slash-burning after trees are harvested. </p><p>Identifying <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R. undulata</emphasis> as the culprit in those (no longer active) Western Cape plantations means scientists have more data that might help to better understand the biology of the fungus - which may lead to better control strategies in the future.</p><p>Our work is also a testament to the timeliness of scientific progress and the importance of patience. This story could only be fully unravelled when more advanced techniques were developed. It shows the power of modern technologies to solve historical problems. This underlines the need for continued investment into research and the development of new tools, both in South Africa and worldwide.</p><p>Our study also strongly advocates for the preservation of diverse fungal cultures for extended periods of time, regardless of their perceived importance at the time they are collected. The lack of accessible culture collections for lesser-known fungi, in South Africa and internationally, highlights the need for innovative approaches to safeguard these invaluable resources.

This was not a glad sight for my grandfather. He was dribbling fire across the forest floor from a lit wick on a long handle, as he always did in autumn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was outlawed in Victorian state forests after the appointment in 1908 of a Conservator of Forests, and the subsequent creation in 1918 of the Forests Commission Victoria.</p><p>The commission's first chair was a young Welsh-born and English-trained forester named Owen Jones. He was intent on preserving forests and suppressing fires. His commission's inspectors went out to apply the law.</p><p>My grandfather snuffed out his flame and put spurs to The General, hurdling logs and fences to reach his property a few kilometres away, where he called urgently for my grandmother to load a cart with calves while he stripped his mount of the saddle.</p><p>And so, with the load of calves drawn by a cart horse, my grandparents set off, an apparently innocent farm couple heading to the monthly livestock</p><p>market, reducing the poor inspector to powerless frustration when he caught up with them.</p><p>The inspector and cattlemen such as my grandfather were at impossible cross purposes. The official was doing the best he could under the rules of the time to protect the landscape.</p><p>My grandfather, who held a lease to run cattle in the forest, was doing what he could to promote the growth of fresh grass among the trees. He was using \"cool\" slow fire to prevent much more destructive hot fire.</p><p>My father, when he was 14, accidentally set a fire leaping while he was herding cattle through that same forest. I have him on video telling the story before he died.</p><p>He finished, nonchalantly, by relating that the fire ran only until \"it reached the next burnt patch\".</p><p>His family burnt the forest in a mosaic pattern, year on year, meaning a major fire couldn't get a good run before it ran out of fuel.</p><p>\"Who taught you that?\" I asked my father. He acknowledged his family must have learned it from the Aboriginal people who lived and hunted across south-west Victoria until families like ours sailed in.</p><p>White Australians began to understand only relatively recently a bit about the sophisticated firestick stewardship of the land by Australia's Indigenous people.</p><p>Bill Gammage's 2011 work, The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines Made Australia, put together evidence of how the intelligent use of fire had shaped the land's ability to support life without the catastrophic bushfires that have become familiar to us.</p><p>Gammage, a historian at the Australian National University, found a common description of the Australian landscape among the first Europeans to arrive was that of a \"gentleman's estate in England\".</p><p>Those first Europeans wrote of wide grassed valleys alive with the yellow flowers of murnong, or yam daisies, open woodlands and bountiful wildlife. Forested areas had nothing like the tangled understory that we consider today to be \"untouched wilderness\".</p><p>All of it, Gammage proposed, was sculpted by flame before colonisation meant that Indigenous people could no longer tend much of their country and the land became overgrown and exposed to uncontrolled fires.</p><p>Today's fire management authorities have, of course, returned to significant programs of strategic planned burning as part of their array of techniques to try to prevent wild fires. Victoria's Bushfire Risk Management Report for 2021-22 shows Forest Fire Management Victoria and the Country Fire Authority completed 435 planned burns across 65,480 hectares, with a further 16,058 hectares of fuel slashed or mowed and 741 kilometres of fire breaks built or upgraded.</p><p>It sounds impressive - until you consider Victoria has about 8.2 million hectares of forest.</p><p>Australia has changed so profoundly in a couple of hundred years - with dramatically increased population, farmland abutting forests, tree-changers valuing bushland around their homes, environmentalists wishing to protect the habitats of native animals and settled communities averse to smoke hazes - that it seems all but impossible to imagine returning to a system whose roots pre-date European settlement.</p><p>And now, topping everything, climate change has massively increased the risk of uncontrolled fires.</p><p>This week's brief bushfires in Gippsland burnt out perhaps a third as much country as authorities burned on purpose across the state in 2021-22 to reduce fuel loads. They are suspected to have occurred when fires lit by property owners trying to clear their land of fuel ahead of the \"normal\" fire-danger period got away when unexpected heat and wind hit.</p><p>And then they were extinguished by a sudden flood. Could the climate be any more viciously ironic?</p><p>As we are drawn into a new El Nino and who knows what terror from our changing climate, my grandfather's exploits seem pretty tame, if</p><p>not desirable.</p><p>Sometimes, I remember the soft grass underfoot that was still in that canopied forest when I was a child in the 1950s, and I yearn a bit for it, knowing much bushland now, despite the \"strategic burning\" here and there, sits deep in fallen branches and peeled bark and tangled scrub, waiting ...</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7s9k6ovkw3q1amia5ev1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69B9-74P1-F0J6-J02P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

These feedstocks in part come from the waste generated in large forest fire prevention activities to reduce risk of wildfires that have become a critical challenge in California in recent years.\u00a0 This project will produce a commercial grade bioethanol, while at the same time contributing to the reduction of carbon released into the atmosphere from the massive wildfires that have severely impacted the environment and residents in California.</p><p>The parties are committed to develop a first project then continue to expand their cellulosic ethanol footprint within California and to other locations all around North America, utilizing local woody biomass materials to supply low-carbon biofuels into the North American market.</p><p>\"Allotrope is excited to continue its efforts to develop a series of advanced biofuels projects in California in partnership with Sumitomo and Axens,\" noted Marc Stuart, CEO of Allotrope Partners LLC. \u00a0\"Axen's Futurol(TM) \u00a0technology is ready for commercial scale roll out and Sumitomo will be a valuable partner across the entire project development process, from feedstock sourcing to the sale of final products into the markets.\"</p><p>Bioethanol is currently attracting attention in countries worldwide striving for carbon-neutral societies as a renewable energy source and as a feedstock for biofuels such as SAF*1 and bio-chemicals. Cellulosic bioethanol made from woody biomass is classified as \"Advanced Bioethanol*2\" by the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) program and \"Cellulosic Fuel\" by the US EPA Renewable Fuel Standard, which has the potential to scale sustainably, and with low Carbon Intensity when compared to other fuels and blending components available on the market today.</p><p>\"The commitment from the Allotrope and Sumitomo teams to deploy Axens Futurol(TM)\u00a0 technology at multiple US plants and to utilize a wide variety of woody biomass feedstocks is another great example that the low carbon marketplace values both the flexibility of the Futurol(TM) technology and Axens' significant technology de-risking achievements. We believe each organization brings complementary strengths to this relationship, and, together, we can make meaningful contributions to reduce the Carbon Intensity of the transportation sector, utilizing ethanol as a renewable energy carrier for gasoline blending and potentially SAF and bio-chemicals production,\" said Frederic Balligand, Vice Pesident, Axens Renewables Product Line.</p><p>Accordingly, the three companies will be studying the possibility of an initial plant to produce about 60,000 tons of bioethanol derived from local feedstocks. The project shall consider carbon recycling initiatives that contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society, such as CCU*2 using carbon-neutral, biogenic CO2 generated naturally during bioethanol production, internal energy production, and effective utilization of residues from the fermentation process including Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) production.</p><p>\"SCOA is pleased to partner with Axens and Allotrope in this landmark project and will contribute to this study by consolidating and applying the knowledge and skills of the Sumitomo Corporation Group acquired through various businesses. This includes the development and deployment of carbon-free energy using hydrogen, ammonia, and next-generation biomass, raw fuel gas, and by promoting the use of green chemicals to construct a circular economy,\" said Sandro Hasegawa, General Manager, SCOA EIIA.</p><p>Allotrope Partners LLC invests in projects and companies engaged in the clean economy transition. The company has had an active local presence in the Northern California biomass community for over a decade, engaging with foresters, farming organizations, lumber production and biomass power producers. Through its partnership with Axens, the Company has identified a pipeline of bioethanol plants in proximity to local woody materials.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBTSRW-202307262030AllotropePartnersLLCAxensNorthAmericaandSumitomoCorporationofAmericastoStudyCommercialProductionofLowCarbonBiofuelUsingWoodyBiomassfromForestThinninginCalifornia</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBTSRW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YK-P4S1-F0HT-94JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484196</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 News Bites Pty Ltd.

Catholics refused to fight while Protestants marched off to an adventure that soured horribly.</p><p>The second war's atrocities left a ferocious bitterness it took generations to overcome.</p><p>Numerous individual stories underscore this history.</p><p>And lest we forget.</p><p>Two little-known Geelong stories, however, provide an enlightening take on the human condition, its allegiances and society and perhaps even a positive way forward from the crucible of war.</p><p>The first story is one we'll find out more about when Geelong academic Dzavid Haveric's latest book is published later this year.</p><p>His story is actually a collection of stories. Up to a hundred stories of Muslim soldiers demonstrating their loyalty, patriotism and contribution to the Australian Army, and sharing their experience with Australian non-Muslims.</p><p>\"While soldiers were excluded in public life because of White Australia Policy which also denied their ethno-religious identity, in the Australian Army they found equality and mateship,\" says Dr Haveric.</p><p>\"They were dedicated to fight together with non-Muslims for Australia and betterment of a new generation.\" That's really something. The Army leading the charge on multiculturalism. The second story is also one of humanity, as well as redemption. In 1942, Japanese pilot Nobuo Fujita flew along the Surf Coast from Cape Otway to Torquay, the Bellarine Peninsula and Melbourne in a plane assembled from a submarine in Bass Strait. He was spotted by defence personnel at Laverton and Williamstown but escaped unscathed.</p><p>Fujita undertook similar recces over Hobart and New Zealand, as well as Suva and American Samoa. He was the only person to bomb the US mainland in WWII, dropping incendiary bombs and starting a forest fire in Oregon that killed a small group of people on a church outing. Years later, in 1962, ashamed of his war attacks, he revisited the town, Brookings, to try to apologise.</p><p>He wanted to strike up a US-Japanese friendship that might help prevent war in the future. He donated money for books on Japan for kids to read. A 400-year-old samurai sword he took with him was also presented to the local library.

It typically brings hot and dry conditions to Southeast Asia, in contrast to La Nina's wetter and cooler weather.</p><p>Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said last weekend several districts of Central Java, the country's main rice-producing region, were already in drought.</p><p>\"Drought has been experienced by residents of Kendalsari Village, Kemalang Sub-district, Klaten Regency, where 4360 residents are facing difficulties in obtaining clean water,\" BNPB spokesman Abdul Muhari said.</p><p>In at least three other Central Java districts local authorities have had to send in tankers to supply villagers with fresh water.</p><p>With the rice production season running from June to October, most of Central Java has a low chance of rainfall, with predictions of less than 90 per cent or below 50mm until next month, according to the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG).</p><p>BMKG forecasts that next month drought will have expanded from Java to the southern part of Sumatra. By August, almost all of Indonesia will be suffering from low rainfall The National Research and Innovation Agency predicts the drought will slash rice production this year by a million tonnes.</p><p>Agriculture Minister Syahrul Yasin Limpo established a quick response taskforce to anticipate El Nino by ensuring better water management and offering drought-tolerant rice seedlings, but President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, took no chances and insisted on the importation of two million tonnes of rice.</p><p>\"The State Logistics Agency and Food Agency are preparing themselves by strengthening its rice reserves. We shouldn't be in a situation where, during a long dry season, we are confused about buying rice from Thailand, Vietnam, India or Pakistan, only to find that there is no supply,\" Jokowi said.</p><p>On Saturday, 132ha of forest were burned in South Kalimantan, Borneo, affecting six districts and a city, state news agency Antara reported. Local police said they were investigating alleged illegal land burning.</p><p>According to the Indonesian government's monitoring dashboard, more than 28,000ha of forest has burned so far this year, releasing more than 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.</p><p>The 2015 forest fire raged through 2.6 million hectares in Sumatra and Kalimantan, costing $US16bn in Indonesia and resulting in 40,000 to 100,000 additional deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.</p><p>The annual problem continued to appear throughout Jokowi's first term, embarrassing him during visits to Malaysia and Singapore. Forest lost to fire has declined from 1.7 million hectares in 2019 to 204,000ha last year.</p><p>But the Singapore Institute of International Affairs said it had raised a red alert over the likelihood of a severe haze affecting Southeast Asia. \"There has been a positive tone of co-operation between ASEAN countries on the haze, and between governments and the private sector, which has improved in the past few years. But we are now facing a time of stress testing. It remains to be seen if this co-ordination can be maintained in the coming months,\" SIIA chairman Simon Tay said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-aa4b927613e911eeb587affffc3b390cb18bd8575626b45b1b34d6275ed8d777</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JP-8M91-F0JP-W2V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 27, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp;

It typically brings hot and dry conditions to Southeast Asia, in contrast to La Nina's wetter and cooler weather.</p><p>Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said last weekend several districts of Central Java, the country's main rice-producing region, were already in drought. </p><p>\"Drought has been experienced by residents of Kendalsari Village, Kemalang Sub-district, Klaten Regency, where 4360 residents are facing difficulties in obtaining clean water,\" BNPB spokesman Abdul Muhari said.</p><p>In at least three other Central Java districts local authorities have had to send in tankers to supply villagers with fresh water.</p><p>With the rice production season running from June to October, most of Central Java has a low chance of rainfall, with predictions of less than 90 per cent or below 50mm until next month, according to the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG).</p><p>BMKG forecasts that next month drought will have expanded from Java to the southern part of Sumatra. By August, almost all of Indonesia will be suffering from low rainfall</p><p>The National Research and Innovation Agency predicts the drought will slash rice production this year by a million tonnes.</p><p>Agriculture Minister Syahrul Yasin Limpo established a quick response taskforce to anticipate El Nino by ensuring better water management and offering drought-tolerant rice seedlings, but President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, took no chances and insisted on the importation of two million tonnes of rice. </p><p>\"The State Logistics Agency and Food Agency are preparing themselves by strengthening its rice reserves. We shouldn't be in a situation where, during a long dry season, we are confused about buying rice from Thailand, Vietnam, India or Pakistan, only to find that there is no supply,\" Jokowi said.</p><p>On Saturday, 132ha of forest were burned in South Kalimantan, Borneo, affecting six districts and a city, state news agency Antara reported. Local police said they were investigating alleged illegal land burning. </p><p>According to the Indonesian government's monitoring dashboard, more than 28,000ha of forest has burned so far this year, releasing more than 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.</p><p>The 2015 forest fire raged through 2.6 million hectares in Sumatra and Kalimantan, costing $US16bn in Indonesia and resulting in 40,000 to 100,000 additional deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. </p><p>The annual problem continued to appear throughout Jokowi's first term, embarrassing him during visits to Malaysia and Singapore. Forest lost to fire has declined from 1.7 million hectares in 2019 to 204,000ha last year. </p><p>But the Singapore Institute of International Affairs said it had raised a red alert over the likelihood of a severe haze affecting Southeast Asia.</p><p>\"There has been a positive tone of co-operation between ASEAN countries on the haze, and between governments and the private sector, which has improved in the past few years. But we are now facing a time of stress testing. It remains to be seen if this co-ordination can be maintained in the coming months,\" SIIA chairman Simon Tay said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Several aircraft were also called in to assist in the fight, including two fixed-wing bombers.</p><p>On Sunday, firefighters conducted a back burn in the northeast sector to stop the fire affecting the Newell Highway. \"We also contracted three large air tankers to make one drop each [over the blaze],\" Inspector McDevitt said.</p><p>He said about 85 per cent of the blaze was state forest, which \"according to local knowledge, has no history of fires in the past fifty years.\"</p><p>The blaze, located on some of the highest country between West Wyalong and Forbes also narrowly missed destroying a vital telecommunications tower.</p><p>Inspector McDevitt said aerial support enabled crews to protect the tower which provides Telstra, Vodafone and Optus services to the surrounding communities.</p><p>With the fire now at patrol status, and stubble burning season kicking into gear and a hot forecast ahead, Inspector McDevitt reminds farmers to be vigilant.</p><p>\"Despite the rainfall we had on Sunday evening across the Bland-Temora Zone, Temora received up to 115mm rain, but the fireground [at West Wyalong] only received about 1.5mm,\" he said. \"Landholders undertaking any hazard reduction or permit burning need to be compliant with the conditions on the permit.</p><p>\"They need to be mindful of the weather conditions and to review them prior to them lighting up.</p><p>\"They also need to have sufficient resources to manage the fire and ensure their mineral earth breaks are in place and avoid vegetation that would carry fire as much as possible.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a fire that broke out at the Tallimba tip on Monday has been contained.</p><p>But with the tip closed until further notice, residents are being asked to take their trash to West Wyalong or Weethalle instead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYADR-doc7pcfdyhqhwg1forrz1aq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYADR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67SM-1GK1-JD34-V2JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386167</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wagga Daily Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
