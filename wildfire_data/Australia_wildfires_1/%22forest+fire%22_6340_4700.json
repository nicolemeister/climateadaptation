The capital, Jakarta, is likely to be seriously smoke-affected by fires in central Java within one or two days.</p><p>Haze levels in Jakarta increased dramatically yesterday as smoke from at least three mountain fires moved across the city and the skyline disappeared beneath the smog.</p><p>A major forest fire was raging near tribal settlements in Malaysia's central Pahang State. Estimates of the area affected ranged from 200 to 2,000 hectares, far smaller than fires in neighbouring Indonesia, but efforts to douse the blaze were hampered by the drought.</p><p>Indonesian forest fires affecting up to 800,000 hectares have generated a thick smoky haze which has blanketed Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and parts of the Philippines and Thailand.</p><p>Indonesian officials appealed to villagers not to shoot tigers and monkeys fleeing fires in national parks around Mount Tumpeng, Mount Merbabu and Mount Malabar in Java.</p><p>The Health Minister, Mr Sujudi, said: \"I think the haze has now reached a dangerous level in terms of breathing difficulty. This situation is endangering people's health.\"</p><p>Experts at the fire response centre said critical smoke conditions, with visibility of less than 100 metres, continued to affect many areas of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Smoke from fires in Irian Jaya had now moved westwards, causing the closure of the airport in Ambon.</p><p>At least five people have died from respiratory problems linked to the haze, 236 people perished last week when a Garuda Airbus crashed in thick smoke, and in Irian Jaya 295 people have died of starvation and cholera due to the drought. Smoke from forest fires in Irian Jaya has prevented air drops of emergency supplies to the hardest-hit mountain villages.</p><p>The new fire in the Mount Rinjani national park on the island of Lombok is particularly worrying for Indonesia's tourist industry as many tour groups had been redirected to Lombok and Bali as airports closed in the worst-affected areas of Kalimantan and Sumatra.</p><p>The Antara newsagency said hundreds of hectares of the park were on fire. Indonesia's eastern islands are more vulnerable than other parts of the country because the monsoon rains normally arrive later than in the west. Meteorologists said some rain had fallen in northern Sumatra and wind patterns were easing conditions for Singapore and Malaysia, but sufficient rain to douse the fires was unlikely to fall until late October or November.</p><p>Yesterday was the deadline for 176 companies to prove they had not deliberately lit forest fires for clearing purposes. Officials said three companies had already been prosecuted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: No smoke without fire . . . an Indonesian farmer burns off undergrowth in Sintang, 1,000 kilometres north-east of Jakarta, where farmers are clearing the land for spring planting.

And after that may well come the fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last summer's heavy rains have transformed large parts of the middle of Australia, with sparse desert replaced by waist or even shoulder-high grass in places.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It might look spectacular, but it also means Australia faces the prospect of huge fires burning for months across its centre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Experts say the season could be a repeat of the summer of 1974-75, when fires throughout central Australia razed 117 million hectares 15 per cent of the continent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Millions of hectares could burn, bushfire expert Phil Cheney said.</p><p>All it takes is a lightning strike to set the grass alight, and once a wildfire takes hold it's very difficult to put out.</p><p>``They will be very difficult to contain,'' said Mr Cheney, the former head of the CSIRO's bushfire research unit.</p><p>``It's likely to burn for months.</p><p>``It will be in the tens of millions of hectares.''</p><p>Heavy rain through Australia's centre has sparked prolific grass growth. It's now curing, or drying out, after recent drier weather.</p><p>The thick band of grass extends from the Indian Ocean in the west to the Pacific Ocean in southern Queensland and the Great Dividing Range in NSW.</p><p>``Essentially we've got a fuel bed that stretches from Sydney to Carnarvon, it goes right across the nation,'' the assistant chief operations officer (country) at Western Australia's Fire &amp; Emergency Services Authority, Chris Arnol, said.</p><p>The Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) warns of the potential for above-normal bushfire activity across the middle of Australia, with grass fires posing the biggest risk this season.</p><p>``We need to be particularly vigilant this year because grass fires start very easily, particularly once the grass is what's termed cured,'' Bushfire CRC deputy CEO and research director Richard Thornton said.</p><p>``They can start very easily, they travel very rapidly and are very difficult to warn about.''</p><p>Bushfire expert and former CSIRO principal research scientist David Packham believes huge grass fires are almost a certainty in the centre of Australia, if not this year then next year.</p><p>``The centre, as everybody knows, has had heaps of rain, there's heaps of growth and they are going to have heaps of fires,'' Mr Packham said.</p><p>``I would expect massive fires in the centre.''</p><p>Several fires have already broken out in central Australia, which doesn't have a fire season every year.</p><p>``Central Australia is a slightly unusual event. This is probably a one-in-30-year event in central Australia,'' Bushfires Northern Territory director Steve Sutton said.</p><p>``Central Australia is likely to continue with fires right through until the autumn, and we will have fires for most of that time,'' he said.</p><p>Mr Sutton said Central Australia's variable winds could fan fire fronts spread over as much as 70km.</p><p>Grass fires can develop into quite significant fires in a matter of minutes, ACT Rural Fire Service chief officer Andrew Stark warned.</p><p>Days of low humidity and strong winds bring an increased risk of bad grass fires, bringing trees down on power lines.</p><p>``So many times right across Australia whenever you see one grass fire occurring in an area often you get a number of grass fires, and that'll be the challenge,'' Mr Stark said.</p><p>Experts say the general trend is that if there's a serious grass season, it's usually a mild forest fire season.</p><p>But as Victoria knows only too well after the Black Saturday bushfires, the bush can be just as volatile.</p><p>``With the right weather conditions coming together dry, hot, windy conditions you're going to get a bushfire risk, you're going to get a grass fire risk under those conditions,'' NSW Rural Fire Brigade Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said.</p><p>In Western Australia, 80 per cent of the state faces the potential for above-average bushfire activity, much of it in grassland and pastoral areas in more isolated locations.</p><p>But Mr Arnol said a key issue remained the forested ``urban interface'' area in the southwest corner despite the forecast of normal bushfire activity there.</p><p>``A normal activity in our lower southwest still means that we will be facing the potential for significant fires coastal, heathland and forest,'' he said.</p><p>While the soil is moist in forested areas, it will only take a run of very hot days to quickly dry out the forests.</p><p>``There's still a big risk,'' Dr Thornton said.</p><p>``You should never be complacent of fire, particularly in Victoria or in NSW or any of those really hot places because forest fires are always a possibility.</p><p>``But this year particularly, grass fires will be a bigger issue than they have been in the past.''</p><p>Dr Thornton says the Bushfire CRC's reports are not a prediction that there will be fires but that there is a greater likelihood of fires.</p><p>There are no crystal balls to say how the season will actually pan out, South Australian Country Fire Service manager operations services Rob Sandford said.</p><p>And no-one can control the weather.</p><p>``If we get hot, really dry, windy weather, that will increase the risk because of the fuel loads right across the state and right across the nation,'' Mr Sandford said.</p><p>Outback station owners, who've already been through tough times with the drought, will be in the frontline if there are major fires across the centre, Mr Packham said.</p><p>But he said many were probably ``on their knees'' and not in a position to buy graders and to have sufficient people around to deal with the fires.</p><p>``The fires are fast-moving. These people know how to deal with them, it's just that they haven't got the resources,'' Mr Packham said.</p><p>``They need government assistance . . . to have sufficient resources to be able to deal with them.''</p><p>Fire authorities have been talking about the risks this fire season, but the concern is that memories have faded since the last bad grass fire season, and for some reason the community thinks a grass fire isn't as bad as a bushfire.</p><p>``A lot of people say it's only a grass fire. It can travel very, very rapidly, it can change direction very rapidly and can catch people by surprise,'' Dr Thornton said.</p><p>Mr Sandford said everyone needed a bushfire action plan even if they thought they didn't live in a bushfire-prone area, saying people who lived in the suburbs around Australia would at some stage drive through a fire zone.</p><p>``People that live there need one, but everyone needs one to ensure their best chances of survival,'' he said.</p><p>``History shows that bushfires are a huge threat in the community and tragically people do die when these events occur.''</p><p>--AAP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-GAT201110011028816116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53XY-VT51-JD3N-52HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - First Edition Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>October 1, 2011 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Both counts relate to fires started at Churchill last Saturday.</p><p>The man was also charged with possessing child pornography.</p><p>Police sources revealed last night that he had been under surveillance for days and had been arrested quietly on Thursday before neighbours suspected he was a target.</p><p>\"They want to hang him,\" a Gippsland policeman said.</p><p>Police and prison officials decided to move the man to Melbourne for his own safety. He was in protective custody last night and will appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday.</p><p>\"There are prisoners who have lost relatives in the fires,\" a Corrections Victoria source said.</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Dannye Moloney said: \"We have a very emotive environment out there. People are pointing fingers. People are jumping to conclusions. Rumours and innuendoes are being spread.\"</p><p>In other developments:</p><p>- Former Supreme Court judge Bernard Teague will head the royal commission on the fires. It is scheduled to deliver an interim report before the end of the year and a final report by July 2010.</p><p>- Families of those who died in the fires will be given a $10,000 bereavement grant from the $100million so far raised by the bushfire appeal. The grant is the first allocation from the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund, which will be administered by a panel headed by former Victorian governor John Landy.</p><p>- A group of forest fire experts accused Environment Minister Gavin Jennings of trying to deceive the public over fire-reduction burning.</p><p>- Hundreds of tradesmen and planners have offered help to rebuild more than 1800 homes destroyed in the fires, leaving 7000 people homeless.</p><p>- The first six of up to 20 Indonesian forensic police will arrive in Melbourne tomorrow to help identify bodies of fire victims, a task that could take six months.</p><p>- The Department of Sustainability and Environment's chief fire officer, Ewan Waller, said authorities expected to be battling the major fires for at least another two weeks.</p><p>Premier John Brumby declined to comment on yesterday's arrest, but said arson was an unspeakable and heinous crime.</p><p>The charge of arson causing death carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' jail, while intentionally lighting a bushfire has a penalty of up to 15 years.</p><p>It is understood police found child pornography images on computer files belonging to the suspected Gippsland arsonist on Thursday afternoon. He was arrested around 4pm and held overnight for his own safety while investigators searched his house.</p><p>He was not present at his remand hearing in the Morwell Magistrates Court yesterday and did not apply for bail.</p><p>His legal aid lawyer said the man was in a \"fragile mental state\".</p><p>Two of the accused man's supporters in court during the remand hearing later told journalists to \"back off\". As police escorted a van carrying the accused out of the court complex, locals hurled abuse and struck the van.</p><p>Meanwhile, investigators confirmed that the fire that wiped out the town of Marysville and nearby Narbethong, killing up to 100 people, began around 2.30pm last Saturday near the abandoned Murrindindi sawmill, south of Yea.</p><p>Forensic examination indicates the fire was deliberately lit. Police appealed for anyone who visited a popular swimming and camping spot near the mill site in Wilhelmina Falls Road on Saturday to contact them urgently.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Paul Hollowood, of the Phoenix taskforce, said: \"We believe the mill site is ground zero ... This was not an attempt to burn down the mill but a deliberate attempt to create a bushfire on a massive scale.\"</p><p>After touring the razed towns of Marysville and Kinglake, Major-General John Cantwell, the man in charge of leading Victoria's bushfire recovery effort, said yesterday the destruction ranked \"alongside some of the worst I've seen in combat\".

We're at the World Science Festival, and on stage, as the lights come up, is what looks like a large Tasmanian tiger. And it's moving. The audience is hushed as it watches, because the tiger is supposed to be extinct. Then they realise it's a giant marionette. This is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis>, on Bringing Them Back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So you've seen a living Tasmanian tiger. He actually did a poo backstage. Bringing Them Back, the de-extinction debate. And in blunt terms we are losing nature before our very eyes, whole ecosystems gone with largely unknown consequences. The much talked about sixth extinction. Is it the one caused by humanity? Tragically the world has lost many of its animal species the last two centuries, and there is no sign of that trend easing. A recent World Wide Fund for Nature report states that since 1970, less than 50 years ago, human activity has wiped out 60% of Earth's wildlife, covering mammals, birds, fish...90% of fish gone. Reptiles and amphibians, not to mention the devastating loss of insects worldwide reported last month. It seems no place on Earth is immune and time is running out for conservation.</p><p>So what does modern conservation science look like, and should everything be on the table for consideration, including the option of reviving what has gone? With new genetic technologies we are not that far from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> idea of de-extinction becoming science fact. But will it ever be possible or practical to revive extinct species to save biodiversity and perhaps ourselves in the process? And if so, where do we start? And who decides what to save?</p><p>Our first guest is a leading expert on wildlife reproduction management from the Leibnitz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin. Since 1997 his team have been working to rescue the northern white rhino from the brink of extinction, made harder by the recent loss of the species' last male. Welcome to the stage, Thomas Hildebrandt.</p><p>Next we welcome executive director of the Institute for Future Environments and a professor across the river at the Queensland University of Technology. Her two decades leading research into the science and policy of conservation has attracted numerous awards, including the Prime Minister's Prize for Life Scientist of the Year, and the Australian Academy of Science Nancy Millis Medal. Kerrie Wilson.</p><p>Hailing from the University of Melbourne, our next guest is an Associate Professor and ARC Future Fellow whose lab recently sequenced the genome of the extinct thylacine or Tasmanian tiger, the one you saw. In developing genetic tools to help conserve current marsupial species, their ultimate aim is to revive the iconic thylacine itself. Welcome Andrew Pask.</p><p>And our final guest is a senior research fellow at Griffith University's Environmental Futures Research Institute. Its work is international, to counter the illegal wildlife trade. Just back from Namibia, welcome Duan Biggs.</p><p>Well, there's the problem. Kerrie, I mentioned the sixth extinction. Are we in it, do you take it seriously?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes, we take it seriously. So 66 million years ago we had a similar extinction event, and about 25 years ago scientists started to think, you know, something is going on here, and we started taking note. They estimated about 25 years ago that we were losing species at around 10,000 times quicker than what we would in the background rate of species loss.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And in this circumstance should all avenues, all different techniques be open to science to try?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> That's an interesting question. Every tool in your tool shed comes with a cost, and it comes with a benefit. And so we need to throw every tool at this question, but we also need to just unpack what do those tools look like and what will be the consequences associated with them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And you'd like a debate, people discussing these things.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes, absolutely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Thomas, during the extinction debate we are talking about saving things before they go away, disappear, and with rhinos you've just got a couple left. What're you going to do? You've got two females.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, the northern white rhino is declared as a subspecies of the southern white rhino. It lives in central Africa and it was a very important landscape architect before it was declared in 2006 as extinct in the wild. Now there are only two females left, a mother and a daughter, Najin and Fatu. Both are infertile so actually that's the end of the story. Not fully because we have stored semen from four different males over the last 20 years, and we have fibroblast culture from 12 non-related individuals. So using the tool box of modern conservation technology we are capable of generating embryos from northern white rhinos by using the oocytes from these two females and the semen, which is cold preserved, and using surrogates mothers like southern white rhinos to produce northern white rhino offspring. We then use these two females to educate the offspring to be a northern white rhino, which is a very important element, the social education. We think this program is quite sound and we hope to be successful within the next three years with the first calf on the ground.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And how long does it take to educate the baby?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> It has to live with the two remaining northern white rhinos to understand what it means to be a northern white rhino because a genome provides all of the morphology, all the physiology, but the knowledge, the social part is also very important and therefore it is a time pressing project because these two females, one is 18, one is 29, so time is running out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You mentioned fibroblasts there, bits of tissue. What do you do with them?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, fibroblasts are parts of the skin, you put them in cell culture and then they propagate, and when they propagate we call them fibroblasts. And in 2012 there was a Nobel Prize for transforming these cells into stem cells.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Stem cells, we can do anything, theoretically.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> That needs quite a lot of research. Right now the mouse is the most advanced model. To transfer all this knowledge to a rhino or to an elephant or to a marsupial, that is quite a challenging task.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And apart from white rhinos, what sort of other collections have you got of these sperm and eggs and so on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> We have a comparable collection of biomaterial, like the frozen zoo in San Diego. So for us, even though Sudan died in March 2018, we declare him not as dead because we still have life elements from him, we have semen from him, we have fibroblasts from him, so there are all these blueprints to make a new Sudan is in our bank.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> It's amazing, isn't it, the progress.</p><p>Andrew, we heard about the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger. I think it was Mike Archer's voice we heard talking about the attempt they made a few years ago, at the Australian Museum, and at that stage we did a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Catalyst</emphasis> program and my partner described it as trying to make some sentences out of alphabet soup, trying to stitch this stuff together. Is it still as hard as all that was back then?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> We've actually rebuilt the entirely thylacine genome in my lab now, so we do have that complete blueprint of what it was to make a thylacine.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Astounding, isn't it. Where did you get the original DNA from?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> This one actually came from one of the Museum Victoria specimens, so it was one of the very few pickled pouch young. So it was a little baby thylacine that was removed from its mum's pouch, the mum was shot as part of the bounty scheme that they had in Tasmania at the time. So they were offering \u00a31 to bring pelts in, which was a huge amount of money back in the early 1900s, to bring in these specimens. And this mum had three babies in her pouch, and so they took each of them. But for some reason we still don't know, they would normally put these into formalin, which is actually very bad for the DNA, but these three miracle pups, we like to call them, went straight into ethanol and that actually preserved the DNA a lot better which meant we were able to get some really, really high quality long bits of DNA from these animals, which makes building that genome a lot easier, and we can be much more sure of the final genome that we have really representing what the thylacine DNA looks like.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And we've just seen a re-enactment on stage. Andrew, imagine you're looking at the offspring and they're alive. How would you feel?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Just blown away. I think it would be such an amazing thing if we could do that, to actually bring a species back, but particularly the thylacine. I think it's such an amazing marsupial species. It's completely unique. It was our only apex predator marsupial that lived into modern times. We don't have anything that sits at the top of the food chain like the thylacine does in any of our other marsupial species. It really was completely unique in every way, from its dog-like shape, the way it moved, its behaviour, right the way through to its hunting behaviours. It really was just an amazing animal that we unfortunately completely wiped from existence.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, and there was a bounty on them and that was quite recently, one or two generations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Yes, and they were aggressively hunted to extinction, as you could imagine, when there is that sort of price put on their head.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So Duan, you're working in Southern Africa, in Namibia, South Africa itself. What are the cultural feelings there about such creatures which still linger and which we want to preserve, how do local people react to what you're trying to do?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Yes, I think that's an important question and I think relevant, as Kerrie raised, de-extinction is one of the tools in the toolbox but there's a whole complex process of discussion and negotiation that needs to take place for it to be evaluated. And I was recently in Botswana, which is the country that sits between Namibia and South Africa, and there, as many of the audience here may have heard, there's been a recent furore because the government wants to bring back hunting of elephants included, and a lot in the international community are saying you cannot do that, that is wrong. Elephant hunting is morally wrong and you shouldn't do it. However, it's complex.</p><p>So in 2014 when hunting was banned there, the types of benefits that typically low income households and communities used to get from elephants disappeared, and also these people have to live with the costs of elephants. I'm not sure how many in the audience have lived with elephants but I have and they are great animals but if you are a small-scale farmer, they can be very damaging and they invoke a lot of fear. So now because of the hunting ban, people are not getting benefits and only living with the costs. And there was increasing antagonism towards these animals, and some of my colleagues in Botswana say increasing support for poaching activities of these animals because they were nuisance and only bringing costs.</p><p>So now Botswanan government is saying let's bring back hunting or talk about bringing back, and well managed hunting can support conservation of elephants and also support rural communities. However, many in the conservation sector internationally, animal welfare, animal rights groups are saying this is unacceptable. There are some big players calling for tourism boycotts of Botswana. So clearly in this complex issue, an animal we all love, like an elephant, we don't, as a conservation sector and as a society, have a good way of dealing with these issues, and it's going to be a similar challenge with de-extinction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Duan, how much time have we got to solve that problem?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> I think the sooner the better, there is urgency, because if you let problems like that lie, then you get a culture developing of antagonism towards wildlife. And there are places in Southern Africa where there is actually a culture of poaching evolves and that becomes the expected thing to do and that's not what we want to get to, so we need to move fast.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And you can get big money very quickly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Yes exactly, and those are low, low income places. But to bring us back to de-extinction, there are discussions around should we bring back the woolly mammoth and thylacine. There are people that are going to bear costs, and where is their voice in the discussion? And these are considerations, together with the ones that Kerry raised, that need careful thought.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Andrew, we have a Twitter question; what would be the surrogate animal to bring back the Tasmanian tiger?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think one of the nice things about marsupials is that they are born so small and then they complete their development in the mother's pouch. So you could actually use a variety of different marsupials to have that embryo be born from and transferred into a pouch of an eastern grey kangaroo or something that's very abundant. You'd have to work on something I guess that you have a lot of. But there's also really great artificial milk for rearing the marsupial pouch young from a very early age. They kind of need that first little few days in mum's pouch to get the good antibodies and things that come across from mum, but then after that you really can hand-rear them and that's done quite commonly for abandoned marsupials. So I think it's something that you could easily gestate in a largish type marsupial, have it go into the pouch, and then you could do that final stage of rearing with some of these artificial milks that we have.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Unlike a puppy, it's the size of a little worm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Exactly, so it's a lot easier for mum to give birth, and a lot easier for us when you're trying to do these sorts of de-extinction experiments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Getting to the next stage, some of the answers, let me just mention a book called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Clone a Mammoth</emphasis> by Beth Shapiro who lives in the States, and she's against cloning the mammoth, for two reasons. One of them is she suggests that you couldn't necessarily make it effectively by handling the DNA that one or two mistakes and you've got all sorts of huge problems. But overall the problem is one of the environment. How do you solve the problem of where it will go?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> There's a third aspect. To clone a mammoth you have to work with Asian elephants, and Asian elephants are CITES 1 animals and you are not allowed to do experiments on them. To modify an oocyte of Asian female is not allowed. So actually there is a legal aspect...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You can't have the surrogate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Yes, and also not the oocyte donor because that would be the first aspect, you need an oocyte from an Asian elephant, which you modify with CRISPR-Cas, it's a gene editing technique, that is actually by law not allowed. And then the other experiment would be the embryo transfer into an Asian elephant. That would be also not allowed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I've heard about artificial wombs. Is that serious, for an elephant or a mammoth?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> No, the artificial womb is only for the last fifth of the pregnancy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> That's enough.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> But what you do with the four-fifths before, the implantation? That is a totally different issue. So the artificial womb is developed for premature human babies to reduce the cost of having them in incubators, and that was shown in lambs very impressively, but it is the last part of the pregnancy. The implantation and the growing from the embryo to a foetus, nobody can do that artificially.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> That's still a couple of months, isn't it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> That's more, the pregnancy length is 22 months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, but the last part, the last fifth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> The last part would be maybe three months...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> In an artificial womb.\u00c2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> But then the 19 months, you have to use an Asian elephant, and that is not allowed. The number of Asian elephants is down to 30,000, it's a very fragile population. It's a totally different scenario to African elephants, and therefore I think it is very unrealistic that it will happen soon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I see. So, woolly mammoths. Passenger pigeons, I think there were 3 billion of them at one stage. If we recreated them, where would they go? The gastric brooding frog. Do you remember we had that actually on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature of Australia</emphasis> series, and the little creature gave birth because...in the stomach, all those eggs, brooding there, and then you've got these tiny frogs coming out of the parent's mouth, 40 of them running off. The most extraordinary sight. And then the actual frog became, it seems, extinct in Queensland. So what would you choose, which creatures to pick, number one or number two?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> The thylacine...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, I thought you'd say that!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> But I think the important thing here is the distinction between cloning as we know it and then de-extinction science as we are talking about here tonight. So the real big difference is that we can do animal cloning really well, we do this with sheep and cattle, tonnes of livestock species all the time, mice we are very proficient at it, humans if you believe the science last year, you can do all these sorts of things really robustly, but that's when you start off with a living cell. So you've already got that cell and all the chromosomes intact, and that's quite different to this process of de-extinction. You still need to have a living cell, that's something we still can't make as scientists. So what we have to do is start off with the template of another species and then really start to edit these differences onto that background genome.</p><p>So with the case of the mammoth you would take your Asian elephant DNA and then you would sequence your mammoth, find out where all the differences lie between their two genomes, and then you edit all of those differences onto your elephant background. So you're trying to turn your elephant DNA now into a mammoth DNA strand basically. Once you've got that, you've got your living cell now that is mammothised, and you can then inject that into an egg and then transfer that egg into a surrogate animal and then have it give birth to your extinct species.</p><p>But the thing that's really important for everybody to know and one of the things that Beth Shapiro is really against with the de-extinction debate, is what exactly is this animal going to look like that you bring back, how close to a real mammoth is that going to be, because we are engineering an elephant genome to look like a mammoth. But there's a lot of that space in the genome that we really don't understand that well still, and so there's a lot of work that still needs to be done in the background to really explore the genome more, start to understand more about how all those different changes are really profound and which ones really make a big difference, and then making the choice of going in and making those edits to recreate your extinct species.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, but Andrew, Duan, I want a dodo.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Correct, yes, I do want a dodo as well...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> What are you going to do for me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Well, you've got to get your cell of a closely related bird species that's still alive, so some sort of pigeon species, yes, and then the DNA in bird feathers is actually really well preserved and very intact, there's hundreds of dodo specimens. One of the things that this de-extinction science is really showing is the value of museum collections in particular. We can go into these museum collections now and we can collect tiny parts of that tissue and then sequence the entire genome and we can learn so much just from looking at that DNA. It's really staggering, the amount of information you can get from just having that blueprint in hand, but then you can start to really think about going down this road of then editing a closely related animal's genome.</p><p>The nice thing about the mammoth is it really is quite closely related to Asian elephants, and so there's not that many changes that need to be made. The thylacine doesn't have a really close living relative, so the closest would be a numbat, but they eat ants. So it's not the best genome to start with. The Tasmanian devil is a little bit further away, but it is at least a carnivore, so that might be something that's a little better to start off with, but they are the kinds of questions that we are exploring. And by doing this kind of science we're going down and figuring out exactly how onerous these tasks might be.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Well, I think if you're asking me personally, as a birdwatcher and speaking selfishly I would love to see a dodo, but that's just me. If I'm speaking as a scientist and informing how we as society should think about this, one way is to start with the already existing IUCN Red List, World Conservation Union red list, and it's what the global conservation community uses. You start on the one end with the species that's of least concern, something that might be vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild like the northern white rhino, and then extinct. And I think what we are talking about here, we're saying how far away is the dodo, how expensive is it, how risky is it, versus, say, something that's more recently extinct like the thylacine.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Kerrie, this is exactly where you come in because that's what you got your prizes for, looking at the landscape, what it costs, what's feasible. How are you going to make that decision and about which creatures and how?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> What I'd encourage the proponents of de-extinction to do is really sit back and go; what are you fundamentally trying to achieve here? So we've heard a couple of objectives being thrown around. I'm not getting a clear line on the objectives, I know that Duan just wants to get birdwatching, you've got your own objective. But fundamentally we want to bring a species back so that it can perform a role, an ecological role. What's the point of bringing back a species just for the sake of it? So the art and science of making a good decision is just being clear about what you're trying to achieve. And the trick to working out what we are trying to achieve is just keep asking why. Why do we want to do this? On average, if you ask why five times, you get to your fundamental objective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, I like wolves and I like to bring them back to national parks and I like to do that not just to look at them but because I think that what they do, even though they hunt elk or moose or whatever, what they're doing is bringing back a balance to the landscape so that the plants and the trees which were being shredded by those ungulates are now not so much, and you've got the balance restored.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> That's deeper ecology, we're going to bring back the species. That's understanding that that whole ecosystem...so there's part of making a good decision, you bring together that data, you bring together your model of your ecosystem, and then you start looking at your levers, you know, what activities could I take in order to get a better overall result for biodiversity in this extinction crisis that we are in. There are a range of activities that we could undertake. We could stop destroying the environment as it stands now, stop those damaging activities, through to we could work in the lab on these types of activities that we're talking about today. That sort of information all needs to be put on the table in order to make a good decision. Then the sweet spot is you can then start to look at what the trade-offs are, what are the opportunity costs associated with these things.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And can you experiment? Have you got time to experiment? Are people patient enough?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I would be really concerned about experimenting in this space, but there are consequences associated with reintroducing a species to an environment that it's been removed, around pathogens and disease spread, so experimentation in this space is costly, and it could potentially have flow-on effects for ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, I'm just thinking about the woolly mammoth, and if you look at the way the ice and glaciers are disappearing, where would they go if the permafrost is melting?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> One of the arguments of the pro-mammoth faction is that mammoths actually have such wide feet that they compress the snow in Siberia, and compressed snow melts less than normal snow, and so to avoid global warming that would be one very simple argument. But I think the mammoth project, it's more a scientific exercise than it is actually a conservation project. You have a lot of species which are close to the brink of extinction, we should focus on them. We have species which played a very important key role in ecosystems which we don't save or the conservation efforts we do right now, like protecting a habitat. One is the Sumatran rhino, the northern white rhino is nearly gone, the Javan rhino belongs to this group. So there are key species which are really important for ecosystems, and I think we should focus on them and not on a scientific exercise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Can I have one more wild idea? In Tasmania someone has suggested...a professor at the University of Tasmania, that because there is so much tinder in the forest and fires are all over the place, 85 fires in the winter in Tasmania, why not import elephants?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> I think Kerrie's point of thinking what the objective is, if it's to reduce the risk of forest fire there might be less controversial and simpler ways of getting there than introducing elephants to Tasmania.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Let's have another question from Twitter. How is this going to help us in the long term, especially concerning climate change, as it's a big issue now? Well, you've mentioned one aspect of the theoretical woolly mammoth, but looking after the animals, will it make a serious difference?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I can't answer the climate change, but I can give you another example. Central Africa has a very complex ecosystem, and disturbing this ecosystem, we have seen that on the west coast of Africa HIV was born there, Ebola was born there. We don't know really what it means losing such an important landscape architect in this very important habitat. Maybe bats travel out of this region and they carry a lot of nasty germs which have really devastating effects on humankind. And so I think it is also the human health, the one-world concept that we should keep these ecosystems intact to protect ourselves against these kind of new emerging diseases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I'll just give you an example of the scale of things that could happen. I broadcast actually research from Switzerland done by an international team, and that is they looked+ \u00c2 down from the sky and wondered how many trees there are on Earth, and the old-fashioned idea was 400 billion. And then they did not just from the sky but counting on the ground as well so that you could get a much more accurate figure, and it turned out to be there are 3 trillion. And there is room for another 1.2 trillion. There is room. In other words, if you planted these trees you would nearly solve the climate problem and you'd create far more complex ecosystem available. Does that turn you on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yep...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You could hardly say no.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> We talked about the tools in the toolbox. Those tools are out there, they are ready for us to use in the climate change arena, and I think increasingly the public is aware of these impacts. We are ready to go with that now, so let's get them off the shelf and start deploying those tools.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Indeed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think one of the interesting things with the climate change is currently it's happening too fast for animals to evolve and to keep up with such a rapid increase in temperature that we are seeing globally. But this is, again, one of those things where the de-extinction science, one of the fringe benefits that is coming from it is it's really pushing science forward in terms of our ability to generate artificial eggs and sperm and we can very quickly generate lots of species diversity or other ways that we can actually go in and edit animal genomes to introduce diversity to those backgrounds where you have really struggling species, and it can actually help really push the evolution of species to occur faster or more rapidly so we can help them actually start to respond to changes like this that happen so quickly in our environment now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, in a minute we will look at the difference between these various toolboxes and the ecosystem one. However, I'd like now to take a moment to acknowledge the important work carried out by museums around the world, and in particular in this instance the Queensland Museum network. Beyond the important role of connecting the public face-to-face with objects of our own and lost cultures, there are many scientists working behind-the-scenes undertaking important research, carrying out conservation projects, preserving objects and animals, to not only capture this moment in time but also to ensure our future is diverse and bright. So let's take a look inside the cupboards, drawers and labs of the Queensland Museum.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Video audio:</emphasis> The Queensland Museum houses a large collection of fauna specimens that document the biodiversity of Queensland and beyond. When changes become too great and the species becomes extinct in the wild, museum collections are one of the few places to see and study them.</p><p>Paradise parrots lived in open woodland and forests with a grassy understory. The last confirmed sighting was in 1927.</p><p>The last known the thylacine from the wild was captured in 1933 and died three years later.</p><p>The burrowing bettong is a small macropod that once lived in much of the arid and semiarid regions of the continent. These old museum skins are the only evidence that this species occurred in Queensland.</p><p>The last specimen of the desert rat kangaroo was collected from 1935, with reports occurring during some wet seasons up to 1975.</p><p>The Bramble Cay\u00c2 melomys occurred only on this small cay in the Torres Strait. After drastic inundation by ocean destroying its vegetation, the species is now declared extinct.</p><p>Extinctions have always occurred, but as humans impose their needs and expand their wants on the environment, so too the impact extends on the other species we share this continent with. And for many this impact is becoming too great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Queensland Museum. Last time I looked when I was president of the Australian Museum Trust, that's the Australian Museum in Sydney, I think more people went to museums than go to football matches. Is that still the case, do you know? Let's assume so. Cheers us up. But I saw a bettong there, not the one I was going to mention, the eastern bettong which I think was released around Canberra, and I think this rewilding, they did not survive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I guess that's the risks associated with these types of activities. And one of the considerations that doesn't often get airplay around rewilding is the ongoing effort that needs to be put into place to manage and maintain those populations, monitor them and evaluate how those populations are tracking. That's that long-term costing that usually isn't accounted for in conservation programs for some odd reason. This isn't just a one-off activity, these are long-term programs, and those programs are often funded on three-year cycles, really short-term funding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> This third part of our discussion is really about playing God, who decides. And Andrew and Thomas, can you outline the de-extinction proposal that you are hoping to get approved for funding by the new Elon Musk. There he goes again, Elon Musk, he's in space, he's doing electric cars and he is also involved in the Foundation for Extinct Animal Revival, known as Elon's FEAR. What's going on there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think there's a great quote from Mike Archer, he was one of the first people to attempt to sequence the thylacine genome, and so he said we were playing God when we wiped them off the face of the Earth, and I'd like to think that we are playing the part of clever humans by trying to bring them back. And that's very much the tactic that I take. We have a social responsibility, we exterminated the thylacine, but if we get the technology and it does become cheap enough...I think right now it's really too expensive to try and think about doing these projects, but when the technology becomes cheaper and more efficient, as it undoubtedly will, I think it's a very real discussion then about bringing these animals back and reintroducing them to the environment.</p><p>I think this is one of the things that makes the thylacine such a great poster-child for de-extinction, is that the Tasmanian wilderness is very similar to how it was in 1936 when the last animal went extinct. The animals that ate it are still there, it still could move back into that food chain and that ecological niche and really have somewhere you could reintroduce such a species. The bigger question is what is that species going to look like, how much of a thylacine is that actually going to be? And that's something we've got to explore I think.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> What is FEAR, that organisation?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I don't know, but I want their money so that we can do this. I think this should be their number one project.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I think we do not ideally fit into this scheme because we are working with species that are still alive or the biomaterial is still alive, and we use new technologies derived from regenerative medicine, like the stem cell technology, applying that to the conservation effort, and I think it's a little bit different approach, using advances, assisted reproduction, test-tube babies, surrogate mothers, and also stem cell technology to produce artificial gametes, which is a totally different field of research compared to the gene editing and the artificial making of extinct species. I think we are doing quite an important job by bringing back the key species which are on the top of any...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, but who decides that? How does someone select a species?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I think there are quite sound studies on service, on function of the southern white rhino in the southern hemisphere of Africa, so the white rhino plays a very important role in this area, and the same you can expect from central Africa, from the northern white rhino, which lived in a totally different environment, and hundreds of species are dependent or indirectly dependent on that. Only the faeces of a rhino provides hundreds of insect species. So it has the? which gives pathways for little antelopes. So I think the rhino is a key element in the ecosystem, and taking that out you disturb the system quite a lot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, it's become iconic. But Kerrie, there are lots of non-iconic creatures which could be brought back and could be the basis for all sorts of things. What would you go for?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes, it's pretty compelling. I'm coming along in this conversation. These guys are starting to shift me in my original position around this. The thylacine argument is quite compelling. It's recent, it's not going to disrupt the ecosystem as it currently stands, it's going to play a really critical and important role. But here's the flip side. So you've been to the University of Tasmania display for these thylacine. It's great. The last time I was there I just stood there and watched people as they came in, and the reaction is really tangible. You can feel this 'oh geez, that's what we did, we had a bounty on these animals, we were getting out there and making a heyday associated with this species'. And part of the beauty, if I can say it, of watching that reaction is the educational program of 'don't do this again, stop this destruction of biodiversity'.</p><p>And so part of me thinks if we go down the line of bringing the thylacine back, we've lost that real impactful...in your generation, in the generation of your parents, you have destroyed this incredible species, look what you've done. And so I think that part plays a part in this in terms of who decides as well and what species do we tackle, because there's the ecological benefits that we've spent discussing but there's the broader socio-economic context associated with these questions as well, and every one of these decisions that we make and how we use our money for biodiversity conservation will have different impacts on how community engage in this issue as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> It's interesting, do you remember the night parrot?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> We made a...well, my colleagues made one for the BBC about what seems to be the discovery of the night parrot, and it's gone around the world. You know, little birdies, we've got zillions of birdies, why should people care so much? And they do. It's very interesting. Has anyone asked them, why do they care about these things?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> We do, and now we've got some really great data analytic tools in our toolbox to measure sentiment, to look at people's reactions to particular conservation issues, to trawl the internet, look at those Twitter feeds that are coming up here and the responses that people and the reactions that people are having to particular issues. So there's some really clever ways to measure sentiment around particular issues as well, and de-extinction would be I think a really great topic to throw out to the public and ask the question; should we do this? If so, what species? And my feeling around that question of what species is why wouldn't I just ask my two little boys, because we are spending this money to rectify the impacts that we've had for their future benefit. So like the climate change debate, you ask the people coming through schools now, and they're saying, come on, hurry up, move on with it, you should be solving this problem now, what are you guys doing? And so you think that's a really critical part of this. We think that we understand what our kids are going to want in the future but we really should be asking those voices and getting those voices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> There's a term we haven't used particularly and that's rewilding. In other words, putting animals back where they once were. How have those experiments gone? I mentioned the wolves back in the national parks, so far a mixed success. How has rewilding gone?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> There are quite successful programs compared to the Australian one. There's the Californian condor, the black footed ferret, the Przewalski's horse, that's an ancestor of our horses...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> The P-horse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, the P-Horse, the Przewalski's horse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Say it again. Polish, is it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, it's a Polish term. If you pronounce it like it is written it would be Przewalski.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And is it true it was almost like one of the original horses way back?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> A recent study actually showed that it is an escaped domestic horse. When humans started to domesticate horses early on, maybe 10,000 years ago, that is a clutch which escaped back to the wild, so it has some traits of a domestic horse. That is at least the opinion of some of the scientists.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And it's doing quite well in the wild now, is it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, it is, in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, so there are different sites where it was reintroduced. In the beginning it was quite hard for them with the wolves, with the cold weather, but they are doing quite well now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And you're listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> on RN, and a panel at the World Science Festival in Brisbane, on Bringing Them Back, the possibilities of de-extinction.</p><p>Andrew, what is a Biobank?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> This is where we can take tissue from preferably living animals and freeze down those cells and create sort of a frozen repository or a frozen zoo so that we can capture the diversity of a species in time and keep that frozen so that if we lose that from the current population, the hope is that we can reintroduce some of that diversity back in when those populations start to undergo a crash. I think this is something that has become really to the forefront now, we are facing this mass extinction, and people are getting really engaged now in growing these cells now, these fibroblasts that Thomas spoke about before, turning them into stem cells, freezing those stem cells down and having a proper tissue repository for those species.</p><p>I guess the big risk there is that people then don't become complacent about still not trying to aggressively conserve those species that are left, thinking that now we have a deep-freeze stockpile of those animals, so that if everything goes pear-shaped we can just bring them back again. It's still not the best thing to do, it's sort of our worst-case backup scenario, but it at least creates that tangible backup that we have, that we don't have to go down this route of de-extinction where we are editing some other species to look like the animal that went extinct, but instead we actually captured before that animal disappeared those living cells and froze them down and we can reanimate, thaw out those cells and reactivate them and make them active again. So it's a much preferable way of preserving that animal or that species than then trying to go down this road of de-extincting it and editing something else.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Thomas, what about your work with the pandas using your techniques?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, the pandas, there are about 1,000 individuals in the wild...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> They are pretty slow with sex though aren't they?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, most of the pandas in captivity are produced by artificial insemination and that is one of the aspects, working with the Chinese colleagues, to include every panda so that we can conserve the genetic diversity of the individuals which are kept in captivity. The panda is not only the cutest mammal I think but it has also some very interesting biological traits. For example, it's the only carnivore we know which is a vegetarian. There is no other carnivore which lives a vegetarian life. It can eat cyanides which are occurring in the bamboo shoots, and it has the largest testicles in the bear family.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> How come?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, and not only do they have the largest testicles, they only have a descent of the testicles after 4 to 5 years, so that the male offspring can live with the father without being a competitor to the father, the sister has to leave. So I think to understand the panda testicular biology, maybe this was a new tool to recognise testicular tumour in humans much earlier. So you have to see the full function and the service evolution can provide us, not only see the cute black-and-white panda but to understand biology before we erase it from our planet is very important.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, the tricky question now to all of you, and that is what if we did nothing? Because money, expense, if there's a collapse of economies or it gets difficult, we get something like Brexit and Western Australia decides to go off on its own, and if I have my way we'd get run from Wellington which seems to be far more able to get things done. But all sorts of distractions, political and otherwise. What if we just said, okay, the creatures can cope on their own? What would happen, do you think?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Well, ultimately we would suffer as people because the joy that I've seen in people around the world from so many different cultures and places when I lead expeditions or tours or give courses, when people go out into nature, like, wow, I've walked past this forest my entire life, I and 50 years old, I didn't know about these birds and animals that lived in there, you've shown them to me, I'm going to go in there whenever I have spare time now because this is fantastic, this enriches my life, just by being here...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Aren't humans extraordinary because we have relationships with so many different species. I don't know one other animal that has so many species routinely around it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Exactly, and certainly from a conservation perspective we have the capacity to really appreciate that, and I certainly see it as my responsibility, and I think it's all our responsibility to make sure that future generations have that opportunity as well. If I look back and I think, jeepers, the dodo, it's gone, how sad is that, that would have been wonderful to have experienced that, and I do not want future generations to feel that way about species that are around now, or even species that are recently extinct that we can actually bring back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Biodiversity gives to us these non-tangible benefits, and I think that's the part of nature that as humans we are all inclined to really value. Personally I'm not a species kind of person, I don't go birdwatching and I don't spend hours of my life looking for that particular...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You're an ecologist.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I'm an ecologist. But more than that, I guess I'm a landscape person, so I like to take a good look across the landscape and look at the complexity that exists within a landscape. And if you start eroding the arms and the legs and the fingers and the toes of a human, and you do the same on the landscape, you start to lose that beauty and the complexity that is nature. We've lost enough.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Indeed. Another question here; what would Darwin make of the discussion?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think he'd love this discussion. I think it gets to the heart of evolution and everything, we start to understand about how species live in a particular environment, which is what he was really fascinated with and he was certainly fascinated by the diversity of life. And I think everything we are all talking about up here we are in agreement with is really trying to preserve that biodiversity and not to lose any more of it and to capture what we have right now and potentially even be able to bring some of our lost biodiversity back in the future. I think that encapsulates everything that would make Darwin happy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> On the other hand, I think the implication in that question is, okay, red in tooth and claw, he didn't say that but somebody else did, that is competition, and you survive and the survival creature is better, so just leave it alone and it will grow up. It's a sort of capitalist market view. If you've not got enough, you die out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think competition between species is quite different to between humans and another species. I think we have a distinct unfair advantage when it comes to wiping these animals off the face of the Earth, which is a bit different to two nonhuman species competing for a particular ecological niche. So I think in that regard I would say this is quite a different question.</p><p>An interesting question for the de-extinction debate though, if we do recreate a species, you're only bringing back one animal or a couple of animals, so it's a very similar question of then how do you bring that diversity back. But our answer to that is if we can start to make those millions of edits that we need to to that genome to actually de-extinct an animal, really the easy part would be then engineering in that diversity that you would need to make them have a really robust immune system or be resistant to certain sorts of diseases or impacts from the environment. So certainly we have a good understanding of what those parts of the genomes look like from healthy groups of marsupials, and so you can easily engineer that back then into a thylacine that you recreate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, that engineering is really powerful stuff, that CRISPR.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Yes, so there's a whole session I think at the World Science Festival talking just about CRISPR, but it really is the thing that pushed this whole field forward, is this ability to very easily and reproducibly make those edits to the genome en masse. So that was really the roadblock to the extinction, was we could make edits one at a time, and you had to sequence all 3 billion base pairs to make sure you had your one edit in the right place and everything looked okay. But now we can do that on a much larger scale, still not large enough to make it really something that we could do tomorrow for a thylacine, but certainly that is getting much better all the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> To end, I'd like you to play God again and choose an animal to bring back that has been extinct. I've already chosen the dodo. There's something about me and dodos that kind of go together, their sweet smiling faces, and you know, they were in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alice in Wonderland</emphasis> and various other wonderful stories from way back. So, Duan, what would you choose to bring back an extinct animal from way back that you'd like...?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Well, if you've chosen the dodo, I'll go with the elephant bird in Madagascar.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Describe it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> As I understand, it was a bird like an ostrich but much bigger, as tall as a giraffe and like a giraffe feeds off the trees at the top of the canopy, and the early settlers there didn't take too long to wipe them out. That would be fantastic if that could come back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I'd quite like the moa as well from New Zealand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Indeed, the moa, and with the Haast's eagle to go with it that used to feed on the moa chicks, that would be a nice ecosystem to have back intact.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Giant birds running around would be truly terrifying, it would be like a pack of velociraptors I reckon. I don't think you need to ask me this question surely, everybody knows what I'd say, it's the thylacine, it should definitely be the one we bring back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> After the thylacine, going back further?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I would say a mammoth, I would love to see a mammoth, I think they truly are...and again, another one of those species that really captures people's imaginations. I think just a magnificent beast, and to see it would be truly amazing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I don't want to be asked this question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Why not?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I'm not the person that should be asked this question. At the moment I want to get on the phone and ask my seven-year-old son, you know, what do you want to see come back?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> T Rex.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Probably, it probably would be T Rex. No, that's not going to happen. For me it's not a question that I want to answer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I stay with Kerrie.

Just.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> No, it's practically extinct.

So I'd say I'm going to stick with the thylacine. I think we can leave Neanderthals and Denisovans where they are perhaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I think a Denisovan would be quite good in Canberra, don't you? Well, we've heard about the possibilities, the ecosystems, the understanding of how culture can be so important in bringing people back to understand the animals that surround them, how you can change how we live so that we can live with nature effectively and not in a way that sacrifices our well-being. Thomas has indicated that we can live for another 300 years so that we are invested in the future. But there are ways in which we can effectively make a huge difference, and it has all happened in the last 10 or 20 years, it's been a complete revolution. And I think the sensibilities about why we love these animals, the hushed tones when you actually saw the thylacine there seeming to be alive and seeming to be back with us, it's quite extraordinary.

El Nino's effects in Indonesia may not be as dramatic as those in Australia, but because it has an impact on a vastly larger population, the problems it poses are greater.</p><p> Despite Indonesia's monsoonal climate, El Nino sharply reduces rainfall throughout much of the country.</p><p>Indonesia experienced a marked decrease in its rainfall in 1982-83 and again, to a lesser degree, in 1987. This was followed by the long El Nino of the 1990s.</p><p> El Nino reduces rice yields and thereby significantly affects overall national production. Since 1987, this has put a damper on Indonesia's attempts to achieve ambitious rice increases in line with a growing population and rising consumption.</p><p> As the agricultural year progresses, there is a follow-on effect for secondary crops such as maize and soybean.</p><p> In the islands east of Bali, El Nino's impact is even greater. The irregularity of the monsoon is as much a factor in cropping success as is the quantity of rain the monsoon brings.</p><p> Dryland farmers from Lombok to Timor are forced into repeated planting of precious seed to catch elusive rains. On Sumba and Timor, during a long drought, feed for cattle and water buffalo becomes almost as scarce as it does in Australia.</p><p> In the dry season, and especially during a drought, these farmers are invariably forced to leave their land in search of other work, increasing the numbers of the unemployed.</p><p> In the mountains of Irian Jaya, El Nino can cause heavy frosts at higher altitudes, destroying root crops of sweet potato and taro.</p><p> El Nino has an equally serious effect on Indonesia's forests. During the severe El Nino of 1982-83, East Kalimantan experienced a 68 per cent decrease in dry season rains.</p><p> A disastrous combination of sharply reduced rainfall, heavy logging, the accumulation of logging residues and local fire-based shifting cultivation produced perhaps the worst forest fire in modern history. Uncontrolled fires burnt for months throughout Kalimantan, damaging an estimated area of 2.8 to 3.5 million hectares. This fire affected an area equal to Victoria and Tasmania.</p><p> El Nino phases are often followed by a sharp swing to heavy rain -a phase now referred to as La Nina. Its rains may offer many benefits, especially for crops, but these rains are generally associated with an increase in pests and diseases.</p><p> The long-term consequences of this, for a major maritime nation like Indonesia, are as yet unknown. Australia's response to El Nino has been to improve its meteorological forecasting capacity. This forecast data is shared with Indonesia under a memorandum of understanding signed in 1995. This co-operation focuses on climate monitoring and seasonal forecasting.</p><p>Indonesian farmers retain painful memories of past droughts, but have little idea what living with El Nino may eventually entail. The first task is to provide them with better seasonal forecasts and with some understanding of the cycle of nature to which they, too, must adapt.</p><p> Professor James Fox is head of the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9708151038214379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:457Y-MFB0-0197-52B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"584\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>August 15, 1997, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>THE LONG-TERM CREDIT BANK OF JAPAN LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLY1</classCode><className>MONSOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000123</classCode><className>POPULATION GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000CP0P</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N111219CO</classCode><className>MISC VEGETABLE FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N111160MM</classCode><className>RICE FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N111150MM</classCode><className>CORN FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000090</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK FEED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC305</classCode><className>INDONESIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009WTY</classCode><className>BORNEO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We're at the World Science Festival, and on stage, as the lights come up, is what looks like a large Tasmanian tiger. And it's moving. The audience is hushed as it watches, because the tiger is supposed to be extinct. Then they realise it's a giant marionette. This is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis>, on Bringing Them Back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So you've seen a living Tasmanian tiger. He actually did a poo backstage. Bringing Them Back, the de-extinction debate. And in blunt terms we are losing nature before our very eyes, whole ecosystems gone with largely unknown consequences. The much talked about sixth extinction. Is it the one caused by humanity? Tragically the world has lost many of its animal species the last two centuries, and there is no sign of that trend easing. A recent World Wide Fund for Nature report states that since 1970, less than 50 years ago, human activity has wiped out 60% of Earth's wildlife, covering mammals, birds, fish...90% of fish gone. Reptiles and amphibians, not to mention the devastating loss of insects worldwide reported last month. It seems no place on Earth is immune and time is running out for conservation.</p><p>So what does modern conservation science look like, and should everything be on the table for consideration, including the option of reviving what has gone? With new genetic technologies we are not that far from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> idea of de-extinction becoming science fact. But will it ever be possible or practical to revive extinct species to save biodiversity and perhaps ourselves in the process? And if so, where do we start? And who decides what to save?</p><p>Our first guest is a leading expert on wildlife reproduction management from the Leibnitz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin. Since 1997 his team have been working to rescue the northern white rhino from the brink of extinction, made harder by the recent loss of the species' last male. Welcome to the stage, Thomas Hildebrandt.</p><p>Next we welcome executive director of the Institute for Future Environments and a professor across the river at the Queensland University of Technology. Her two decades leading research into the science and policy of conservation has attracted numerous awards, including the Prime Minister's Prize for Life Scientist of the Year, and the Australian Academy of Science Nancy Millis Medal. Kerrie Wilson.</p><p>Hailing from the University of Melbourne, our next guest is an Associate Professor and ARC Future Fellow whose lab recently sequenced the genome of the extinct thylacine or Tasmanian tiger, the one you saw. In developing genetic tools to help conserve current marsupial species, their ultimate aim is to revive the iconic thylacine itself. Welcome Andrew Pask.</p><p>And our final guest is a senior research fellow at Griffith University's Environmental Futures Research Institute. Its work is international, to counter the illegal wildlife trade. Just back from Namibia, welcome Duan Biggs.</p><p>Well, there's the problem. Kerrie, I mentioned the sixth extinction. Are we in it, do you take it seriously?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes, we take it seriously. So 66 million years ago we had a similar extinction event, and about 25 years ago scientists started to think, you know, something is going on here, and we started taking note. They estimated about 25 years ago that we were losing species at around 10,000 times quicker than what we would in the background rate of species loss.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And in this circumstance should all avenues, all different techniques be open to science to try?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> That's an interesting question. Every tool in your tool shed comes with a cost, and it comes with a benefit. And so we need to throw every tool at this question, but we also need to just unpack what do those tools look like and what will be the consequences associated with them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And you'd like a debate, people discussing these things.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes, absolutely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Thomas, during the extinction debate we are talking about saving things before they go away, disappear, and with rhinos you've just got a couple left. What're you going to do? You've got two females.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, the northern white rhino is declared as a subspecies of the southern white rhino. It lives in central Africa and it was a very important landscape architect before it was declared in 2006 as extinct in the wild. Now there are only two females left, a mother and a daughter, Najin and Fatu. Both are infertile so actually that's the end of the story. Not fully because we have stored semen from four different males over the last 20 years, and we have fibroblast culture from 12 non-related individuals. So using the tool box of modern conservation technology we are capable of generating embryos from northern white rhinos by using the oocytes from these two females and the semen, which is cold preserved, and using surrogates mothers like southern white rhinos to produce northern white rhino offspring. We then use these two females to educate the offspring to be a northern white rhino, which is a very important element, the social education. We think this program is quite sound and we hope to be successful within the next three years with the first calf on the ground.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And how long does it take to educate the baby?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> It has to live with the two remaining northern white rhinos to understand what it means to be a northern white rhino because a genome provides all of the morphology, all the physiology, but the knowledge, the social part is also very important and therefore it is a time pressing project because these two females, one is 18, one is 29, so time is running out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You mentioned fibroblasts there, bits of tissue. What do you do with them?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, fibroblasts are parts of the skin, you put them in cell culture and then they propagate, and when they propagate we call them fibroblasts. And in 2012 there was a Nobel Prize for transforming these cells into stem cells.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Stem cells, we can do anything, theoretically.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> That needs quite a lot of research. Right now the mouse is the most advanced model. To transfer all this knowledge to a rhino or to an elephant or to a marsupial, that is quite a challenging task.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And apart from white rhinos, what sort of other collections have you got of these sperm and eggs and so on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> We have a comparable collection of biomaterial, like the frozen zoo in San Diego. So for us, even though Sudan died in March 2018, we declare him not as dead because we still have life elements from him, we have semen from him, we have fibroblasts from him, so there are all these blueprints to make a new Sudan is in our bank.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> It's amazing, isn't it, the progress.</p><p>Andrew, we heard about the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger. I think it was Mike Archer's voice we heard talking about the attempt they made a few years ago, at the Australian Museum, and at that stage we did a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Catalyst</emphasis> program and my partner described it as trying to make some sentences out of alphabet soup, trying to stitch this stuff together. Is it still as hard as all that was back then?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> We've actually rebuilt the entirely thylacine genome in my lab now, so we do have that complete blueprint of what it was to make a thylacine.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Astounding, isn't it. Where did you get the original DNA from?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> This one actually came from one of the Museum Victoria specimens, so it was one of the very few pickled pouch young. So it was a little baby thylacine that was removed from its mum's pouch, the mum was shot as part of the bounty scheme that they had in Tasmania at the time. So they were offering \u00a31 to bring pelts in, which was a huge amount of money back in the early 1900s, to bring in these specimens. And this mum had three babies in her pouch, and so they took each of them. But for some reason we still don't know, they would normally put these into formalin, which is actually very bad for the DNA, but these three miracle pups, we like to call them, went straight into ethanol and that actually preserved the DNA a lot better which meant we were able to get some really, really high quality long bits of DNA from these animals, which makes building that genome a lot easier, and we can be much more sure of the final genome that we have really representing what the thylacine DNA looks like.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And we've just seen a re-enactment on stage. Andrew, imagine you're looking at the offspring and they're alive. How would you feel?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Just blown away. I think it would be such an amazing thing if we could do that, to actually bring a species back, but particularly the thylacine. I think it's such an amazing marsupial species. It's completely unique. It was our only apex predator marsupial that lived into modern times. We don't have anything that sits at the top of the food chain like the thylacine does in any of our other marsupial species. It really was completely unique in every way, from its dog-like shape, the way it moved, its behaviour, right the way through to its hunting behaviours. It really was just an amazing animal that we unfortunately completely wiped from existence.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, and there was a bounty on them and that was quite recently, one or two generations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Yes, and they were aggressively hunted to extinction, as you could imagine, when there is that sort of price put on their head.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So Duan, you're working in Southern Africa, in Namibia, South Africa itself. What are the cultural feelings there about such creatures which still linger and which we want to preserve, how do local people react to what you're trying to do?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Yes, I think that's an important question and I think relevant, as Kerrie raised, de-extinction is one of the tools in the toolbox but there's a whole complex process of discussion and negotiation that needs to take place for it to be evaluated. And I was recently in Botswana, which is the country that sits between Namibia and South Africa, and there, as many of the audience here may have heard, there's been a recent furore because the government wants to bring back hunting of elephants included, and a lot in the international community are saying you cannot do that, that is wrong. Elephant hunting is morally wrong and you shouldn't do it. However, it's complex.</p><p>So in 2014 when hunting was banned there, the types of benefits that typically low income households and communities used to get from elephants disappeared, and also these people have to live with the costs of elephants. I'm not sure how many in the audience have lived with elephants but I have and they are great animals but if you are a small-scale farmer, they can be very damaging and they invoke a lot of fear. So now because of the hunting ban, people are not getting benefits and only living with the costs. And there was increasing antagonism towards these animals, and some of my colleagues in Botswana say increasing support for poaching activities of these animals because they were nuisance and only bringing costs.</p><p>So now Botswanan government is saying let's bring back hunting or talk about bringing back, and well managed hunting can support conservation of elephants and also support rural communities. However, many in the conservation sector internationally, animal welfare, animal rights groups are saying this is unacceptable. There are some big players calling for tourism boycotts of Botswana. So clearly in this complex issue, an animal we all love, like an elephant, we don't, as a conservation sector and as a society, have a good way of dealing with these issues, and it's going to be a similar challenge with de-extinction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Duan, how much time have we got to solve that problem?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> I think the sooner the better, there is urgency, because if you let problems like that lie, then you get a culture developing of antagonism towards wildlife. And there are places in Southern Africa where there is actually a culture of poaching evolves and that becomes the expected thing to do and that's not what we want to get to, so we need to move fast.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And you can get big money very quickly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Yes exactly, and those are low, low income places. But to bring us back to de-extinction, there are discussions around should we bring back the woolly mammoth and thylacine. There are people that are going to bear costs, and where is their voice in the discussion? And these are considerations, together with the ones that Kerry raised, that need careful thought.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Andrew, we have a Twitter question; what would be the surrogate animal to bring back the Tasmanian tiger?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think one of the nice things about marsupials is that they are born so small and then they complete their development in the mother's pouch. So you could actually use a variety of different marsupials to have that embryo be born from and transferred into a pouch of an eastern grey kangaroo or something that's very abundant. You'd have to work on something I guess that you have a lot of. But there's also really great artificial milk for rearing the marsupial pouch young from a very early age. They kind of need that first little few days in mum's pouch to get the good antibodies and things that come across from mum, but then after that you really can hand-rear them and that's done quite commonly for abandoned marsupials. So I think it's something that you could easily gestate in a largish type marsupial, have it go into the pouch, and then you could do that final stage of rearing with some of these artificial milks that we have.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Unlike a puppy, it's the size of a little worm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Exactly, so it's a lot easier for mum to give birth, and a lot easier for us when you're trying to do these sorts of de-extinction experiments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Getting to the next stage, some of the answers, let me just mention a book called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Clone a Mammoth</emphasis> by Beth Shapiro who lives in the States, and she's against cloning the mammoth, for two reasons. One of them is she suggests that you couldn't necessarily make it effectively by handling the DNA that one or two mistakes and you've got all sorts of huge problems. But overall the problem is one of the environment. How do you solve the problem of where it will go?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> There's a third aspect. To clone a mammoth you have to work with Asian elephants, and Asian elephants are CITES 1 animals and you are not allowed to do experiments on them. To modify an oocyte of Asian female is not allowed. So actually there is a legal aspect...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You can't have the surrogate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Yes, and also not the oocyte donor because that would be the first aspect, you need an oocyte from an Asian elephant, which you modify with CRISPR-Cas, it's a gene editing technique, that is actually by law not allowed. And then the other experiment would be the embryo transfer into an Asian elephant. That would be also not allowed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I've heard about artificial wombs. Is that serious, for an elephant or a mammoth?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> No, the artificial womb is only for the last fifth of the pregnancy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> That's enough.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> But what you do with the four-fifths before, the implantation? That is a totally different issue. So the artificial womb is developed for premature human babies to reduce the cost of having them in incubators, and that was shown in lambs very impressively, but it is the last part of the pregnancy. The implantation and the growing from the embryo to a foetus, nobody can do that artificially.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> That's still a couple of months, isn't it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> That's more, the pregnancy length is 22 months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, but the last part, the last fifth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> The last part would be maybe three months...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> In an artificial womb.\u00c2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> But then the 19 months, you have to use an Asian elephant, and that is not allowed. The number of Asian elephants is down to 30,000, it's a very fragile population. It's a totally different scenario to African elephants, and therefore I think it is very unrealistic that it will happen soon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I see. So, woolly mammoths. Passenger pigeons, I think there were 3 billion of them at one stage. If we recreated them, where would they go? The gastric brooding frog. Do you remember we had that actually on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature of Australia</emphasis> series, and the little creature gave birth because...in the stomach, all those eggs, brooding there, and then you've got these tiny frogs coming out of the parent's mouth, 40 of them running off. The most extraordinary sight. And then the actual frog became, it seems, extinct in Queensland. So what would you choose, which creatures to pick, number one or number two?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> The thylacine...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, I thought you'd say that!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> But I think the important thing here is the distinction between cloning as we know it and then de-extinction science as we are talking about here tonight. So the real big difference is that we can do animal cloning really well, we do this with sheep and cattle, tonnes of livestock species all the time, mice we are very proficient at it, humans if you believe the science last year, you can do all these sorts of things really robustly, but that's when you start off with a living cell. So you've already got that cell and all the chromosomes intact, and that's quite different to this process of de-extinction. You still need to have a living cell, that's something we still can't make as scientists. So what we have to do is start off with the template of another species and then really start to edit these differences onto that background genome.</p><p>So with the case of the mammoth you would take your Asian elephant DNA and then you would sequence your mammoth, find out where all the differences lie between their two genomes, and then you edit all of those differences onto your elephant background. So you're trying to turn your elephant DNA now into a mammoth DNA strand basically. Once you've got that, you've got your living cell now that is mammothised, and you can then inject that into an egg and then transfer that egg into a surrogate animal and then have it give birth to your extinct species.</p><p>But the thing that's really important for everybody to know and one of the things that Beth Shapiro is really against with the de-extinction debate, is what exactly is this animal going to look like that you bring back, how close to a real mammoth is that going to be, because we are engineering an elephant genome to look like a mammoth. But there's a lot of that space in the genome that we really don't understand that well still, and so there's a lot of work that still needs to be done in the background to really explore the genome more, start to understand more about how all those different changes are really profound and which ones really make a big difference, and then making the choice of going in and making those edits to recreate your extinct species.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, but Andrew, Duan, I want a dodo.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Correct, yes, I do want a dodo as well...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> What are you going to do for me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Well, you've got to get your cell of a closely related bird species that's still alive, so some sort of pigeon species, yes, and then the DNA in bird feathers is actually really well preserved and very intact, there's hundreds of dodo specimens. One of the things that this de-extinction science is really showing is the value of museum collections in particular. We can go into these museum collections now and we can collect tiny parts of that tissue and then sequence the entire genome and we can learn so much just from looking at that DNA. It's really staggering, the amount of information you can get from just having that blueprint in hand, but then you can start to really think about going down this road of then editing a closely related animal's genome.</p><p>The nice thing about the mammoth is it really is quite closely related to Asian elephants, and so there's not that many changes that need to be made. The thylacine doesn't have a really close living relative, so the closest would be a numbat, but they eat ants. So it's not the best genome to start with. The Tasmanian devil is a little bit further away, but it is at least a carnivore, so that might be something that's a little better to start off with, but they are the kinds of questions that we are exploring. And by doing this kind of science we're going down and figuring out exactly how onerous these tasks might be.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Well, I think if you're asking me personally, as a birdwatcher and speaking selfishly I would love to see a dodo, but that's just me. If I'm speaking as a scientist and informing how we as society should think about this, one way is to start with the already existing IUCN Red List, World Conservation Union red list, and it's what the global conservation community uses. You start on the one end with the species that's of least concern, something that might be vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild like the northern white rhino, and then extinct. And I think what we are talking about here, we're saying how far away is the dodo, how expensive is it, how risky is it, versus, say, something that's more recently extinct like the thylacine.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Kerrie, this is exactly where you come in because that's what you got your prizes for, looking at the landscape, what it costs, what's feasible. How are you going to make that decision and about which creatures and how?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> What I'd encourage the proponents of de-extinction to do is really sit back and go; what are you fundamentally trying to achieve here? So we've heard a couple of objectives being thrown around. I'm not getting a clear line on the objectives, I know that Duan just wants to get birdwatching, you've got your own objective. But fundamentally we want to bring a species back so that it can perform a role, an ecological role. What's the point of bringing back a species just for the sake of it? So the art and science of making a good decision is just being clear about what you're trying to achieve. And the trick to working out what we are trying to achieve is just keep asking why. Why do we want to do this? On average, if you ask why five times, you get to your fundamental objective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, I like wolves and I like to bring them back to national parks and I like to do that not just to look at them but because I think that what they do, even though they hunt elk or moose or whatever, what they're doing is bringing back a balance to the landscape so that the plants and the trees which were being shredded by those ungulates are now not so much, and you've got the balance restored.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> That's deeper ecology, we're going to bring back the species. That's understanding that that whole ecosystem...so there's part of making a good decision, you bring together that data, you bring together your model of your ecosystem, and then you start looking at your levers, you know, what activities could I take in order to get a better overall result for biodiversity in this extinction crisis that we are in. There are a range of activities that we could undertake. We could stop destroying the environment as it stands now, stop those damaging activities, through to we could work in the lab on these types of activities that we're talking about today. That sort of information all needs to be put on the table in order to make a good decision. Then the sweet spot is you can then start to look at what the trade-offs are, what are the opportunity costs associated with these things.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And can you experiment? Have you got time to experiment? Are people patient enough?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I would be really concerned about experimenting in this space, but there are consequences associated with reintroducing a species to an environment that it's been removed, around pathogens and disease spread, so experimentation in this space is costly, and it could potentially have flow-on effects for ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, I'm just thinking about the woolly mammoth, and if you look at the way the ice and glaciers are disappearing, where would they go if the permafrost is melting?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> One of the arguments of the pro-mammoth faction is that mammoths actually have such wide feet that they compress the snow in Siberia, and compressed snow melts less than normal snow, and so to avoid global warming that would be one very simple argument. But I think the mammoth project, it's more a scientific exercise than it is actually a conservation project. You have a lot of species which are close to the brink of extinction, we should focus on them. We have species which played a very important key role in ecosystems which we don't save or the conservation efforts we do right now, like protecting a habitat. One is the Sumatran rhino, the northern white rhino is nearly gone, the Javan rhino belongs to this group. So there are key species which are really important for ecosystems, and I think we should focus on them and not on a scientific exercise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Can I have one more wild idea? In Tasmania someone has suggested...a professor at the University of Tasmania, that because there is so much tinder in the forest and fires are all over the place, 85 fires in the winter in Tasmania, why not import elephants?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> I think Kerrie's point of thinking what the objective is, if it's to reduce the risk of forest fire there might be less controversial and simpler ways of getting there than introducing elephants to Tasmania.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Let's have another question from Twitter. How is this going to help us in the long term, especially concerning climate change, as it's a big issue now? Well, you've mentioned one aspect of the theoretical woolly mammoth, but looking after the animals, will it make a serious difference?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I can't answer the climate change, but I can give you another example. Central Africa has a very complex ecosystem, and disturbing this ecosystem, we have seen that on the west coast of Africa HIV was born there, Ebola was born there. We don't know really what it means losing such an important landscape architect in this very important habitat. Maybe bats travel out of this region and they carry a lot of nasty germs which have really devastating effects on humankind. And so I think it is also the human health, the one-world concept that we should keep these ecosystems intact to protect ourselves against these kind of new emerging diseases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I'll just give you an example of the scale of things that could happen. I broadcast actually research from Switzerland done by an international team, and that is they looked+ \u00c2 down from the sky and wondered how many trees there are on Earth, and the old-fashioned idea was 400 billion. And then they did not just from the sky but counting on the ground as well so that you could get a much more accurate figure, and it turned out to be there are 3 trillion. And there is room for another 1.2 trillion. There is room. In other words, if you planted these trees you would nearly solve the climate problem and you'd create far more complex ecosystem available. Does that turn you on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yep...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You could hardly say no.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> We talked about the tools in the toolbox. Those tools are out there, they are ready for us to use in the climate change arena, and I think increasingly the public is aware of these impacts. We are ready to go with that now, so let's get them off the shelf and start deploying those tools.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Indeed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think one of the interesting things with the climate change is currently it's happening too fast for animals to evolve and to keep up with such a rapid increase in temperature that we are seeing globally. But this is, again, one of those things where the de-extinction science, one of the fringe benefits that is coming from it is it's really pushing science forward in terms of our ability to generate artificial eggs and sperm and we can very quickly generate lots of species diversity or other ways that we can actually go in and edit animal genomes to introduce diversity to those backgrounds where you have really struggling species, and it can actually help really push the evolution of species to occur faster or more rapidly so we can help them actually start to respond to changes like this that happen so quickly in our environment now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, in a minute we will look at the difference between these various toolboxes and the ecosystem one. However, I'd like now to take a moment to acknowledge the important work carried out by museums around the world, and in particular in this instance the Queensland Museum network. Beyond the important role of connecting the public face-to-face with objects of our own and lost cultures, there are many scientists working behind-the-scenes undertaking important research, carrying out conservation projects, preserving objects and animals, to not only capture this moment in time but also to ensure our future is diverse and bright. So let's take a look inside the cupboards, drawers and labs of the Queensland Museum.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Video audio:</emphasis> The Queensland Museum houses a large collection of fauna specimens that document the biodiversity of Queensland and beyond. When changes become too great and the species becomes extinct in the wild, museum collections are one of the few places to see and study them.</p><p>Paradise parrots lived in open woodland and forests with a grassy understory. The last confirmed sighting was in 1927.</p><p>The last known the thylacine from the wild was captured in 1933 and died three years later.</p><p>The burrowing bettong is a small macropod that once lived in much of the arid and semiarid regions of the continent. These old museum skins are the only evidence that this species occurred in Queensland.</p><p>The last specimen of the desert rat kangaroo was collected from 1935, with reports occurring during some wet seasons up to 1975.</p><p>The Bramble Cay\u00c2 melomys occurred only on this small cay in the Torres Strait. After drastic inundation by ocean destroying its vegetation, the species is now declared extinct.</p><p>Extinctions have always occurred, but as humans impose their needs and expand their wants on the environment, so too the impact extends on the other species we share this continent with. And for many this impact is becoming too great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Queensland Museum. Last time I looked when I was president of the Australian Museum Trust, that's the Australian Museum in Sydney, I think more people went to museums than go to football matches. Is that still the case, do you know? Let's assume so. Cheers us up. But I saw a bettong there, not the one I was going to mention, the eastern bettong which I think was released around Canberra, and I think this rewilding, they did not survive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I guess that's the risks associated with these types of activities. And one of the considerations that doesn't often get airplay around rewilding is the ongoing effort that needs to be put into place to manage and maintain those populations, monitor them and evaluate how those populations are tracking. That's that long-term costing that usually isn't accounted for in conservation programs for some odd reason. This isn't just a one-off activity, these are long-term programs, and those programs are often funded on three-year cycles, really short-term funding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> This third part of our discussion is really about playing God, who decides. And Andrew and Thomas, can you outline the de-extinction proposal that you are hoping to get approved for funding by the new Elon Musk. There he goes again, Elon Musk, he's in space, he's doing electric cars and he is also involved in the Foundation for Extinct Animal Revival, known as Elon's FEAR. What's going on there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think there's a great quote from Mike Archer, he was one of the first people to attempt to sequence the thylacine genome, and so he said we were playing God when we wiped them off the face of the Earth, and I'd like to think that we are playing the part of clever humans by trying to bring them back. And that's very much the tactic that I take. We have a social responsibility, we exterminated the thylacine, but if we get the technology and it does become cheap enough...I think right now it's really too expensive to try and think about doing these projects, but when the technology becomes cheaper and more efficient, as it undoubtedly will, I think it's a very real discussion then about bringing these animals back and reintroducing them to the environment.</p><p>I think this is one of the things that makes the thylacine such a great poster-child for de-extinction, is that the Tasmanian wilderness is very similar to how it was in 1936 when the last animal went extinct. The animals that ate it are still there, it still could move back into that food chain and that ecological niche and really have somewhere you could reintroduce such a species. The bigger question is what is that species going to look like, how much of a thylacine is that actually going to be? And that's something we've got to explore I think.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> What is FEAR, that organisation?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I don't know, but I want their money so that we can do this. I think this should be their number one project.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I think we do not ideally fit into this scheme because we are working with species that are still alive or the biomaterial is still alive, and we use new technologies derived from regenerative medicine, like the stem cell technology, applying that to the conservation effort, and I think it's a little bit different approach, using advances, assisted reproduction, test-tube babies, surrogate mothers, and also stem cell technology to produce artificial gametes, which is a totally different field of research compared to the gene editing and the artificial making of extinct species. I think we are doing quite an important job by bringing back the key species which are on the top of any...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, but who decides that? How does someone select a species?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I think there are quite sound studies on service, on function of the southern white rhino in the southern hemisphere of Africa, so the white rhino plays a very important role in this area, and the same you can expect from central Africa, from the northern white rhino, which lived in a totally different environment, and hundreds of species are dependent or indirectly dependent on that. Only the faeces of a rhino provides hundreds of insect species. So it has the? which gives pathways for little antelopes. So I think the rhino is a key element in the ecosystem, and taking that out you disturb the system quite a lot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, it's become iconic. But Kerrie, there are lots of non-iconic creatures which could be brought back and could be the basis for all sorts of things. What would you go for?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes, it's pretty compelling. I'm coming along in this conversation. These guys are starting to shift me in my original position around this. The thylacine argument is quite compelling. It's recent, it's not going to disrupt the ecosystem as it currently stands, it's going to play a really critical and important role. But here's the flip side. So you've been to the University of Tasmania display for these thylacine. It's great. The last time I was there I just stood there and watched people as they came in, and the reaction is really tangible. You can feel this 'oh geez, that's what we did, we had a bounty on these animals, we were getting out there and making a heyday associated with this species'. And part of the beauty, if I can say it, of watching that reaction is the educational program of 'don't do this again, stop this destruction of biodiversity'.</p><p>And so part of me thinks if we go down the line of bringing the thylacine back, we've lost that real impactful...in your generation, in the generation of your parents, you have destroyed this incredible species, look what you've done. And so I think that part plays a part in this in terms of who decides as well and what species do we tackle, because there's the ecological benefits that we've spent discussing but there's the broader socio-economic context associated with these questions as well, and every one of these decisions that we make and how we use our money for biodiversity conservation will have different impacts on how community engage in this issue as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> It's interesting, do you remember the night parrot?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> We made a...well, my colleagues made one for the BBC about what seems to be the discovery of the night parrot, and it's gone around the world. You know, little birdies, we've got zillions of birdies, why should people care so much? And they do. It's very interesting. Has anyone asked them, why do they care about these things?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> We do, and now we've got some really great data analytic tools in our toolbox to measure sentiment, to look at people's reactions to particular conservation issues, to trawl the internet, look at those Twitter feeds that are coming up here and the responses that people and the reactions that people are having to particular issues. So there's some really clever ways to measure sentiment around particular issues as well, and de-extinction would be I think a really great topic to throw out to the public and ask the question; should we do this? If so, what species? And my feeling around that question of what species is why wouldn't I just ask my two little boys, because we are spending this money to rectify the impacts that we've had for their future benefit. So like the climate change debate, you ask the people coming through schools now, and they're saying, come on, hurry up, move on with it, you should be solving this problem now, what are you guys doing? And so you think that's a really critical part of this. We think that we understand what our kids are going to want in the future but we really should be asking those voices and getting those voices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> There's a term we haven't used particularly and that's rewilding. In other words, putting animals back where they once were. How have those experiments gone? I mentioned the wolves back in the national parks, so far a mixed success. How has rewilding gone?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> There are quite successful programs compared to the Australian one. There's the Californian condor, the black footed ferret, the Przewalski's horse, that's an ancestor of our horses...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> The P-horse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, the P-Horse, the Przewalski's horse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Say it again. Polish, is it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, it's a Polish term. If you pronounce it like it is written it would be Przewalski.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And is it true it was almost like one of the original horses way back?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> A recent study actually showed that it is an escaped domestic horse. When humans started to domesticate horses early on, maybe 10,000 years ago, that is a clutch which escaped back to the wild, so it has some traits of a domestic horse. That is at least the opinion of some of the scientists.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And it's doing quite well in the wild now, is it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, it is, in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, so there are different sites where it was reintroduced. In the beginning it was quite hard for them with the wolves, with the cold weather, but they are doing quite well now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And you're listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> on RN, and a panel at the World Science Festival in Brisbane, on Bringing Them Back, the possibilities of de-extinction.</p><p>Andrew, what is a Biobank?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> This is where we can take tissue from preferably living animals and freeze down those cells and create sort of a frozen repository or a frozen zoo so that we can capture the diversity of a species in time and keep that frozen so that if we lose that from the current population, the hope is that we can reintroduce some of that diversity back in when those populations start to undergo a crash. I think this is something that has become really to the forefront now, we are facing this mass extinction, and people are getting really engaged now in growing these cells now, these fibroblasts that Thomas spoke about before, turning them into stem cells, freezing those stem cells down and having a proper tissue repository for those species.</p><p>I guess the big risk there is that people then don't become complacent about still not trying to aggressively conserve those species that are left, thinking that now we have a deep-freeze stockpile of those animals, so that if everything goes pear-shaped we can just bring them back again. It's still not the best thing to do, it's sort of our worst-case backup scenario, but it at least creates that tangible backup that we have, that we don't have to go down this route of de-extinction where we are editing some other species to look like the animal that went extinct, but instead we actually captured before that animal disappeared those living cells and froze them down and we can reanimate, thaw out those cells and reactivate them and make them active again. So it's a much preferable way of preserving that animal or that species than then trying to go down this road of de-extincting it and editing something else.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Thomas, what about your work with the pandas using your techniques?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, the pandas, there are about 1,000 individuals in the wild...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> They are pretty slow with sex though aren't they?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, most of the pandas in captivity are produced by artificial insemination and that is one of the aspects, working with the Chinese colleagues, to include every panda so that we can conserve the genetic diversity of the individuals which are kept in captivity. The panda is not only the cutest mammal I think but it has also some very interesting biological traits. For example, it's the only carnivore we know which is a vegetarian. There is no other carnivore which lives a vegetarian life. It can eat cyanides which are occurring in the bamboo shoots, and it has the largest testicles in the bear family.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> How come?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Yes, and not only do they have the largest testicles, they only have a descent of the testicles after 4 to 5 years, so that the male offspring can live with the father without being a competitor to the father, the sister has to leave. So I think to understand the panda testicular biology, maybe this was a new tool to recognise testicular tumour in humans much earlier. So you have to see the full function and the service evolution can provide us, not only see the cute black-and-white panda but to understand biology before we erase it from our planet is very important.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, the tricky question now to all of you, and that is what if we did nothing? Because money, expense, if there's a collapse of economies or it gets difficult, we get something like Brexit and Western Australia decides to go off on its own, and if I have my way we'd get run from Wellington which seems to be far more able to get things done. But all sorts of distractions, political and otherwise. What if we just said, okay, the creatures can cope on their own? What would happen, do you think?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Well, ultimately we would suffer as people because the joy that I've seen in people around the world from so many different cultures and places when I lead expeditions or tours or give courses, when people go out into nature, like, wow, I've walked past this forest my entire life, I and 50 years old, I didn't know about these birds and animals that lived in there, you've shown them to me, I'm going to go in there whenever I have spare time now because this is fantastic, this enriches my life, just by being here...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Aren't humans extraordinary because we have relationships with so many different species. I don't know one other animal that has so many species routinely around it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Exactly, and certainly from a conservation perspective we have the capacity to really appreciate that, and I certainly see it as my responsibility, and I think it's all our responsibility to make sure that future generations have that opportunity as well. If I look back and I think, jeepers, the dodo, it's gone, how sad is that, that would have been wonderful to have experienced that, and I do not want future generations to feel that way about species that are around now, or even species that are recently extinct that we can actually bring back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Biodiversity gives to us these non-tangible benefits, and I think that's the part of nature that as humans we are all inclined to really value. Personally I'm not a species kind of person, I don't go birdwatching and I don't spend hours of my life looking for that particular...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> You're an ecologist.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I'm an ecologist. But more than that, I guess I'm a landscape person, so I like to take a good look across the landscape and look at the complexity that exists within a landscape. And if you start eroding the arms and the legs and the fingers and the toes of a human, and you do the same on the landscape, you start to lose that beauty and the complexity that is nature. We've lost enough.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Indeed. Another question here; what would Darwin make of the discussion?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think he'd love this discussion. I think it gets to the heart of evolution and everything, we start to understand about how species live in a particular environment, which is what he was really fascinated with and he was certainly fascinated by the diversity of life. And I think everything we are all talking about up here we are in agreement with is really trying to preserve that biodiversity and not to lose any more of it and to capture what we have right now and potentially even be able to bring some of our lost biodiversity back in the future. I think that encapsulates everything that would make Darwin happy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> On the other hand, I think the implication in that question is, okay, red in tooth and claw, he didn't say that but somebody else did, that is competition, and you survive and the survival creature is better, so just leave it alone and it will grow up. It's a sort of capitalist market view. If you've not got enough, you die out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I think competition between species is quite different to between humans and another species. I think we have a distinct unfair advantage when it comes to wiping these animals off the face of the Earth, which is a bit different to two nonhuman species competing for a particular ecological niche. So I think in that regard I would say this is quite a different question.</p><p>An interesting question for the de-extinction debate though, if we do recreate a species, you're only bringing back one animal or a couple of animals, so it's a very similar question of then how do you bring that diversity back. But our answer to that is if we can start to make those millions of edits that we need to to that genome to actually de-extinct an animal, really the easy part would be then engineering in that diversity that you would need to make them have a really robust immune system or be resistant to certain sorts of diseases or impacts from the environment. So certainly we have a good understanding of what those parts of the genomes look like from healthy groups of marsupials, and so you can easily engineer that back then into a thylacine that you recreate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, that engineering is really powerful stuff, that CRISPR.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Yes, so there's a whole session I think at the World Science Festival talking just about CRISPR, but it really is the thing that pushed this whole field forward, is this ability to very easily and reproducibly make those edits to the genome en masse. So that was really the roadblock to the extinction, was we could make edits one at a time, and you had to sequence all 3 billion base pairs to make sure you had your one edit in the right place and everything looked okay. But now we can do that on a much larger scale, still not large enough to make it really something that we could do tomorrow for a thylacine, but certainly that is getting much better all the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> To end, I'd like you to play God again and choose an animal to bring back that has been extinct. I've already chosen the dodo. There's something about me and dodos that kind of go together, their sweet smiling faces, and you know, they were in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alice in Wonderland</emphasis> and various other wonderful stories from way back. So, Duan, what would you choose to bring back an extinct animal from way back that you'd like...?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Well, if you've chosen the dodo, I'll go with the elephant bird in Madagascar.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Describe it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> As I understand, it was a bird like an ostrich but much bigger, as tall as a giraffe and like a giraffe feeds off the trees at the top of the canopy, and the early settlers there didn't take too long to wipe them out. That would be fantastic if that could come back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I'd quite like the moa as well from New Zealand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duan Biggs:</emphasis> Indeed, the moa, and with the Haast's eagle to go with it that used to feed on the moa chicks, that would be a nice ecosystem to have back intact.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> Giant birds running around would be truly terrifying, it would be like a pack of velociraptors I reckon. I don't think you need to ask me this question surely, everybody knows what I'd say, it's the thylacine, it should definitely be the one we bring back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> After the thylacine, going back further?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> I would say a mammoth, I would love to see a mammoth, I think they truly are...and again, another one of those species that really captures people's imaginations. I think just a magnificent beast, and to see it would be truly amazing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I don't want to be asked this question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Why not?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> I'm not the person that should be asked this question. At the moment I want to get on the phone and ask my seven-year-old son, you know, what do you want to see come back?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> T Rex.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kerrie Wilson:</emphasis> Probably, it probably would be T Rex. No, that's not going to happen. For me it's not a question that I want to answer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> I stay with Kerrie. So if you don't accept the northern white rhino from my side then I don't want...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> But it's still here. Just.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> No, it's practically extinct. Two infertile females and no male on the planet, so I think if we don't act with the technology I described, they will be gone in 10 years time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, another thought experiment, it just so happens that I have Denisovan genes, you have some Neanderthal genes, 2% of you is Neanderthal, I can see from here...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Hildebrandt:</emphasis> Thanks!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Now, the Denisovans, and you know about Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo's work in Leipzig, he got some of the work out, and at Wollongong they've just looked again at Denisovans and we may have enough DNA at least to do something, from what you describe Andrew, would you bring back a Denisovan?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Pask:</emphasis> When you start talking about the hominins I think you start to move into very dicey territory. So I'd say I'm going to stick with the thylacine. I think we can leave Neanderthals and Denisovans where they are perhaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I think a Denisovan would be quite good in Canberra, don't you? Well, we've heard about the possibilities, the ecosystems, the understanding of how culture can be so important in bringing people back to understand the animals that surround them, how you can change how we live so that we can live with nature effectively and not in a way that sacrifices our well-being. Thomas has indicated that we can live for another 300 years so that we are invested in the future. But there are ways in which we can effectively make a huge difference, and it has all happened in the last 10 or 20 years, it's been a complete revolution. And I think the sensibilities about why we love these animals, the hushed tones when you actually saw the thylacine there seeming to be alive and seeming to be back with us, it's quite extraordinary. Would you please thank the panel? Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>Our panel at the World Science Festival in Brisbane was: Thomas Hildebrandt from the Leibnitz Institute in Berlin; Professor Kerrie Wilson, executive director Institute for Future Environments at QUT; Associate Professor Andrew Pask from the University of Melbourne; and Duan Biggs, senior research fellow, Griffith University in Brisbane.</p><p>Next week on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis>: the Moon, of course; data, how it could be worth billions of dollars for Australian industry; and the University of Tasmania, how it's uniting the state, or trying to.

Good morning, Simon.</p><p>How are people there coping with the dreadful effects of these fires?</p><p>SIMON LAUDER: Traralgon and all of the many smaller communities in the Strzelecki Ranges in south, I've got to say, are doing it really tough, Tony.</p><p>The deaths in the fire have really shaken up the whole community. It's still really hard for people to talk about it because there's a sense that the crisis is now. There could be more deaths that we don't know about and of course the fire still burns. So for many, especially those in charge of controlling this emergency, it's a matter of deliberately postponing that grief and shock.</p><p>I met people at the relief centre who also didn't know yet if they had a home to go back to and some of those who do know their properties are destroyed have told me that there's a sense of denial. On the upside though, I met a woman who was elated because she found her friend's mother alive and well and she just had to go and find her friend and break the news to her.</p><p>TONY EASTLEY: Here in Wallan this morning it's been reasonable cool and of course there's been some light rain in parts of Victoria. What's the situation where you are?</p><p>SIMON LAUDER: Indeed it was quite chilly and there was bit of rain but the fire still threatens small communities between Churchill and Yarram and the rough and steep terrain of the Strzelecki Ranges is making it really hard to even get to the fire, yet alone contain it and there are several uncontrolled parts of the fire where there are no containment lines.</p><p>So putting those in when the weather's cool is the big challenge for the CFA at this stage, it's keeping their fighters very busy, even in the downtimes, especially in the downtime really. And whether or not people in those threatened communities need to stay or go, is something the need to decide. And the Country Fire Authority incident controller Barry Foss says it's a matter which also deserves more consideration in the future.</p><p>I spoke to Barry Foss a short time ago.</p><p>BARRY FOSS: The fire services have adopted particular philosophies over the years and that's come with the experiences such as Ash Wednesday, there's a lot of research being completed in relation to how the community should deal with it and how the fire services should operate. It will be a matter for future research as to whether those strategies are still appropriate in this day and age but that's a matter for the future. At this point in time we've still got a lot of work to do in controlling these fires.</p><p>SIMON LAUDER: And those strategies, are you referring there to whether people should stay or should they go?</p><p>That's correct I mean, we still maintain that the chance of property survival is to stay and protect your property if certainly you've prepared, and that's important, if you've prepared your property appropriately and you fit and able to do it, both physically and mentally, and I suppose this goes back to the point of whether people should decide to stay or go. If you are prepared, we're recommending that you do stay.</p><p>Are you concerned that the news will get worse in terms of the human toll?</p><p>Yeah look, there's a reasonable area of this fire that we haven't really had the opportunity to get personnel in because of the safety issues and today we're going to progress that and, you know, we're hoping that the toll doesn't rise but there's an expectation that it will.</p><p>TONY EASTLEY: Incident controller at the Churchill fire, Barry Foss.</p><p>Well our reporter Simon Lauder is on the line. Simon, is there any chance this Churchill fire will break out somehow?</p><p>SIMON LAUDER: There certainly is. It's 40,000 hectares and much of it is uncontained and as I mentioned and in the words of one officer here at the Control Centre, fire tends to pillar around a bit some times, but when the wind picks up, the game changes. It's really at the mercy of the wind. Some have still got a bit to run and indeed there are hotter temperatures expected later this week.</p><p>And if the fire starts heading north, it will, in its path will be the Loy Yang power generator and Traralgon is also to the north of the fire at the moment.

Steel industry job losses this week were just the start of the real world pain in the non-mining economy. Labor has tried to prepare for this crunch, but its general ineptitude left its biggest effort - the mining tax - hopelessly compromised and the rest largely unnoticed. A Labor government traditionally would be thinking about spending some money on the problem about now, beyond the $30 million for affected regions and a bringing forward of $100 million of steel industry assistance announced this week. </p><p>Not a bailout. And not spending in the misguided belief that it could substitute for long-term policies to keep Australian industry efficient and productive. But a 45 per cent appreciation of the currency over just two years is an almighty short-term shock for exporters to try to absorb, and no one thinks this is the end of the fallout. Some kind of targeted short-term investment allowance or tax break that might help manufacturing survive, or some kind of broader structural adjustment effort, would not seem unreasonable. Well, it would not seem unreasonable in normal political circumstances. But this is a government under siege. And the international economic uncertainty has already put a question mark over its promise to return the budget to surplus next year, a promise Labor made the benchmark of its economic credibility. The Treasurer, Wayne Swan, told a meeting of Labor backbenchers that the cabinet was \"prepared to use the tax system\" to help manufacturers. He mentioned the tax summit. A special cabinet taskforce has been set up to look at all policy options. But with the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, already signalling more spending cuts to meet the surplus promise, the cabinet has to consider the financial cost and the political cost of returning another deficit. If Labor was faring a bit better politically, that decision might not be so hard. But its political capital is deeply, deeply in deficit. So far it has been left talking about industry \"advocates\" and global centres of excellence, and pointing to stuff it has already done, such as training programs and tougher anti-dumping rules announced in June. Which is all very well but it sounds about as effective as a water pistol against a raging forest fire. The manufacturing unions are not so constrained. They want the government to push harder for miners to use more local product, reasoning that the $430 billion in the investment pipeline should translate into quite a bit of local work. And they say miners should be forced to come up with local \"participation plans\" before their projects are approved. And the Coalition is speaking the unionists' language. The opposition's industry spokeswoman, Sophie Mirabella, says local companies are sick and tired of being told that anything a government might do amounts to protectionism. \"We need to reframe the economic debate,\" she says. \"People are sick of being told there is a level playing field internationally. People are sick of being told it is protectionist if you acknowledge the reality that there is not. \"Subsidised foreign goods are distorting our markets ... we could do much more in terms of anti-dumping, we could do more in terms of getting major projects to use local content without breaching our international obligations, we could do more in terms of government purchasing ... and if that brings on the inevitable hysterical screams that we are being protectionist, we need to show that's just false, we need to shift the debate.\" She is preparing to do just that with policy announcements over the next couple of weeks. In other words, the Coalition is preparing to continue its raid on Labor's blue-collared heartland by outflanking the \"party of the workers\" from the left. But despite the fighting words, there are still a few things cruelling the credibility of the Coalition's new blue-collar pitch. For one, it is still promising a $500 million cut to existing automotive grants, which carmakers say would lead to the close of existing operations. Mirabella said she was in \"detailed discussions\" with the auto industry. But since the Coalition's razor gang is already looking for $70 billion in savings, Tony Abbott has not got much financial leeway either. And the Coalition is still promising to vote against the revised mining profits tax and scrap the programs to be funded from it. Despite BHP's $22 billion profit, the Coalition says the miners are paying \"more than enough tax\". For Labor, the tragedy of their predicament is that they did see this \"manufacturing crisis\" coming. Swan explained his original $99 billion (over 10 years) resource super profits tax in May last year, on the basis that the mining boom would make it very difficult for the \"non-mining parts of the economy to retain workers and investment as they are drawn to the mining sector\". \"You may have heard of the 'Dutch disease' where the exploitation of natural gas in the 1970s is supposed to have 'hollowed out' the Dutch economy,\" he said in a speech to economists. If we had not heard of \"Dutch disease\" then, we sure have now. But of course, the Rudd government's remedy - the resource super profits tax - was smashed by a $22 million advertising campaign by angry miners, after Labor reneged on promises to consult on the details. And Rudd's prime ministership, already weakened by the backflip on the emissions trading scheme, was smashed, too. Julia Gillard quickly negotiated a compromise with just the three biggest miners, which raised only $38.5 billion over 10 years, meaning the proposed company tax cut supposed to help the non-mining parts of the economy had to be cut from 2 per cent to 1 per cent. And even that $38.5 billion relies on new, higher, but unpublished estimates of the volume and value of the minerals being exported. The Coalition, the Greens and the smaller miners strongly suspect the tax take from the major mining companies will be not much more than what they were paying before. And so our hollow political debate rolls on. The compromised versus the uncompromising. As the Treasury secretary, Martin Parkinson, said this week, the economy is facing bigger problems than it has for generations. But the government is scraping to find the political capital to meet the challenge and the opposition is driven by whatever will help it blast its way to power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-614fiwhbh9sddy8zoer</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53MX-SFC1-F09W-8218-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>August 27, 2011 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Industry/Manufacturing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy/Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy/Financial Markets/Currency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy/Taxation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics/Political Parties Groups/Australian Labor Party/ALP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Energy &amp;

Both have their place in ensuring a long-term future for irrigation communities.</p><p>The best outcomes for rivers and communities are achieved when irrigation modernisation and water buyback work together to create high-value, highly efficient irrigation in the areas where it is most suitable and to provide transitional assistance for communities where it is not.</p><p>Selling water to the Government is actually popular with farmers. Every tender in the southern basin has been oversubscribed and most people are only selling a portion of their entitlement and remaining in irrigation.</p><p>The water buyback program is a highly cost-effective way of returning water to rivers and gives farmers an injection of cash to increase business flexibility, retire debt and stay in their communities.</p><p>If only groups like the National Irrigators Council would support these farmers and the option they have chosen, rather than making out that the only beneficiaries of buyback are the banks.</p><p>Juliet Le Feuvre,</p><p>Environment Victoria</p><p>Murray flows first-rate</p><p>I WOULD hope that common sense and logic prevails in the whole water debate of the Murray Darling Basin assessment.</p><p>Surely with the excellent flows of the last 18 months, plus the coming snow melt, would mean that there is ample time, to properly assess the flow needs, not just jump at shadows to tick environmental boxes.</p><p>The loss of any further agricultural production in this country will be a grave error of federal or state judgment.</p><p>Murray Roberts,</p><p>Strathmore, Vic</p><p>Missed chance with census</p><p>GIVEN the Gillard Government is so desperate to reduce its carbon footprint, why haven't they encouraged people to do the census electronically rather than by paper?</p><p>Think of all the trees cut down to make a paper form for all households.</p><p>What the Government should have done was take out ads on prime-time television well before hand to encourage people to register to do it electronically.</p><p>Then once the numbers were crunched, only print enough forms for those who did not register for lodging electrically.</p><p>Alan Barron,</p><p>Grovedale, Vic</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WKT201108171025308819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53JS-GB41-F0JP-W463-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>August 17, 2011 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00091Z0</classCode><className>SPC ARDMONA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D4F3</classCode><className>FRUIT &amp;

There was no YouTube in 2003 or 2004, either.</p><p>Not until \"Me at the zoo,\" a video of co-founder Jawed Karim standing in front of elephants at the zoo in San Diego, USA, was posted in April 2005, was there, really, a YouTube.</p><p>Yet despite being around for fewer than half of the past 10 years, the video-sharing service is the decade's most influential popular-culture force on the internet.</p><p>From Karim talking about the elephants' trunks in the still-available 19-second clip, it has spearheaded the availability of video on the Web, everything from golf tournaments, live, to episodes of popular sitcoms.</p><p>These developments threaten traditional delivery systems. YouTube became the clearing-house for the short, shared, \"viral\" videos that were a key to making internet culture into mainstream culture, and started to play a role in politics, especially in the 2008 US presidential campaign.</p><p>It developed as a kind of chaotic library, a reference resource for people seeking video of musical artists, old cigarette commercials or a news sensation. And it has championed the decade's DIY aesthetic: Skip the professionals, was YouTube's implicit message. Shoot your own video. Upload it here, fast and easy.</p><p>And, in the end, it doesn't matter so much if your backyard trampoline-stunt footage (ouch!) isn't great art; what matters is the validation it seems to get by being hosted on an external site.</p><p>With YouTube, if you wanted your friends to watch what you made, you didn't have to drag them into your living room and plug the camcorder into the TV.</p><p>You just sent them a link, and they watched it at the same website that has professional material by TV stars. The site echoed similar revolutions in writing, as blogs came to prominence, and in photography, as people shared photos on sites such as Flickr. But with YouTube, it was even more so, because the bar to getting videos shown in public had been higher.</p><p>Professional creators of content tried to fight YouTube for a while, policing their copyrights zealously and seeking takedowns whenever possible. But eventually, they decided they'd rather switch than fight. Deals were struck, and providers who didn't form their own YouTube channels to show highlights offered the equivalent of YouTube clips and more on their own sites or on professional aggregators, led by iTunes, from Apple, by Netflix, and by Hulu, a project of General Electric Co, News Corp and, later, Disney.</p><p>YouTube created the expectation that video would be available online, on demand, freed of network schedule or DVD. It got so big, so fast that Google was moved to buy the service for $US1.65 billion in late 2006, an admission that Google's own stab at a video-upload site, Google Videos, had lost.</p><p>It was quite a climb for the service that began with a clip of the zoo. Karim, Steve Chen and Chad Hurley had met while working at PayPal, the money-transfer service. Chen was a graduate of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy and, like Karim, had studied computer science.</p><p>But even as YouTube has become a ubiquitous brand, virtually the synonym for web-based video, it hasn't yet proved it can translate its enormous traffic into revenue. The site has struggled to integrate advertising in a way that won't alienate customers, who value its instant accessibility and lack of clutter.</p><p>And indeed, Hulu, which might be termed a professional version of YouTube, has announced that it will, next year, begin charging.</p><p>But the battle of getting people to pay for content on the web, or of getting content to pay for itself through ads, is a \u00e2\u20ac\u201d possibly the \u00e2\u20ac\u201d question of the next decade.</p><p>NOUGHTIES' 5 KEY WEB MOMENTS</p><p>1 2000: The (first) internet bubble bursts. Lots of people made a lot of money, lots of people lost a lot. But the collapse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effect, similar to a forest fire, cleared the way for a lot of new growth and a more mature, more reality-based web.</p><p>2 2001: The first iPod is introduced. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portable player of music in digital-file format would pave the way for music sales on the internet (iTunes), challenging the share-with-everyonebut- the-creators model of Napster. iPods also, of course, would lead to the iPhone, which puts the world wide web of mobile entertainment, plus a phone, in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets.</p><p>3 2001: Wikipedia begins. What Wikipedia proved was the potential to harvest the web for massive, non-professional collaboration, a lesson that political campaigns would soon take to heart.</p><p>4 2003: MySpace is launched. It would grow within three years to become the most popular social-networking service in the United States. In addition to paving the way for Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in more recent years, MySpace demonstrated that many people absolutely wanted to have personal web pages and conduct social lives online. The service also became an effective vehicle for music promotion.</p><p>5 2006: Twitter is created. The site gives everyone from bored journalists to bored celebrities a place to jot and share their micro thought bursts.</p><p>While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too soon to know the ultimate impact, the growth curve has been phenomenal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUSTRATION: ROBIN COWCHER</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">5sfjxbywe20ynke6os0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7XD8-0XJ0-YB64-401F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2013-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>December 26, 2009 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Technology/Computers/Online Services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Company/YouTube Inc</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

After blundering through fields, villages and small towns, confused, hungry and often angry as farmers attacked them with stones, spears and arrows, the elephants were at last diverted back towards their forest.</p><p>Six people were trampled to death by the animals during the first few days of their rampage. One man was crushed, according to the daily `Telegraph' of Calcutta, when he tried to ram a hot iron rod into the anus of one of the elephants.</p><p>A `Telegraph' reporter, Debashish Bhattacharyya, said: \"The elders in the herd bore the torment with patience and trumpeted only occasionally to chase people away ... While the behavior of the elephants was restrained, the conduct of local people and state administration officials was beastly.\"</p><p>But in the past few days, a saner mood seems to have prevailed among the populace. Yesterday in Calcutta, Hindu priests began praying to appease Ganesh, the elephant god.</p><p>The villagers, instead of persecuting the animals, beat drums, waved torches and formed a human chain to turn them back to their forest sanctuary.</p><p>Trains were held up as the herd wandered back and forth across the railway line, and there were long traffic delays on the roads as lorries were parked to block the herd's path.</p><p>The elephants suffered casualties too. One of the two calves in the herd got stuck in a bog, where the best efforts of accompanying bull elephants to extract it were of no avail. West Bengal forestry officials later extricated it, but failed to reunite it with the herd.</p><p>They took the elephant calf to the zoo.</p><p>Only 100 kilometres away _ two days' trample for a herd of elephants _ Calcutta was alive with rumors and gossip on New Year's Eve. Bets were taken on whether the herd would swim across the city's last line of defence, the Hooghly river, and which political party they would support if they reached the state capital.</p><p>Local papers advised their readers on the do's and don'ts of running into a wild elephant.

One has been in bed for 11 days with a foot infection, another suffered frostbite to his face campaigning in a mountainous region, one cannot do walk-abouts after injuring a hand and foot in a fall and one developed intestinal and bronchial infections after accepting some home-made food.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stick with one Italy: president ITALIAN President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has insisted the country's unity be maintained after powerful party leader Umberto Bossi called for the secession of the rich north. Bossi, whose Northern League made a strong showing in last month's elections, touched off a storm with a speech to his party's self-styled \"parliament of the north\" in Bagnolo San Vito.</p><p>China quake deaths stable THE death toll from China's latest earthquake remained at 18 but might go higher as 280 were still in a serious condition, a spokesman for the Baotou Seismology Bureau said yesterday. The quake, at 6.4 on the Richter scale, shook a mountainous valley in the northern region of Inner Mongolia on Friday.</p><p>A fire too fast A FOREST fire in northern New Mexico erupted yesterday, forcing 2000 residents to evacuate and engulfing several houses. No injuries were reported. Ignited by burning trash, the blaze burnt 1620 hectares of the Carson National Forest, forcing evacuations from Red River, La Lama and Questa and engulfing half a dozen houses in La Lama.</p><p>Firefighters fought it from the air because it was moving too quickly for ground crews.</p><p>Phoney smokes blast Gulf state NINE pre-dawn explosions set off by booby-trapped cigarette packets hit foreign and other firms in Bahrain yesterday, causing millions of dollars in damage but no injuries, a government official said.</p><p>Ecstasy claims another victim A BRITISH police chief's daughter died at an all-night party hours after taking the drug ecstasy at a club, it was claimed. Claire Pierce, 20, daughter of Superintendent Roy Pierce, was found dead at the home of Simon Wright, near the town of Mansfield, early yesterday.</p><p>Wright, 20, said he was told Claire had taken tablets in a nightclub in nearby Derby.</p><p>NZ flies into a spin about fruit NEW Zealand agriculture prepared for a crisis after the discovery of a further 14 Mediterranean fruit-flies in Auckland yesterday. Ministry of Agriculture officials have begun spraying poison bait in a three-kilometre circle around the Mt Roskill suburb where they were found. Two were found last week. The Mediterranean fruit-fly is one of the most damaging species for commercial orchards.</p><p>Not quite what program intended AN orang-utan called Indra left Auckland zoo officials red-faced when she climbed a ladder inadvertently left in her cage and went out to meet the people. Her five minutes of freedom sparked an emergency at the zoo and hundreds of visitors were warned to shelter in the nearest secure building as Indra took a stroll with her baby Isim.

Since about 1960 we have, through trial and error, learnt to burn when the measured fuel moisture in the uncut forest is 18 per cent plus, while that in felled slash is 10 to 14 per cent.</p><p>This critical difference occurs for only a few days after the first rains of autumn. If the measured wind, temperature and relative humidity conditions and the four-day forecast are all okay the forest fire manager must take every opportunity to burn before the onset of heavier rains.</p><p> This year these vital conditions coincided with Easter and upset many people.</p><p> This is understandable given the catcalls of \"barbaric\" and \"Third World practice\" and the utter failure of the Greens to praise and explain Tasmania's magnificent record in fire ecology research, forest regeneration and reserved forests.</p><p> A true ecotourist program would make a feature of these huge smoke towers coming from such tightly contained patches of forest.</p><p> It would tell every tourist how we learnt to harness nature's most powerful ecological weapon to produce clean, green and vigorous forests.</p><p>Tony Mount</p><p>Forest fire ecologist</p><p>Taroona</p><p>Anti-social</p><p>behaviour</p><p>I find it incredible that in the 21st century ForestryTasmania has the arrogance to believe it has some God-given right to pollute, regardless of the effects on the rest of the community.</p><p> Evan Rolley says it (burning) has to be done when the weather is suitable (The Mercury, April 2).</p><p> Who says it has to be done? Not the people who look from the top of Mt Wellington into a yellow smog; not the tourist operators, having to apologise for the condition of our much-touted \"purest air in the world\"; not even those well-qualified foresters who contend that burning is not a necessary requirement for successful regeneration.</p><p> This is as if a chemical firm had said that it needed to flush its tanks of toxic residues into the Derwent River, and this could only be done when the tide was right.</p><p> No one would tolerate such a statement from any organisation, so why does the Department of the Environment condone and/or turn a blind eye to the actions of ForestryTasmania in so many areas of interest to the larger community? Ordinary citizens face stringent action if they light backyard bonfires or run smoky woodheaters, yet ForestryTasmania remains mysteriously immune.</p><p> May we hope to see an effective sanction against this body and its anti-social behaviour?</p><p>Ian Milne</p><p>Seven Mile Beach</p><p>Road space</p><p>I noticed that a Hobart City Council alderman is pushing a \"sustainability in transport\" initiative this week. I will be on my bicycle commuting to my job and endorsing such sentiments, as I have done since the early seventies.</p><p> I have also been a driver of cars, trucks and buses since 1968.</p><p> I think I understand what it takes to negotiate our increasingly adversarial road system.</p><p> However, in the past two weeks I have had physical contact with three vehicles as they have moved into my road space. I have tried to push them away. They are that close! A blue Toyota driven by a young woman pulled out of the right lane into my path in Regent St. A large truck drove past me and then moved over on to me in Macquarie St, and on Easter Sunday a yellow Corolla drove at speed into my space. He had obviously left his turn into Molle St too late.</p><p> I am all for sustainable transport until it kills me.</p><p>Raymond Arnold</p><p>Mt Nelson</p><p>Ferries</p><p>Responding to C. F. Tate (Letters, March 26), I recall a trip on the Nairana on my way to Darwin during World War II. May I suggest that we forget the indigenous and the governor-general for the time being and give favourable consideration to naming the two new ferries Rosny and Derwent in memory of the vessels plying our magnificent river years ago.</p><p>David Tregear</p><p>West Moonah</p><p>Sunnies</p><p>Regarding the letter by Egon Strodl (March 28), it is all very well to criticise people for wearing sunglasses, but has it ever occurred to him that some people have bad eyes and can't stand bright lights?</p><p> Sometimes it can still be a bit glary, whether the sun is out or not. I have to wear them on doctor's orders. Don't be so quick to knock people with sunnies just because you have the good fortune of good eyesight.</p><p>J. Lear</p><p>Kingston</p><p>Queen Mother</p><p>Your excellent editorial (April 2) on the death of the Queen Mother said it all. It was the end of an era and for the first time in my life I observed people from across the Australian political spectrum -- whether constitutional monarchists or republicans -- and whether young or old paying tribute to a wonderful person.</p><p> What a pity that one or two mean-spirited republicans couldn't resist using the death of the Queen Mother to push their own self-centred barrow.</p><p>Michael Hodgman</p><p>Hobart</p><p> I commend Graeme Phillips on his Taste article (March 27) regarding the proposed Liquor and Accommodation Act amendments. I agree with nearly all of his sentiments and strongly oppose the reforms to the Licensing Board.</p><p> I make these observations as a person with extensive experience and understanding of the hospitality industry. I deliver responsible serving of alcohol courses within Tasmania. I am the sole deliverer of these courses to industry and have been since the program's inception in 1995.</p><p> I have previously been the holder of five hotel licences, the first being in 1975 when I was 21. I have owned, managed, operated and held liquor licences for hotels, restaurants, function centres, bottle shops, liquor stores and liquor merchants.</p><p> According to AHA state director Daniel Leesong's letter (April 1) the restructuring of the Licensing Board (to seven members) to include legislated industry representation is a safeguard to ensure that there will be board members with relevant industry knowledge and experience.</p><p> Yet in the next paragraph he goes on to say, \"The current Tasmanian Licensing Board has two of three members that have had hospitality industry experience\" (the third by provision of the current Act is required to be a legal practitioner). So, as the famous saying goes, if the wheel of the wagon ain't broke, don't fix it. As Graeme Phillips pointed out, there's no tourism or wine industry representatives in this proposal, but maybe Paul Lennon feels they don't contribute to the hospitality industry, or is that just the AHA's view?</p><p> The key word used by Mr Leesong is \"safeguard\" but his analysis as to who is being protected is flawed as the proposed amendments would only safeguard the existing players.</p><p> Furthermore, he asserts \"the introduction of a need to show sound commercial principles are underpinning an application ensures that orderly development of the industry is maintained\".</p><p> So now a board consisting of persons representing vested interests will make decisions on whether or not a proposal is \"sound\" before granting a licence. Some points: *\u00a0 Will the board members be qualified to make such a judgment? *\u00a0 All rejections based on the above will end up being appealed in court (in fact, all decisions of the re-structured board would end up in court as it would have a stated vested and anti-competitive interest); *\u00a0 The Act specifically directs the board to maintain the \"orderly development of the industry\", so how does removing this direct reference under the proposed amendments and stacking the new board achieve this? *\u00a0 Surely the most obvious arbiter of sound commercial principle is the market place.</p><p> Mr Leeson says: \"In addition, the Licensing Board will still be required to take into account the best interests of the community as a whole when granting liquor licences\".</p><p> The amendments do not mention the word \"community\" once. The Act infers the board members represent the interests of the community. Will the new, stacked board look out for community interest or their own interest? If the Licensing Board in 1987 was of the proposed composition the Hotel Grand Chancellor would never have been granted a licence.</p><p> He then applauds the Bacon Government for \"honouring its commitment to the hotel sector\". Pity this commitment will potentially harm the rest of the state in the process. Just think -- poker machines!</p><p> What gross hypocrisy to introduce a Bill freeing up shop trading hours and shutting down tourism development in the same session.</p><p>Colin Corney</p><p>Hobart</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-MER0204041018998614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEMERCURY,HOBALTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:45H3-SM80-015H-90PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1465\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>April 4, 2002, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Composition</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDJDRDcyQjc1NzNBNDFDRThERDhCQTRBRkNCRURERDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTRCNTZEQjY2QkExNEExQzhFM0U4REU1NjM5QzMzOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp;

It could prevent 50 billion tonnes of carbon from being released into the atmosphere.</p><p>Ashley Hall has more.</p><p>(sound of forest fire)</p><p>ASHLEY HALL: In 2005, illegal logging in Indonesia and the subsequent fires were blamed for a plume of smoke that swept across South-East Asia, cutting visibility and causing breathing problems in neighbouring countries.</p><p>But it's not just the smoke that's a problem. The slashing and burning of tropical rainforests is also considered a prime factor in climate change.</p><p>Dr Pep Canadell, the Executive Director of the Global Carbon Project and CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research says deforestation is to blame for about one and a half billion tonnes of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere every year for the past 15 years.</p><p>PEP CANADELL: We have a huge reservoir of carbon. We go there, we cut it, we burn it, and it goes into the atmosphere. But in addition to that, we make disappear a piece of forest that is taking and cleaning a lot of the carbon in the atmosphere. So it's almost a double loss.</p><p>ASHLEY HALL: So this is a devastating impact?</p><p>PEP CANADELL: It is. And actually the calculations we are doing is that the net effect of all this deforestation, it's basically almost an increase of 20 per cent additional emissions from human activity going into the atmosphere and feeding into climate change.</p><p>ASHLEY HALL: Greenpeace's Forest Campaigner, Tiy Chung, says tropical rainforests are vanishing at an alarming rate.</p><p>TIY CHUNG: In PNG, 60 per cent of its large ancient intact forests have already been destroyed, and Greenpeace estimates that over 90 per cent of logging in PNG is illegal.</p><p>Between August 2000 and 2005, the Amazon lost 2.8 million hectares of forest.</p><p>Indonesia was confirmed, a couple of weeks ago, as a Guinness World Record holder for destroying its forests at the fastest rate, and the Democratic Republic of Congo risks losing up to 40 per cent of its forests by 2050.</p><p>ASHLEY HALL: Greenpeace says aside from logging, forests are cleared to make way for agricultural land.</p><p>In the Amazon, it's cleared to produce soya.</p><p>In Indonesia, the Solomons and Papua New Guinea, land is cleared to produce pulp and paper, as well as palm oil.</p><p>And palm oil is produced to service the increase in demand for biofuels brought about by the EU's decision to move towards 20 per cent biofuel use.</p><p>Greenpeace's Tiy Chung says that target was ill-conceived.</p><p>TIY CHUNG: You know, you can't just say something like we're going to go 20 per cent into biofuels without also looking at how that's going to be produced.</p><p>ASHLEY HALL: The International Tropical Timber Organisation is holding its 42nd meeting this week in Port Moresby. At a similar meeting in 1990, it set a target called Objective 2000. The plan was to ensure that trade in tropical timber came only from sustainable forests by 2000.</p><p>But in last year's assessment, the ITTO found less than five per cent of tropical forests were being managed sustainably.</p><p>The PNG Prime Minister, Sir Michael Somare, hinted at the reason when he opened the meeting - economic growth. It would be illogical, he said, to expect developing countries to grow without using their forest resources.</p><p>But Dr Pep Canadell says it would take a relatively small effort to reduce the carbon emissions from deforestation.</p><p>PEP CANADELL: If you slow down deforestation of the next, you know, 100 years by 50 per cent, you can be looking at a savings of about 500 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere every single year.</p><p>ASHLEY HALL: And he says many of the affected nations have already asked to be included in a global carbon emissions trading scheme. The proposal would allow some countries to be rewarded with carbon credits in exchange for reducing deforestation.</p><p>In March, the Federal Government announced $197 million to help fight deforestation in the tropics.</p><p>Federal Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull.</p><p>MALCOLM TURNBULL: What we are seeking to do is to bring deforestation and addressing deforestation to the top of the climate change agenda. It is something that we can do now. As I said in my speech at the Press Club recently, we have to be committed to early action.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: The Federal Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull, ending Ashley Hall's report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-1920977</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4NPJ-9KH0-TXDB-C21B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><timeReceived>6:27 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>May 11, 2007 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment/Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Rain Forests and Forest</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, Economics and Finance/Industry/Timber</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Or is it two? Students at Rydell High include John Travolta, since reborn as a megastar, and our own Lady of the Pompadours, Olivia Newton-Thing, who talks to (or for) the animals on Nine. A lot of left-over bits from West Side Story, Rebel Without A Clue and The Acne Monster Meets Dobie Gillis are bonded together with a sticky substance and enlivened by a lot of superannuated stars such as Frankie Avalon, Ed Byrnes and the repulsive Sid Caesar. The result? Suck it and see or, if time is short, try this handy hint from our culinary adviser, Dr Vladimir Jacuzzi. He recommends dipping a beach umbrella in golden syrup and swallowing it with a splash of Mouton Ron Casey, J Curve Series Commemorative port. Mmnnn!</p><p>SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER (1977)</p><p>On Seven at 10.50 pm</p><p>A lot has changed in the past 19 years. Just as well, too! Tony Manero, in the person of John Travolta, adopts the poses that made him famous in this marshmallow fable of a hardware clerk striving for immortality in an ice-cream suit. Hectic dance routines and melting moments abound as he dances his socks off. More of a nut sundae than a film, but it did HUGE business at the box office and, given Travolta's newfound status as a re-invented, re-born and \"respectable\" character actor, is possibly worth a re-visit.</p><p>MEDICINE MAN (1992)</p><p>On Nine at 8.30 pm</p><p>DEEP in the fetid rainforests of Brazil, Dr Sean Connery is working on a cure for cancer. Och Jock!! Eureka! He finds it and damn and blast! promptly loses it. Ah well, back to the drawing board. Meanwhile the board of directors at the university sponsoring his research think Dr Campbell has had a fair go and no longer warrants further grants. There have been some very promising results from a Dr Hammond of the Jurassic Park Looney Theme Park Laboratory. So they instruct biochemist Lorraine Bracco (PhD in Street Smarts and a Masters in Up Yer Face New York Attitood), to hop on a jet and do a Stanley/Livingstone routine - \"Telegram, Doc. Bad news, I'm afraid.\" But when she realises how close Campbell is to the crucial breakthrough in recreating the magic formula, she pitches in. No such magic arises between them, alas, as they fight off filthy entrepreneurs who want to bulldoze the rainforest where the crucial ingredients are located and erect another vertical griller factory. A fabulous forest fire revs things up but the yarn lacks the potency, the characters and the kind of fusion necessary to shove it into overdrive. It dies with the brakes on and Bracco isn't about to roll over and beg for it like a James Bond bimbette. Different casting might have helped but I suspect otherwise.</p><p>JACQUELINE (1956)</p><p>On ABC at 1 pm</p><p>A GROG-SODDEN Belfast shipwright suffers from vertigo but is put back on an even keel (sorry) by his tiny child.

Records show the moon in June can be an extremely dangerous place.</p><p> At this time of year, the moon, and the Earth, are exposed to a dangerous phenomenon that could damage observers' eyes and even threaten life.</p><p> Over the past 1000 years, the latter half of June has seen some of the most destructive meteor strikes on Earth and on the moon.</p><p> This is a result of the Earth moving through the Taurid meteor stream, a trail of debris left by an extinct comet.</p><p> The 150 metre to 200 metre diameter chunk of ice and dust that exploded with the force of an H-bomb about 8km above Siberia on June 30, 1908, flattened trees over an area of 2000 sq km.</p><p> It also left a descent trail as bright as the sun, dazzling observers as far to the east as China.</p><p> On June 18, 1178, \"four wise men\" stargazing on a warm, cloudless night in the English town of Canterbury were terrified by the spectacle of fire erupting from the half-moon.</p><p> Over the next few hours, they saw the moon change from its normal yellow-white to dull red, as a cloud of vaporised gas, rock and debris from a major impact spread across its surface.</p><p> Astronauts on the first Apollo mission to examine the back of the moon -- which is perpetually hidden from the Earth -- photographed a huge, apparently recent crater on the dark side, behind its north pole.</p><p> The crater, since named Giordano Bruno, was probably produced by a comet fragment 2km to 3km in diameter.</p><p> Had it hit the Earth it could have destroyed all human life on the planet -- only sheer chance prevented it doing so.</p><p> However, recent research suggests a storm of smaller fragments produced a tidal wave which devastated Pacific Rim countries after crashing into the ocean.</p><p> One of those fragments may have exploded over the Tapanui region of New Zealand's South Island.</p><p> Maori legends, that may date to the 1178 impact, have it that part of the moon broke off and crashed to Earth, setting fire to the forests and killing huge numbers of moas, the giant flightless birds that once inhabited New Zealand.</p><p> Recent geological surveys of the Tapanui region identified several young impact craters, and extensive deposits of charcoal which would indicate a major forest fire.</p><p> In 1973, a seismometer left on the lunar surface by one of the Apollo missions recorded the vibrations of a major meteor shower -- again in late June.</p><p> The odds against eclipse-watchers witnessing a lunar impact tonight are long, but not astronomically so.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHS0007161024712028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYHERALDSUNLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44K8-CTN0-0197-93VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>July 16, 2000, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MILKY WAY\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001330</classCode><className>PLANETS &amp;

But when I first heard it performed by the American group Cry Cry Cry I immediately read the CD sleeve to discover who had married this haunting melody to such an affecting story -- the tale of 13 firefighters killed in a forest fire in Montana in 1949 told from the point of view of one who escaped (barely) with his life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The story song is seldom heard in the charts these days -- unless you call Madonna's ritual disembowelment of American Pie a story song -- but a tune as powerful as Cold Missouri Waters made me realise how undervalued stories of real people have become in a celebrity-obsessed world.</p><p>As it turns out, the author, Canadian singer and songwriter James Keelaghan, right, had been thinking much the same thing as he was growing up and then studying history at university. The first time he heard Cry Cry Cry's version of his song it stopped him in his tracks, too.</p><p>Keelaghan says: \"When I first heard their version</p><p>I was driving in my car --</p><p>I put it into the CD player but had to pull over because I was bawling like a baby. I thought then that I had started to accomplish what I had set out to do. Now people all over North America are covering the song, retelling the story.\"</p><p>What he had set out to do was to keep the story alive, giving a voice in song to the ordinary people who are usually forgotten when the generation that knew them passes on.</p><p>\"It is always the people that attracted me,\" says Keelaghan, who is back in Australia for a tour that brings him to Brisbane tomorrow night. \"The real problem when I studied history is that people come away thinking it's about generals and prime ministers. I have a radically different view, so I promised myself I would try to take ordinary people and give them a measure of fame.\"</p><p>Songs like that one and Kiri's Piano, about the forced internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II, have won Keelaghan his reputation as one of his country's leading songwriters. But turmoil in his personal life meant his muse took a different turn on his latest album, Road (Hightone).</p><p>\"I hadn't written personal stuff before but because of things I was going through, my divorce and my father nearly dying from a heart attack, I thought if I don't write about it now there won't be a chance at all.\"</p><p>He does it beautifully on songs like Ring and Your Secret, although there is still room for one classic new Keelaghan tale, Captain Torres, about the ship of that name caught in wild weather off the coast of Canada in 1989. Because of the severity of the storm the chances of survival were slim and the crew lined up in the radio room to phone home and say goodbye. There were no survivors.</p><p>\"The story is not as well known as you would think in Canada because it was on the same night as a mass murder in Montreal when a man shot 15 women,\" Keelaghan says.</p><p>\"The dichotomy is that one guy did something that night so horrendous all men got tarred with it, while 600 miles to the east, 29 men were doing what men normally do. Which, at the moment of crisis and death, is thinking about family.\"</p><p>James Keelaghan plays Souths Rugby Union Club, Frederick Street, Yeronga, Brisbane, tomorrow from 7.30pm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML0003251W16369111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIERMAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44KK-YFD0-0197-F2FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Courier Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>March 25, 2000, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001795</classCode><className>FOLK &amp; WORLD MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001184</classCode><className>MUSIC INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000266</classCode><className>CD &amp; DVD DRIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009UJ9</classCode><className>MADONNA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The fundamentals of a forest or furnace fire are the same.</p><p> The Australian eucalypt that another green spokesman referred to as fire retardant does not shed its bark or leaves until all moisture is extracted, thus creating ever increasing ground layers of highly combustible material that refuses to decompose.</p><p> Old growth trees shed the most.</p><p> The high wind in Canberra was a convection current, the result of the wildfire, not the cause of the fire.</p><p> Similarly, while drought conditions are a final contributor to wildfire, they are not the cause.</p><p> The cause is fuel levels further dehydrated by drought conditions.</p><p> Arsonists and careless smokers should be condemned but, like natural lightning, these ignitions cannot turn into a wildfire without high levels of combustible fuel at ground level.</p><p> Forest roads might provide access for the careless but they also provide primary access to firefighters to extinguish fires in their infancy -- however they are lit.</p><p> I am bemused by the Green network citing statistics as to how many forest fires begin outside national parks before becoming destructive wildfires inside the parks.</p><p> Surely it is the fact and reasons that the park burned that matter.</p><p> Controlled burning has nothing to do with simply working around urban areas.</p><p> It is the well-researched cool burn technology that the NSW State Forests Department continued to practise on a seven-year rotation throughout the entire 2.5 million hectares under management. Last year they suffered 2000ha of fires.</p><p> On the other hand, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service reduced its activity to half a per cent of its management area and experienced 750,000ha of fires last year.</p><p> The assertion that ecological change arises from a frequent low-level burning pattern defies history.</p><p> The unique Australian eucalypt is the product of this process as practised by the Aborigines and well recorded by the early settlers. They described the forest in the 1790s as one of well-spaced large trees surrounded by clear grasslands, not the</p><p>impenetrable, fire-prone bush McFadzean would describe as pristine.</p><p> The native Australian plants are tolerant species, but nothing resists a wildfire.</p><p> It is the crown-burning wildfires that kill native trees and create the opportunity for the establishment of alternative exotic species and weeds.</p><p> The suggestion that a strong dense regrowth area of young eucalypts will burn more fiercely than a metre plus of absolutely dry ground matter in an old growth forest is ridiculous.</p><p> This suggests we could better ignite our lounge or camp fire with green sticks.</p><p> The same can be said of McFadzean's reference to the vulnerability of plantations.</p><p> There's clear evidence in my electorate of bush fires burning all the old growth bush, but expiring metres after entering the managed plantation forest.</p><p>Canberra's pine plantations experienced fires in recent years that started within their boundaries and were extinguished without the destruction experienced during the recent tragedy.</p><p> THE Canberra pine fires were ignited by the blowtorch of the super wildfires of the adjoining national parks that, to quote eyewitness accounts, were even burning the smoke particles as they roared into suburbia.</p><p> The 1939 Stretton Royal Commission in Victoria gave an identical description in its report.</p><p> There is plenty of science about the causes of fire, but less about the science of fire suppression.</p><p> The McFadzeans of this world do the community, the animals and trees no favours by attempting to confuse the issue to support their confused philosophy.</p><p> WILSON TUCKEY is federal Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DHS0302211020025615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERALDSUNLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:47YX-RWK0-015G-T1M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>February 21, 2003, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;

Danny Boyle's film is more than an unsparing record of Ralston's ordeal; it is a life-affirming experience, with some dazzling filmcraft and a brave central performance from James Franco. Much of it is hard to watch, all of it hard to forget.</p><p>EVAN WILLIAMS ****</p><p>No Strings Attached (MA15+)</p><p>A bright and breezy rom-com, which deals more candidly than most with bodily parts and functions (no nudity though) and centres on a couple of charming performances from Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher as a couple who (at first) want sex without love. Unfortunately, if you've seen the trailer you've already seen the best jokes.</p><p>D.S.</p><p>SOUTH AUSTRALIA</p><p>STAGE</p><p>The Wau Wau Sisters</p><p>The New York-based Wau Wau Sisters (Tanya Gagne and Adrienne Truscott) are part of a new wave of burlesque performers -- most of them women -- who trade on sex and nudity while dismantling traditional notions of the demeaned stripper or prettily passive showgirl. They open their new show, The Wau Wau Sisters are as Naked as the Day They Were Born Again, at the Adelaide Fringe. The sisters' routines are a spicy stir-fry of kinky acrobatics and trapeze, satirical songs, comedy sketches and stripping. As its title implies, their latest show takes an emphatically minimalist approach to costuming.</p><p>ROSEMARY NEILL</p><p>The Spiegeltent. Garden of Unearthly Delights, East Terrace, Adelaide.

The Small Ensemble has Cole out front, with Mark Schwaber and Matt Cullen trading acoustic guitars, banjo and mandolin in support. Opening with No Blue Skies, Cole performs two sets and delves deep into his songbook. Highlights from his days with the Commotions include Perfect Skin, Are You Ready to be Heartbroken?, Forest Fire and Rattlesnakes. The older material sits well alongside recent compositions such as Writers Retreat! and favourites from the solo years such as Margo's Waltz, Like Lovers Do and the encore, Undressed. Cole's singing, buoyed by clever wordplay, is enriched throughout by a swell of acoustic instruments. Splendid.</p><p>SEAN SENNETT</p><p>The Gov. 59 Port Road, Hindmarsh. Tonight, 5pm.

From the moment the spotlight finds vaudeville wise-cracker Old Toss (Ernie Dingo) with his sidekick Young Harry (Jessica Clarke), we are on a roller-coaster of irony, bitter social critique, affectionate humour and drama. Drawing on a club such as the Coolbaroo -- which arose in Australia after World War II, and where whites and Aborigines sang and danced together -- as a potential model for a possibly more genuine mode of reconciliation, the play weaves music theatre in a Brechtian strain with contemporary drama. Highlights are Ursula Yovich's soaring voice, Trevor Jamieson's sensitive rendering of his character Charlie, and Dingo's panto-dame slap-down of serving king and country.</p><p>JOHN KINSELLA</p><p>Subiaco Arts Centre. 180 Hamersley Rd, Subiaco.

Buoyed by Maria Callas's meticulous voice, their molten bodyline and precision made the complex seven-couple passage in Jiri Kylian's Un Ballo almost transcendental. Their strong classical technique and rhythmic fidelity in Uwe Scholz's Seventh Symphony, in which Jennifer Provins shone, added a wonderful layer of interpretation to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No 7. Although lone Australian choreographer David Jonathan's Saudade suffered from indistinct lighting, Ivan Cavallari's Chaplinesque duet Ombra Leggiera was amusingly captivating and crowned a compelling performance.</p><p>RITA CLARKE</p><p>Quarry Amphitheatre.

Now a small exhibition in Perth highlights a lesser known side of Logue: his days as a public speaker, producer and actor. Logue was known to recite Shakespeare and Dickens across Perth, and also devised, produced and acted in plays and musicals. The exhibition includes pictures of Nicholson's music shop, where Logue ran the School of the Spoken Word.</p><p>IAN CUTHBERTSON</p><p>DownStairs at the Maj. His Majesty's Theatre, 825 Hay St, Perth.

And for the past decade the Brooklyn artist has produced a body of work both intimate and grand in scale, using traditional printmaking techniques to reproduce images of street life in New York while unveiling larger-scale works designed to respond to local environments and communities. One of her more high-profile works was in 2008, when she led a flotilla of salvaged material down the Hudson River in Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea before sailing boats made from garbage into the Venice Biennale the following year. Swoon has now turned her attention to Melbourne, with her first solo exhibition to be opened at Metro Gallery tonight by Victorian Premier and Arts Minister Ted Baillieu. As part the exhibition, which runs until March 5, Swoon has created a 4m x 6m installation from timber and cardboard, inspired by the Indian city of Varanasi, inside the gallery. Later this week she will head to the Northern Territory to meet indigenous artists from the region and tour local communities.</p><p>ASHLEIGH WILSON</p><p>Edited by Ian Cuthbertson.</p><p>Full reviews of new films will appear in The Weekend Australian on Saturday.</p><p>Send event information to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:listings@theaustralian.com.au\">listings@theaustralian.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS-20110216-o-014-794815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALI2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:525Y-W701-F0JP-W4TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1121\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>o - SA Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>February 16, 2011 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5QC</classCode><className>MOVIE RATINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009VC1</classCode><className>STRINGED INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VRY</classCode><className>COMEDY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp;

It matters not that our rivers are drying up, and the Eildon Weir is heading below 15 per cent this week.</p><p>All that matters is trying to deceive our city cousins into believing that we in the Upper Goulburn Catchment have plenty of water to send south.</p><p>Jan Beer, Plug the Pipe spokeswoman</p><p>CFA levy burns landowners</p><p>I WISH to comment on the current media campaign aimed at replacing our insurance-type levy system used to fund the Country Fire Authority, with claims that other states have dropped this method.</p><p>In these states new methods have proved a disaster with property owners' contributions escalating.</p><p>The problem with the existing insurance levy scheme is that it has been hijacked by the government and bureaucracy of the CFA to produce income for consolidated revenue and activities of the CFA that are government responsibilities such as community safety, community education, support for government agencies and bodies, and road accident services.</p><p>These services equate to an estimated 40 per cent of budget expenditure.</p><p>On information made available in the CFA 2007 annual report, the fire services levy contributed by the insurance system was $175.87 million, collected from an estimated total insurance pool for all risks of $436.38 million.</p><p>Added to the fire service levies paid to the State Government from the total pool are GST and stamp duty of $128.55 million, totalling $304.05 million. Out of this is the total CFA budget expense of $288.9 million, leaving a balance of $15.52 million surplus. How can this be justified?</p><p>A further example of inadequacies in the current system is where a property owner insures 1000 large round bales of hay for $100 each.</p><p>Insurance premiums would be about $259, then added to this are fire service levies and taxes of $208. If the bales catch fire, and large machinery is required to assist in their movement or suppression of the fire, the CFA demands the owner must pay for the cost of this machinery or his hay can burn.</p><p>A solution to our high insurance levies is not to scrap the system, but to remove the use of it as a ``taxing structure'' to fund other activities.</p><p>This would immediately reduce the levy. Existing levy and taxes of 87 cents on top of insurance premiums would be reduced to 52 cents.</p><p>Fire protection and prevention over the past decade has, by the lack of results achieved, raised community concerns in the aftermath of fires, creating real issues that the present centralised bureaucratic system has failed to address.</p><p>Alex Hopper, Winnindoo</p><p>A way to park a resource?</p><p>LINLEY Walker (WT, March 12) refers to ``huge scientific evidence for the need to establish new parks along the Murray''. I can't help but wonder what that evidence is.</p><p>VEAC's own discussion paper lists red gum forests that are ``in best ecological condition''.</p><p>Those named are all logged forests. Only Lindsay Island is a park, and it only became a park in recent years after salvage logging to remove all trees that could be sold.</p><p>National park's management of Lindsay Island has been to let it regenerate, just as state forest management would have done.</p><p>I attended a two day conference held by the Royal Society of Victoria.</p><p>In the two days of scientific papers the most compelling argument in favour of state forests becoming national parks was that the Government provides more money per hectare for national parks than it does for state forests.</p><p>VEAC's National Park draft recommendations include that ``ecological thinning may be permitted where required''.</p><p>State forests don't have to be logged, but they can be. The product from a felled tree in state forest can be sold. An ecologically thinned tree in a national park cannot be sold so it must be left to provide fuel for the next forest fire.</p><p>State forest management can be as passive or active as circumstances dictate. It can also include indigenous involvement without the need for VEAC's recommendation.</p><p>No living person knows just how these red gum forests were cared for 200 years ago. We do know that their management and water supply have changed. How do we manage them best for the future?</p><p>I somehow doubt that park management really has the desire to find out. It is so much easier to lock it up and let nature take its course. Then nature can take any blame.</p><p>Victor Eddy, Mildura</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WKT200803261014215424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4S4K-5T70-TX5J-V1MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>March 26, 2008 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000975</classCode><className>IRRIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">BEIJING, Sunday: The spread of China's worst forest fire has been blamed on bureaucratic bungling, and the Minister for Forestry, Mr Yang Zhong, has been sacked for dereliction of duty.</p><p>Northern China has been hit in recent weeks, by a series of fires, the worst of which killed at least 200 people, razed four towns, made 50,000 people homeless, and burned 700,000 hectares of forest.</p><p>A meeting of the ruling state council yesterday held Mr Yang and his ministry responsible for the fire and strongly criticised him for having not written a self-criticism - the Chinese way of admitting fault and seeking the party's forgiveness - until after he was prompted by senior officials.</p><p>The acting Premier, Mr Wan Li, said the fire \"fully revealed the bureaucratic mismanagement\" in the ministry, and quoted the former Chinese leader, Mr Mao Zedong, as saying: \"Bureaucratic inertia runs counter to the party's purpose of serving the people with heart and soul.\"</p><p>Mr Yang, 52, who had his character assassinated today by the Chinese media, was also criticised for not having gone to the scene of the fire, in Heilongjiang province, near the Soviet border.</p><p>Other sackings could follow, as the State Council has announced an investigation into the ministry and the fire-fighting command.</p><p>Diplomats suggested that Mr Yang might be a victim of military dissatisfaction with the government handling of the fire.</p><p>Many of the 42,000 fire-fighters were soldiers and the army has been loudly praised for its gallantry.</p><p>Forestry officials have already confessed that fire-fighters were hindered by primitive equipment, often nothing more than a branch or water-soaked clothes, and that the building of fire-breaks was badly handled.</p><p>But the Government has yet to admit that it made a mistake by refusing on-the-ground assistance from other countries.</p><p>Five men have been arrested for accidentally starting fires in Heilongjiang.</p><p>Three have been accused of carelessly discarding cigarette butts, while another two men are said to have started blazes through recklessly handling chain-saws.</p><p>The Government has not revealed what will be done with them but, given China's record of severe punishment in negligence cases and the damage caused by the fires, they could well be shot.</p><p>The official news agency, Xinhua, said the sacking of Yang Zhong showed the\"firm determination\" of the fight against bureaucracy, and \"anything less severe would not be warning enough\".</p><p>Other than his failure to write a self-criticism and to visit the fire zone, Mr Yang's bureaucratic crimes have not been explained.</p><p>The fire appears to have become a sensitive political issue, as the acting Premier stressed the need to stop officials shielding each other from criticism and to stop them working for personal gain - both are much debated matters in a Communist Party stricken by faction-fighting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Port: Mr Yang ... prompted to write

How dare he and his parochial Education Minister put wealthy private schools and the political support of the Abbott-led Coalition ahead of our children. It is clear, with the recent hypocritical behaviour over hospital funding, that the Victorian government is making our people suffer in order to prevent the Gillard government from achieving policy success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what if some wealthy schools lose some of their funding. Schools that can pay $500,000 a year for a principal and can spend $20 million buying a property next door do not need funding from the scarce education funds. The current funding model gives too much to private schools and not enough to public schools. This must change. Mr Baillieu must be told that he cannot deprive our children just so that he can support Tony Abbott.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Margaret Ludowyk, Brunswick</p><p>Not so good advice</p><p>YOUR editorial \"Danger lurks where city meets the bush\" (21/2) expressed concerns about the danger to hundreds of residents trapped in a traffic gridlock as they tried to obey orders to evacuate from a grass fire threat near Epping North.</p><p>The problem is not so much ineffective road infrastructure hindering \"escape\" as the ineffective and erroneous official post-2009 advice that promotes evacuation.</p><p>Whether leaving is the safest option depends on a great many factors. Mass evacuation from grass or forest fire is inherently dangerous, usually far more so than is home defence. It was especially unnecessary from the \"neatly manicured\", almost bare-of-vegetation Epping North and Wollert housing estate.</p><p>Even the pro-\"escape\" official line urges it only on code-red days for residents of high-risk areas. This was neither such a day nor such an area.</p><p>The best advice to have given those residents was not to evacuate, but to mow grass alongside timber fences, close windows and doors, put on cover-all clothing and stand by with hoses, and mops in buckets of water, to douse any sparks. Time wasted in getting out is better spent preventing sparks and embers from getting in.</p><p>Joan Webster, Castlemaine</p><p>Clearly affordable</p><p>I AGREE with Greens leader Christine Milne that if BHP can afford to pay Marius Kloppers $75 million for a mediocre performance, then BHP can afford to pay a more realistic mining tax to the Australian people (\"Kloppers payout obscene: Greens\", 23/2). Ditto for other corporations who overpay their chief executives. Where are the other parties on this issue? Are they afraid of losing the donations from vested interests with an election coming up?</p><p>Barry Lizmore, East Geelong</p><p>Wasting our money</p><p>I WAS outraged to see the full-page advertisement for the federal government's health funding (The Saturday Age, 23/2). The ad served no public purpose. An election has been called, and the government is using public money to support its own re-election campaign. Victorians would be better off if the government spent more money providing health services and less trying to save its political skin.</p><p>Stewart Maiden, Camberwell</p><p>New party time</p><p>LIKE Mary Lane (Letters, 22/2), I, too, find the current Australian political landscape utterly desolate. I suggest we form a new political party, the VIP - Vote Informal Party.</p><p>If you find the idea of voting for the Labor Party in its current incarnation impossible, or believe that the Greens have lost all credibility, or know that voting for Tony Abbott is simply too awful to contemplate, then the Vote Informal Party is the one for you. Do I have your vote?</p><p>Monica Clarke, Port Melbourne</p><p>Equality in care</p><p>ELDERLY lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender and intersex people are so afraid of prejudice and discrimination in aged care that they are not accessing the services they desperately need. Many aged-care service providers are faith-based organisations, and especially in some rural and regional areas, there is no choice - it's a faith-based provider or nothing.</p><p>The bottom line: our taxes should not be funding organisations that discriminate against us.</p><p>Surely that's only fair. That's one reason why the new anti-discrimination legislation should be passed.</p><p>Sujay Kentlyn, Stanmore, NSW</p><p>Keep out all bigots</p><p>CORY Bernardi complains of a \"double standard\" on free speech (\"Senator backs Wilders tour\", 21/2). His notion of fairness entails that if a bigot of one kind is allowed into Australia, then we must balance this by admitting a bigot of a different kind. My view is we don't need bigots of any kind - especially not of the Geert Wilders type. His intemperate outbursts against Muslims are cringeworthy.</p><p>Bigots are bigots. It doesn't matter what they're for or against, we must not give them air. Words are acts and they hurt. They damage relations. We have enough bigots of our own. We do not need to import them.</p><p>Marietta Elliott-Kleerkoper, Fairfield</p><p>Proper ratings</p><p>THOMAS Baker's assertion (Letters, 22/2) that the R18+ classification for video games is damaging to society is specious. While many minors can access MA15+ games with ease, some MA15+ games released, unedited, in Australia are actually classified R18+ overseas, including titles in the popular Fallout and Grand Theft Auto series. The R18+ rating will allow proper classification of the games released in Australia, nothing more.</p><p>In addition, while some people in the US may \"attribute\" gun-related violence to video games, no link has been scientifically demonstrated. Besides, with the lack of guns in this country, how are people supposed to enact gun violence? Petty scaremongering achieves little of substance.</p><p>Eddie La Marca, Heidelberg</p><p>Easy as 1, 2, 3</p><p>THE chief of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, running the most finely tuned and intricately engineered vehicles outside Cape Canaveral, reckons that, \"due to the size and temporary nature of the Albert Park circuit, we use a methodology that includes a variety of inputs, including ticket sales, to calculate estimated attendances for each day of the event\" (\"Government blocks move for grand prix headcount\", 23/2). Hand-held scanners, barcoded tickets and (temporary) turnstiles are beyond Bernie and the boys? Must be all those fumes.</p><p>Leonard Colquhoun, Invermay, Tasmania</p><p>Malodorous</p><p>LAST week, while on my way to the booking office at the Arts Centre, I had occasion to pass Flinders Street Station. No sooner had I set foot on the kerb outside the station than I was assailed by the stench of urine. This olfactory assault continued for the length of the facade of the station.</p><p>During the course of this perambulation, I espied a young busker, plying his trade amid the pong. When I returned that evening (on my way to War Horse), he was still there. It must surely be injurious to his health to spend all day (and half the night) imbibing these noxious exhalations.

Under cross-examination by counsel for the NSW Rural Fire Service Christopher Erskine, Mr Cheney suggested NSW authorities might have shown a lack of experience in fighting forest fires in one of their decisions not to start backburning from a particular trail in the Brindabellas during benign weather early in last year's emergency.Earlierevidence from a NSW incident controller, Bruce Arthur, has suggested he did not want to start the backburning without the support of aerial resources because of the steep, serpentine nature of the trail and that any fire above or below personnel on the trail was \"tantamount to a death sentence\".Mr Cheney said he believed while the trail was winding, there were \"ample places to seek refuge\" in cleared areas along it.\"So you wouldn't describe it as a death trap in sensible fire fighting terms. Perhaps that reflects a lack of experience in forest fire fighting,\" he said.Mr Erskine quoted extensively from logs which were part of the NSWRFS and NSW National Parks and Wildlife submission to last year's NSW coronial inquiry into the fires.He said the logs showed on January8 that the Mount Coree tower spotted smoke in the Brindabellas just before 3.30pm. By 5.40pm, an air observer estimated the McIntyre's Hut fire was 200 hectares in size, and by 5.52pm there was a report of embers being driven to as far as Fairlight, 10-12km away.Mr Cheney agreed with Mr Erskinethat the fire had become an impressive one in a short period of time and that NSW authorities were confronted with eight fires (includingthree in the ACT) on January 8.However, Mr Cheney still believed NSW should have sent crews to the fires on January 8 for a proper on-ground assessment because \"they should have known they were going into a falling fire danger period, that the fire behaviourwould decrease in that country at night\".Counsel for the ACT is expected to cross-examine Mr Cheney today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-2414787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4DB4-JMG0-0045-51K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 The Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited</copyright><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>September 16, 2004 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001849</classCode><className>WITNESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N923120MQ</classCode><className>CORONERS COURTS &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N111000CC</classCode><className>CROP PRODUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was a bushfire, not a fish, and he had been called out to protect the sleepy Victorian township after the surrounding forest went up on a hot, windy October day in 1988.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">``It was a killer day,'' says Gibbons, who is now a land management expert at the Australian National University.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">``There were fires everywhere. The whole thing just took off.''</p><p>Despite suggestions to the contrary, there is nothing new about the landscape of southern Australia burning ahead of the acknowledged summer bushfire season.</p><p>This will be of limited consolation to the families of the two men who died fighting blazes in the Blue Mountains and southern NSW, not to mention the owners of the 200-plus homes that have been destroyed in the ongoing emergency. But it is central to the debate on whether the incidence and severity of bushfires in Australia can be blamed on climate change and, if so, what can be done to abate the risk.</p><p>Arguably, that discussion descended to a new low when Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt tweeted: ``Why <person><nameText>Tony Abbott's </nameText></person>plan means more bushfires for Australia and more pics like this of Sydney,'' alongside an image of the NSW capital wreathed in smoke.</p><p>After Environment Minister Greg Hunt accused Bandt of politicising a tragedy, the UN's point woman on climate change, Christiana Figueres, declared that bushfires were ``absolutely'' linked to global warming and the flames ringing Sydney were a harbinger of what was to come if emission levels didn't fall. The Prime Minister hit back, describing bushfires as part of the Australian experience and accusing her of ``talking out of her hat'' -- earning a rebuke from former US vice-president and climate change activist Al Gore.</p><p>Abbott then ramped up the rhetoric in an interview with syndicated News group columnist Andrew Bolt, published yesterday, dismissing any link between climate change and the NSW bushfires as ``complete hogwash''.</p><p>Gibbons, a senior lecturer with the Fennes School of Environment and Society at ANU, shakes his head. ``We know that bushfires have happened before in October, we know they have sometimes been very severe. That's not the issue. The question is: are we going to get more of these?''</p><p>In its recent fifth report, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said bushfires were set to increase in hotter and drier parts of the world.</p><p>That was an ominous portent for Australia's fire-prone southeast. But the trouble with bushfires is they don't fit into neat categories. Disasters such as the Black Saturday fires that killed 173 people in Victoria on February 7, 2009, are the deadly product of a chain reaction involving high temperatures, fuel loads, the dryness of the bush, humidity, wind and population demographics.</p><p>And as we saw this week when the army was pinged for starting the State Mine blaze at the centre of the Blue Mountains emergency during a live-firing exercise, there must be an ignition source, which can as readily be human as an act of nature.</p><p>Climate scientists, firefighters, experts in fire behaviour and ecologists argue about which factor is more important, and how bushfires slot into the threat matrix of global warming.</p><p>Still, Richard Thorton, chief executive of the government-backed Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre, says one point can be made with confidence: ``You can't attribute any particular fire to global warming or climate change in any sense.''</p><p>The CSIRO's Kevin Hennessy concurs. A principal research scientist on climate impacts, he has helped model how the bushfire risk in Australia will be affected by climate change under the scenarios used by the IPCC to predict warming. The study found the number of extreme fire danger days in southeast Australia generally increases 5-25 per cent by 2020 for a low-emission scenario and 15-65 per cent for a high scenario. By 2050, the increases are 10-50 per cent for a low scenario and 100-300 per cent for a high scenario. That means more days with total fire bans.</p><p>While it's almost impossible to attribute an individual extreme weather event to climate change, he says the general risk of fire has increased due to a warming and drying trend that is partly due to rising greenhouse gas levels.</p><p>As Tasmanian fire scientist David Bowman says, our wide brown land is configured to ``burn and burn and . . . burn again''. The fiery cycle starts in the Top End in the dry season, with the bushfire seasons tracking south in tandem with rising temperatures.</p><p>Grass fires erupt in central and southeast Queensland in early spring while humidity is relatively low. For central and southern NSW the danger peaks in December and January; in Victoria and Tasmania it tends to be in February and March.</p><p>Again, there are exceptions. In 1994 Canberra's bushfire season opened in August, in the depths of its frosty winter. This year's new year celebrations were barely over when Tasmania's Tasman Peninsula was engulfed by fires that claimed 126 homes but, near miraculously, not a single life.</p><p>This could be seen to bear out a recent study by researchers Hamish Clarke, Christopher Lucas and Peter Smith, published in the International Journal of Climatology, that suggests fire seasons were becoming longer and the conflagrations more intense. Yet there was an important caveat to their findings: ``Although these trends are consistent with projected impacts of climate change . . . this study cannot separate the influence of climate change, if any, with that of natural variability,'' they reported.</p><p>The issue of fuel-load management generates intense heat. Sydneysider Christine Findlay, who earned a PhD in bushfire management from the University of NSW and styles herself as a whistleblower, argues that firestorms give the appearance of being caused by global warming, when the problem is actually the build-up of fuel on the forest floor.</p><p>John Handmer, a lead author of last year's special report for the IPCC on managing the risk of climate-related extremes and disasters, says people tend to focus on fuel loads because they can be tackled, albeit with limited success. ``We can't do much about the weather,'' he says, ``but we think we can do something about the fuel loads.''</p><p>The royal commission into the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires recommended preventive burning be doubled in Victoria to reduce fuel loads, a target the state has struggled to meet.</p><p>While fuel loads are crucial, Handmer, the director of Centre for Risk and Community Safety at Melbourne's RMIT University, says their relative importance declines as fire conditions deteriorate.</p><p>Take Black Saturday. The bush north and east of Melbourne was primed to burn by heatwave conditions that culminated in a 45C day, turning leaves and undergrowth to tinder. The Forest Fire Danger Index was off the scale. Investigators would identify multiple ignition points, some deliberately lit. The landscape was hilly and homes dotted the ridgelines, allowing the flames to rush on to them after crowning in the thick eucalypt forests.</p><p>But the killer factor was the wind, in Handmer's assessment. ``It's true that fire intensity is partly a factor of how dry and hot it is . . . but if there is no wind you have got a good chance of containing that fire, no matter what the other circumstances,'' he says. ``If there is very strong wind . . . the ability to control that fire really goes down.''</p><p>Yesterday, Will Steffen of the Climate Council -- the successor of the Climate Commission abolished by Abbott -- insisted it was a ``no brainer'' that rising temperatures made fires more likely, but that did not mean those still raging in NSW could be attributed directly to climate change.</p><p>Echoing what Gibbons tells Inquirer, he said: ``The issue is not whether they are caused by climate change,'' he said. ``The question is, is there an influence?

I am also tired of average work being given extra weight because it's attached to something with real gravitas, like the AIDS emergency. So I truly try to tread carefully as I walk over the dreams of dignity under my feet in our work for the terrible beauty that is the continent of Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm used to the custard pies.</p><p>I've even learnt to like the taste of them. But before you are tempted to let fly with your understandable invective, allow me to contextualise.</p><p>Not for the sake of my vanity, but for the sake of people who are depending on you - the reader - to respond to the precariousness of their lives.</p><p>Picture this: a village where the disappearance of a whole generation has left children to bring up children..</p><p>I'm a witness to this. What can I do?</p><p>Or this: my new friend Prudence, who even if she had access to anti-retroviral therapies would not have shared them with her now dead sister or best friend Janny, because her fellow activists were more important to keep alive.</p><p>Why? Because picture this: most activists and trained nurses cannot afford the drugs available to us in any corner chemist.</p><p>I am a witness to this. I have watched these brave and beautiful souls who are fighting a forest fire of a pandemic with watering cans, knowing they will not see the light of a day when their work will be honoured. I have been a witness to their conversations around canteen tables, deciding who will live or die, because they do not have enough pills to go round. I've seen Zackie Achmat refuse his medications until he won his action against the South African Government, forcing their hand on universal access. What a witness he was. And so I testify.</p><p>These firefighters deserve fire engines with sirens and low-flying aircraft with bellies full of rain. At the very least, they deserve their situation to merit the classification of an emergency. Code Red, like Hurricane Katrina or the tsunami in south Asia, which swept away 150,000 lives. These were natural catastrophes. Africa loses 150,000 men, women, and children every month to AIDS, a wholly avoidable disaster, a preventable, treatable disease.</p><p>Colin Powell describes the tiny little virus HIV as the most lethal weapon of mass destruction on the planet. So forgive us if we expand our strategy to reach the high street, where so many of you live and work.</p><p>We need to meet you where you are as you shop, as you phone, as you lead your busy, businessy lives. Those of us who campaign on these issues feel we have made a dent on the pop consciousness with Live Aid and 8, Red Nose Day, Comic Relief and Make Poverty History. But we are still losing the battle: 9000 new infections every day across the developing world.</p><p>There will be those that think that RED is the worst idea they've ever heard.</p><p>On the far right, we will hear the usual carping about it being Africa's own fault. This despite the fact that the largest increasing group of HIV-positive people are monogamous married women. We'll hear, the \"Africans can't take pills because they don't have watches to tell the time\" line. Even though Africans have the best record of us all at sticking to their drug regimens.</p><p>On the far left, we will meet \"better dead than RED\", a reaction to big business that is not wholly unjustified. But given the emergency that is AIDS, I don't see this as selling out. I see this as ganging up on the problem.</p><p>Product RED cannot replace activism. For anyone who thinks this means I'm going to retire to the boardroom and stop banging my fist on the door of No 10, I'm sorry to disappoint you. We have to keep our marching boots on and hold our leaders to account for the promises they have made to Africa - and get them to promise more. The incredible movement we saw gathering around last year's G8 is what will, in the end, win the day. But for too many people, that day will be too late. Right now, people you will never meet, who will never be able to thank you, are depending on you for the life-saving drugs which buying this paper will buy. For those people, my motivation, or our (RED) motivation, is irrelevant.</p><p>U2 frontman and activist Bono, along with leading American philanthropist Bobby Shriver, has set up the product RED partnership, designed to throw the weight of the corporate world behind the battle against AIDS in Africa and which is backed by the Independent newspaper.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-6412039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4JYT-DCN0-TX4S-M31R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>May 17, 2006 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000051</classCode><className>AIDS &amp; HIV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U6N</classCode><className>POP &amp; ROCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000054</classCode><className>AIDS &amp; HIV TREATMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009F7U</classCode><className>HURRICANES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009R5P</classCode><className>HURRICANE KATRINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001824</classCode><className>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000101</classCode><className>ANTIVIRALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001824</classCode><className>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>GR134</classCode><className>SOUTHERN ASIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In every sense, a firestorm.</p><p>When the fires hit the suburbs, they took the public - and the authorities - almost entirely by surprise.</p><p>Four residents died in a hopeless battle to protect their homes or escape the flames.</p><p>Hundreds more people were injured - some critically. They suffered horrendous burns, smoke inhalation, broken limbs, and exhaustion.</p><p>There had been no official order to evacuate their homes.</p><p>It was, in essence, every man and woman for themselves.</p><p>Bushland tinderbox</p><p>The fires began on January 8, 2003, when a series of dry lightning storms swept over the vast expanse of Namadgi National Park, which makes up nearly two-thirds of south-west ACT.</p><p>When authorities detected the fires, they dispatched small crews into some of the most remote sections of the bush.</p><p>But the fires were hard to access and there was no real sense of official urgency.</p><p>They were subsequently criticised in an ACT Government inquiry and a long-running coronial inquest, for doing too little, too slowly.</p><p>The McLeod Inquiry concluded the fires \"might have been contained had they been attacked more aggressively in the 24 or so hours after they broke out.\"</p><p>But the eucalypt forests had been desiccated by years of drought and once the fires took hold, they were impossible to contain.</p><p>For more than a week emergency services officials provided community and press briefings on the growing scale of the fires, but little was said publicly to suggest Canberra's suburbs might be at risk.</p><p>Key officials dared not to even think it was a possibility, until it was too late.</p><p>In the blame game that followed, NSW fire authorities claimed they had issued their ACT counterparts with clear warnings that Canberra's suburbs had been under threat.</p><p>Those warnings had never been passed on to the public.</p><p>Fires reach Canberra</p><p>On the morning of January 18, 2003, there were ominous signs in the sky.</p><p>Residents woke to the news that the fires had broken containment lines overnight and were now being fanned towards Canberra's suburbs.</p><p>In the city's western suburbs, the sight of ash and burnt leaves falling from the sky - carried tens of kilometres from the fire front to the west - was considered a novelty but little more.</p><p>Still, the official firefighting effort was centred around protecting isolated rural settlements and Canberra residents planned their Saturdays in blissful ignorance.</p><p>Many headed to the New South Wales south coast to cool down, while others prepared to enjoy another hot summer's day in the capital.</p><p>Fire authorities had hoped to stop the fires from crossing the Murrumbidgee River corridor, less than four kilometres west of the Weston Creek suburbs of Duffy, Rivett and Chapman.</p><p>As it turned out, even their worst case scenario was to prove dramatically optimistic.</p><p>The fire had blown out to a 30-kilometre front, with destructive fire weather forecast, temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius and gusty winds.</p><p>What had started as four discrete fires combined into one unstoppable blaze that roared into the suburbs.</p><p>Burning suburbs</p><p>Between 1pm and 1:30pm the fires crossed the Murrumbidgee River and only then did ACT emergency authorities seriously consider the suburbs were under threat.</p><p>From the river it was all uphill to Canberra, the conditions under which fire spreads fastest.</p><p>Fire experts later estimated the pace at 20 kilometres per hour, believed to be the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire.</p><p>The first public emergency warning was finally issued just after 2pm, listing Duffy, Chapman, Rivett, and Holder as areas most at risk.</p><p>Instead of urging residents to leave the area, it asked them to return to their homes and prepare for the coming fire front.</p><p>At first, a senior emergency services official resisted police efforts to declare a state of emergency, which would allow police to forcibly evacuate residents.</p><p>By 2:45pm, the fire began burning extensive pine plantations around Mount Stromlo and eventually destroyed the historic observatory telescope complex that sat at the crest of the hill.</p><p>Pine forests also surrounded the suburb of Duffy on two sides, and firefighters dispatched to Eucumbene drive on the the suburban fringe were quickly forced to retreat.</p><p>Between 3pm and 3:30pm, the first houses were lost in Duffy.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, fire ignited homes in Rivett, Holder, Chapman and Kambah.</p><p>The flow of information from fire authorities to the public came in for scathing criticism in subsequent inquiries.</p><p>Even as the fire bore down on homes and residents were fleeing for their lives, then chief minister Jon Stanhope was telling the media that people should not be \"unduly alarmed\".</p><p>Clearly no-one knew just how bad the situation was, except those facing the flames.</p><p>Nightmare inferno</p><p>What followed over the course of the next few hours still haunts many residents of Canberra's western suburbs, even 10 years on.</p><p>Firefighters dressed in protective clothing, with modern hoses and firefighting gear were simply overwhelmed.</p><p>It was far worse for residents, many of whom were caught out in shorts, singlets and thongs.</p><p>It had been normal operating procedure to send at least two fire trucks to a single house fire, and now about 20 firefighting crews were faced with hundreds of homes alight.</p><p>In the chaos of that afternoon, three fire trucks broke down after ingesting superheated gases and burning their air filters.</p><p>One of those trucks was totally destroyed and its crew only just made it to the safety of a second vehicle. A second crew was also forced out into the flames on foot.</p><p>A senior firefighter standing on the roof of his own home in Duffy described the scene before him as \"Armageddon\".</p><p>Many thousands of residents joined an evacuation convoy out of the suburbs - amazingly without serious incident.</p><p>But others stayed, battling houses fully ablaze with feebly inadequate resources.</p><p>In the end, police road blocks stopped other residents from returning to join the effort.</p><p>Those road blocks remained in place many hours after the fire front had passed, but houses were still catching alight from their neighbours.</p><p>Some saw it as a case of appalling judgement to block people from the streets, and in hindsight, perhaps some of those homes could have been saved.</p><p>Dreadful toll</p><p>That afternoon, some 500 homes were destroyed across half a dozen suburbs and rural communities.</p><p>Most house losses were in the streets closest to the pine forests but it was a random game of chance.</p><p>Some homes were ignited by spot fires kilometres away, while others remained intact surrounded by scenes of utter devastation.</p><p>Thousands of residents were displaced and had to be housed at emergency evacuation centres until they could find alternative accommodation.</p><p>The four people who died in and near Duffy had been battling the fire front in vain.</p><p>One fell from the roof of his house, garden hose still in hand.</p><p>Another died lying in her bathtub surrounded by wet towels.</p><p>She had apparently misunderstood official advice to fill a bathtub to act as a water source, with tragic consequences.</p><p>The Canberra Hospital was over-run with the walking wounded, many suffering burns and smoke inhalation. The emergency department just could not cope and the worst injured were flown to Sydney for specialist treatment.</p><p>At 7pm a cool wind change saw an end to the fire emergency and the epic fight to save homes turned to one of rebuilding a shattered community.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-4455454</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57H0-19T1-F031-X1B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1320\"/><timeReceived>11:12 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 14, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia:ACT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Fires:Bushfire</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Under the sub-heading \"Painful legacy\", it said: \"If the 1936 Olympics was one of the most politicised, the Sydney Games of 2000 best personifies the negative economic impact that mega events can have on host cities. The Sydney Olympic Park which housed the athletes, now stands derelict. Getting there, some 25 kilometres from the business district, is an ordeal involving driving down Paramatta Road for an hour. The link between Darwin Harbour was not accomplished and the taxpayers continue to bear the brunt of this investment. </p><p>Even as a tourist attraction, the Sydney Olympic Park has little currency. It remains an example of how things can go wrong while trying to use sport as a module for urban regeneration.\" Built to last AN INTERESTING rant on The Sydney Morning Herald's website last week, by Jonno Seidler, took aim at an Australian music culture that continues to embrace stars from the '60s, '70s and '80s, while ignoring artists from the past 20 years. We listen to the oldies on radio and go to see the likes of Bob Dylan, John Farnham, AC/DC, Simon and Garfunkel, and Billy Joel in huge numbers in concerts. (Don't forget, just 37 days to go till Leonard Cohen sings again in Sydney.) \"In an already crowded arena,\" Seidler wrote, \"the juggernauts of yesteryear hang over our heads even when they're no longer recording. There's no space for new music in this country, because we're still clinging to the old.\" All good, Jonno, and perhaps a fair point. Your generation has produced some great artists including Michael Franti, the Cat Empire and Green Day - and I have been to their concerts - but pound for pound, hit for hit, it seems to me the talent gets very thin thereafter, and few bands and singers seem to stay around long enough to earn the iconic status that will see people still wanting to see them play 40 and 50 years on. That's a problem for your generation. My generation will still pay to see Dylan sing Desolation Row 10 years from now. Whose life is it? AS FAR as I know, I am as healthy as a trout, at least healthy enough to play some rugby with the Golden Oldies Festival of the Cauliflower Ears, which has brought 5000 visitors to our town. But let's say I was not. Let's say I was suffering a terminal illness and was facing an agonising end lasting many months. Let's say that, instead of going down that path, I chose to be euthanased at the point where I judged my meaningful life was over, even if my heart was still beating. Here is my question: what right would you have to stop me, to assert that your desire to have me to stay living outweighed my own right to die? Because your religion says so? I don't share your religion. Because you know better than me? Please. Because you think life is precious and must be preserved, no matter the cost to the state and pain to the person? Palpable nonsense. I assert that my own right to die in a manner of my choosing far outweighs all other factors. Australia will have to weigh up just such issues in coming weeks, as Bob Brown's euthanasia bill is put before Federal Parliament. The country is likely to be tightly divided on the issue - a state familiar to us lately - and on the side of euthanasia I suspect you will find most of us who have nursed a dying parent to the bitter end. Joke of the week A PARAPROSDOKIAN is a figure of speech in which the latter part of a sentence or phrase is surprising or unexpected in a way that causes the reader or listener to reframe or reinterpret the first part. I asked God for a bike, but I know God doesn't work that way. So I stole a bike and asked for forgiveness. The last thing I want to do is hurt you. But it's still on the list. Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad. How is it one careless match can start a forest fire, but it takes a whole box to start a campfire? A bank is a place that will lend you money you can if prove that you don't need it. Women will never be equal to men until they can walk down the street with a bald head and a beer gut, and still think they are sexy. You do not need a parachute to skydive. You only need a parachute to skydive twice. I always take life with a grain of salt, plus a slice of lemon, and a shot of tequila. Model muck-up IN AUCKLAND on Wednesday night, I was fascinated to see the Kiwis' principal television station TV ONE include, high in their evening news bulletin, the Sarah Murdoch Australia's Next Top Model imbroglio, in which the host announced the wrong winner then had to recant halfway through the celebrations. But wouldn't you know it? The Kiwis did it first. The station ran footage of host Peter Sinclair at the 1984 Miss New Zealand contest reading out the runners-up as he built to the climactic announcement of the winner before suddenly stopping and saying: \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have a most embarrassing task to perform ... I have just read the list from the top down, instead of the bottom up ... In fact, this is the correct order.\" You can watch the whole excruciating episode by Googling the details above. It is priceless! They said ...

In the days after September 11, the French got all the attention for that Le Monde headline: ''Nous sommes tous Americains'' -- ''We are all Americans,'' though they didn't mean it, even then. But <person><nameText>John Howard, </nameText></person>the Aussie Prime Minister, put it better and kept his word: ''This is no time to be an 80 per cent ally.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Marvellous. More recently, the Prime Minister offered some thoughts on the difference between Muslims and other immigrant groups. ''You can't find any equivalent in Italian or Greek or Lebanese or Chinese or Baltic immigration to Australia. There is no equivalent of raving on about jihad,'' he said, stating the obvious in a way most political leaders can't quite bring themselves to do. ''There is really not much point in pretending it doesn't exist.''</p><p>Unfortunately, too many of his counterparts insist on pretending (at least to their citizenry) that it doesn't exist. What proportion of Western Muslims is hot for jihad? Five per cent? Ten, 12 per cent? Given that understanding this pan-Islamist identity is critical to defeating it, why can't we acknowledge it honestly?</p><p>''Raving on about jihad'' is a line that meets what the law used to regard as the reasonable-man test: If you're watching news footage of a Muslim march promising to bring on the new Holocaust, Howard's line fits.</p><p>Is it something in the water down there? Listen to Howard's cabinet colleagues. Here's the Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello, with advice for Western Muslims who want to live under Islamic law: ''There are countries that apply religious or sharia law -- Saudi Arabia and Iran come to mind. If a person wants to live under sharia law these are countries where they might feel at ease. But not Australia.''</p><p>You don't say. Which is the point: Most Western government leaders don't say, and their silence is correctly read by a resurgent Islam as timidity.</p><p>I also appreciated this pithy summation by my favourite Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer: ''Multilateralism is a synonym for an ineffective and unfocused policy involving internationalism of the lowest common denominator.'' See Sudanese slaughter, Iranian nukes, the UN's flop response to the tsunami, etc. It's a good thing being an Aussie cabinet minister doesn't require confirmation by [liberal US Democrat senators] <person><nameText>John Kerry </nameText></person>and Joe Biden.</p><p/><p>The Sydney Morning Herald takes issue with Bill Leak and The Weekend Australian:</p><p>[LEAK'S] cartoon could hardly be calculated to offend more. The Rakyat Merdeka drawing [of <person><nameText>John Howard </nameText></person>and Alexander Downer as humping dingoes, somehow related to an alleged Australian wish to take over Papua] was not particularly funny or on target, aside from being tasteless, so was easy for its targets to shrug off. The Murdoch newspaper's cartoon is consciously more offensive, since the dog is regarded as a particularly unclean animal by Indonesia's Muslims. It is hard to think of any other world leader being depicted the same way as the cartoon did Yudhoyono. Indeed, by sharp contrast, the same newspaper had just set what may be record levels of sycophancy in its coverage of visits by Condoleezza Rice, Tony Blair and Wen Jiabao. When another of its cartoonists depicted the former president Suharto as an orang-outang swinging nonchalantly through the jungles, during the 1997 forest-fire haze and economic crisis, its editors were soon on a plane to grovel in Jakarta.</p><p>See-sawing between adulation and reckless offence hardly reflects well on editorial judgment. Sentiment in the Muslim world is inflamed enough. It's a time to do what you do with rutting dogs: bring out the hose.</p><p/><p>Andrew Cornell, in The Weekend Australian Financial Review, on how Howard has turned our athletes into cheats:</p><p>AT the recent Big Day Out rock concert in Melbourne, some veteran rockers lamented younger fans draping themselves in the Australian flag. ''In our day they would have been burning the flag, given this Government and what it's done to ordinary people and refugees,'' said one particular rock beast.</p><p>He's right. This meanness of spirit and bodgy nationalism is a symptom of that same latent xenophobia and old-fashioned cultural cringe that <person><nameText>John Howard </nameText></person>has successfully parlayed in his 10 years in office.</p><p>It was most graphically on display in the [Melbourne Commonwealth] Games context when 400m runner Tamsyn Lewis ensured a gold medal by knowingly allowing the English to break a technical rule and then protesting -- robbing the clearly superior English of the win when the infringement made absolutely no difference to the result ... This was a very ugly Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0604051015874171</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4JMV-JRX0-TX5J-81WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>April 5, 2006 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004XG3</classCode><className>CHICAGO SUN-TIMES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

But it is the Great Dividing Range that will determine the scale of increases in temperature as a result of global warming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thanks to their proximity to the coast, those people living south of the divide won't see the temperature rises their northern cousins will experience.</p><p>CSIRO researchers have used 12 computer models to come to these conclusions, and the outcomes point to a warmer climate, although the rises depend on where you live.</p><p>By 2030, average daytime temperatures are expected to rise between 0.3C and 1.6C and by 2070 that rise is expected to be in the range of 0.8C-5C in northern Victoria and 0.6C-4C in the south of the state.</p><p>Northern Victoria is likely to get warm, and those long, hot summers are going to get longer.</p><p>For Mildura residents, the number of days that reach 35C or more could increase by four to 11 days by 2030 and by 2070, there could be nine to 41 more scorchers for the city.</p><p>They will also have more \"hot spells\", when there are three to five days where temperatures exceed 35C. By 2070, Mildura residents could have up to 10 more of these hot spells each year.</p><p>But that needs to be put into perspective, according to CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research stream leader Dr Penny Whetton.</p><p>She said Mildura's climate was already warm in summer, and any rise in temperature of 1C or 2C would not be too noticeable.</p><p>\"It just means that a 34C day will be a 35C day, and so will contribute to a hot spell, rather than big jumps in temperatures,\" Dr Whetton said. \"Every day of the year will be just that bit warmer.\"</p><p>Even Melbourne residents are going to get more chances to warm up, with up to 23 more days over 35C by 2070.</p><p>By then, Bendigo's climate will be more like Echuca's, Melbourne's like Adelaide's and Shepparton more like Condobolin, NSW - all about 2C warmer and 20 per cent drier.</p><p>While tongue-in-cheek references to more sun in Melbourne can be seen as a joke, there are obviously great implications for the broader community.</p><p>Already climatologists are warning of more cases of heat-related deaths. These are expected to double in Melbourne, from the current level of 289 a year, up to 604 by 2020 and 1318 by 2050.</p><p>While the ageing population also plays its part in these figures, the hotter climate has a major role in the rising death rates.</p><p>Agriculture, too, must prepare for the implications of hotter summers.</p><p>There are few dairy cattle around Condobolin in central western NSW, yet this is the kind of climate that Goulburn Valley diary farmers will face come 2070.</p><p>Hotter summers will mean cows eat less, lose weight, will produce less milk of lower quality and will be under greater pressure from parasites. Some experts also predict extreme conditions could lead to the collapse of cows, unless precautions are made such as extra shade and other means of cooling cows down.</p><p>\"The climate is what has made Victoria such a centre for dairying, as the cows are more productive in cooler climates. These cows may well get more stressed if the temperature warms up,\" Dr Whetton said.</p><p>Grape growers might also need to make changes to stop their vines and winegrapes suffering heat damage.</p><p>\"Obviously with increased temperatures, these things become more of an issue,\" she said.</p><p>The hotter, and drier, conditions will have an impact on fires too, with an expected increase in extreme fire days. There could be up to 70 per cent more very high and extreme forest fire days by 2050, and extreme grass fire days are also expected to rise by up to 40 per cent by 2050.</p><p>At Mildura, that could mean a jump from 79 extreme fire days to 107 days of tough conditions by 2050.</p><p>But Dr Whetton stressed that an increased number of risk days did not necessarily mean more fires.</p><p>\"We can change the way we manage forests and grasslands, knowing that there is an increased chance of fires,\" she said.</p><p/><p>warming up</p><p>expected number of days to reach 35C or more</p><p>location 2007 2030 2070</p><p>Melbourne 8 9-12 10-20</p><p>Ballarat 4 4-7 5-17</p><p>Lismore 8 9-12 10-23</p><p>Hamilton 6 6-9 7-19</p><p>Horsham 15 16-22 18-38</p><p>Mildura 23 24-33 27-56</p><p>Ouyen 24 25-32 27-57</p><p>Bendigo 9 10-16 12-34</p><p>Echuca 16 17-25 20-49</p><p>Swan Hill 20 20-30 24-55</p><p>Benalla 13 14-22 16-47</p><p>Tatura 8 9-16 11-41</p><p>Omeo 2 2-5 3-20</p><p>Rutherglen 15 16-24 18-50</p><p>Lakes Entrance 3 3-5 4-9</p><p>Orbost 5 6-9 7-21</p><p>Sale 4 5-7 6-16</p><p>Wonthaggi 3 3-6 4-13</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WKT0710031N22593853</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTMLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PT8-M680-TX52-K0JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>October 3, 2007 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

However, the oceans and atmosphere are still not set to the El Nino and in SA. Our growing season is nearly over in SA with below normal rainfall to date and summer ahead with hotter than normal days and nights more likely.</p><p>There is not much change to last week's outlook with reduced chances of exceeding the median rainfall across SA and Australia for November.</p><p>The BoM outlook also shows an 80pc chance of exceeding median maximum temperatures for most of Australia apart from the southern coastal regions where the chance is a 60 to 70 pc chance of exceeding median maximum temperatures.</p><p>The oceans and atmosphere are yet to play along for an El Nino to be declared but other events are happening to cause drought like conditions.</p><p>One of these other events is the location of constant large high-pressure systems moving across the continent blocking much hope of frontal development for SA.</p><p>At this point our hope is for tropical moisture events from the north, however they are neither more or less likely at present also due to the nature of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>El Nino-like conditions have eased in the last week with the southern oscillation index near neutral and sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean above Darwin warming slightly.</p><p>The warm sea surface temperatures spanning the Pacific Ocean may generate more storms and tropical rainfall, but according the Bureau of Meteorology there is little likelihood of it producing above median rainfall for November across southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>The BoM continues to warn of increased chances of drier than normal conditions into November across southern and eastern Australia with about a 30 per cent chance of exceeding the median.</p><p>In addition, much of SA has been officially declared in drought with the Murray Mallee, Mid North and Eyre Peninsula in the mix.</p><p>With the Bureau of Meteorology still warning of an El Nino, we are not seeing typical sea surface temperatures associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation.</p><p>There are currently warmer than average sea surface temperatures along the entire equator in the Pacific Ocean, and across much of the tropics to the north of the equator.</p><p>These sea surface temperatures have influenced recent tropical storms in the north of Australia and sub-tropical lows bringing rain to southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>In the past week parts of SA received some much-needed rainfall with up to 25mm across the southern coastal regions and up to 10 mm on the Eyre Peninsula and Mid North. It certainly is an unusual ENSO development confusing seasonal outlook modelling as we know it as climate change challenges what we know.</p><p>There are below normal chances of exceeding the median rainfall for October in SA and eastern Australia. The chance of exceeding median rainfall ranges from 20 to 35 pc. The chances for exceeding median rainfall are lower in the southern coastal regions of SA.</p><p>This outlook is related to a sustained negative Southern Oscillation Index. A negative SOI at this time of the year reduces the changes of above normal rainfall across SA and eastern Australia. The SOI is likely to influence the development of cooler than normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean above Darwin.</p><p>When the sea surface temperatures are cooler than normal there is less evaporation and hence less moisture which results in lower than normal rainfall. Because of these developing conditions, the Bureau of Meteorology has issued an El Ni&amp;#xF1;o ALERT with around triple the normal likelihood of an El Nino occurring in 2018.</p><p>If combined with a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (now also highly likely) the chances dry and warm conditions to the end of the year across SA are increased along with the risk of heatwaves and bushfires.</p><p>There were stronger than average westerly winds across southern Australia for August with wind speed records being broken in many locations.</p><p>There were also record high pan evaporation rates in southern and eastern Australia for winter. Stored soil moisture was around average for much of the southern cropping region but below average for the mid north, Yorke peninsula and central rangelands for August. The greenness index is currently below normal across SA.</p><p>For spring we have a very high forest fire danger index coupled with increased chances for below normal rainfall across SA for October (30-45 per cent chance).</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's POAMA model suggests drier than normal conditions are likely across SA for the next two weeks with most regions receiving 5 millimetres to 10mm of rain below the normal up until the end of September.</p><p>Further ahead, the Bureau of Meteorology suggests a drier than normal October with a 30 per cent to 40pc chance of exceeding the median rainfall across the state for the month.</p><p>A warmer world is generally a wetter world and when sea surface temperatures are warmer than normal (especially in the pacific and Indian Oceans surrounding Australia) then higher rainfall is likely.</p><p>Sea surface temperatures surrounding Australia are neutral and expected to cool further over spring meaning lower than normal rainfall chances across much of southern and eastern Australia for spring. The interesting thing is that in parts of the Pacific Ocean the sea surface temperatures are warmer than ever recorded with more record-breaking hurricanes likely to occur this season in the northern hemisphere.</p><p>High pressure systems are more likely to dominate over southern Australia for the next few weeks.</p><p>This means colder than normal nights and warmer than normal days.</p><p>The high-pressure systems are likely to block cold fronts from crossing southern Australia apart from the coastal tips of SA, providing much needed rain over the next few weeks.</p><p>This pattern is worrying at this crucial stage in the season. The reason for the blocking highs is that the Southern Annular Mode is positive and likely to stay that way for at least the next few weeks according to the national weather service climate prediction centre.</p><p>During a positive SAM event, a belt of strong westerly winds contracts towards Antarctica.</p><p>This results in weaker than normal westerly winds and higher pressures over southern Australia, restricting the penetration of cold fronts inland.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's rainfall outlook for spring shows reduced chances of exceeding the median rainfall across much of Australia.</p><p>From the Mid North of SA through to the southern coastal regions there is a less than 30pc chance of exceeding the median rainfall across SA for September and October.</p><p>The Southern Oscillation Index is negative which has a high correlation with below normal spring rainfall for SA.</p><p>Ocean and atmosphere models suggest a weak El Nino will be declared by late spring, but in addition a positive IOD is predicted by most models which also has a negative impact on rainfall for spring.</p><p>Would you like help with planning a project or communication? Go to climateagriculturalsupport.com</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's rainfall outlook services include the chances of receiving nominated amounts of rainfall.</p><p>The chances of receiving 25 millimetres across SA varies for September. The outlook suggests that there is a 75 per cent chance of receiving 25mm of rainfall for the southern coastal tips of SA and for the remainder of southern SA there is a 55pc to 75pc chance of receiving 25mm in September.</p><p>The chances of receiving 25mm of rainfall for the remainder of the states cropping zone are further reduced with a 25pc to 35pc chance for the coming month.</p><p>The southern parts of the state have received some much-needed rainfall in the last week, but the northern parts of the cropping region only a few millimetres.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology warns that despite the rainfall, there is still double the chance of El Ni&amp;#xF1;o developing by mid to late spring.</p><p>El Nino only has a statistical influence on rainfall in spring for SA, so it may depend on when/if it develops. Three of six international climate models surveyed by the Bureau also suggest a short-lived positive Indian Ocean Dipole may event may develop.</p><p>A positive IOD during spring can exacerbate any El Ni&amp;#xF1;o driven rainfall deficiencies in spring. As always it is a numbers game and this information needs to be considered with other factors for decision making, including stored soil moisture and current crop/pasture dry matter.</p><p>Most of SA recorded decile 2-3 rainfall for May through to the end of July.</p><p>The remainder of Australia recorded decile 2-3 with some parts recording decile 1 or lowest on record.</p><p>The next week across SA is likely to be 7-14 millimetres drier than normal at your location, according the to the BOM POAMA model.</p><p>Present ocean and atmosphere conditions are not entirely negative for rainfall to transpire, but the BOM continues to warn that an El Nino may develop by spring with double the normal chances, according to their dynamical models.</p><p>If this occurs, then there are increased chances for below normal spring rainfall.</p><p>For August, there is a less than 30 per cent chance of exceeding the median rainfall for much of the state's cropping zone.</p><p>In addition, much of the state has a 70pc change of exceeding the median maximum temperatures for August (according to the Bureau of Meteorology seasonal outlook).</p><p>Much of SA has a suite of soil moisture probes that can be accessed here.</p><p>Stored soil moisture can be used in conjunction with seasonal outlooks to project pasture and cereal production.</p><p>There are outlook tools that already do this such as the Meat and Livestock Australia rainfall to pasture growth outlook tool or Yield Prophet.</p><p>Rainfall for April to June has been very much below average in the decile 2-3 range for most of SA.</p><p>The remainder of Australia has similar circumstances with some areas like southern WA receiving rainfall at the lowest on record.</p><p>I cannot help but relate the recent southern Australian rainfall patterns to that of rainfall patterns across the past 20 years.</p><p>Autumn rainfall for southern Australia has been on the decline on average for the past 20 years, when compared to the last 100 years of rainfall. This is due to larger than normal high-pressure systems blocking cold frontal development and movement across SA.</p><p>Going ahead it is best to make farm decisions on rainfall to date, stored soil moisture, a neutral winter outlook and a potential El Nino and positive IOD for Spring (meaning below normal rainfall more likely).</p><p>The next week is more likely to be drier than normal across SA according to the Bureau of Meteorology POAMA model, with about normal rainfall more likely for August.</p><p>There are no strong indicators for above normal rainfall beyond August, with sea surface temperature that influence above normal rainfall being neutral and the Southern Oscillation Index unlikely to encourage the movement of warmer water to the Pacific Ocean above Australia.</p><p>The BoM warns of double normal chances of an El Nino developing in spring and half of the ocean and atmosphere models also suggest a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. If either of these things occur our chances of receiving above normal rainfall for spring across SA will be reduced. If both occur together the chances diminish further.</p><p>You may be aware of the new fast break and a series of excellent seasonal climate products available for SA. The fast break mentions the present blocking high over the Bight, chasing fronts and lows away and, of such strength, that its movement eastward is painfully slow.</p><p>This large high is also having an impact on the water temperature in the Timor Sea, where stronger easterly winds are stirring the surface up and making it the sea surface temperatures cooler and hence less moisture available for rainfall. All these things are hopefully temporary, but until they change, dry conditions seem likely.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's outlook for winter is 45 per cent statistically consistent for SA. The BoM does provide the accuracy information on their web page by clicking a link near their seasonal outlook.</p><p>The BoM has a duty of care to anyone utilising these outlooks to provide an understanding that guessing or tossing a coin would be more accurate than the present winter BoM outlook for SA.</p><p>The reason the outlook is not very consistent at this time of year is due to a lack of strong signals in the ocean or atmosphere with broadscale climate drivers, such as the El Ni&amp;#xF1;o-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole forecast to remain neutral during winter with little influence on SA rainfall.</p><p>Despite the lack of accuracy, the outlook does show reduced chances of above median rainfall for winter for most of SA.</p><p>I think the best bet for agricultural decision-making at present is to not place any emphasis on this outlook for now and instead use stored soil moisture and the BoM met eye outlooks for 10 days to better inform decisions.</p><p>The ocean to atmosphere indicators suggest neither a wetter or drier than normal winter.</p><p>The season could go either way. Due to the lack of conciseness with the current indicators, I have resorted to probabilities of rainfall. Across these locations here are the probabilities of receiving 50mm for June; Adelaide 70pc, Renmark 4pc, Whyalla 12pc, Port Lincoln 87pc, Keith 50pc, Mt Gambier 97pc, Mt Compass 83pc, Nuriootpa 60pc, Minlaton 62pc, Strathalbyn 40pc. The POAMA experimental model suggests June rainfall is more likely to be around normal for the southern coastal regions of SA and slightly below normal for the remainder of the state.</p><p>A slow moving low high-pressure system is likely to block rainfall for the next 7 days across SA. The POAMA experimental model suggests that rainfall is more likely to be up to 15mm below normal for the next two weeks. The southern annual mode SAM used to interpret the potential strength and position of cold fronts and mid-latitude storm systems was negative over the last week bringing welcomed cold fronts, \"the Antarctic blast\" however the SAM has returned positive and more likely to remain that way for a week or two meaning more high-pressure systems over southern Australia for that time.</p><p>Most climate drivers are having little influence on our rainfall at present with normal sea surface temperatures and a current neutral ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation).</p><p>This means that rainfall can go either for the coming months way but less likely to be extremely dry or wet.</p><p>But, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is more likely to be negative over the coming weeks. SAM can be used to interpret the potential strength and position of cold fronts and mid-latitude storm systems and is an important driver of rainfall variability in southern Australia.</p><p>A negative SAM event reflects an expansion of the belt of strong westerly winds towards the equator and this means more (or stronger) storms and low-pressure systems over southern Australia and hence likely rainfall.</p><p>This would be a welcome change to the warmer than normal days and cold nights provided by the dominating blocking high pressure system in the upper atmosphere over the last week.</p><p>There are no strong swings toward above or below normal rainfall for May to June for SA.</p><p>The sea surface temperatures that can influence rainfall at this time are neutral and are likely to stay this way through winter.</p><p>This does not necessarily mean average conditions will result, it means that the ocean and atmospheric condition are difficult to read at present, so the outlook models cannot indicate which way the rainfall is more likely to swing.</p><p>In the shorter term, there is up to 20 millimetres coming in the next few days for the southern parts of SA.</p><p>Soil Moisture probes are being used more for irrigation scheduling, prediction of pasture and crop growth, stock movements and hay cutting.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about how to use soil moisture probes and the many available on the market as well as how to improve your soil health, book to attend the biggest field day on the Fleurieu on May 15.</p><p>There is a chance that an intense cut-off low developing off south-west WA will bring some rainfall again for the southern coastal regions, but at this stage it is unknown if it will be enough to constitute a break for the season.</p><p>The southern annular mode is likely to continue to remain negative for the next few weeks, meaning more (or stronger) low pressure systems are more likely to develop over southern Australia and this leads to increased storms and rain.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology POAMA model suggests that wetter than normal conditions are more likely for SA for the two weeks from Anzac Day.</p><p>Would you like to present a display or attend our field day on May 15?

Rather, it indicates a reduced chance of widespread very wet or very dry weather, and that other climate drivers may have greater influence in the coming months.</p><p>These drivers include the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode. SAM drives the path of high pressure systems. If they track too low across SA, they block much needed cold fronts from developing.</p><p>At the moment, SAM is negative and likely to stay that way for the next three weeks. It means high pressure systems are less likely to block cold fronts.

However, the oceans and atmosphere are still not set to the El Nino and in SA. Our growing season is nearly over in SA with below normal rainfall to date and summer ahead with hotter than normal days and nights more likely.</p><p>There is not much change to last week's outlook with reduced chances of exceeding the median rainfall across SA and Australia for November.</p><p>The BoM outlook also shows an 80pc chance of exceeding median maximum temperatures for most of Australia apart from the southern coastal regions where the chance is a 60 to 70 pc chance of exceeding median maximum temperatures.</p><p>The oceans and atmosphere are yet to play along for an El Nino to be declared but other events are happening to cause drought like conditions.</p><p>One of these other events is the location of constant large high-pressure systems moving across the continent blocking much hope of frontal development for SA.</p><p>At this point our hope is for tropical moisture events from the north, however they are neither more or less likely at present also due to the nature of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>El Nino-like conditions have eased in the last week with the southern oscillation index near neutral and sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean above Darwin warming slightly.</p><p>The warm sea surface temperatures spanning the Pacific Ocean may generate more storms and tropical rainfall, but according the Bureau of Meteorology there is little likelihood of it producing above median rainfall for November across southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>The BoM continues to warn of increased chances of drier than normal conditions into November across southern and eastern Australia with about a 30 per cent chance of exceeding the median.</p><p>In addition, much of SA has been officially declared in drought with the Murray Mallee, Mid North and Eyre Peninsula in the mix.</p><p>With the Bureau of Meteorology still warning of an El Nino, we are not seeing typical sea surface temperatures associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation.</p><p>There are currently warmer than average sea surface temperatures along the entire equator in the Pacific Ocean, and across much of the tropics to the north of the equator.</p><p>These sea surface temperatures have influenced recent tropical storms in the north of Australia and sub-tropical lows bringing rain to southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>In the past week parts of SA received some much-needed rainfall with up to 25mm across the southern coastal regions and up to 10 mm on the Eyre Peninsula and Mid North. It certainly is an unusual ENSO development confusing seasonal outlook modelling as we know it as climate change challenges what we know.</p><p>There are below normal chances of exceeding the median rainfall for October in SA and eastern Australia. The chance of exceeding median rainfall ranges from 20 to 35 pc. The chances for exceeding median rainfall are lower in the southern coastal regions of SA.</p><p>This outlook is related to a sustained negative Southern Oscillation Index. A negative SOI at this time of the year reduces the changes of above normal rainfall across SA and eastern Australia. The SOI is likely to influence the development of cooler than normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean above Darwin.</p><p>When the sea surface temperatures are cooler than normal there is less evaporation and hence less moisture which results in lower than normal rainfall. Because of these developing conditions, the Bureau of Meteorology has issued an El Ni&amp;#xF1;o ALERT with around triple the normal likelihood of an El Nino occurring in 2018.</p><p>If combined with a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (now also highly likely) the chances dry and warm conditions to the end of the year across SA are increased along with the risk of heatwaves and bushfires.</p><p>There were stronger than average westerly winds across southern Australia for August with wind speed records being broken in many locations.</p><p>There were also record high pan evaporation rates in southern and eastern Australia for winter. Stored soil moisture was around average for much of the southern cropping region but below average for the mid north, Yorke peninsula and central rangelands for August. The greenness index is currently below normal across SA.</p><p>For spring we have a very high forest fire danger index coupled with increased chances for below normal rainfall across SA for October (30-45 per cent chance).</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's POAMA model suggests drier than normal conditions are likely across SA for the next two weeks with most regions receiving 5 millimetres to 10mm of rain below the normal up until the end of September.</p><p>Further ahead, the Bureau of Meteorology suggests a drier than normal October with a 30 per cent to 40pc chance of exceeding the median rainfall across the state for the month.</p><p>A warmer world is generally a wetter world and when sea surface temperatures are warmer than normal (especially in the pacific and Indian Oceans surrounding Australia) then higher rainfall is likely.</p><p>Sea surface temperatures surrounding Australia are neutral and expected to cool further over spring meaning lower than normal rainfall chances across much of southern and eastern Australia for spring. The interesting thing is that in parts of the Pacific Ocean the sea surface temperatures are warmer than ever recorded with more record-breaking hurricanes likely to occur this season in the northern hemisphere.</p><p>High pressure systems are more likely to dominate over southern Australia for the next few weeks.</p><p>This means colder than normal nights and warmer than normal days.</p><p>The high-pressure systems are likely to block cold fronts from crossing southern Australia apart from the coastal tips of SA, providing much needed rain over the next few weeks.</p><p>This pattern is worrying at this crucial stage in the season. The reason for the blocking highs is that the Southern Annular Mode is positive and likely to stay that way for at least the next few weeks according to the national weather service climate prediction centre.</p><p>During a positive SAM event, a belt of strong westerly winds contracts towards Antarctica.</p><p>This results in weaker than normal westerly winds and higher pressures over southern Australia, restricting the penetration of cold fronts inland.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's rainfall outlook for spring shows reduced chances of exceeding the median rainfall across much of Australia.</p><p>From the Mid North of SA through to the southern coastal regions there is a less than 30pc chance of exceeding the median rainfall across SA for September and October.</p><p>The Southern Oscillation Index is negative which has a high correlation with below normal spring rainfall for SA.</p><p>Ocean and atmosphere models suggest a weak El Nino will be declared by late spring, but in addition a positive IOD is predicted by most models which also has a negative impact on rainfall for spring.</p><p>Would you like help with planning a project or communication? Go to climateagriculturalsupport.com</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's rainfall outlook services include the chances of receiving nominated amounts of rainfall.</p><p>The chances of receiving 25 millimetres across SA varies for September. The outlook suggests that there is a 75 per cent chance of receiving 25mm of rainfall for the southern coastal tips of SA and for the remainder of southern SA there is a 55pc to 75pc chance of receiving 25mm in September.</p><p>The chances of receiving 25mm of rainfall for the remainder of the states cropping zone are further reduced with a 25pc to 35pc chance for the coming month.</p><p>The southern parts of the state have received some much-needed rainfall in the last week, but the northern parts of the cropping region only a few millimetres.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology warns that despite the rainfall, there is still double the chance of El Ni&amp;#xF1;o developing by mid to late spring.</p><p>El Nino only has a statistical influence on rainfall in spring for SA, so it may depend on when/if it develops. Three of six international climate models surveyed by the Bureau also suggest a short-lived positive Indian Ocean Dipole may event may develop.</p><p>A positive IOD during spring can exacerbate any El Ni&amp;#xF1;o driven rainfall deficiencies in spring. As always it is a numbers game and this information needs to be considered with other factors for decision making, including stored soil moisture and current crop/pasture dry matter.</p><p>Most of SA recorded decile 2-3 rainfall for May through to the end of July.</p><p>The remainder of Australia recorded decile 2-3 with some parts recording decile 1 or lowest on record.</p><p>The next week across SA is likely to be 7-14 millimetres drier than normal at your location, according the to the BOM POAMA model.</p><p>Present ocean and atmosphere conditions are not entirely negative for rainfall to transpire, but the BOM continues to warn that an El Nino may develop by spring with double the normal chances, according to their dynamical models.</p><p>If this occurs, then there are increased chances for below normal spring rainfall.</p><p>For August, there is a less than 30 per cent chance of exceeding the median rainfall for much of the state's cropping zone.</p><p>In addition, much of the state has a 70pc change of exceeding the median maximum temperatures for August (according to the Bureau of Meteorology seasonal outlook).</p><p>Much of SA has a suite of soil moisture probes that can be accessed here.</p><p>Stored soil moisture can be used in conjunction with seasonal outlooks to project pasture and cereal production.</p><p>There are outlook tools that already do this such as the Meat and Livestock Australia rainfall to pasture growth outlook tool or Yield Prophet.</p><p>Rainfall for April to June has been very much below average in the decile 2-3 range for most of SA.</p><p>The remainder of Australia has similar circumstances with some areas like southern WA receiving rainfall at the lowest on record.</p><p>I cannot help but relate the recent southern Australian rainfall patterns to that of rainfall patterns across the past 20 years.</p><p>Autumn rainfall for southern Australia has been on the decline on average for the past 20 years, when compared to the last 100 years of rainfall. This is due to larger than normal high-pressure systems blocking cold frontal development and movement across SA.</p><p>Going ahead it is best to make farm decisions on rainfall to date, stored soil moisture, a neutral winter outlook and a potential El Nino and positive IOD for Spring (meaning below normal rainfall more likely).</p><p>The next week is more likely to be drier than normal across SA according to the Bureau of Meteorology POAMA model, with about normal rainfall more likely for August.</p><p>There are no strong indicators for above normal rainfall beyond August, with sea surface temperature that influence above normal rainfall being neutral and the Southern Oscillation Index unlikely to encourage the movement of warmer water to the Pacific Ocean above Australia.</p><p>The BoM warns of double normal chances of an El Nino developing in spring and half of the ocean and atmosphere models also suggest a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. If either of these things occur our chances of receiving above normal rainfall for spring across SA will be reduced. If both occur together the chances diminish further.</p><p>You may be aware of the new fast break and a series of excellent seasonal climate products available for SA. The fast break mentions the present blocking high over the Bight, chasing fronts and lows away and, of such strength, that its movement eastward is painfully slow.</p><p>This large high is also having an impact on the water temperature in the Timor Sea, where stronger easterly winds are stirring the surface up and making it the sea surface temperatures cooler and hence less moisture available for rainfall. All these things are hopefully temporary, but until they change, dry conditions seem likely.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's outlook for winter is 45 per cent statistically consistent for SA. The BoM does provide the accuracy information on their web page by clicking a link near their seasonal outlook.</p><p>The BoM has a duty of care to anyone utilising these outlooks to provide an understanding that guessing or tossing a coin would be more accurate than the present winter BoM outlook for SA.</p><p>The reason the outlook is not very consistent at this time of year is due to a lack of strong signals in the ocean or atmosphere with broadscale climate drivers, such as the El Ni&amp;#xF1;o-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole forecast to remain neutral during winter with little influence on SA rainfall.</p><p>Despite the lack of accuracy, the outlook does show reduced chances of above median rainfall for winter for most of SA.</p><p>I think the best bet for agricultural decision-making at present is to not place any emphasis on this outlook for now and instead use stored soil moisture and the BoM met eye outlooks for 10 days to better inform decisions.</p><p>The ocean to atmosphere indicators suggest neither a wetter or drier than normal winter.</p><p>The season could go either way. Due to the lack of conciseness with the current indicators, I have resorted to probabilities of rainfall. Across these locations here are the probabilities of receiving 50mm for June; Adelaide 70pc, Renmark 4pc, Whyalla 12pc, Port Lincoln 87pc, Keith 50pc, Mt Gambier 97pc, Mt Compass 83pc, Nuriootpa 60pc, Minlaton 62pc, Strathalbyn 40pc. The POAMA experimental model suggests June rainfall is more likely to be around normal for the southern coastal regions of SA and slightly below normal for the remainder of the state.</p><p>A slow moving low high-pressure system is likely to block rainfall for the next 7 days across SA. The POAMA experimental model suggests that rainfall is more likely to be up to 15mm below normal for the next two weeks. The southern annual mode SAM used to interpret the potential strength and position of cold fronts and mid-latitude storm systems was negative over the last week bringing welcomed cold fronts, \"the Antarctic blast\" however the SAM has returned positive and more likely to remain that way for a week or two meaning more high-pressure systems over southern Australia for that time.</p><p>Most climate drivers are having little influence on our rainfall at present with normal sea surface temperatures and a current neutral ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation).</p><p>This means that rainfall can go either for the coming months way but less likely to be extremely dry or wet.</p><p>But, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is more likely to be negative over the coming weeks. SAM can be used to interpret the potential strength and position of cold fronts and mid-latitude storm systems and is an important driver of rainfall variability in southern Australia.</p><p>A negative SAM event reflects an expansion of the belt of strong westerly winds towards the equator and this means more (or stronger) storms and low-pressure systems over southern Australia and hence likely rainfall.</p><p>This would be a welcome change to the warmer than normal days and cold nights provided by the dominating blocking high pressure system in the upper atmosphere over the last week.</p><p>There are no strong swings toward above or below normal rainfall for May to June for SA.</p><p>The sea surface temperatures that can influence rainfall at this time are neutral and are likely to stay this way through winter.</p><p>This does not necessarily mean average conditions will result, it means that the ocean and atmospheric condition are difficult to read at present, so the outlook models cannot indicate which way the rainfall is more likely to swing.</p><p>In the shorter term, there is up to 20 millimetres coming in the next few days for the southern parts of SA.</p><p>Soil Moisture probes are being used more for irrigation scheduling, prediction of pasture and crop growth, stock movements and hay cutting.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about how to use soil moisture probes and the many available on the market as well as how to improve your soil health, book to attend the biggest field day on the Fleurieu on May 15.</p><p>There is a chance that an intense cut-off low developing off south-west WA will bring some rainfall again for the southern coastal regions, but at this stage it is unknown if it will be enough to constitute a break for the season.</p><p>The southern annular mode is likely to continue to remain negative for the next few weeks, meaning more (or stronger) low pressure systems are more likely to develop over southern Australia and this leads to increased storms and rain.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology POAMA model suggests that wetter than normal conditions are more likely for SA for the two weeks from Anzac Day.</p><p>Would you like to present a display or attend our field day on May 15?

Rather, it indicates a reduced chance of widespread very wet or very dry weather, and that other climate drivers may have greater influence in the coming months.</p><p>These drivers include the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode. SAM drives the path of high pressure systems. If they track too low across SA, they block much needed cold fronts from developing.</p><p>At the moment, SAM is negative and likely to stay that way for the next three weeks. It means high pressure systems are less likely to block cold fronts. But, it will be dry in SA at Easter and for the next 10 days.</p><p>Details: climateagriculturalsupport.com</p><p>Two tropical cyclones, including Tropical Cyclone Marcus near the WA coast and a developing cyclone above Darwin are giving tropical low push back for southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>Tropical Cyclone Marcus is well off the mainland, but the intensity of the low-pressure system - a category 5 cyclone - will cause an extended tropical low across Australia.</p><p>This will temporarily push away the blocking high pressure systems dominating and blocking rainfall in southern and eastern Australia and should bring some moisture, cloud cover and rainfall to southern and eastern Australia at the weekend and next week.</p><p>But, the rainfall may only reach parts of central SA and the coastal regions and is not likely to exceed 10 millimetres.</p><p>How do we make our farming systems more resilient to climate variability and drought? Save May 15 to attend a soil health field day on the Fleurieu, with national speakers, many displays and opportunity for discussion.</p><p>Tropical rainfall influences from Tropical Cyclone Linda will increase humidity across SA late this week and bring some small amounts of rainfall to the coastal regions of SA.</p><p>Present blocking high pressure systems may move further south toward the end of the month and bring some more rainfall for southern SA.</p><p>The POAMA experimental model suggests southern SA is likely to receive up to 10 millimetres in the last two weeks or March.</p><p>Longer term, La Nina has completely declined, and all indicators suggest a neutral ENSO for the remainder of the year.</p><p>For the past three months, SA rainfall has been about normal in the decile 5 range, while eastern Australian rainfall has had below normal and WA above normal.</p><p>March rainfall average totals are typically low for SA with cropping zone average for March ranging from 10-25mm and the coastal fringes receiving 25-50mm (April average totals are very similar).</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology March outlook for SA suggests increased chances of below median rainfall. But, the POAMA models shows that rainfall may only be below normal by 3mm in March with April rainfall likely to be around 3mm above normal.</p><p>Longer term, the ocean and atmosphere models suggest we are headed for an El Nino Southern Oscillation neutral year which typically means rainfall can go either way.</p><p>Having a better understanding of when to use outlooks and when to ignore them can support you to maximise profits in good years and minimise losses in bad years.</p><p>The BOM maintains that rainfall is more likely to be below normal for March with the next two weeks receiving around 5mm less than the average.</p><p>Maximum temperatures for the next two weeks will be around normal.</p><p>SA rainfall for Autumn is more likely to be below normal with around 10-30 mm below the 3 month median. Median Autumn rainfall at Buckelboo is 49mm, Adelaide 146mm, Maitland 110mm, Tintinarra 96mm, Kangaroo Island 137mm and Whaylla 52mm.</p><p>SA maximum and minimum temperatures are also more likely to be above the median for Autumn.</p><p>Would you like to better integrate climate and weather information into your farm planning? I can provide a workshop for your farm group or one on one consults.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology has released its outlook for autumn, which shows reduced chances of exceeding the median rainfall for SA.</p><p>The POAMA experimental rainfall outlook suggests that rainfall is likely to be up to 10 millimetres below normal for most of the state's locations for each month of autumn.</p><p>Maximum temperature is more likely to be above the median for autumn with a 65 per cent to 70pc chance of exceeding the median.</p><p>Minimum temperatures are also more likely to exceed the median for April across SA.</p><p>In the past week, sea surface temperatures that normally influence rainfall have returned to normal. The La Nina event has declined and will have little influence on any rainfall around Australia.</p><p>For SA, the POAMA experimental model suggests that rainfall will be normal to just below normal for the remainder of Feb and around normal for March.</p><p>Daytime temperatures are less likely to exceed the median and night time temperatures are likely to be normal for both February and March across SA.</p><p>Details: climateagriculturalsupport.com</p><p>Rainfall is more likely to be about normal for February and March across SA according to the Bureau of Meteorology POAMA experimental outlook.</p><p>Daytime temperatures are less likely to exceed the median and night time temperatures are likely to be normal for both February and March across SA.</p><p>Outlook accuracy for February is low and somewhat improved for March. It is understood that the present La Nina has little effect on southern SA rainfall at this time of year. Furthermore, this weak La Nina event is likely to burn out by autumn according to most climate models.</p><p>Details: climateagriculturalsupport.com</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology has updated its outlook for February.</p><p>Past historical accuracy of the BOM outlook in February is low, with the outlook being wrong more than 50 per cent of the time.</p><p>It is the nature of this time of year when the ocean and atmospheric conditions are in turmoil and their relationship to follow up rainfall at this time of the year is nonexistent.</p><p>The POAMA experimental outlook showing amounts of rainfall also has low skill at this time of year. It is showing that 6 millimetres to 18mm of rainfall above the median rainfall (at each location) is more likely SA for Feb.</p><p>The message of low accuracy is frustrating however outlook model developers are looking for methods to improve forecast accuracy for this time of the year.</p><p>Influencing aspects for more moisture and possible rainfall include warmer than normal sea surface temps in the Pacific and Indian oceans north of Australia.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology has declared a weak La Nina event which is likely to be short-lived.</p><p>La Nina events tend to have more impact on increasing the chances of rainfall across northern SA and depending on the strength of the event, tropical moisture can make its way further south.</p><p>The BOM outlook suggests increased chances for above normal rainfall across SA for Jan to March, however it is important to understand the likely rainfall amounts.</p><p>The POAMA experimental outlook tools suggests that may be some wetter than normal events late this January for the upper north of SA of up to 15 millimetres. Across the state in February rainfall may be 10mm to 20mm above normal. For March there are no strong swings toward above or below normal rainfall for SA at this stage.</p><p>The present La Nina influence means that there will be some moisture near Christmas time but only a slight chance of rainfall - about 10 per cent to 20pc - across SA. Furthermore, it is not likely to be too hot across the southern parts of the state in the next two weeks, with temperatures in the mid-20s.</p><p>Temperatures will be balmy in the low 30s for the Mid North. But, the Upper North pastoral regions may receive temperatures in the low 40s during the Christmas period.</p><p>For a more precise outlook for your location go to bom.gov.au/australia/meteye</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology has declared that the tropical Pacific has reached La Ni&amp;#xF1;a levels.</p><p>Climate models suggest this La Ni&amp;#xF1;a will be weak and short-lived, persisting until early southern autumn 2018.</p><p>La Ni&amp;#xF1;a can bring above average rainfall to eastern Australia during late spring and summer.</p><p>However, sea surface temperature patterns in the Indian Ocean and closer to Australia are not typical of a La Ni&amp;#xF1;a event, reducing the likelihood of widespread above average summer rainfall across SA.</p><p>The BOM outlook shows no strong swings toward above or below normal rainfall for SA for summer.</p><p>La Ni&amp;#xF1;a can increase the chance of prolonged warm spells for southeast Australia and the BOM suggests warmer than normal daytime and nighttime temperatures are more likely for SA for summer.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology says there are three times the normal chance of a La Nina event developing.</p><p>If a La Nina declares itself, it is likely to be weak and short lived.</p><p>A La Nina increases the likelihood of above normal rainfall for eastern Australia and cyclones for northern Australia.
