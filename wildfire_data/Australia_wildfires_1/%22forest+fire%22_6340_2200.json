Such a move would mean Republicans retake control of the 50-50 Senate, ending President Biden's legislative agenda.</p><p>'New Kennedys' Democratic heavies Vice-President Kamala Harris, a former California senator, and senator Elizabeth Warren have been campaigning in the Golden State in recent weeks, curtain-raisers for President Biden's arrival for Newsom's final rally in Palm Beach on Tuesday AEST.</p><p>Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor dubbed one of the \"new Kennedys\" by Harper's Bazaar when he was married to Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr's current girlfriend, is fighting to avoid being the second US governor to be recalled.</p><p>In 2003 former Democrat governor Gray Davis, a few months into his second term, was ousted by a recall vote, replaced by actor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state's last Republican governor.</p><p>Newsom's own movie star looks have failed to inoculate the first-term governor against a small-business community enraged by the nation's longest lockdown, gig workers, and Republicans who've smelt vulnerability.</p><p>\"If you're going to tax people at a high rate, destroy small businesses, put hardworking blue-collar people on the street, and then brag about your $80bn budget surplus, I find that offensive,\" says Ram Duriseti, a 51-year-old emergency room physician living in the Bay Area.</p><p>Newsom's critics have furnished an exhaustive list of reasons to dump him, from high taxation, arbitrary rule, poor forest fire management, homelessness and unworkable industrial relations, persuasive enough to have attracted 2.1 million signatures, 600,000 more than needed under state law to trigger a recall vote.</p><p>\"He's the epitome of his hypocrisy, all 'do as I say not as I do',\" says Lydia Olson, a full-time Uber driver in the San Francisco Bay area, bristling at the Governor's decision to cut public servants' pay by 10 per cent but exempt his own.</p><p>\"And then there's the French Laundry,\" she exclaims, recounting what's become - almost everyone I spoke to in California brought it up - Newsom's signature blunder, being photographed at a high-end restaurant in Napa last November with pharmaceutical executives without a mask, flouting his own rules.</p><p>After weeks of steadily narrowing, the polls have drifted in Newsom's favour: 56 per cent of voters oppose the recall motion, and 42 per cent are in favour, according to the latest average of credible statewide polls published by Nate Silver. But it's not so simple where voting isn't compulsory.</p><p>About half of likely voters say they haven't decided how to vote yet or wouldn't vote for any of the replacement candidates on the recall ballot, according to a recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California.</p><p>California is solidly Democrat, but motivated Republicans might be more likely to vote.</p><p>\"It's a bet on propensity,\" says Steve Haro, a veteran Democrat strategist and principal at Mehlman and Castagnetti, arguing the recall was a low-cost way for Republicans to destabilise the Governor.</p><p>\"It's a colossal waste of time and taxpayer dimes because the state is now stuck footing the bill for a frivolous election that should not have been triggered,\" Haro tells The Australian, referring to a $276m estimate for the total state and county costs for running the recall election.</p><p>Under California's recall rules, a new governor could be elected with a tiny number of votes. The ballot has two separate questions, of which voters can answer either or both.</p><p>Should Newsom be recalled? And who should replace him, with a list of 46 hopefuls including Caitlyn Jenner, a trans former gold medal-winning decathlete, and Larry Elder, a black American conservative talk-show host, to pick from.</p><p>A simple majority in favour of a yes vote would see Newsom replaced by the candidate who obtained the most votes, even if that were a piddling figure in a state of 40 million people.</p><p>'Not a coup' Shannon Hile, 39, a volunteer for one of the Republican contenders, Kevin Kiley, bristles at the idea Republicans were behind the recall.</p><p>\"We made our own signs, bought our own banners; they didn't back us one bit, it's ridiculous they call this a Republican coup. They didn't even join in until we had enough signatures,\" she adds.</p><p>\"Everyone has their own reasons for signing; I'm a single mum and I was unable to work because I have a small child,\" she adds.</p><p>California has had the longest, strictest lockdown among US states, lasting with varying degrees of severity from March 2020 to June 2021. And, unlike other states, Newsom still hasn't ended a state of emergency order that allows him to govern by decree.</p><p>\"I've been in snow, rain, smoke; Covid held us back too, actually at some point we thought Newsom was shutting us down for so long to slow down the campaign,\" Hile says.</p><p>Almost 18 months since the pandemic began, more than 5 per cent of California's schools are still fully remote, according to the American Enterprise Institute's school tracker, a higher share than in any other US state.</p><p>At the 38 per cent of schools that have reintroduced face-to-face teaching five days a week, children over the age of two are still required to socially distance and wear a mask, even outside.</p><p>A perceived war on gig workers has put the Governor at odds with gig workers too. California passed \"assembly Bill 5\" in January 2020, which reclassified millions of independent contractors across California as \"employees\" in a radical rewrite of the state's industrial relations laws. Employers had to prove, with documentation, their contractors were not employees.</p><p>Tech giants Uber and Lyft later won exemptions for their drivers and delivery workers, but for thousands of other gig workers it meant unemployment in a state with a jobless rate of 7.6 per cent, more than two percentage points above the national average.</p><p>Recall votes aren't new to California, where they are easier to trigger than other states owing to progressive reforms going back to the early 1910s. But, while Schwarzenegger himself has drawn parallels between his own 2003 contest and Newsom's present political predicament, the state has grown only more staunchly Democratic since then.</p><p>Republican Elder After Jenner's campaign fizzled - \"it feels a bit comical, is this really serious?\" says Duriseti - Elder became the de facto Republican frontrunner, eclipsing the more traditional Republican 36-year-old California assemblyman Kiley, who wrote a 200-page book in January outlining the case against Newsom.</p><p>Dubbed the \"black face of white supremacy\" by a Los Angeles Times columnist in August, Elder has been cast as a Trump-supporting extremist, despite a platform of reopening schools and curbing the state's notoriously high levels of homelessness and crime.</p><p>\"I love Trump but at the same time, at this point, it's a good thing he's letting California get on with it. We want everyone to look at this with clear eyes,\" says Republican volunteer Hile.</p><p>Leading Democrats, including Governor Newsom, failed to condemn a white woman wearing a gorilla mask who threw an egg at Elder as he campaigned near Venice Beach in Los Angeles last week.</p><p>\"Whatever your views on abortion, it properly terrorises the average Californian Democrat and, frankly, the average Californian moderate Republican,\" says Duriseti, referring to Texas's recent, highly controversial move to outlaw abortion after six weeks.</p><p>Kevin Paffrath, a 29-year-old real estate broker and the only Democrat brave enough to put his name on the ballot, says Elder's candidacy has been a godsend for Newsom.</p><p>\"He was just talking about Republicans taking your voting rights, which was boring; now they've got someone who they can paint as extreme,\" he says.</p><p>The bulk of experts believe Newsom will win.</p><p>\"The Dems have practised holding power in that state for a long time, gerrymandered, and have built advantages that can't be understated,\" says one veteran Democrat adviser in DC.</p><p>\"At the same time, the Republican fundraising apparatus has fallen apart and the Republican political class just moved out of California,\" he adds, preferring not to be named.</p><p>The state that catapulted Ronald Reagan, governor from 1967 to 1975, to national fame has become progressively more and more Democrat.</p><p>\"Basically, it started to shift after \"prop 187\" was passed in 1994, a measure that prohibited undocumented immigrants from being able to use public schools, and that enraged a lot of people,\" Haro explains.</p><p>Newsom is a smart politician, a survivor, and glamorous in a state famous for Hollywood, and he's not running against an Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p>\"Even if Elder won, the state legislature, 75 per cent Democrat, wouldn't let him govern properly, waiting until the next governor election in 2022,\" says Paffrath.</p><p>About seven million Californians have voted already via mail-in ballot; 34 per cent of them from Democrats and 30 per cent from Republicans. Whether enough of the 22 per cent of ballots sent in by independents are angry with Newsom remains to be seen.</p><p>Olson, who ferries Californians around for work daily, is quietly optimistic. \"September 14th can't come soon enough, I say to them, and there's a lot of appreciative chuckling,\" she says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-fa680272137711ecac1a23b3f036d5c379590a4b1f1f58a3dc77fb60c02baacf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63KW-B0R1-F0JP-W19M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 14, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDkyMkE0NDI4NDVBNEVCM0FCMUNGQUNDQTg0NDQ3RTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0Y4NEU1ODkzRTlENEQ5MEI1NTRFRTI0RTIzNDcxRkI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Discipline, Licensing &amp;

IN JANUARY 27, the ANU academic stated: \"There are just three contracting crews in East Gippsland at the moment = 15 on-the-ground employees\" in an email to environment groups. Yet figures supplied by East Gippsland forest industry consultant Gary Squires show there are 118 people employed in harvesting and hauling logs, while others are employed in sawmills at Brodribb and Newmerella (both just outside Orbost), Nowa Nowa, Bairnsdale and Swifts Creek, who all take logs from East Gippsland.</p><p>ON JANUARY 22, Prof Lindenmayer told the ABC: \"We won't lose a single job, in fact it will grow the forest industry to be more substantial than it is now, but using plantation feedstock, rather than using native forest\".</p><p>Yet the Victorian Association of Forest Industries has repeatedly stated the Government's plantation estate has barely been established and will take 30 years to develop to a point where it could realistically supply timber to industry.</p><p>Timber workers in Warburton, Noojee, Violet Town, Powelltown, Corryong, Orbost, Benalla and Heyfield face joining the dole queue after Premier Daniel Andrews announced cuts to the annual supply of native forest logs from the current 253,000 cubic metres to 140,000m3 by 2025-26 and down to zero by 2030.</p><p>JANUARY 29, in an ABC opinion piece Prof Lindenmayer said: \"salvage logging is the most damaging form of logging in native forests. Its impacts can last for decades or centuries and seriously impair the recovery of animal, bird and insect populations.

Its impacts can last for decades or centuries and seriously impair the recovery of animal, bird and insect populations. With so little intact forest left, this will spell disaster for native wildlife\".</p><p>Professional Forester Mark Poynter said the claim was interesting given major salvage logging which occurred following the 1939 bushfires has created advanced regrowth forests (80 years old) which is being proposed as the so-called 'Great Forest National Park' because of its huge environmental values, especially for endangered species such as Leadbeater's Possum and Greater Glider.</p><p>University of Melbourne forest fire scientists Kevin Tolhurst said the 2019-20 fires in southeast Australia burnt about 4.3 million hectares of conservation areas, 2.5 million hectares of agricultural land, and about 1.8 million hectares of forest and plantation areas.</p><p>\"It would appear that the impact of timber harvesting is far less significant to the extent of bushfires than areas managed primarily for conservation,\" Professor Tolhurst said</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROF LINDENMAYER</emphasis> continues to insist the Leadbeater's possum population is crashing and \"it is absent from sites and landscapes burned in the 2009 fires\". </p><p>Yet Victorian Government and community group surveys show a more than five-fold increase in known possum colonies from 153 in 2014 to 828 this year.</p><p>Prof Lindenmayer has dismissed these survey results saying they are \"repeats or triples or quadruples of animals we've already seen\". </p><p>The surveys also show the Leadbeater's Possum is found in regenerating forests (either from fire or logging) after about

Stay-at-home orders, basically keep people from going to work, make them work from home.</p><p>If they're essential workers, depending on how bad the problem is, you may even have to cut back on that and have only limited essential services.</p><p>So, it's the last thing that we want to do, but when you have an out of control forest fire of coronavirus infections, unfortunately, we don't have many other choices.</p><p>LEIGH SALES: When you have to start doing that repeatedly, how difficult does it become to get the public to keep complying?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well, you know the challenge we have is really different by what stage you are in the pandemic.</p><p>When it's early on and you know that this is coming and you're trying to keep the cases from occurring or you're trying to flatten an emerging curve, where basically a lot of people won't know anyone who has actually had the infection.</p><p>At the point it's very difficult to get people to comply and we're sure seeing that in many areas of the world.</p><p>But then once the house catches on fire, as we've seen in a number of localised outbreaks in states or cities here in the United States, same as true as throughout the rest of the world, then people take on a very different approach to what is going on.</p><p>If, in fact, your mom or dad, or your brother or sister, or your good friend, or your colleague, have died from the infection, it does take on a different meaning but that's a terrible way to have to achieve one's attention for this problem.</p><p>LEIGH SALES: How much of the population needs to have been infected before you see transmissions slow down?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: The more people that are immune, it means even if I have contact with them, I won't transmit a virus to them and they become infected because they are already protected.</p><p>And we know today, that based on what we're seeing, we probably need between 50 and 70 per cent of the population, at minimum, to be infected and that's really important to understand because it's saying in fact it's not just that they have been infected, but that it's durable protection, that they stay protected after that fact.</p><p>LEIGH SALES: And to give us some context, what percentage of the US has been infected so far?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: You know, it varies by location in the sense of New York and some of the hotter spots in the southern part of the United States, but across the board, it's about 7 to 9 per cent at the most of the entire country has been impacted.</p><p>In some localised areas, it may be as high as 10 to 18 per cent but I think the really important message is, that I just shared with you, in terms of what it takes to get to herd immunity.</p><p>Imagine here we are at 7 to 9 per cent, and for us to get to a herd immunity level where again, the virus doesn't stop getting transmitted, it just slows down its transmission, think of all the pain, the suffering and death, that has occurred associated with that amount of disease so far, and what it's going to take to get to a herd immunity status. That's a very, very daunting reality.</p><p>LEIGH SALES: You said in a recent interview that even if a vaccine becomes available, we'll be dealing with the virus forever. What did you mean by that?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well, just like any other major infectious disease that is newly emerging into humans, it will basically stay around until somehow either that animal species it came from is eliminated, or in the case of humans like this, think of HIV/AIDS. Once it got here, no matter how good we were at treating people and rendering them virtually non-infectious, it's still around.</p><p>And even if we can vaccinate most of the world, I doubt we'll ever vaccinate the entire world and then, of course, remember the vaccine is not likely to be 100 per cent effective.</p><p>LEIGH SALES: Something that's quite difficult for Australians to understand is why mask wearing in the US has become such a volatile political issue. What is going on?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: So much of this debate is not about the mask, it's about ideology and as a scientist, my job is to stay with the data, to basically provide what we know.</p><p>We say to wear masks, that they surely may reduce the transmission of the virus, we don't know how much, we have to be careful not to oversell masks.</p><p>Again, I say wear them, but the most important thing you can do is distance, distance and distance.</p><p>LEIGH SALES: Dr Osterholm, thanks for once again joining the program.</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-12509838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-HJ31-F031-X006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Health:Epidemics and Pandemics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health/Diseases and Disorders/Infectious Diseases (Other)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health/Diseases and Disorders/Respiratory Diseases</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N923120GC</classCode><className>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DP79</classCode><className>DISEASE CONTACT TRACING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPX0</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION &amp;

An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wwf.org.au/news/news/2020/3-billion-animals-impacted-by-australia-bushfire-crisis#gs.vckp7g\">estimated three billion</url> animals were killed or displaced, not including invertebrates. <br/><br/>The impact of the fires on biodiversity was too vast for professional scientists alone to collect data. So in the face of this massive challenge, we set up a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/environment-recovery-project-australian-bushfires\">community (citizen) science project</url> through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</url> website to help paint a more complete picture of which species are bouncing back - and which are not. </p><p><br/><br/>Almost 400 community scientists living near or travelling across the firegrounds have recorded their observations of flora and fauna in the aftermath, from finding <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38285436\">fresh wombat droppings</url> in blackened forests, to hearing the croaks of healthy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69126202\">tree frogs</url> in a dam choked with debris and ash. <br/><br/>Each observation is a story of survival against the odds, or of tragedy. Here are five we consider particularly remarkable. <br/>Greater gliders after Australia's largest ever bushfire<br/>The Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html\">the biggest forest fire</url> in Australian history, razing an area seven times the size of Singapore. This meant there nothing in history scientists could draw from to predict the animals' response. <br/><br/>So it came as a huge surprise when a community scientist observed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/66511751\">greater gliders</url> deep within the heart of the Gospers Mountain firegrounds in Wollemi National Park, far from unburned habitat. Greater gliders are listed as \"vulnerable\" under national environment law. They're nocturnal and live in hollow-bearing trees. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>A citizen scientist snapped this photo of a greater glider in the heart of the the Gospers Mountain firegrounds. <br/>Mike Letnic/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>How gliders survived the fire is still unknown. Could they have hidden in deep hollows of trees where the temperature is relatively cooler while the fire front passed? And what would they have eaten afterwards? Greater gliders usually <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9960401\">feed on young leaves and flowers</url>, but these foods are very rare in the post-fire environment. <br/><br/>Finding these gliders shows how there's still so much to learn about the resilience of species in the face of even the most devastating fires, especially as bushfires are forecast to become more frequent. <br/>Rare pink flowers burnishing the firegrounds<br/>The giant scale of the 2019-20 fires means post-fire flowering is on display in grand and gorgeous fashion. This is a feature of many native plant species which need fire to stimulate growth. <br/><br/>Excitingly, community scientists recorded a long-dormant species, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://inaturalist.org/observations/70592241\">pink flannel flower</url> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Actinotus forsythii</emphasis>), that's now turning vast areas of the Blue Mountains pink. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>Pink flannel flowers are bushfire ephemerals, which means their seeds only germinate after fire. <br/>Margaret Sky/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>Pink flannel flowers are not considered threatened, but they are very <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/once-in-a-lifetime-pink-flowers-emerge-from-burnt-landscapes-20210215-p572m8.html\">rarely seen</url>. <br/><br/>Individuals of this species spend most of their life as a seed in the soil. Seeds require a chemical found in bushfire smoke, and the right seasonal temperatures, to germinate. <br/>Rediscovering the midge orchid<br/>Much of Australia's amazing biodiversity is extremely local.

The Black Summer fires destroyed the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21266-5\">entire range</url> of 100 Australian plant species, incinerating the above-ground parts of every individual.

The species fate was unknown until two separate community scientists photographed it at five sites in January 2021, showing its recovery. <br/><br/>Like many of Australia's terrestrial orchids, this species has an underground tuber (storage organ) which may have helped part of it avoid the flames' lethal heat. <br/>Don't forget about insects<br/>Despite their incredible diversity and tremendous value to society, insects tend to be the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecologyisnotadirtyword.com/2021/03/13/new-paper-we-dont-know-how-extreme-fire-impacts-australian-invertebrates/\">forgotten victims</url> of bushfires and other environmental disasters. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/photos-from-the-field-zooming-in-on-australias-hidden-world-of-exquisite-mites-snails-and-beetles-147576\">Many trillions of</url> invertebrates would have been killed in the fires of last summer.

An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wwf.org.au/news/news/2020/3-billion-animals-impacted-by-australia-bushfire-crisis#gs.vckp7g\">estimated three billion</url> animals were killed or displaced, not including invertebrates. <br/><br/>The impact of the fires on biodiversity was too vast for professional scientists alone to collect data. So in the face of this massive challenge, we set up a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/environment-recovery-project-australian-bushfires\">community (citizen) science project</url> through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</url> website to help paint a more complete picture of which species are bouncing back - and which are not. </p><p><br/><br/>Almost 400 community scientists living near or travelling across the firegrounds have recorded their observations of flora and fauna in the aftermath, from finding <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38285436\">fresh wombat droppings</url> in blackened forests, to hearing the croaks of healthy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69126202\">tree frogs</url> in a dam choked with debris and ash. <br/><br/>Each observation is a story of survival against the odds, or of tragedy. Here are five we consider particularly remarkable. <br/>Greater gliders after Australia's largest ever bushfire<br/>The Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html\">the biggest forest fire</url> in Australian history, razing an area seven times the size of Singapore. This meant there nothing in history scientists could draw from to predict the animals' response. <br/><br/>So it came as a huge surprise when a community scientist observed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/66511751\">greater gliders</url> deep within the heart of the Gospers Mountain firegrounds in Wollemi National Park, far from unburned habitat. Greater gliders are listed as \"vulnerable\" under national environment law. They're nocturnal and live in hollow-bearing trees. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>A citizen scientist snapped this photo of a greater glider in the heart of the the Gospers Mountain firegrounds. <br/>Mike Letnic/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>How gliders survived the fire is still unknown. Could they have hidden in deep hollows of trees where the temperature is relatively cooler while the fire front passed? And what would they have eaten afterwards? Greater gliders usually <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9960401\">feed on young leaves and flowers</url>, but these foods are very rare in the post-fire environment. <br/><br/>Finding these gliders shows how there's still so much to learn about the resilience of species in the face of even the most devastating fires, especially as bushfires are forecast to become more frequent. <br/>Rare pink flowers burnishing the firegrounds<br/>The giant scale of the 2019-20 fires means post-fire flowering is on display in grand and gorgeous fashion. This is a feature of many native plant species which need fire to stimulate growth. <br/><br/>Excitingly, community scientists recorded a long-dormant species, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://inaturalist.org/observations/70592241\">pink flannel flower</url> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Actinotus forsythii</emphasis>), that's now turning vast areas of the Blue Mountains pink. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>Pink flannel flowers are bushfire ephemerals, which means their seeds only germinate after fire. <br/>Margaret Sky/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>Pink flannel flowers are not considered threatened, but they are very <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/once-in-a-lifetime-pink-flowers-emerge-from-burnt-landscapes-20210215-p572m8.html\">rarely seen</url>. <br/><br/>Individuals of this species spend most of their life as a seed in the soil. Seeds require a chemical found in bushfire smoke, and the right seasonal temperatures, to germinate. <br/>Rediscovering the midge orchid<br/>Much of Australia's amazing biodiversity is extremely local. Some species, particularly plants, exist only in a single valley or ridge. The Black Summer fires destroyed the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21266-5\">entire range</url> of 100 Australian plant species, incinerating the above-ground parts of every individual.

The species fate was unknown until two separate community scientists photographed it at five sites in January 2021, showing its recovery. <br/><br/>Like many of Australia's terrestrial orchids, this species has an underground tuber (storage organ) which may have helped part of it avoid the flames' lethal heat. <br/>Don't forget about insects<br/>Despite their incredible diversity and tremendous value to society, insects tend to be the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecologyisnotadirtyword.com/2021/03/13/new-paper-we-dont-know-how-extreme-fire-impacts-australian-invertebrates/\">forgotten victims</url> of bushfires and other environmental disasters. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/photos-from-the-field-zooming-in-on-australias-hidden-world-of-exquisite-mites-snails-and-beetles-147576\">Many trillions of</url> invertebrates would have been killed in the fires of last summer.

So in the face of this massive challenge, we set up a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/environment-recovery-project-australian-bushfires\">community (citizen) science project</url> through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</url> website to help paint a more complete picture of which species are bouncing back - and which are not. </p><p><br/><br/>Almost 400 community scientists living near or travelling across the firegrounds have recorded their observations of flora and fauna in the aftermath, from finding <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38285436\">fresh wombat droppings</url> in blackened forests, to hearing the croaks of healthy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69126202\">tree frogs</url> in a dam choked with debris and ash. <br/><br/>Each observation is a story of survival against the odds, or of tragedy. Here are five we consider particularly remarkable. <br/>Greater gliders after Australia's largest ever bushfire<br/>The Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html\">the biggest forest fire</url> in Australian history, razing an area seven times the size of Singapore. This meant there nothing in history scientists could draw from to predict the animals' response. <br/><br/>So it came as a huge surprise when a community scientist observed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/66511751\">greater gliders</url> deep within the heart of the Gospers Mountain firegrounds in Wollemi National Park, far from unburned habitat. Greater gliders are listed as \"vulnerable\" under national environment law. They're nocturnal and live in hollow-bearing trees. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>A citizen scientist snapped this photo of a greater glider in the heart of the the Gospers Mountain firegrounds. <br/>Mike Letnic/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>How gliders survived the fire is still unknown. Could they have hidden in deep hollows of trees where the temperature is relatively cooler while the fire front passed? And what would they have eaten afterwards? Greater gliders usually <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9960401\">feed on young leaves and flowers</url>, but these foods are very rare in the post-fire environment. <br/><br/>Finding these gliders shows how there's still so much to learn about the resilience of species in the face of even the most devastating fires, especially as bushfires are forecast to become more frequent. <br/>Rare pink flowers burnishing the firegrounds<br/>The giant scale of the 2019-20 fires means post-fire flowering is on display in grand and gorgeous fashion. This is a feature of many native plant species which need fire to stimulate growth. <br/><br/>Excitingly, community scientists recorded a long-dormant species, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://inaturalist.org/observations/70592241\">pink flannel flower</url> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Actinotus forsythii</emphasis>), that's now turning vast areas of the Blue Mountains pink. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>Pink flannel flowers are bushfire ephemerals, which means their seeds only germinate after fire. <br/>Margaret Sky/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>Pink flannel flowers are not considered threatened, but they are very <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/once-in-a-lifetime-pink-flowers-emerge-from-burnt-landscapes-20210215-p572m8.html\">rarely seen</url>. <br/><br/>Individuals of this species spend most of their life as a seed in the soil. Seeds require a chemical found in bushfire smoke, and the right seasonal temperatures, to germinate. <br/>Rediscovering the midge orchid<br/>Much of Australia's amazing biodiversity is extremely local. Some species, particularly plants, exist only in a single valley or ridge. The Black Summer fires destroyed the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21266-5\">entire range</url> of 100 Australian plant species, incinerating the above-ground parts of every individual.

The species fate was unknown until two separate community scientists photographed it at five sites in January 2021, showing its recovery. <br/><br/>Like many of Australia's terrestrial orchids, this species has an underground tuber (storage organ) which may have helped part of it avoid the flames' lethal heat. <br/>Don't forget about insects<br/>Despite their incredible diversity and tremendous value to society, insects tend to be the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecologyisnotadirtyword.com/2021/03/13/new-paper-we-dont-know-how-extreme-fire-impacts-australian-invertebrates/\">forgotten victims</url> of bushfires and other environmental disasters. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/photos-from-the-field-zooming-in-on-australias-hidden-world-of-exquisite-mites-snails-and-beetles-147576\">Many trillions of</url> invertebrates would have been killed in the fires of last summer.

An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wwf.org.au/news/news/2020/3-billion-animals-impacted-by-australia-bushfire-crisis#gs.vckp7g\">estimated three billion</url> animals were killed or displaced, not including invertebrates. <br/><br/>The impact of the fires on biodiversity was too vast for professional scientists alone to collect data. So in the face of this massive challenge, we set up a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/environment-recovery-project-australian-bushfires\">community (citizen) science project</url> through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</url> website to help paint a more complete picture of which species are bouncing back - and which are not. </p><p><br/><br/>Almost 400 community scientists living near or travelling across the firegrounds have recorded their observations of flora and fauna in the aftermath, from finding <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38285436\">fresh wombat droppings</url> in blackened forests, to hearing the croaks of healthy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69126202\">tree frogs</url> in a dam choked with debris and ash. <br/><br/>Each observation is a story of survival against the odds, or of tragedy. Here are five we consider particularly remarkable. <br/>Greater gliders after Australia's largest ever bushfire<br/>The Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html\">the biggest forest fire</url> in Australian history, razing an area seven times the size of Singapore. This meant there nothing in history scientists could draw from to predict the animals' response. <br/><br/>So it came as a huge surprise when a community scientist observed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/66511751\">greater gliders</url> deep within the heart of the Gospers Mountain firegrounds in Wollemi National Park, far from unburned habitat. Greater gliders are listed as \"vulnerable\" under national environment law. They're nocturnal and live in hollow-bearing trees. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>A citizen scientist snapped this photo of a greater glider in the heart of the the Gospers Mountain firegrounds. <br/>Mike Letnic/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>How gliders survived the fire is still unknown. Could they have hidden in deep hollows of trees where the temperature is relatively cooler while the fire front passed? And what would they have eaten afterwards? Greater gliders usually <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9960401\">feed on young leaves and flowers</url>, but these foods are very rare in the post-fire environment. <br/><br/>Finding these gliders shows how there's still so much to learn about the resilience of species in the face of even the most devastating fires, especially as bushfires are forecast to become more frequent. <br/>Rare pink flowers burnishing the firegrounds<br/>The giant scale of the 2019-20 fires means post-fire flowering is on display in grand and gorgeous fashion. This is a feature of many native plant species which need fire to stimulate growth. <br/><br/>Excitingly, community scientists recorded a long-dormant species, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://inaturalist.org/observations/70592241\">pink flannel flower</url> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Actinotus forsythii</emphasis>), that's now turning vast areas of the Blue Mountains pink. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>Pink flannel flowers are bushfire ephemerals, which means their seeds only germinate after fire. <br/>Margaret Sky/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>Pink flannel flowers are not considered threatened, but they are very <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/once-in-a-lifetime-pink-flowers-emerge-from-burnt-landscapes-20210215-p572m8.html\">rarely seen</url>. <br/><br/>Individuals of this species spend most of their life as a seed in the soil.

So in the face of this massive challenge, we set up a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/environment-recovery-project-australian-bushfires\">community (citizen) science project</url> through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</url> website to help paint a more complete picture of which species are bouncing back - and which are not. </p><p><br/><br/>Almost 400 community scientists living near or travelling across the firegrounds have recorded their observations of flora and fauna in the aftermath, from finding <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38285436\">fresh wombat droppings</url> in blackened forests, to hearing the croaks of healthy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69126202\">tree frogs</url> in a dam choked with debris and ash. <br/><br/>Each observation is a story of survival against the odds, or of tragedy. Here are five we consider particularly remarkable. <br/>Greater gliders after Australia's largest ever bushfire<br/>The Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html\">the biggest forest fire</url> in Australian history, razing an area seven times the size of Singapore. This meant there nothing in history scientists could draw from to predict the animals' response. <br/><br/>So it came as a huge surprise when a community scientist observed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/66511751\">greater gliders</url> deep within the heart of the Gospers Mountain firegrounds in Wollemi National Park, far from unburned habitat. Greater gliders are listed as \"vulnerable\" under national environment law. They're nocturnal and live in hollow-bearing trees. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389452/original/file-20210315-23-1njq9bg.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>A citizen scientist snapped this photo of a greater glider in the heart of the the Gospers Mountain firegrounds. <br/>Mike Letnic/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>How gliders survived the fire is still unknown. Could they have hidden in deep hollows of trees where the temperature is relatively cooler while the fire front passed? And what would they have eaten afterwards? Greater gliders usually <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9960401\">feed on young leaves and flowers</url>, but these foods are very rare in the post-fire environment. <br/><br/>Finding these gliders shows how there's still so much to learn about the resilience of species in the face of even the most devastating fires, especially as bushfires are forecast to become more frequent. <br/>Rare pink flowers burnishing the firegrounds<br/>The giant scale of the 2019-20 fires means post-fire flowering is on display in grand and gorgeous fashion. This is a feature of many native plant species which need fire to stimulate growth. <br/><br/>Excitingly, community scientists recorded a long-dormant species, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://inaturalist.org/observations/70592241\">pink flannel flower</url> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Actinotus forsythii</emphasis>), that's now turning vast areas of the Blue Mountains pink. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/389455/original/file-20210315-20-1th0zi6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip</url>Pink flannel flowers are bushfire ephemerals, which means their seeds only germinate after fire. <br/>Margaret Sky/iNaturalist, <url normalizedValue=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC</url><br/>Pink flannel flowers are not considered threatened, but they are very <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/once-in-a-lifetime-pink-flowers-emerge-from-burnt-landscapes-20210215-p572m8.html\">rarely seen</url>. <br/><br/>Individuals of this species spend most of their life as a seed in the soil. Seeds require a chemical found in bushfire smoke, and the right seasonal temperatures, to germinate. <br/>Rediscovering the midge orchid<br/>Much of Australia's amazing biodiversity is extremely local. Some species, particularly plants, exist only in a single valley or ridge. The Black Summer fires destroyed the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21266-5\">entire range</url> of 100 Australian plant species, incinerating the above-ground parts of every individual.

The species fate was unknown until two separate community scientists photographed it at five sites in January 2021, showing its recovery. <br/><br/>Like many of Australia's terrestrial orchids, this species has an underground tuber (storage organ) which may have helped part of it avoid the flames' lethal heat. <br/>Don't forget about insects<br/>Despite their incredible diversity and tremendous value to society, insects tend to be the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecologyisnotadirtyword.com/2021/03/13/new-paper-we-dont-know-how-extreme-fire-impacts-australian-invertebrates/\">forgotten victims</url> of bushfires and other environmental disasters. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/photos-from-the-field-zooming-in-on-australias-hidden-world-of-exquisite-mites-snails-and-beetles-147576\">Many trillions of</url> invertebrates would have been killed in the fires of last summer.

NSW broke its annual record for daytime temperatures for a third year in a row, while Victoria had its fourth-warmest.</p><p>For South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, 2019 also marked their hottest year for maximums.</p><p>Rainfall was generally dismal, averaging just 277.63 millimetres across Australia in 2019. That tally was more than one-10th below the previous record low set in 1902.</p><p>\"Australia had below-average rainfall in every month - it's the first time that's happened,\" Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Each city, except Sydney, had rainfall totals in the driest 10 per cent of years. The city had many months with below-average rainfall and ended up with its driest year since 2005.</p><p>NSW and the Murray-Darling Basin both collected less than half their usual annual rainfall, setting new lows and intensifying the drought. South Australia also had its driest year, with one-third its typical falls, while Victoria had its 10th-driest at just below two-thirds of normal levels.</p><p>Three poor winters meant run-off into dams in the Murray-Darling Basin was also very poor, with \"no meaningful inflows in the northern basin, where storages remained extremely low or close to empty\", the bureau said in its annual report.</p><p>Australia started 2019 with an extreme heatwave in January that helped make the 2018-19 summer the country's hottest.</p><p>But that record could be eclipsed after a scorching December that \"brought an exceptionally warm end to the year\", the bureau said.</p><p>On December 18 Australia had its hottest day, with an average maximum of about 41.9 degrees. The month also included the next six warmest days, all shading the previous 40.3-degree high set in early 2013.</p><p>The week ending Christmas Eve was Australia's hottest week, with an average of 40.5 degrees.</p><p>The size of December's temperature leap was perhaps the standout statistic from 2019. At 38.6 degrees on average, December's daytime temperatures were a full 4.15 degrees above the 1961-90 benchmark, beating a record set only a year earlier by 1.74 degrees.</p><p>December maximums were the largest departure from the norm for any month the bureau has monitored, as were the mean temperatures - averaging out maximums and minimums - at an anomaly of 3.21 degrees.</p><p>Nullarbor station's 49.9 degrees last month set a new December record nationally.</p><p>\"2019 was the extreme year in the sequence [of the past few hot years], but December was the sharp end of the extremes,\" Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Rain clouds were largely absent for the month, with a delayed northern monsoon contributing to Australia's driest December. Rainfall averaged just 15.42 millimetres.</p><p>The combination of extreme heat and low rainfall meant the bushfire season started early in many parts of Australia.</p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Index - gauging temperature, humidity, winds and drought - was the highest on record over most of Australia.</p><p>Rainfall was generally dismal in 2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc78r7o6fpcli18tspijkp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXT-5851-F0J6-J3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

level of risk most Victorians face from the ongoing build-up of fuel loads in Black Saturday's worst-hit zones, leaving them more exposed to loss of homes and lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After repeatedly failing to keep fuel loads in check, the Government's Forest Fire Management Victoria agency simply raised the level of residual risk it deemed acceptable across the most dangerous fire zones.</p><p>The move went unnoticed until The Weekly Times examined archived snapshots of FFMVic's website, which showed it had raised its residual risk targets across the state's most dangerous fire zones.</p><p>Date-stamped archived internet pages show that after redrawing its fire zone boundaries, it had lifted the acceptable risk levels between March 12 last year and January this year, from: 80 to 85 per cent across the Port Phillip Zone, extending from Melbourne out to Kinglake, the Yarra Ranges and Bunyip State Park.</p><p>60 to 70 per cent across the state's North East.</p><p>65 to 70 per cent in Gippsland.</p><p>The higher the risk, the higher the fuel loads close to homes, leaving more Victorians exposed to losing property or lives on catastrophic code red days.</p><p>In the lead-up to Black Saturday the build-up of fuel loads had pushed the residual risk levels to 80 per cent across the worst-hit Kinglake-Marysville zone, where most of the 2133 homes and 173 lives were lost.</p><p>The nation's top bushfire scientist Kevin Tolhurst has accused the Government of being \"sneaky buggers\" in arbitrarily resetting the numbers, without bothering to consult the communities at risk.</p><p>\"To me that level should be something that is acceptable to the community,\" Professor Tolhurst said. \"They've raised it (the risk target) just because it's easier to achieve.\" Prof Tolhurst and his colleague Derek Chong, developed the Phoenix Rapid Fire computer model, which is used by FFM Vic to calculate residual risk.</p><p>Originally, the Government set an average residual risk target of 70 per cent for the state.</p><p>\"If the residual risk for the new Port Phillip region is 85 per cent, then that implies that the level of house loss (over 2000 houses), was acceptable (on Black Saturday),\" Prof Tolhurst said.</p><p>\" Continued, Page 4 \" Editorial, Page 16 \" Rule's View, Page 17 \" From Page 1 \"I don't believe the extent of impact on peoples' homes and livelihood would be generally considered 'acceptable'.</p><p>\"The level of risk should not just be determined by a government agency based on what seems achievable given a certain level of resources.\" A risk level of 100 per cent equates to no fuel reduction burns being conducted at all, resulting in impacts of a fire with maximum fuel loads.</p><p>Redrawing the boundaries has also allowed FFMVic to split Victoria's highest risk East Central bushfire zone between three new lower risk zones, Port Phillip, Hume and Gippsland.</p><p>The internet archives show that in 2018 FFMVic stated that in the East Central Zone: \"fuel management activities in the FOP (fire operations plan) will slow this increase to a projected 77-79 per cent, but without planned burning residual risk will continue to rise, to a projected 84 per cent by 2020\".</p><p>In December 2018The Weekly Times reported what was then called the East Central zone's residual risk had hit pre-Black Saturday levels of 80 per cent.</p><p>At the time Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning Port Phillip Assistant Chief Fire Officer Chris Eagle told The Weekly Times: \"The residual risk target for

told The Weekly Times the 80 per cent figure was a mistake and the Port Phillip zone \"has always been 85 per cent, despite the temporary error on our website\".</p><p>The spokesman said the original boundary changes had been made in 2017, which had then led to some risk ratings going up \"due to the inclusion of more fire-prone areas - however, it had no effect on the statewide risk rating, which remains 70 per cent\".</p><p>\"The targets have gone up in Hume Region (previously reported as Alpine and North East Bushfire Risk Landscape) because of the addition of the Murrindindi District from the East Central BRL.</p><p>\"The Gippsland Region (previously reported as Alpine and Greater Gippsland BRL) has gone up because of the addition of the Latrobe District from the East Central BRL\".</p><p>FFMVic, Premier Daniel Andrews and his senior ministers have repeatedly refused to release a full set of fuel-load maps for Victoria's bushfire zones, first stating in the lead-up to last summer's catastrophic fire season that they were only for internal \"business\" use, and then more recently claiming they could be used by arsonists.</p><p>Until the Andrews Government was elected in 2014, both the former Baillieu-Napthine Coalition and Brumby Labor governments had committed to the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission's recommendation to \"fund and commit to implementing a long-term program of prescribed burning based on an annual rolling target of 5 per cent minimum of public land\", equal to 385,000ha annually.</p><p>But in 2015 the Inspector General of Emergency Management Tony Pearce reviewed the target and recommended it be replaced with the computer-modelled measure of residual risk.</p><p>Professor Tolhurst said Victoria was relying on bushfires to reduce fuel loads, rather than good management.</p><p>\"Most of the impact seems to do with wildfires, not to do with management, which is perverse in itself,\" he said.</p><p>FUELLING THE FIRE Target risk

level of risk most Victorians face from the ongoing build-up of fuel loads in Black Saturday's worst-hit zones, leaving them more exposed to loss of homes and lives. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After repeatedly failing to keep fuel loads in check the Government's Forest Fire Management Victoria agency simply raised the level of residual risk it deemed acceptable across the most dangerous fire zones.</p><p>The move went unnoticed until <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Weekly Times </emphasis>examined archived snapshots of FFMVic's website, which showed it had raised its residual risk targets across the state's most dangerous fire zones. </p><p>Date-stamped archived internet pages show that after redrawing its fire zone boundaries, it had lifted the acceptable risk levels between March 12 last year and January this year, from:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">80 to 85 per cent</emphasis> across the Port Phillip Zone, extending from Melbourne out to Kinglake, the Yarra Ranges and Bunyip State Park.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">60 to 70 per cent</emphasis> across the state's North East.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">65 to 70 per cent</emphasis> in Gippsland.</p><p>The higher the risk, the higher the fuel loads close to homes, leaving more Victorians exposed to losing their lives on catastrophic code red days.</p><p>In the lead-up to Black Saturday the build-up of fuel loads had pushed the residual risk levels to 80 per cent across the worst hit Kinglake-Marysville zone, where most of the 2133 homes and 173 lives were lost. </p><p>The nation's top bushfire scientist Kevin Tolhurst has accused the Government of being \"sneaky buggers\" in arbitrarily resetting the numbers, without bothering to consult the communities at risk.</p><p>\"To me that level should be something that is acceptable to the community,\" Professor Tolhurst said. \"They've raised it (the risk target) just because it's easier to achieve.\"</p><p>Prof Tolhurst and his colleague Derek Chong, developed the Phoenix Rapid Fire computer model, which is used by FFM Vic to calculate residual risk. </p><p>Originally the Government set an average residual risk target of 70 per cent for the state.</p><p>\"If the residual risk for the new Port Phillip region is 85 per cent, then that implies that the level of house loss (over 2000 houses), was acceptable (on Black Saturday),\" Prof Tolhurst said. </p><p>\"I don't believe the extent of impact on peoples' homes and livelihood would be generally considered 'acceptable'.\"</p><p>\"The level of risk should not just be determined by a government agency based on what seems achievable given a certain level of resources.\"</p><p>A risk level of 100 per cent equates to no fuel reduction burns being conducted at all, resulting in impacts of a fire with maximum fuel loads.</p><p>Redrawing the boundaries has also allowed FFMVic to split Victoria's highest risk East Central bushfire zone between three new lower risk zones - Port Phillip, Hume and Gippsland.</p><p>The internet archives show that in 2018 FFMVic stated that in the East Central Zone: \"fuel management activities in the FOP (fire operations plan) will slow this increase to a projected 77-79 per cent, but without planned burning residual risk will continue to rise, to a projected 84 per cent by 2020\".</p><p>In December 2018 <url

homes in regional Victoria say they are running out of time to prepare their properties for the upcoming bushfire season, with travel permits urgently needed.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the past 40 years, Shirley Hinkley has spent this time of year preparing her Daylesford holiday house for the upcoming summer bushfire season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The area around the house, there is about an acre that is mowed \u2026 the rest of the property, even though it is well-treed it still needs the undergrowth from the bush and the trees to be cleared as much as possible,\" she says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her holiday house sits on 5 acres of land and requires a fair bit of work ahead of summer \u2014 but for months, Ms Hinkley hasn't been able to get there.</p><p>She lives in Airport West in Melbourne and usually spends every weekend in Daylesford.</p><p>But coronavirus travel restrictions mean Melburnians can not travel further than 5 kilometres from their homes, unless it is for essential work or activities.</p><p>So far, bushfire preparation for a second property has not been considered an essential reason to travel.</p><p>Coronavirus restrictions are forecast to next ease in Melbourne on October 19, but it is not yet clear what extra travel, if any, will be allowed.</p><p>Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton did say earlier in the week that bushfire preparation will need to be done in regional Victoria and the State Government is working on allowances for it, but so far no announcement has been made.</p><p>For Melburnians with regional properties, the worry is timing.</p><p>They want to know when they will be able to start bushfire preparations and if they will be given the time they need ahead of summer.</p><p>\"This time leading up to December is our prime time to be clearing and burning off branches and leaves and undergrowth,\" Shirley explains.</p><p>She wants to get to her holiday house while burn-offs are still allowed.</p><p>She's happy to isolate on her property, to make sure there isn't a COVID-19 risk.</p><p>\"We are in the bush, I can literally drive from my front gate in Melbourne to my front gate at Daylesford and not see a soul,\" she says.</p><p>She just wants the chance to protect a holiday house that has 40 years of memories for her family.</p><h>Property owners say they need clarity on travel rules </h><p>Jenny Cato lives in Collingwood in Melbourne's inner-north and is in the process of purchasing a property in Castlemaine she hopes to enjoy with her family.</p><p>\"We are due to settle on the 15th of this month and there is a lot of ambiguity around the rules in this regard,\" she says.</p><p>She says she has not been able to get a clear answer about whether she can travel to the property for a final inspection before settlement.</p><p>But even more than that, she wants clarity on when she can travel to her new holiday home to get it ready for the upcoming bushfire season.</p><p>She says the house has been empty for the past year, and there is a lot of work to do.</p><p>\"It is in a red-hot fire zone and we need to do some pretty heavy lifting in order to mitigate any risk of fire coming through,\" she says.</p><p>She has been in contact with the local CFA and wants to get advice on the work that needs to be done, but is starting to worry about the timing.</p><p>\"If we haven't got everything sorted by mid-November we are just raising the risk for the property and for ourselves,\" she says.</p><p>She also says she is happy to isolate on her property, but wants to make sure it makes it safely through this summer. </p><h>Government urged to find a solution before Melbourne Cup weekend</h><p>Surf Coast Shire councillor Tony Revell is a CFA volunteer in Anglesea, where he estimates around 50 per cent of homes are owned by people who do not permanently live in the popular tourist town.</p><p>He says ensuring property owners have done enough to prepare for the bushfire season is always a challenge, but that has been compounded by the restrictions preventing Melbourne residents from visiting their regional Victorian properties.</p><p>\"It's confusing,\" he says.</p><p>\"We are getting asked 'when can we come down' and the short answer is you're not allowed to come down at the moment, in terms of how the Government is interpreting that regulation.\"</p><p>He says the Government and CFA advice is that Melbourne residents who own properties in bushfire-prone areas should hire contractors to clear the properties, but he says this is not always an easy option for people due to the cost.</p><p>\"What we are disappointed about this year is that we're coming up to the Melbourne Cup weekend [on October 31], which is the one\u00a0big clean-up weekend when people come down,\" he explains.</p><p>\"Whether they're going to be able to do it this year remains to be seen.\"</p><p>Cr Revell acknowledges the Government has to carefully balance the risk of Melburnians unwittingly taking the virus into regional areas against the hazard posed by properties left underprepared for the bushfire season.</p><p>\"But we remain concerned, given the propensity for significant loss in regions like Anglesea, Aireys Inlet and our coastal towns,\" he says.</p><p>While Cr Revell is keen to see a plan laid out to help property owners prepare as soon as possible, he says the La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern forecast for this summer should mean a delayed start to the bushfire</p><h>Connecting with CFA brigades is also an essential bushfire preparation, former fire chief says</h><p>Ewan Waller, who is a former chief officer with Forest Fire Management Victoria, says some parts of his community in East Gippsland are very dry after months with little rain, and notes Bairnsdale saw a nuisance fire over the weekend.</p><p>He says now is the time to prepare for summer.</p><p>\"Spring can turn very quickly, we get hot drying winds and you can go from OK to not OK very quickly,\" he

In case you get this letter, you probably know why. I took my chance and failed.\" Along with a brief will and testament declaring his mother his sole beneficiary, the letter would be Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz's final recorded word.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Seven days later the 27-year-old exiled German author boarded the MV Abosso bound for Britain. Two months into the journey, on October 30 - so grippingly close to safe harbour - the boat would be torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat in the Atlantic. Boschwitz, with his revised 1939 novel Der Reisende (The Traveller) reportedly strapped to his body, would perish along with 361 others, his body never recovered.</p><p>Interred as a prisoner of war in Australia, Boschwitz had been delaying his return to Europe after being reclassified a refugee, wary of being drafted by the Allies into a war against his own countrymen. A German of both Jewish and Protestant ancestry, he had fled Berlin with his mother Martha in 1935 trailing the Jewish intelligentsia to Scandinavia, as Nazi pugnacity towards Germany's Jewish population rapidly decayed from enmity to unmitigated brutality.</p><p>Despite his young age and the existential tumult of abandoning his family's life and significant fortune in Berlin, Boschwitz completed and published his first novel, Menschen neben dem Leben (People Parallel To Life), in 1937 under the anglicised pen name John Grane, before continuing his restive migration through Paris, Luxembourg and Belgium. Here, he would complete his second novel in just a matter of weeks: an urgent response to the November 1938 pogroms in the Reich. First released in Sweden, The Traveller would be published in the UK and US respectively as The Fugitive and The Man Who Took Trains.</p><p>Set in Germany in the immediate aftermath of Kristallnacht, the novel - which traces the travails of a wealthy Jewish businessman trying to dodge capture - received mixed reviews on publication, with The Times Literary Supplement dismissing the novel as unrealistic as well as \"inconclusive, allusive \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 characteristic of immature writing\". The Glasgow Herald would prove more receptive, writing: \"With dreadful clarity Mr Grane presents the spectacle of a civilised man travelling round and round Germany like a beast encircled by a forest fire \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" In a world now all-consumed with war, the book would vanish into the cinders of Europe's burning cities.</p><p>Boschwitz himself recognised the novel's faults - its cumbrous dialogue and frustrating narrative progress - but also understood its edifying potential. With war now declared in Europe he absconded to the UK seeking asylum, only to be arrested and interred as an enemy alien in June 1940. Two months later he would be marched onto an overcrowded ship alongside Italian fascists and Nazi POWs, believing he was destined for Canada. Sailing through nauseating Atlantic swell, the ship made a sudden pivot south, traversed its way around the Horn of Africa and trained its bow towards the distant continent of Australia.</p><p>The Jewish prisoners aboard - composed of many notable philosophers, scientists and artists - would become endearingly known as the Dunera Boys. Winston Churchill would later call their grievous treatment on the Dunera and remote exile as POWs \"a deplorable mistake\". Boschwitz would reportedly be robbed by British soldiers on the arduous journey and have a manuscript tossed overboard.</p><p>While in Australia, first interred at Hay in NSW and later in Tatura, Boschwitz drafted two new novels and wholly revised The Traveller in the hope of finally having it released in Germany. By mid-1942 most of the 2542 Dunera Boys - including Sigmund Freud's grandson Walter - had either returned to Europe to join the Allied war effort or been released into the community in Australia, where many went on to become prominent members of Australian society, including decorated athletics coach Franz Stampfl and physicist Hans Adolf Buchdahl.</p><p>Prior to his own departure Boschwitz wrote his final letter to his mother, extolling The Traveller: \"I really believe there is something in this book, which may make it a success\". In the event of his death he implored her to continue the campaign to have the novel released in what he hoped to be a newly liberated Germany, adding that he had sent a partial redraft ahead with a fellow intern. He boarded the MV Abosso with his own copy. Neither manuscript has ever been recovered.</p><p>In 2015 Berlin-based publisher Peter Graf received an email from Israel. As a publisher with a reputation for rehabilitating long-forgotten works of German literature - including Blood Brothers by Ernst Haffner, which traverses the gritty underworld of Berlin in the 1930s - the correspondent, Reuella Shachaf, enquired as to whether Graf was aware of the novel, The Traveller, authored by her late uncle Ulrich Boschwitz. The original unedited 1938 manuscript, she informed him, was kept in the German Exile Archive in Frankfurt. Intrigued, Graf travelled west to Germany's financial capital.</p><p>\"I was curious about this text, but had no particular expectations,\" Graf explains to Review from his home in Berlin. The pages were jaundiced with time, but the text still legible. \"When I read it, I was quickly aware that it was a significant but unrevised novel. It is a cruel book and for that very reason a manifesto of humanity, a reminder and a gift to us. And the way it is written, stylistically and dramaturgically, is very remarkable, especially when you know that the author was 23 years old when the work was written.\" Graf began trawling what little archival material there was on Boschwitz, mostly a small cache of papers housed at the Centre For Jewish History in New York, including the final letter to his mother. Here he learned of Boschwitz's last wishes, to have the work edited and released in German, and resolved to complete the task with the blessing from the extended family in Israel. Released in 2019 into a radically different Germany to that in which it was cast, the edited novel would be proclaimed by German critics as \"one of the most important books of the year\" and \"an incredibly gripping rediscovery\". Multiple translations ensued (20 to date), with the revised edition now available in English, resurrected as The Passenger, translated by Philip Boehm and published locally by Allen &amp; Unwin.</p><p>The novel traces the frenetic footsteps of Otto Silbermann, a Bourgeois Jewish scrap metal dealer in Berlin. Amidst the clang of Kristallnacht he calmly goes about his business, certain in his social stature until there comes a fateful knock at the door: \"Open up, Jew, open up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" So begins a desperate, anxious and often tragicomic attempt to elude what we now know to be such a dystopian endgame.</p><p>The earliest known novel penned in direct response to Kristallnacht and the subsequent pogroms, The Passenger is less a comment on the rise of the Nazis than a documentary of the degradation of human dignity. As Nazi oppression begins to choke, Silbermann's longtime friends, fellow Great War veterans and business partners, sense their opportunity to fleece him of every last pfennig. He watches helplessly as German turns on German, Jew on Jew, in a hideous orgy of avarice and desperation.</p><p>Feeling somewhat invulnerable with a briefcase stuffed with Deutsche marks and a discernibly Aryan complexion, Silbermann haplessly sets off for Hamburg by train: commencing an equally farcical and desperate flight that hightails through Germany, as he tries to evade the spectre of both opprobrium and oppression. The novel would channel the author's own flight from Berlin as well as the conundrum of his own mixed ancestry. As Boschwitz's Australian Military Forces prisoner of war file would coolly record: Protestant, dark blonde hair, blue eyes.</p><p>Written two years before the Wannsee Conference, The Passenger captures the nascent absurdity of the political dehumanisation of the Jewish population. Attempting to mollify Silbermann about his newly acquired pariah status, one Aryan colleague consoles: \"A lot of bad things happen in the world. And some good things as well. Today it's this person, tomorrow that one \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 That's the way it is.\" Silbermann fossicks for empathy with his tormentors, even feeling compunctious for thrashing one particularly witless Nazi in six consecutive games of chess.</p><p>\"Did you notice,\" a fellow passenger comments, ignorant to Silbermann's Jewishness, \"that the whole first class is full of Jews. Half of Israel is on tour.\" He bides his time drinking beer and taking long lunches of roasted goose leg in train-station restaurants, perversely reading trashy paperback murder mysteries to take his mind off his own existential calamity. Purchasing a ticket to Munich he muses: \"At least I'll get to know Germany.\" In the shadow of history's inexpungible scar of the Holocaust, Silbermann's indifference to his situation can prove frustrating. But we only need to look to the recent storming of the US Capitol to understand how rapidly the wholly inconceivable can become tenable.</p><p>\"This novel, which is over 80 years old, now comes to the surface like a message in a bottle and is read at a time when flight and expulsion are taking place worldwide, with the same mechanisms as then,\" Graf suggests. \"Human dramas take place every day under the eyes of the world public, but most of them remain nameless.\" Despite the increasingly desperate situation, the married Silbermann (his wife a Protestant, and safe from harm) schemes an illicit rendezvous with a much younger Aryan woman he meets on a train, who sardonically notes the inconvenience of having German aesthetics but \"not a very fortunate\" surname. \"I'm completely at the mercy of chance,\" Silbermann resolves. \"It's almost as though the subject has become the object.\" As he moves across Germany, he desperately tries to avoid fraternising with Jewish colleagues who might betray his \"ethnic curse\". In one darkly comic yet deeply disturbing scene, sensing a fellow sufferer's fatalistic acceptance of his destiny due to the size of his nose, Silbermann attempts to cheer him up by complimenting the gentleman on his business acumen: \"You'll even manage to make money off the rope they hang you with\".</p><p>The man responds mirthfully: \"I should hope so \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Otherwise how would my wife be able to pay for her widow's veil?\" The situation quickly degenerates and the trenchant wisecracks peel away as Silbermann faces up to the wretchedness of his people's persecution. The colour bleeds from the endless rolling landscape into monochrome beyond the glass of the train window, as does his command over his own identity. \"They'll slowly undress us first and then kill us, so our clothes won't get bloody and our banknotes won't get damaged.\" \"A good minority is still better than a bad majority,\" Boschwitz would write all too optimistically from his long exile. His premature death would extricate him from ever knowing how this nascent campaign of oppression against his people would turn so macabre. Eight decades on, The Passenger remains terrifyingly prescient.</p><p>The Passenger by Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz is published by Pushkin Press ($27.99, pp256).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-f53fb452daf611eb80cb4c7fb80f50459bee7d18720422cc185bf7de49eb26ef</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63C2-BFS1-JD3N-511D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 14, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UI0</classCode><className>LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D9R3</classCode><className>ETHNIC CONFLICTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DENE</classCode><className>POWS &amp; MIAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00099LS</classCode><className>JEWS &amp; JUDAISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001341</classCode><className>POLITICAL ASYLUM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N511130CC</classCode><className>BOOK PUBLISHING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX121</classCode><className>BERLIN, GERMANY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>GX454</classCode><className>GLASGOW, SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC314</classCode><className>BELGIUM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC375</classCode><className>LUXEMBOURG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC326</classCode><className>SWEDEN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Thus, there is a need to identify factors that may decrease shame among female survivors of adult rape. Self-compassion may be one such factor. The present study used path analysis in MPlus version 7.3 to examine the indirect effect of self-compassion on PTSD and depression via rape-related shame. We hypothesized that higher levels of self-compassion would be associated with lower levels of rape-related shame, which in turn would be associated with lower levels of PTSD and depression. College women (N = 305) who reported experiencing rape completed anonymous online surveys assessing rape, self-compassion, rape-related shame, PTSD, and depression. Consistent with our hypothesis, results indicated that self-compassion was negatively associated with assault-related shame, which in turn was positively associated with PTSD and depression. There was also a significant indirect effect of self-compassion on PTSD and depression via rape-related shame. Further, rape-related shame fully explained the relation between self-compassion and PTSD. Findings suggest that self-compassion may be an appropriate target to reduce rape-related shame and may subsequently facilitate reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rape, a common form of trauma experienced by women in the United States (Breiding et al., 2015), is associated with numerous adverse outcomes (Dworkin et al., 2017). Two especially common outcomes of experiencing rape are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. A review on the prevalence of mental health disorders among sexual assault survivors indicated that over half of survivors develop PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder (Campbell et al., 2009). Sexual assault survivors are more vulnerable to PTSD and depression compared to survivors of other types of trauma and individuals who did not experience trauma (Kelley et al., 2009; Zinzow et al., 2010, 2012). Shame may explain these high rates of distress among sexual assault survivors (Scheff, 2003, p. 239; Wilson et al., 2006). Given the prominent role of shame in the development and maintenance of PTSD and depression among sexual assault survivors (Feiring et al., 1998), it is important to identify factors that are associated with shame. One such factor could be self-compassion. The purpose of this study is to examine whether self-compassion is associated with lower levels of PTSD and depression symptoms via lower levels of rape-related shame in a sample of women who experienced rape. Before we investigate these relations, we must first understand what shame is and why it is relevant to rape survivors.</p><p/><h>The Relevance of Shame</h><p>Shame is known to be a ubiquitous response to sexual assault (Vidal &amp; Petrak, 2007). Lewis (1987, pp. 15-18) defined shame as \u201cone\u2019s own vicarious experience of the other\u2019s scorn\u2026shame may also be played out as an internal colloquy, in which the whole self is condemned.\u201d From this definition, shame is viewed as an intensely aversive emotion where the whole self is seen as flawed and debased and therefore, unworthy of acceptance and belonging (Brown, 2006). Shame is both a self-conscious and a social emotion (Hareli &amp; Parkinson, 2008), experienced in the context of relationships with other individuals, institutions, and broader societal norms. More specifically, shame evolves within a person when they anticipate, infer, or experience negative judgement and rejection from other individuals, institutions, and/or anticipate judgment based upon societal norms. These negative introjects then lead to self-rejection and self-judgement. This social and internalized nature of shame drives its prominence for sexual assault survivors.</p><p>Recovery from sexual assault is embedded in a multilevel context where sexual victimization is a highly stigmatized experience (Kennedy &amp; Prock, 2018). Societal beliefs and rape myths that hold the survivors responsible, either completely or in part, for the assault feed into the stigmatized nature of sexual assault (Edwards et al., 2011; Moor &amp; Farchi, 2011). Survivors are immersed in this context before, during, and after the assault. These blaming messages are communicated to them through media representations, dominant narratives, and stereotypes. They are also directly communicated to survivors after the assault in the form of unsupportive responses to assault disclosure (Ahrens, 2006; Ahrens et al., 2010). As a result of being embedded in this blaming cultural context, survivors internalize stigma and blame, and begin blaming themselves for the violence inflicted upon then. This internalized stigma and blame feeds into shame, which in turn leads to PTSD and depression (Bhuptani &amp; Messman-Moore, 2019). As a result of elevated shame, sexual assault survivors may engage in self-criticism ( Harman &amp; Lee, 2010), start isolating themselves from their sources of support or feel abandoned (Jacques-Tiura et al., 2010), engage in rumination (Conway et al., 2004), or feel overwhelmed by their emotional pain, all of which are pathways to distress.</p><h>The Relevance of Self-compassion</h><p>Kristen Neff (2003b, p. 22), a pioneer in investigating self-compassion, defines it as \u201can open-hearted way of relating to the negative aspects of oneself and one\u2019s experience that enables greater emotional resilience and psychological well-being.\u201d In other words, it is a caring and compassionate stance that one takes toward the self, especially during difficult times. It is conceptualized as a trait entailing three opposite facets: self-kindness versus self-criticism, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus overidentification (Neff, 2003a). Self-kindness involves the tendency to be caring and understanding in the context of difficulties, in contrast to condemning or criticizing oneself. Common humanity reflects the ability to recognize our experiences and struggles as an inherently universal aspect of the human experience, in contrast to feeling isolated upon perceiving one\u2019s struggles as unusual or uncommon. Finally, mindfulness is one aspect of self-compassion which involves being aware of one\u2019s negative thoughts and emotions without being consumed by them.</p><p>Growing evidence suggests that self-compassion is positively related to well-being and adaptive psychological functioning. Higher levels of self-compassion are associated with greater life satisfaction, optimism, and well-being (Barnard &amp; Curry, 2011; Neff, 2012). In contrast, lower levels of self-compassion are associated with higher levels of pessimistic thinking, rumination, and fear of failure. Further, self-compassion has shown to be negatively related to more severe psychopathology such as depression and anxiety in both nonclinical and clinical samples (Krieger et al., 2013; Neff, 2003a). The most robust findings come from a meta-analysis that reported moderate overall effect sizes for the relation between self-compassion and depressive symptoms (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> = \u2013.52) and anxiety symptoms (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> = \u2013.51; MacBeth &amp; Gumley, 2012).</p><p>In addition to its relation with depression, self-compassion has also been linked to PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed individuals. A cross-sectional study with a community sample found that self-compassion was associated with overall PTSD severity and individual symptoms (re-experiencing, hyperarousal, avoidance, and dysphoria; Maheux &amp; Price, 2015) as well as mediated the relation between social support and PTSD (and depression) symptoms (Maheux &amp; Price, 2016). These findings are corroborated by evidence from longitudinal research that supports the role of self-compassion in PTSD. A study with youth exposed to a potentially traumatic forest fire found that higher self-compassion at one-month postexposure predicted fewer PTSD and depression symptoms at three- and six-month postexposure (Zeller et al., 2015). In a study with combat veterans, low self-compassion predicted higher PTSD severity over 12 months, even after controlling for combat exposure and baseline PTSD severity, emphasizing the longstanding negative impact of low self-compassion (Hiraoka et al., 2015). Along this vein, two different pilot studies have tested the effectiveness of self-compassion interventions for treating PTSD among combat veterans. Both studies found that these interventions led to reductions in PTSD (Kearney et al., 2013) and depression symptoms (Serpa et al., 2020) over 8-12-week period.</p><p>Other studies provide a more nuanced picture of the relation between self-compassion and PTSD symptoms. These two cross-sectional studies used college samples. One study found that self-compassion was associated with only the avoidance symptom cluster of PTSD, and not with other symptom clusters (Thompson &amp; Waltz, 2008). Another study found that self-compassion was not associated with individual PTSD symptom clusters after controlling for psychological inflexibility (Seligowski et al., 2015). Overall, this body of evidence suggests that higher levels of self-compassion are associated with lower levels of PTSD and depression symptoms among trauma-exposed individuals. However, it is important to note that the aforementioned studies which investigated correlates of self-compassion (Seligowski et al., 2015) as well as effectiveness of self-compassion interventions (Kearney et al., 2013), did not examine how such factors may be related to rape. Moreover, previous studies do not identify mechanisms that explain how self-compassion can ameliorate distress. One potential mechanism may be shame.</p><h>The Impact of Self-compassion on Shame</h><p>Self-compassion is highly relevant to rape and sexual assault survivors for two main reasons: its overlap with common processes that occur during assault recovery (e.g., isolation) and its impact on shame. Each of the three opposite components of self-compassion can mitigate existing feelings of shame among rape survivors. The first component of self-compassion is self-kindness (vs. self-criticism). Given that high levels of self-criticism are directly linked to the process of internal shaming (Gilbert, 2005, 2007), self-kindness may directly ameliorate shame by offering care and understanding toward the self. This ability to be kind, warm, and understanding toward oneself, especially in the context of perceived failure, can lead to significant reductions in shame (Gilbert &amp; Procter, 2006). The second component of self-compassion is common humanity (vs. isolation), which involves adopting a broader, contextual view of one\u2019s struggles and negative experiences within the realm of universal human experience. People who experience or acknowledge common humanity can imagine that many other people would have made similar behavioral choices and that this negative event could have happened to anyone when faced with negative events (Terry &amp; Leary, 2011). This element of self-compassion can help reduce feelings of shame by allowing individuals to focus less on how they were uniquely to blame for what happened to them. The final element of self-compassion is mindfulness (vs. overidentification), which is negatively associated with shame (Goldsmith et al., 2014a). Mindfulness reduces shame by enabling trauma survivors to be open to negative affect and experiences without self-judgment (Follette et al., 2006).</p><p>Given that individual components of self-compassion are theoretically linked with shame, preliminary research has started documenting associations between self-compassion and shame among various populations. Most of this research focuses on women with eating disorders, which indicates self-compassion is negatively associated with shame in this population (Ferreira et al., 2013, 2014). Only three studies have examined this association beyond bivariate levels. A treatment study found that individuals who demonstrated greater increases in their level of self-compassion also reported faster decreases in their feelings of shame over 12 weeks, even when controlling for their early change in eating disorder symptoms (Kelly et al., 2014). In another study, shame mediated the relation between self-compassion and psychosocial outcomes among individuals with HIV (Williams et al., 2019). The remaining study found that self-compassion and shame serially mediated the relation between childhood maltreatment and depression such that childhood maltreatment was associated with lower self-compassion, which was associated with higher shame (Ross et al., 2019). These high levels of shame were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Only one study (Ross et al., 2019) to our knowledge has examined the relation between self-compassion and shame among trauma-exposed individuals. Given how these constructs play an important role in recovery from rape (Follette et al., 2006), it would seem germane to empirically investigate the relevance of this construct among survivors of rape.</p><h>Present Study</h><p>Survivors of rape and sexual assault experience higher rates of distress compared to survivors of other types of trauma (Zinzow et al., 2010, 2012). Shame is one factor that explains these high rates of distress (Amstadter &amp; Vernon, 2008; Feiring et al., 1998). Additionally, self-compassion and shame are negatively associated with one another (e.g., Ferreira et al., 2014), and shame mediates the relation between self-compassion and psychosocial outcomes (Williams et al., 2019). Further, self-compassion interventionsare effective for reducing PTSD and depression symptoms among trauma-exposed individuals (Kearney et al., 2013). However, the role of self-compassion and its relation to shame among rape survivors has not been examined. Given this significant gap in literature, the aim of this study was to examine the indirect relation of self-compassion to depressive and PTSD symptoms through rape-related shame among women who had experienced rape. We hypothesized that high levels of self-compassion would be associated with low levels of rape-related shame, which in turn would be associated with lower levels of PTSD and depression symptoms.</p><h>Method</h><h>Participants</h><p>The initial sample consisted of 1,479 female undergraduates at a midsized public university in the Midwestern United States, participating in a study examining shame responses amongst those who have experienced trauma. The final sample included only women who reported an experience of rape after the age of 14, 20.6% (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 305) of the overall sample. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 22 years (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">M =</emphasis> 18.84, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SD</emphasis> = .95). The majority of participants self-identified as White (91.5%), with 3.9% identifying as Asian, 3.6% identifying as Black, 2% as Biracial (2%), 1% as Native American, 1% as Pacific Islander, and 1% as another racial/ethnic background (1%). Additionally, a small portion of the sample (5.6%) identified as Latina/Hispanic. The majority were from upper-middle class households based upon reported family household incomes.</p><h>Procedures</h><p>Participants were recruited from a research participant pool (for Introduction to Psychology), and earned research credit for study completion. Informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study. All participants met in the laboratory for informed consent/study instructions, but completed the online surveys outside the laboratory. No adverse effects from participating in the study were reported.</p><h>Measures</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rape and related variables.</emphasis> The modified Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) (Messman-Moore &amp; Long, 2000; Messman-Moore et al., 2010) was used to assess rape after age 14. The measure includes a series of yes/no questions assessing specific types of attempted and completed unwanted sexual activities (ranging from kissing to fondling to penetration). For each unwanted activity, follow-up questions assessed the frequency and methods of coercion involved. Rape was defined as completed oral-genital contact or vaginal/anal penetration due to the inability to consent because of substance impairment (alcohol or drugs) or the use or threat of use of physical force</p><p>If a participant reported an unwanted sexual act, she was directed to answer additional follow-up questions about her most distressing experience. Additional details regarding the most distressing unwanted sexual experience were collected, including: type of unwanted sexual act(s), method of coercion used (e.g., force, threats of force), identity of the perpetrator (e.g., acquaintance, romantic partner, etc.), time since assault, and level of intoxication/impairment of the survivor. This information was utilized to identify experiences of rape as defined above.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Self-compassion.</emphasis> Self-compassion was assessed with the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003a), a 26-item questionnaire with six subscales which assesses positive (self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness) and negative self-compassion facets (self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification). Example items include \u201cI try to be loving towards myself when I\u2019m feeling emotional pain,\u201d (self-kindness) or \u201cWhen I\u2019m feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that\u2019s wrong\u201d (overidentification). Response options on Likert scale range from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Items in the negative subscale scores were reverse scored. Item responses were summed and a mean score was calculated. Higher mean scores indicated higher levels of self-compassion. The SCS has good reliability and validity (Neff, 2003a). In the current sample, internal consistency for total scale was good (\u03b1 = .90).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rape-related shame.</emphasis> Questions assessing rape-related shame was asked in relation to the most distressing rape experience. The Trauma-Related Shame Inventory (\u00d8ktedalen et al., 2014) was used to assess rape-related shame. It is a 24-item self-report questionnaire where participants respond on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not true of me) to 4 (completely true of me). An example item on this scale is \u201cIf others knew what happened to me, they would view me as inferior.\u201d Item responses were added to obtain a total score and higher total scores indicated greater levels of shame. The scale demonstrated excellent internal consistency in the current sample (\u03b1 = .97).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Psychological distress.</emphasis> The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) was used to assess PTSD symptoms in the past month. The PCL-5 is a 22-item self-report measure where participants respond on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = \u201cnot at all\u201d to 4 = \u201cextremely\u201d). The depression subscale from the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995) was used to assess depression symptoms in the past week. The DASS-21 is a 7-item self-report measure where participant respond on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = \u201cdid not apply to me at all\u201d to 3 = \u201capplied to me very much or most of the time\u201d). Higher scores on both measures indicate higher levels of distress. Internal reliability for both the PCL-5 (\u03b1 = .95) and the DASS-21 depression subscale (\u03b1 = .91) were good.</p><h>Data Analysis Plan</h><p>Data were examined for normality, completeness, and the presence of outliers or impossible values. Bivariate correlations were computed to examine general patterns of association and identify covariates. Path analysis using the Maximum Likelihood estimation method in MPlus version 7.3 tested one mediation model. Given the overlap between the distinct forms of psychological distress, error variances for the two dependent variables (depression and PTSD symptoms) were correlated. We tested the hypothesized indirect effect of self-compassion on PTSD and depression symptoms via rape-related shame, in addition to focusing on individual pathways, consistent with current recommendations (Hayes, 2013). Specifically, we tested the overall indirect effect for the model (i.e., self-compassion \u2193 rape-related shame \u2193 PTSD [and depression symptoms]) and used bootstrapping techniques to construct confidence intervals around the indirect effects (Hayes, 2013; Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004; Figure 1).</p><h>Results</h><h>Skewness, Kurtosis, and Missing Data</h><p>The skewness and kurtosis of continuous variables were examined. All continuous variables were normally distributed and had a skewness value less than the absolute value of 2 (\u2013.12 to 1.58) and a kurtosis value less than the absolute value of 2 (.08 to 1.97). Missing Value Analysis (MVA) in SPSS revealed values ranging from 1% to 3.6% across key study variables (i.e., self-compassion subscales, depression, etc.). Little\u2019s MCAR test indicated data were not significantly different from the missing completely at random pattern, \u03c72 = 1218.52, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">df</emphasis> = 1,228, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = .57 (Little, 1988). Given this, single imputation using the Expectation Maximization algorithm was used following current guidelines for managing less than 8% item-level missing data (Widaman, 2006).</p><h>Descriptive Statistics and Bivariate Associations</h><p>Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations between key study variables are presented in Table 1. Most rape characteristics (i.e., time since rape, survivor\u2019s level of intoxication, and perpetrator type) and demographic variables (i.e., age and race) were not associated with PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms. However, survivor\u2019s levels of unconsciousness during rape was significantly associated with depression. Hence, it was included as a covariate. Bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between all primary variables of interest.

The modal timing of the index rape was between one to two years ago. Most women were raped by a known perpetrator (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 265, 86.9%). Over half of the perpetrators (51.8%, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 158) were known to participants in a romantic context (e.g., current or past romantic partner, casual date) or other sexual encounter (e.g., a new partner outside an established romantic relationship), and 35.1% of perpetrators (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 105) were known to participants in a nonromantic context (e.g., friend, classmate, coworker, boss, acquaintance). Approximately one third (29.4% <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 91) of the women reported the perpetrator used threats or physical force (or a weapon) during the rape, 49.8% (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 152) reported substance-related coercion, and the rest (20.3%, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 62) reported the presence of both threat or force and substance-related coercion during the rape. Nearly half of the participants (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 145, 47.5%) endorsed elevated depressive symptoms on the DASS-21 (i.e., scores \u226510, classified as mild through extremely severe; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995). Although there is no definitive cutoff score for the PCL-5 (as indicative of a PTSD diagnosis), the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (2015) suggests a cutoff score of 31 until further psychometric data are available. Nearly one-quarter of the women (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 70, 23%) met this cutoff criterion.</p><h>Path Analysis</h><p>Model fit statistics of the parallel mediation model (Figure 1) suggested that model fit was good.

Other indices also indicated a good fit, CFI = .99, TLI = .95, SRMR = .04, and RMSEA = .07. Next, we will discuss individual pathways and then examine the total, direct, and indirect effects.</p><h>Figure 1.</h><h>Mediation model examining the relation of self-compassion on PTSD and depression symptoms through rape-related shame.</h><p>A mediation model, estimated with 10,000 bootstrap samples, was tested to examine the indirect effect of self-compassion on PTSD and depression symptoms via rape-related shame (Figure 1). Given that both PTSD and depression are distinct forms of psychological distress that share overlap, the error variances of both variables were correlated with each other. When examining individual pathways, self-compassion was negatively associated with rape-related shame such that higher levels of self-compassion were related with lower levels of rape-related shame. Rape-related shame, in turn, was positively associated with both PTSD symptoms and depression symptoms, over and above self-compassion, such that lower rape-related shame was related to lower levels of PTSD and depression symptoms.</p><p>The total effects of self-compassion on PTSD symptoms and depression symptoms were significant. However, the direct effect of self-compassion was significant only for depression symptoms, such that higher self-compassion was associated with lower depression symptoms, after shame was included. Self-compassion was not related to PTSD symptoms after rape-related shame was included in the model. Lastly, the indirect effects of self-compassion on PTSD symptoms (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">b</emphasis> = \u20135.43, SE = 1.06, 95% CI [\u20137.64, \u20133.46]) and depression symptoms (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">b</emphasis> = \u20131.37, SE = 0.38, 95% CI [\u20132.26, \u20130.72]) were significant as the confidence interval around the indirect effect did not contain zero. This suggests that higher self-compassion is associated with lower rape-related shame, which in turn, is related to lower levels of PTSD and depression symptoms.</p><h>Discussion</h><p>We investigated whether self-compassion was associated with shame, PTSD and depressive symptoms among women who experienced rape. We found that higher levels of self-compassion were associated with lower levels of rape-related shame, which in turn was associated with lower PTSD and depression symptoms, consistent with our hypotheses and the previous literature (Ross et al., 2019). Further, rape-related shame completely explained the relation between self-compassion and PTSD. This pattern of results in consistent with findings from previous studies where emotion regulation (Scoglio et al., 2018) and experiential avoidance (Seligowski et al., 2015) explained the relation between self-compassion and PTSD. However, these two former studies did not assess for rape, a stigmatized experience, and hence, overlooked the role shame plays in predicting PTSD post-rape. However, these results, in combination with our findings, illustrate the far-reaching benefits of improving self-compassion. Practicing self-compassion not only reduces shame but also fosters improved emotion regulation and decreased experiential avoidance, both of which are also known as powerful predictors of psychopathology (for review see Chawla &amp; Ostafin, 2007; Messman-Moore &amp; Bhuptani, 2017).</p><p>The association between self-compassion, shame, PTSD, and depression highlights the importance of reducing self-compassion and shame among rape survivors to reduce PTSD and depression. A growing body of literature has examined self-compassion as a treatment for PTSD and depression among trauma survivors. For example, the Warrior Renew treatment (Katz, 2014) aims at improving self-compassion among survivors of military sexual trauma via perspective taking, cognitive reframing, and imaginal reprocessing (Katz, 2016). Imaginal reprocessing involves having clients imagine interacting with and extending compassion toward their younger self (e.g., hugging the younger self and saying words such as \u201cYou\u2019re safe now,\u201d \u201cIt was not your fault,\u201d \u201cI love you,\u201d \u201cI will protect you,\u201d \u201cYou are important and your needs matter,\u201d etc.). This treatment has been associated with decreased PTSD and depression symptoms among survivors of sexual assault (Katz, 2016; Katz et al., 2008), and compared favorably to empirically supported treatments such as Prolonged Exposure (Katz et al., 2014) and Cognitive Processing (Basharpoor et al., 2013).</p><p>Along this vein, another treatment study for PTSD demonstrated benefits of cultivating self-compassion (Hoffart et al., 2015). Participants were provided with either standard prolonged exposure, which includes imaginal exposure to the traumatic memory, or modified prolonged exposure that included imagery rescripting of the memory replaced exposure, with participants instructed to cultivate compassion toward their traumatized self (e.g., by holding or hugging themselves). Imaginal rescripting led to a decrease in self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification, as well as increases in self-kindness. In turn, these aspects of self-compassion were positively associated with the process of therapeutic change. Similarly, loving-kindness meditation was associated with reduced symptoms of PTSD and depression via enhanced self-compassion among veterans in a pilot study (Kearney et al., 2013). Taken together, studies of these three treatments (Hoffart et al., 2015; Katz, 2016; Kearney et al., 2013) suggest self-compassion is a factor in recovery from PTSD and depression. However, none of these studies examined intermediary factors that may explain how self-compassion reduces PTSD and depression symptoms. Our results add to this body of literature and suggest that shame may explain the relation between increased self-compassion and reduced distress symptoms.</p><p>Shame among sexual assault survivors does not develop in a vacuum. Rather, it emerges from victim-blaming messages that are entrenched in media representations, dominant narratives, stereotypes, or unsupportive responses to assault disclosure (Ahrens, 2006; Ahrens et al., 2010). Survivors of sexual assault may internalize these messages and engage in self-blame. Self-blame has been known to exacerbate shame among survivors and led to PTSD and depression (Alix et al., 2017; Zinzow &amp; Thompson, 2011). Given the close relationship between blame and shame, one can expect that improvements in self-compassion would reduce self-blame as well. Indeed, higher self-compassion is associated with lower levels of self-blame, which in turn is associated with lower levels of PTSD and depression among female survivors of sexual assault (Hamrick &amp; Owens, 2019). While it was beyond the scope of this study, future studies should empirically investigate whether self-compassion would have an equal impact both self-blame and shame when considered together</p><h>Limitations and Future Directions</h><p>The current study supports the important role of self-compassion in relation to assault-related shame, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Yet, these findings must be tempered by study limitations. Most notably, the retrospective, cross-sectional design limits conclusions regarding the directionality of effects as well as the causal nature of relations found. It may be possible that decreased PTSD or depression symptoms lead to improved self-compassion via decreased shame, instead of the other way around. There is longitudinal evidence that self-compassion predicts PTSD and depression (Zeller et al., 2015), whereas there is no such evidence that PTSD or depression predict self-compassion. Thus, we have increased confidence in our results. However, future studies could investigate the temporal and causal relations among PTSD or depression, shame, and self-compassion over time. It is likely that variables are associated via reciprocal processes where increases in self-compassion would lead to decreases in depression PTSD symptoms, which then would lead to further improvements in self-compassion. In addition, the current design and assessment limits our ability to capture the enduring and dynamic nature of shame and its potential cyclical impact on distress. To truly understand the relation among these variables, longitudinal studies with more than two time points are needed. Such studies may increase confidence in the findings of the studies and may also assist in teasing apart the nature of relation among these constructs.</p><p>Generalization of the current findings are limited given the homogenous nature of our sample. Notably, the study sample was predominantly white, cisgender college females which precludes examination of how age, race, gender, ethnicity, educational status, and other relevant demographics may impact the variables of interests as well as relations between them. Given how research on trauma has overlooked the impact of intersecting identities on recovery (Bryant-Davis, 2019), it is vital to determine how they affect self-compassion and shame. Preliminary research suggests that levels of self-compassion are higher amongst female African American college students when compared to female European American (Miron et al., 2014). Meanwhile, another study among multiracial South Africans noted that individuals identifying with white Afrikaans culture reported experiencing less shame compared to black, colored, or Indian Afrikaan cultures (Mayer &amp; Viviers, 2017). Further, a qualitative study found that sexual minority adolescents of color view their sexual identity through the lens of their racial identity, which may exacerbate shame (Flores &amp; Davalos, 2019). While the literature on how diverse identities influence shame and self-compassion is still nascent, different factors (e.g., minority stressors, religiosity) may impact how self-compassion and shame operate differently across different populations (Messman-Moore &amp; Bhuptani, 2017). In conclusion, our results suggest that self-compassion has an indirect effect on PTSD and depression via assault-related shame, among women who have experienced rape. More studies are needed to establish causality among these variables and examine how other demographic factors impact these relations.</p><h>Implications</h><p>A large body of research indicates that shame is a powerful predictor of a more persistent, or long-lasting course of PTSD and depression (Andrews et al., 2002; Feiring &amp; Taska, 2005). Since improvements in shame drive improvements in PTSD and depression (Goldsmith et al., 2014a; Judge et al., 2012), it is important that clinicians develop methods to address shame when it arises in the therapy room. Extant interventions for assault-related PTSD, including cognitive processing therapy (CPT; Resick et al., 2008) and skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation with prolonged exposure (STAIR; Cloitre et al., 2011) focus on reducing shame by addressing maladaptive cognitions and dysfunctional schemas. Our results suggest that improving self-compassion may be another approach to reduce shame among rape survivors by promoting self-kindness and mindfulness and decreasing isolation. Self-compassion promotes kindness and understanding toward oneself and encourages a more holistic view of where the blame for negative events truly lie. Further, self-compassion fosters a nonjudgmental awareness of negative emotions. These skills can directly counteract the painful and emotionally overwhelming effects of shame, which in turn leads to reduction in depression and PTSD symptoms.

In case you get this letter, you probably know why. I took my chance and failed.\" Along with a brief will and testament declaring his mother his sole beneficiary, the letter would be Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz's final recorded word.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Seven days later the 27-year-old exiled German author boarded the MV Abosso bound for Britain. Two months into the journey, on October 30 - so grippingly close to safe harbour - the boat would be torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat in the Atlantic. Boschwitz, with his revised 1939 novel Der Reisende (The Traveller) reportedly strapped to his body, would perish along with 361 others, his body never recovered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interred as a prisoner of war in Australia, Boschwitz had been delaying his return to Europe after being reclassified a refugee, wary of being drafted by the Allies into a war against his own countrymen. A German of both Jewish and Protestant ancestry, he had fled Berlin with his mother Martha in 1935 trailing the Jewish intelligentsia to Scandinavia, as Nazi pugnacity towards Germany's Jewish population rapidly decayed from enmity to unmitigated brutality.</p><p>Despite his young age and the existential tumult of abandoning his family's life and significant fortune in Berlin, Boschwitz completed and published his first novel, Menschen neben dem Leben (People Parallel To Life), in 1937 under the anglicised pen name John Grane, before continuing his restive migration through Paris, Luxembourg and Belgium. Here, he would complete his second novel in just a matter of weeks: an urgent response to the November 1938 pogroms in the Reich. First released in Sweden, The Traveller would be published in the UK and US respectively as The Fugitive and The Man Who Took Trains.</p><p>Set in Germany in the immediate aftermath of Kristallnacht, the novel - which traces the travails of a wealthy Jewish businessman trying to dodge capture - received mixed reviews on publication, with The Times Literary Supplement dismissing the novel as unrealistic as well as \"inconclusive, allusive ... characteristic of immature writing\". The Glasgow Herald would prove more receptive, writing: \"With dreadful clarity Mr Grane presents the spectacle of a civilised man travelling round and round Germany like a beast encircled by a forest fire ...\" In a world now all-consumed with war, the book would vanish into the cinders of Europe's burning cities.</p><p>Boschwitz himself recognised the novel's faults - its cumbrous dialogue and frustrating narrative progress - but also understood its edifying potential. With war now declared in Europe he absconded to the UK seeking asylum, only to be arrested and interred as an enemy alien in June 1940. Two months later he would be marched onto an overcrowded ship alongside Italian fascists and Nazi POWs, believing he was destined for Canada. Sailing through nauseating Atlantic swell, the ship made a sudden pivot south, traversed its way around the Horn of Africa and trained its bow towards the distant continent of Australia.</p><p>The Jewish prisoners aboard - composed of many notable philosophers, scientists and artists - would become endearingly known as the Dunera Boys. Winston Churchill would later call their grievous treatment on the Dunera and remote exile as POWs \"a deplorable mistake\". Boschwitz would reportedly be robbed by British soldiers on the arduous journey and have a manuscript tossed overboard.</p><p>While in Australia, first interred at Hay in NSW and later in Tatura, Boschwitz drafted two new novels and wholly revised The Traveller in the hope of finally having it released in Germany. By mid-1942 most of the 2542 Dunera Boys - including Sigmund Freud's grandson Walter - had either returned to Europe to join the Allied war effort or been released into the community in Australia, where many went on to become prominent members of Australian society, including decorated athletics coach Franz Stampfl and physicist Hans Adolf Buchdahl.</p><p>Prior to his own departure Boschwitz wrote his final letter to his mother, extolling The Traveller: \"I really believe there is something in this book, which may make it a success\". In the event of his death he implored her to continue the campaign to have the novel released in what he hoped to be a newly liberated Germany, adding that he had sent a partial redraft ahead with a fellow intern. He boarded the MV Abosso with his own copy. Neither manuscript has ever been recovered.</p><p>In 2015 Berlin-based publisher Peter Graf received an email from Israel. As a publisher with a reputation for rehabilitating long-forgotten works of German literature - including Blood Brothers by Ernst Haffner, which traverses the gritty underworld of Berlin in the 1930s - the correspondent, Reuella Shachaf, enquired as to whether Graf was aware of the novel, The Traveller, authored by her late uncle Ulrich Boschwitz. The original unedited 1938 manuscript, she informed him, was kept in the German Exile Archive in Frankfurt. Intrigued, Graf travelled west to Germany's financial capital.</p><p>\"I was curious about this text, but had no particular expectations,\" Graf explains to Review from his home in Berlin. The pages were jaundiced with time, but the text still legible. \"When I read it, I was quickly aware that it was a significant but unrevised novel. It is a cruel book and for that very reason a manifesto of humanity, a reminder and a gift to us. And the way it is written, stylistically and dramaturgically, is very remarkable, especially when you know that the author was 23 years old when the work was written.\"</p><p>Graf began trawling what little archival material there was on Boschwitz, mostly a small cache of papers housed at the Centre For Jewish History in New York, including the final letter to his mother. Here he learned of Boschwitz's last wishes, to have the work edited and released in German, and resolved to complete the task with the blessing from the extended family in Israel. Released in 2019 into a radically different Germany to that in which it was cast, the edited novel would be proclaimed by German critics as \"one of the most important books of the year\" and \"an incredibly gripping rediscovery\". Multiple translations ensued (20 to date), with the revised edition now available in English, resurrected as The Passenger, translated by Philip Boehm and published locally by Allen &amp; Unwin. </p><p>The novel traces the frenetic footsteps of Otto Silbermann, a Bourgeois Jewish scrap metal dealer in Berlin. Amidst the clang of Kristallnacht he calmly goes about his business, certain in his social stature until there comes a fateful knock at the door: \"Open up, Jew, open up ...\" So begins a desperate, anxious and often tragicomic attempt to elude what we now know to be such a dystopian endgame.</p><p>The earliest known novel penned in direct response to Kristallnacht and the subsequent pogroms, The Passenger is less a comment on the rise of the Nazis than a documentary of the degradation of human dignity. As Nazi oppression begins to choke, Silbermann's longtime friends, fellow Great War veterans and business partners, sense their opportunity to fleece him of every last pfennig. He watches helplessly as German turns on German, Jew on Jew, in a hideous orgy of avarice and desperation.</p><p>Feeling somewhat invulnerable with a briefcase stuffed with Deutsche marks and a discernibly Aryan complexion, Silbermann haplessly sets off for Hamburg by train: commencing an equally farcical and desperate flight that hightails through Germany, as he tries to evade the spectre of both opprobrium and oppression. The novel would channel the author's own flight from Berlin as well as the conundrum of his own mixed ancestry. As Boschwitz's Australian Military Forces prisoner of war file would coolly record: Protestant, dark blonde hair, blue eyes.</p><p>Written two years before the Wannsee Conference, The Passenger captures the nascent absurdity of the political dehumanisation of the Jewish population. Attempting to mollify Silbermann about his newly acquired pariah status, one Aryan colleague consoles: \"A lot of bad things happen in the world. And some good things as well. Today it's this person, tomorrow that one ... That's the way it is.\"</p><p>Silbermann fossicks for empathy with his tormentors, even feeling compunctious for thrashing one particularly witless Nazi in six consecutive games of chess. </p><p>\"Did you notice,\" a fellow passenger comments, ignorant to Silbermann's Jewishness, \"that the whole first class is full of Jews. Half of Israel is on tour.\"</p><p>He bides his time drinking beer and taking long lunches of roasted goose leg in train-station restaurants, perversely reading trashy paperback murder mysteries to take his mind off his own existential calamity. Purchasing a ticket to Munich he muses: \"At least I'll get to know Germany.\" </p><p>In the shadow of history's inexpungible scar of the Holocaust, Silbermann's indifference to his situation can prove frustrating. But we only need to look to the recent storming of the US Capitol to understand how rapidly the wholly inconceivable can become tenable.</p><p>\"This novel, which is over 80 years old, now comes to the surface like a message in a bottle and is read at a time when flight and expulsion are taking place worldwide, with the same mechanisms as then,\" Graf suggests. \"Human dramas take place every day under the eyes of the world public, but most of them remain nameless.\"</p><p>Despite the increasingly desperate situation, the married Silbermann (his wife a Protestant, and safe from harm) schemes an illicit rendezvous with a much younger Aryan woman he meets on a train, who sardonically notes the inconvenience of having German aesthetics but \"not a very fortunate\" surname. \"I'm completely at the mercy of chance,\" Silbermann resolves. \"It's almost as though the subject has become the object.\"</p><p>As he moves across Germany, he desperately tries to avoid fraternising with Jewish colleagues who might betray his \"ethnic curse\". In one darkly comic yet deeply disturbing scene, sensing a fellow sufferer's fatalistic acceptance of his destiny due to the size of his nose, Silbermann attempts to cheer him up by complimenting the gentleman on his business acumen: \"You'll even manage to make money off the rope they hang you with\". </p><p>The man responds mirthfully: \"I should hope so ... Otherwise how would my wife be able to pay for her widow's veil?\"</p><p>The situation quickly degenerates and the trenchant wisecracks peel away as Silbermann faces up to the wretchedness of his people's persecution. The colour bleeds from the endless rolling landscape into monochrome beyond the glass of the train window, as does his command over his own identity. \"They'll slowly undress us first and then kill us, so our clothes won't get bloody and our banknotes won't get damaged.\"</p><p>\"A good minority is still better than a bad majority,\" Boschwitz would write all too optimistically from his long exile. His premature death would extricate him from ever knowing how this nascent campaign of oppression against his people would turn so macabre. Eight decades on, The Passenger remains terrifyingly prescient. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He has floundered on social issues over the past few months.

The result one month ago was much closer: 43 to 21 per cent.</p><p>Labor is in dire trouble because the Coalition leads in areas where Labor has usually held the advantage. On jobs and wages, voters favour the Coalition over Labor by 37 to 30 per cent. On health and aged care, the gap is 34 to 29 per cent. On industrial relations it is 33 to 31 per cent.

Day by day, he has honed the message to be ready for the election.</p><p>And the Coalition went into campaign mode this week. Morrison went to Lilley in Brisbane for instance, held by Labor on a margin of just 0.64 per cent, and Dunkley in suburban Melbourne, held by Labor by 2.7 per cent.</p><p>The visits to Coalition seats also took Morrison to Deakin, Goldstein and La Trobe in Melbourne, Bass and Braddon in Tasmania and at least five seats in Queensland: Bonner, Brisbane, Flynn, Forde and Longman.</p><p>Morrison still strikes some observers, especially women, as too belligerent and arrogant at times. He has floundered on social issues over the past few months. Some expert observers, distant from Canberra but familiar with its ways, think he has been off his game since Brittany Higgins went public with her allegations of rape in Parliament House on February 15.</p><p>Now, with a budget to sell, Morrison is back on safer ground. Again, the Resolve Political Monitor shows why. When voters are asked about policy issues, they generally favour the Coalition as the better party to run the country.</p><p>Asked who is best to manage the COVID-19 situation, 46 per cent name the Coalition but only 20 per cent prefer Labor. The government's support is up from 42 per cent in the survey one month earlier.</p><p>On economic management, 46 per cent name the Coalition as best to manage the issue but only 20 per cent name Labor. The result one month ago was much closer: 43 to 21 per cent.</p><p>Labor is in dire trouble because the Coalition leads in areas where Labor has usually held the advantage. On jobs and wages, voters favour the Coalition over Labor by 37 to 30 per cent. On health and aged care, the gap is 34 to 29 per cent. On industrial relations it is 33 to 31 per cent. On education it is 34 to 30 per cent.</p><p>This is a different sort of budget bounce for a government. It is not the jump in primary vote that observers usually watch for.

It's a free country, he says. And he is right. The government is in no position to dictate this personal decision when more supplies from Pfizer and Moderna are due to arrive. But this is one area where Morrison's warnings about the pandemic could deliver a policy gain by convincing people to roll up their sleeves.</p><p>On borders, he is deliberately vague. The government suggests it will open the international borders in the middle of 2022. This is central to the federal budget, which is a policy document authored by ministers. But Morrison presents the date as merely an assumption.</p><p>On quarantine he is passive. He waits for state leaders to come to him with proposals and chooses some, such as the plan for a new facility in or near Melbourne, and rejects others, such as the sketchy proposal for Toowoomba. The last big federal initiative, to expand Howard Springs in the Northern Territory, was finalised in December. Morrison seeks to avoid the risk of making quarantine a greater federal responsibility.</p><p>Even so, the government neglects the Australian employers and communities that need a road map to open borders. Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, says anyone who depends on tourism is in \"diabolical\" trouble and the daily political doorstops, with ideas like vaccine passports, are not helping.</p><p>\"There are too many different communications circulating all over the shop,\" she says. \"There is a desperate need for some sort of national unity.\"</p><p>Yet national cabinet is back to meeting once every month. There is no sense of the urgency that led Morrison to put the peak group on an \"operational footing\" just six weeks ago.</p><p>While Morrison seems too cautious for some business leaders, he is in tune with scientists on the continuing risks.</p><p>\"The PM is correct the pandemic is changing,\" says Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of NSW. \"Pandemics shouldn't be viewed from a linear perspective as there are many facilitators that do not have equal impact and some that have more impact than the sum of each.\"</p><p>Those factors include the vaccination rate and the variants overseas. Getting things wrong, says McLaws, could quickly throw Australia into another wave of infection.</p><p>Just as Australians want to play it safe, so does Morrison.</p><p>For the moment, the political imperative is to keep people anxious until their votes are counted. The path to policy certainty runs through the ballot box. No wonder some want to get there as fast as possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520417949</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62RB-C4C1-JBJ7-N1RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1522\"/><timeReceived>05:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, says anyone who depends on tourism is in \"diabolical\" trouble and the daily political doorstops, with ideas like vaccine passports, are not helping.</p><p>\"There are too many different communications circulating all over the shop,\" she says. \"There is a desperate need for some sort of national unity.\"</p><p>Yet national cabinet is back to meeting once every month. There is no sense of the urgency that led Morrison to put the peak group on an \"operational footing\" just six weeks ago.</p><p>While Morrison seems too cautious for some business leaders, he is in tune with scientists on the continuing risks.</p><p>\"The PM is correct the pandemic is changing,\" says Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of NSW. \"Pandemics shouldn't be viewed from a linear perspective as there are many facilitators that do not have equal impact and some that have more impact than the sum of each.\"</p><p>Those factors include the vaccination rate and the variants overseas. Getting things wrong, says McLaws, could quickly throw Australia into another wave of infection.</p><p>Just as Australians want to play it safe, so does Morrison.</p><p>For the moment, the political imperative is to keep people anxious until their votes are counted. The path to policy certainty runs through the ballot box. No wonder some want to get there as fast as possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520417949</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62RB-HR31-JBJ7-N2C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1522\"/><timeReceived>05:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They argued that such burns would have reduced the bushfire intensity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoEYok70dxQ\">Fire experts</url> repeatedly dismissed these claims. As then NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons noted in January this year, the number of available days to carry out prescribed burns had reduced because climate change was altering the weather and causing longer fire seasons.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: How does bushfire smoke affect our health? 6 things you need to know</emphasis></p><p>This public conversation led our research team to ask: if climate change continues at its current rate, how will this change the days suitable for prescribed burning? </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088893?af=R\">Our results</url>, published today, were unexpected. Climate change may actually increase the number of burn days in some places, but the windows of opportunity will shift towards winter months. The bad news is that burning during these months potentially increases the public health impacts of smoke. </p><h>A hot debate</h><p>Hazard reduction involves removing vegetation that could otherwise fuel a fire, including burning under controlled conditions. But its effectiveness to subdue or prevent fires <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-burn-legacy-why-the-science-on-hazard-reduction-is-contested-132083\">is often debated</url> in the scientific community. </p><p>Those with experience on fire grounds, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoEYok70dxQ\">including</url> Fitzsimmons, say it's an important factor in fire management, but \"not a pancea\". </p><p>Despite the debate, it's clear hazard reduction burning will continue to be an important part of bushfire risk management in coming decades. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The burn legacy: why the science on hazard reduction is contested</emphasis></p><h>Modelling future weather</h><p>Before conducting prescribed burns, firefighting agencies consider factors such as vegetation type, proximity to property, desired rate of spread and possible <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/18/6585/2018/acp-18-6585-2018.html\">smoke dispersal over populated areas</url>. But we wanted to distil our investigation down to daily weather factors.</p><p>We reduced those factors to five key components. These were maximum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, fuel moisture and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/frontline-support/Fire-danger-meters/Mk5-forest-fire-danger-meter\">McArthur forest fire danger index</url> (the index used to forecast fire danger in southeast Australia).</p><p>We looked at these elements on prescribed burning days between 2004-2015. We then used climate models to simulate how the conditions would change with global warming over southeast Australia, relative to a baseline historical 20-year period for 1990-2009. </p><p>To make a valid 20-year comparison, we compared the historical period to a modelled period from 2060-2079, assuming emissions continue to rise at their current pace. </p><p>Surprisingly, we found, with one regional exception, the number of days suitable for prescribed burning did not change. And in many places, the number increased. </p><p>As the fire season lengthened under a warming climate, the number of days suitable for burning just shifted from autumn to winter.</p><h>Shifting seasons</h><p>Our research indicated that by 2060 there'll be fewer prescribed burning days during March, April and May. These are the months when most burning happens now.</p><p>But there will be significantly more opportunities for burning days from June to October. This is because the conditions that make for a good day for prescribed burning - such as mild and still days - start to shift to winter. Today, weather in these months is unsuitable for conducting burns. </p><p>Interestingly, these results aren't uniform across southeast Australia. For example, much of the Australian east coast and South Australia would see seasonal shifts in burning windows, with around 50% fewer burning days in March to May.</p><p>Much of Victoria and in particular the southern regions saw an increase in burning windows during April to May and, in some parts of the state, through September and October as well.</p><p>Only the east Queensland coast would see a total reduction in prescribed burn days from April to October.</p><h>The smoke trap</h><p>This may be good news for firefighters and those agencies who depend on prescribed burning as a key tool in bushfire prevention. But, as so often is the case with climate change, it's not that simple.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-08/nsw-fires-rfs-commissioner-weights-in-on-hazard-reduction-debate/11850862\">byproduct of prescribed burning</url> is smoke, and it's a very significant health issue. </p><p>Last year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateextremes.org.au/climate-change-to-worsen-eastern-australias-winter-pollution/\">research</url> showed global warming will strengthen an atmospheric layer that traps pollution close to the land surface, known as the \"inversion layer\". This will happen in the years 2060-79, relative to 1990-2009 - especially during winter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The smoke from autumn burn-offs could make coronavirus symptoms worse. It's not worth the risk</emphasis></p><p>Unfortunately, the conditions that create inversion layers - including cool, still air - correspond with conditions suitable for prescribed burning.</p><p>For asthmatics and those sensitive to air pollution, smokier burn days could make winter months more difficult and add further stress to the health system. </p><p>It also creates an additional challenge for firefighting agencies, which must already consider whether smoke will linger close to the surface and potentially drift into populated regions during prescribed burns.</p><p>This is just one factor our firefighting agencies will need to face in the future as bushfire risk management becomes more complex and challenging under climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: How does bushfire smoke affect our health? 6 things you need to know</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Giovanni Di Virgilio receives funding from The National Environmental Science Program and the NSW DPIE.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamish Clarke receives funding from the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Evans receives funding from the Australian Research Council, The National Environmental Science Program and the NSW DPIE.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Sharples receives funding from the Australian Research Council and the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Melissa Hart receives funding from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes and the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Annette Hirsch does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAUS-143546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-9431-JB75-93TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1028\"/><timeReceived>7:57 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Australia</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6070\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp;

I pledge in their honour that we will develop a vaccine, and we will defeat the virus.</p><p>\"My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable.\"</p><h>But there's still ammo for Trump's critics</h><p>This is hardly the first time the President <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-03/trumps-approach-to-coronavirus-is-eerily-familiar/12114128\">has backflipped on his stance</url> since the start of the US outbreak. </p><p>He likened COVID-19 to a flu throughout much of January and February. </p><p>Then he agreed with the scientists that a lockdown was necessary in March. </p><p>In early April, he said governors should be responsible for the US response, and by the month's end, he was calling for an abrupt end to nationwide lockdowns and threatening to use his power to make it so.</p><p>His latest comments end a three-month period of insisting life is back to normal, but they still leave plenty of ammo for his critics.</p><p>Unlike the previous briefings, the 27 minutes of guidance came from Trump and Trump alone, as the medical experts on the White House's Coronavirus Task Force stayed outside the briefing room. </p><p>That left no-one but the President to dole out the statistics, facts and scientific reasoning behind his points.</p><p>Some of his claims that appeared tailor-made to paint the US as superior to other countries will no doubt be picked apart for being misleading. </p><p>He pointed to a chart claiming the US had the world's lowest mortality rate, while Johns Hopkins University figures <url normalizedValue=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">rank the US seventh highest.</url></p><p>\"If you watch television you'd think that the US is the only country suffering from the China virus,\" Trump said in one of his comments that directly or indirectly blamed China for the pandemic. </p><p>Phrases like \"the virus will disappear one day\" and \"we'll end up with a cure soon\" also surfaced in the briefing. </p><p>Perhaps the briefing was meant to reassure the portion of the public that's panicked. But health experts have warned such comments also run the risk of lulling those who are weary of coronavirus restrictions into a false sense of security.</p><h>The mask tweet told us this was coming</h><p>The decision to resume daily briefings was announced <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-21/why-trump-decided-to-wear-a-mask/12475722\">not long after the President tweeted</url>that wearing a mask was \"patriotic,\" a first hint of his sudden reversal. </p><p>The White House press secretary said Trump had \"been consistent on the issue of masks\" and cited the President's frequent testing regime as proof he is \"acting appropriately\" and setting an example. </p><p>The President did not wear a mask at today's briefing, which is consistent with all but three of his public appearances since the start of the outbreak, but he did pull one out of his pocket to illustrate a point about his willingness.</p><p>\"I will use the mask gladly,\" he said, adding he often puts it on when he's near others, like in elevators.</p><p>\"I have no problem with the masks. I view it this way. Anything that can help is a good thing.\"</p><p>Though he said a return to lockdowns would be \"unfeasible\" at this stage, Trump encouraged social distancing, hand-washing and general vigilance. </p><p>He pleaded with young Americans, who appear to be driving the outbreaks in the southern states, to stop attending bars and gatherings. </p><p>He promised his administration was working to speed up tests, which are taking 10 or more days to return results in some regions.</p><p>He pledged he'd help governors with whatever supplies they needed. </p><p>But in most cases, he stopped short of elaborating on the specifics, opting for message over mechanics.</p><p>He ended his briefing by reminding reporters he'd be back tomorrow.</p><h>We're still a long way from the election</h><p>Even while Trump managed to stay somewhat on-message when it came to coronavirus, he still bestowed his good wishes on Ghislaine Maxwell, the former partner of disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. </p><p>\"I don't know, I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly,\" Trump responded when asked about the charges she faces of transporting minors for illegal sexual acts. </p><p>\"I have met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is.\"</p><p>The White House briefing room has always been a dangerous place for a President who tends to stray from the script. </p><p>Plenty have speculated that Trump's motivation for resuming the briefings <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/21/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-daily/index.html\">involves rescuing his sagging poll numbers.</url></p><p>Trump continues to trail Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden by an average of nine points as US COVID-19 case numbers rise above 3.8 million and the unemployment rate hovers around 11 per cent. </p><p>And with the Trump campaign <url

it's clear the virus has prohibitively diminished the ability to hold rallies, Trump's signature campaign tool. </p><p>We don't know if and how daily briefings will influence the President's

The fire season has only just begun and there is every indication that this summer there will be more potentially deadly episodes.</p><p>Drought-ravaged parts of the state are still at risk and long-term weather forecasts expect more tinder dry conditions.</p><p>Similarly, the fires are not extinguished in East Gippsland and the state's northeast.</p><p>Dozens of blazes are still burning and a \"mega fire\" straddling the border with New South Wales will continue to create headaches for emergency services.</p><p>FFMV chief officer Chris Hardman said yesterday the fight was far from over. \"We need to be really clear that unless we get really significant rains \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We're going to be in this for the long haul,\" he said.</p><p>\"We will be working on these fires right through until the end of February, into March and possibly beyond.</p><p>\"We will be putting our firefighters out there to do everything they can to contain these fires and stop them running into communities.\" Premier Daniel Andrews and Emergency Management Victoria Commissioner Andrew Crisp have also been vocal that the danger is still very real.</p><p>Bushfire Recovery Victoria, a new agency to lead rebuilding efforts, has been established as a permanent fixture to cope with what is expected to be the new status quo.</p><p>It is grim news for many communities and for the hundreds of volunteers and professionals who have spent their holidays in disastrous conditions with little time to see the families and loved ones they are battling to protect.</p><p>Australians have shown great generosity over this difficult period. We have come together to help those in need and put petty differences aside when necessary to ensure lives are protected and people receive vital support.</p><p>While we try to shake off the fog and come out of \"holiday mode\" one of the most important things we can do is remember those we have lost and those still fighting to save lives.</p><p>The natural impulse will be to focus on what happens next.</p><p>Frank and fearless discussion must be had about the impact of our changing climate on fire danger and what steps authorities can take to mitigate future risk to lives and property.</p><p>Current funding models, hazard reduction plans and government strategies should all be examined.</p><p>As this happens we should also continue to keep in mind the brave work being done by those on the frontline of this mammoth crisis.</p><p>Run for their lives THERE is nothing more precious than a baby born - and Paul Abbey knows this more than most.</p><p>Mr Abbey's daughter, Lottie, was born very prematurely, at 27 weeks, so it was touch and go whether she would make it.</p><p>But as today's Herald Sun reports, Lottie, who weighed only 761 grams at birth, pulled through, and now she's a bright and determined two-year-old.</p><p>Mr Abbey and wife Hayley, who also have a daughter Sadie, cannot be more thankful to staff at the Royal Children's Hospital for saving Lottie.</p><p>Mr Abbey is a keen participant in the Herald Sun/Transurban Run for the Kids, an annual event that has raised more than $17 million for the hospital's Good Friday Appeal.</p><p>Last year's event was especially poignant for the Maidstone dad, as Lottie was being treated in hospital at the time.</p><p>Mr Abbey, who raised more than $11,000 last year, said he was determined to give something back to a world-class facility that did so much good for Victoria.</p><p>He will also take part in this year's event - to be held on Sunday, March 29 - and hopes to raise a similar amount of money.</p><p>Tens of thousands of runners pounded the pavement in 2019, helping to raise $1.5 million for the appeal.</p><p>Debuting in 2006, Run for the Kids has grown to become one of the state's biggest mass participation fun runs.</p><p>Registrations for the 2020 event open today, with details at runforthekids.com.auPaul Abbey will be there, running for Lottie, and other kids.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-8b2b0172329411ea9a42ac9ed2b69c6213da8b727ad14071736ef460d984b1d7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYN-KTF1-JD3N-50VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

Due to a number of safety concerns stemming from the fire that affected the site and the wider bushfire impacts across the country, it was agreed that holding RSF over the scheduled weekend in Lexton simply isn't the right thing to do.\"</p><p>The statement said the two new events would honour the spirit of the festival.</p><p>\"The two events will be treated as Rainbow Serpent Festival 2020 with your tickets gaining entry to both.</p><p>\"(In Melbourne) Multiple stages hosting the majority of special guest performers from the original lineup.

Exposure to cool westerlies kept a lid on the mercury for Melbourne, but it too had above-average maximums.</p><p>NSW broke its annual record for daytime temperatures for a third year in a row, while Victoria had its fourth-warmest. For South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, 2019 also marked their hottest year for maximums.</p><p>Drought intensifies</p><p>Rainfall was generally dismal, averaging just 277.63 millimetres across Australia in 2019. That tally was more than one-10th below the previous record low set in 1902.</p><p>\"Australia had below-average rainfall in every month - it's the first time that's happened,\" Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Each city, except Sydney, had rainfall totals in the driest 10 per cent of years. The city had many months with below-average rainfall and ended up with its driest year since 2005.</p><p>NSW and the Murray-Darling Basin both collected less than half their usual annual rainfall, setting new lows and intensifying the drought.</p><p>South Australia also had its driest year, with one-third its typical falls, while Victoria had its 10th-driest at just below two-thirds of normal levels.</p><p>Three poor winters meant run-off into dams in the Murray-Darling Basin was also very poor, with \"no meaningful inflows in the northern basin where storages remained extremely low or close to empty\", the bureau said in its annual report.</p><p>Year-end blowtorch</p><p>Australia started 2019 with an extreme heatwave in January that helped make the 2018-19 summer the country's hottest.</p><p>But that record could be eclipsed as soon as this summer after a scorching December that \"brought an exceptionally warm end to the year\", the bureau said.</p><p>On December 18 Australia had its hottest day, with an average maximum of 41.9 degrees. The month also included the next six warmest days, all shading the previous 40.3-degree high set in early 2013.</p><p>The week ending Christmas Eve was Australia's hottest week, with an average of 40.5 degrees.</p><p>The size of December's temperature leap was perhaps the standout statistic from 2019.</p><p>At 38.6 degrees on average, December's daytime temperatures were a full 4.15 degrees above the 1961-90 benchmark, beating a record set only a year earlier, by 1.74 degrees.</p><p>December maximums were the largest departure from the norm for any month the bureau has monitored, as were the mean temperatures - averaging out maximums and minimums - at an anomaly of 3.21 degrees.</p><p>Nullarbor station's 49.9 degrees last month set a new December record nationally.</p><p>\"2019 was the extreme year in the sequence [of the past few hot years], but December was the sharp end of the extremes\", Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Rain clouds were largely absent for the month, with a delayed northern monsoon contributing to Australia's driest December. Rainfall averaged just 15.42 millimetres.</p><p>The combination of extreme heat and low rainfall meant the bushfire season started early in many parts of Australia.</p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Index - gauging temperature, humidity, wind speed and drought to assess the potential threat of the spread of fire - was the highest on record over most of Australia, including almost all of NSW.</p><p>Fire seasons are getting longer - extending as much as a month in parts of south-eastern Australia.</p><p>\"We're getting more fire weather during the season and the fire weather we're seeing is more severe,\" Dr Braganza said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520225882</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXV-JBT1-DY19-C3NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><timeReceived>08:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A key recommendation of the 2010 commission, accepted by the Brumby Labor government at the time, was that the Victorian government significantly boost its level of fuel reduction from the then current annual level of 130,000ha, or about 1.7 per cent of public land, to 5 per cent of public land, or about 385,000ha.</p><p>The 2018-19 figures show DELWP did not even try to meet the commission's recommen-dations in setting its target, with the 246,396ha of planned burns constituting just 64 per cent of the recommended 385,000ha.</p><p>While weather conditions have at times caused a cancellation of planned burns, some have also been hampered by green groups.</p><p>Near the Victorian town of Nowa Nowa, among communities evacuated as the East Gippsland fires roared through the region last week, a controlled burn in September was delayed and then significantly reduced.</p><p>The prescribed burn at Nelsons Road, Nowa Nowa, was initially intended to cover 370ha of land to the south of the town in September, but protests resulted in it being delayed until the following month.</p><p>Even then, only 9ha was burned after \"community consultation\", with some mulching and slashing also done in the area.</p><p>\"The current bushfires did not reach the Nelsons Road burn but another nearby planned burn at Radar Hill played a significant role in helping to stop the fire,\" a DELWP spokesman said.</p><p>Former CSIRO fire scientist David Packham slammed the Andrews government's 2015 decision to move from hectare targets to \"risk reduction targets\".</p><p>\"Hectare targets were a process by which the department and government could be held -accountable,\" he said. \"Such people don't like being held accountable, especially when they're doing the best they can to subvert what the commission came up with.\" Mr Packham also attacked the government for its refusal to release DELWP mapping of fuel loads across the state, which were previously publicly available.</p><p>DELWP last year demanded a fee of $1294.80 from the Weekly Times to process a Freedom of Information request for copies of the maps, and a state government spokeswoman this week told The Australian that publishing them \"would be giving a map of where to start a fire to arsonists\".</p><p>\"The level of secrecy from DELWP would make a nuclear research facility jealous,\" Mr Packham said. He said he believed that even the 5 per cent target recommended by the royal commission was insufficient. \"The royal commission originally concluded that 5-8 per cent 'at a minimum' would be appropriate,\" he said. \"When the final report came, the 5-8 had turned into 5 per cent and the word 'minimum' had disappeared.\" Fourth-generation mountain cattleman Bruce Commins, 66, said \"mismanagement of the bush\" through a lack of controlled burning was to blame for the -severity of the current fires.</p><p>The East Gippsland farmer's home north of Swift's Creek and 2000ha grazing property near Benambra remain under threat from fires that have been burning since November 21. \"I'm devastated by this,\" said Mr Commins, a CFA volunteer for more than 45 years.</p><p>\"The environmental damage that's been done is beyond belief. \"I really thought that after Black Saturday we would have had a change, but the royal commission recommendations just haven't been followed in terms of fuel reduction burning. That is the issue - the fuel.\"Forest Fire Management Victoria chief Chris Hardman said the move away from hectare-based targets had been endorsed by an expert reference panel and was adopted \"because it represented a more effective approach to reducing risk for life and property than a hectare-based target\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-37990d2a31d011eab8abb9040b940932d6f68b8a96312cea46a2ac3574c72bcc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXV-M7W1-F0JP-W4GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

That gives us that heads up of what we're expecting over the next decades.\" </p><p>The report reveals Australia has warmed on average by 1.44C, give or take 0.24C, which is far more specific than the 1C figure in the last report. </p><p>Most warming has occurred since 1950 and every decade since then has been warmer than the ones before. </p><p>The seven years from 2013 to 2019 all rank in the nine warmest years. Warming is observed in all months, day and night. Along with warming comes more frequent extreme events including bushfires. </p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Index combines temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind speed. Using this index to map the change in the number of dangerous fire days between two periods - July 1950 to June 1985, and July 1985 to June 2020 - shows South Australia is among the hardest hit by fierce fire conditions now.

But in general, streamflow from rainfall has reduced. </p><p>In the Murray-Darling Basin, most of the streamflow gauges show a declining trend since records began in 1970. </p><p>Changing rainfall patterns mean the country as a whole, and the basin in particular, is generally wetter in the north and drier in the south, but warmer temperatures and higher evaporation means streamflow has been reduced in three quarters of stations. </p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Youth ideas to fix planet they will be left with</emphasis></p><p>Climate change looms large on the horizon for our children, who will inherit the problem of excess greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide warming the atmosphere, with far-reaching consequences for life on Earth. </p><p>At Adelaide Botanic High School, students are encouraged to explore the issue and find solutions. </p><p>Clementine Cooke-Hall, 14, of Fitzroy, would like to use visual arts to inspire a passion for the environment, provide creative ways to share information and raise awareness about the issues our society faces. </p><p>Hieu Nguyen, 15, of Pooraka, likes to focus on ways he can contribute personally, from the \"little things like composting and recycling\" through to environmentally-conscious shopping. </p><p>The Year 10 student is interested in developing new materials that can replace plastics derived from fossil fuels. He's working on a project to design a carbon-neutral shoe, considering three billion shoes are created every year, with embodied fossil fuels.

Daytime temperatures were 2.09 degrees above the 1961-90 average, beating the previous high set in 2013 by 0.54 degrees. Annual mean temperatures were 1.52 degrees above the norm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Globally, 2019 was also the second hottest year on record based on data going back to 1880. It will be the warmest for any year that did not have an El Nino event - a Pacific climate pattern that boosts temperatures - and means the past five years are all among the top five warmest.</p><p>While short-term climate drivers, particularly in the Indian Ocean, contributed to Australia's hot year, the background warming - caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions - is clear.</p><p>\"We've seen clear trends in maximum, minimum and average temperatures across Australia,\" said Karl Braganza, head of the bureau's climate monitoring, adding the country had warmed about 1.4 degrees since 1910, most of it since 1950.</p><p>\"We've seen quite clear trends in reducing rainfall across south-west WA and parts of the south-east,\" he said.</p><p>Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane and Hobart notched their warmest year on record for daytime temperatures, while Perth was equal-warmest and Darwin the second-warmest. Exposure to cool westerlies kept a lid on the mercury for Melbourne, but it too had above-average maximums.</p><p>NSW broke its annual record for daytime temperatures for a third year in a row, while Victoria had its fourth-warmest. For South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, 2019 also marked their hottest year for maximums.</p><p>Drought intensifies</p><p>Rainfall was generally dismal, averaging just 277.63 millimetres across Australia in 2019. That tally was more than one-10th below the previous record low set in 1902.</p><p>\"Australia had below-average rainfall in every month - it's the first time that's happened,\" Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Each city, except Sydney, had rainfall totals in the driest 10 per cent of years. The city had many months with below-average rainfall and ended up with its driest year since 2005.</p><p>NSW and the Murray-Darling Basin both collected less than half their usual annual rainfall, setting new lows and intensifying the drought.</p><p>South Australia also had its driest year, with one-third its typical falls, while Victoria had its 10th-driest at just below two-thirds of normal levels.</p><p>Three poor winters meant run-off into dams in the Murray-Darling Basin was also very poor, with \"no meaningful inflows in the northern basin where storages remained extremely low or close to empty\", the bureau said in its annual report.</p><p>Year-end blowtorch</p><p>Australia started 2019 with an extreme heatwave in January that helped make the 2018-19 summer the country's hottest.</p><p>But that record could be eclipsed as soon as this summer after a scorching December that \"brought an exceptionally warm end to the year\", the bureau said.</p><p>On December 18 Australia had its hottest day, with an average maximum of 41.9 degrees. The month also included the next six warmest days, all shading the previous 40.3-degree high set in early 2013.</p><p>The week ending Christmas Eve was Australia's hottest week, with an average of 40.5 degrees.</p><p>The size of December's temperature leap was perhaps the standout statistic from 2019.</p><p>At 38.6 degrees on average, December's daytime temperatures were a full 4.15 degrees above the 1961-90 benchmark, beating a record set only a year earlier, by 1.74 degrees.</p><p>December maximums were the largest departure from the norm for any month the bureau has monitored, as were the mean temperatures - averaging out maximums and minimums - at an anomaly of 3.21 degrees.</p><p>Nullarbor station's 49.9 degrees last month set a new December record nationally.</p><p>\"2019 was the extreme year in the sequence [of the past few hot years], but December was the sharp end of the extremes\", Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Rain clouds were largely absent for the month, with a delayed northern monsoon contributing to Australia's driest December. Rainfall averaged just 15.42 millimetres.</p><p>The combination of extreme heat and low rainfall meant the bushfire season started early in many parts of Australia.</p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Index - gauging temperature, humidity, wind speed and drought to assess the potential threat of the spread of fire - was the highest on record over most of Australia, including almost all of NSW.</p><p>Fire seasons are getting longer - extending as much as a month in parts of south-eastern Australia.</p><p>\"We're getting more fire weather during the season and the fire weather we're seeing is more severe,\" Dr Braganza said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520225882</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXV-JBT1-DY19-C3N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><timeReceived>08:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Authorities in NSW expect that number will grow by hundreds in coming days. Since New Year's Eve, 576 homes have been lost.</p><p>Assessment teams were yet to reach NSW's hardest-hit towns, which likely include Bundanoon, Wingello, Batlow, Adelong, the Jervis Bay area, Boydtown, Kiah, Wonboyn, Towamba and Cabramurra.</p><p>A body was found at Nerrigundah in southern NSW late yesterday, bringing to 20 the number of deaths in NSW this fire season. Two more people were missing south of Bombala and west of Bedalla, both in southern NSW.</p><p>Four people missing in Victoria were yesterday found safe.</p><p>The state's Emergency Management Commissioner said 1.2 million hectares had been burnt in Victoria, predominantly in the east, while Premier Daniel Andrews said 200 homes were confirmed lost. He warned this could reach 300 once assessments are completed.</p><p>As of yesterday afternoon, there were 27 fires burning across Victoria. There were 18 in East Gippsland and the remainder were in the north-east, close to the NSW South Coast fires.</p><p>While conditions had eased in fire-ravaged areas in Victoria, temperatures were expected to soar on Thursday and Friday, leading to dangerous fire conditions.</p><p>The cool change that pushed up the east coast on Saturday enabled military helicopters to deliver much-needed supplies to communities that had been cut off by the fires, and to assist with evacuations.</p><p>The helicopters reached 13 communities on Sunday, and the Australian Defence Force yesterday reached a further three.</p><p>They rescued 406 people from Mallacoota, after navy ships evacuated more than 1100 people on Sunday. Heavy smoke has made further aerial evacuations unlikely, but people wanting to leave the town had the option of more boats.</p><p>\"They've got a choice today to take up the offer of the boat, and people are being talked to today, or staying and hoping the smoke clears sometime in the next couple of days,\" Victorian Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said yesterday.</p><p>While the southerly change brought some rain, it was not enough to put out the fires and did not occur across all fire-affected areas.</p><p>\"It's better than it not raining but it's nowhere near enough for us to think this [fire] event's over,\" Mr Andrews said.</p><p>In NSW, the Rural Fire Service said rain brought some relief to firefighters, but warned it was not enough to put out the largest and most dangerous blazes before conditions deteriorate again on Friday.</p><p>The cool change also created hazardous conditions in some areas. \"[The change] does in fact create some other challenges in a strange way - we had a Forest Fire Management vehicle tip over yesterday, thankfully no one was seriously injured,\" Mr Andrews said yesterday.</p><p>The vehicle tipped as the road was greasy because it had not rained in the area for some time.</p><p>More than 100,000 sheep and cattle had been killed in the bushfires, and authorities expect that number to grow. In south-eastern NSW alone, an estimated 2800 livestock had been lost to bushfires since Christmas.</p><p>The National Farmers Federation said the deaths were either a direct result of the blazes, or from the effects of heat stress and smoke inhalation.</p><p>Federal Emergency Management Minister David Littleproud warned there was a biosecurity risk if livestock carcasses were not disposed of quickly.</p><p>Federal Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie said there had been issues getting access to live fire grounds.</p><p>\"Where it's safe to do so we need to be getting in within a week, ideally, to really be dealing with the carcasses in an appropriate way,\" she said.</p><p>Army reservists will help bury some of the lost livestock by digging pits in the coming days and weeks.</p><p>The government said farmers who lost stock would be an urgent priority, and the newly established national bushfire recovery agency will offer income support to farmers.</p><p>At Mount Selwyn, photos taken by National Parks staff showed scenes of total destruction, with burned out buildings, tractors and ski lifts scattered around the site.</p><p>The ABC reported the resort's owners had promised to rebuild the resort. About 60 people work there during peak season.</p><p>Nearby Perisher and Thredbo resorts were unaffected.</p><p>WITH AAP</p><p>Key pointsMore deaths confirmed as hundreds wait to learn the fate of their homes.</p><p>Mt Selwyn ski resort was destroyed by a fire in the Snowy Mountains.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78q6kmh6z95vwna24yz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY2-40N1-F0J6-J53W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A key recommendation of the 2010 commission, accepted by the Brumby Labor government at the time, was that the Victorian government significantly boost its level of fuel reduction from the then current annual level of 130,000ha, or about 1.7 per cent of public land, to 5 per cent of public land, or about 385,000ha.</p><p>The 2018-19 figures show DELWP did not even try to meet the commission's recommen-dations in setting its target, with the 246,396ha of planned burns constituting just 64 per cent of the recommended 385,000ha.</p><p>While weather conditions have at times caused a cancellation of planned burns, some have also been hampered by green groups.</p><p>Near the Victorian town of Nowa Nowa, among communities evacuated as the East Gippsland fires roared through the region last week, a controlled burn in September was delayed and then significantly reduced.</p><p>The prescribed burn at Nelsons Road, Nowa Nowa, was initially intended to cover 370ha of land to the south of the town in September, but protests saw it was delayed until the following month.</p><p>Even then, only 9ha was burned after \"community consultation\", with some mulching and slashing also done in the area.</p><p>\"The current bushfires did not reach the Nelsons Road burn but another nearby planned burn at Radar Hill played a significant role in helping to stop the fire,\" a DELWP spokesman said.</p><p>Former CSIRO fire scientist David Packham slammed the Andrews government's 2015 decision to move from hectare targets to \"risk reduction targets\".</p><p>\"Hectare targets were a process by which the department and government could be held -accountable,\" he said. \"Such people don't like being held accountable, especially when they're doing the best they can to subvert what the commission came up with.\" Mr Packham also attacked the government for its refusal to release DELWP mapping of fuel loads across the state, which were previously publicly available.</p><p>DELWP last year demanded a fee of $1294.80 from the Weekly Times to process a Freedom of Information request for copies of the maps, and a state government spokeswoman this week told the Australian that publishing them \"would be giving a map of where to start a fire to arsonists\".</p><p>\"The level of secrecy from DELWP would make a nuclear research facility jealous,\" Mr Packham said. He said he believed that even the 5 per cent target recommended by the royal commission was insufficient. \"The royal commission originally concluded that 5-8 per cent \"at a minimum\" would be appropriate,\" he said. \"When the final report came, the 5-8 had turned into 5per cent and the word 'minimum' had disappeared.\" Fourth-generation mountain cattleman Bruce Commins, 66, said \"mismanagement of the bush\" through a lack of controlled burning was to blame for the -severity of the current fires.</p><p>The East Gippsland farmer's home north of Swift's Creek and 2000ha grazing property near Benambra remain under threat from fires that have been burning since November 21. \"I'm devastated by this,\" said Mr Commins, a CFA volunteer for more than 45 years.</p><p>\"The environmental damage that's been done is beyond belief. \"I really thought that after Black Saturday we would have had a change, but the royal commission recommendations just haven't been followed in terms of fuel reduction burning. That is the issue - the fuel.\"Forest Fire Management Victoria chief Chris Hardman said the move away from hectare-based targets had been endorsed by an expert reference panel and was adopted \"because it represented a more effective approach to reducing risk for life and property than a hectare-based target\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-37990d2a31d011eab8abb9040b9409324a60d017da6684678dcb5125e017c24e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXT-R5X1-JD3N-54SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"822\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I'll think to myself that I will sit here a bit longer and stay a bit longer.\"</p><p>Some places, though, make him \"feel so crook and so sick that I have to move myself back away\".</p><p>\"Once I'm gone, I feel good as gold again. There are just some sites that I cannot go to.\"</p><p>He has a book coming out, titled Spirit of Place.</p><p>\"It will continue the education work that I have been doing on these sacred sites,\" he said.</p><p>\"The whole idea of the book is to educate people and stop them going out to the sites.</p><p>\"They can experience the sites and learn the culture without them being given away.\"</p><p>Time Means Nothing Mr Taggart - also known as Uncle Warren, elder of the Wonnarua people - has been surveying Aboriginal sites all his life.</p><p>He finds himself in a different state of mind when he enters the national parks.</p><p>\"Time means nothing to me when I'm out in the mountains,\" he said.</p><p>After the Black Summer bushfires, his team received a bushfire recovery grant from the Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife.</p><p>The grant was used for the survey of Aboriginal sites in Yengo and Wollemi national parks and surrounding country.</p><p>Mr Taggart and three friends with passion for Aboriginal sites work as a team on the site surveys.</p><p>\"We aren't a formal organisation as such, but we work closely together.</p><p>\"Carol Carter and Allan Chawner are the photographers and Jim Mitchell and myself do the paperwork and the planning for the day.</p><p>\"We all clicked and we all love what we do. We're out there to look, protect, photograph and document.\"</p><p>The team surveyed up to 70 sites from May to December last year. National park rangers helped with the project.</p><p>The sites are mostly in massive areas of national park to the west of and parallel to the Hunter Region and Central Coast.</p><p>\"We went well and truly beyond the initial expectation. We did three or four sites at a time depending on the distance between them and what the weather was like,\" Mr Taggart said.</p><p>The survey spanned forest areas in which the notorious Wollemi megafire, known as the Gospers Mountain blaze, burnt more than 500,000 hectares.</p><p>It set a record for being the biggest forest fire in Australian history.</p><p>Most of the sites survived the fires, but two caves were damaged due to eroding winds in the firestorm and trees that burnt into the cave overhangs.</p><p>\"A damaged cave in Wollemi National Park had handprints that were all gone because the cave was directly facing west and the fire hit it front on,\" Mr Taggart said.</p><p>\"The majority of the caves and rock engravings remained unburnt. The fire had come up to the bottom of the caves and around sandstone plateaus and didn't enter.</p><p>\"There was only one cave that I came across - in Wollemi National Park - where the cave was completely burnt out, with only one handprint remaining.</p><p>\"I was expecting a lot more damage.\"</p><p>'Dad Showed Me' Mr Taggart said his dad was \"a man of the bush and showed me a lot of the sites growing up\".</p><p>The survey covered many areas that his dad showed him.</p><p>\"This is over 7000 square kilometres. It's impossible to do every single site,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Taggart said all Aboriginal sites were sacred.</p><p>\"Each site is significant and should be preserved and respected,\" he said.</p><p>\"When people ask me where the sites are, I tell them they're in the mountains. When they ask when I'll take them there, I say one day.</p><p>\"In other words, I won't be taking them.\"</p><p>He will make some exceptions.</p><p>\"If I take a person out there, it has to be the right person for the right reason.</p><p>\"You take the wrong person out and it becomes a domino effect because then they take someone else.</p><p>\"Before you know it, the site is vandalised because someone wants to put their name up on the walls.\"</p><p>He said the amount of vandalism at some easy-to-access sites was gobsmacking.</p><p>The sites in this survey were \"very remote\".</p><p>\"None of the sites had been given away, so fortunately none of these sites were vandalised.\"</p><p>Getting to some sites deep in the bush requires a three-hour walk.</p><p>\"It's dedication for the culture,\" Mr Taggart said.</p><p>He said the caves that weren't damaged were because \"no one knows about them and no one would want to walk in that far\".</p><p>Griffith University archaeologist Dr Jillian Huntley has written a foreword for the Spirit of Place book.</p><p>Dr Huntley has conducted research on the rock art of the Sydney Basin for more than 15 years.</p><p>\"We are privileged in Australia to have continuing cultural traditions of Aboriginal peoples,\" she said.</p><p>\"This sort of work, revisiting and redocumenting rock art sites, is one of the most important things that Aboriginal custodians can do to care for them.\"</p><p>The basis for any conservation management program was to \"understand the condition of sites, how they are preserving over time and what is affecting them\".</p><p>\"Support for this sort of survey and documentation is critical in helping Aboriginal custodians care for their sites and their cultural landscapes more broadly,\" Dr Huntley said.</p><p>\"Aboriginal people need the most up-to-date information in order to make decisions about the management of their country.</p><p>\"Rock art is just one aspect of Aboriginal cultural heritage which shows the long-lived connections people continue to have with their country.\"</p><p>Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife chief executive Ian Darbyshire said the survey was \"an extremely important contribution to preserving our Indigenous heritage\".</p><p>\"We are committed to the ongoing protection of Aboriginal sites.</p><p>\"Through grant funding, we can continue to support the work being done by passionate individuals and community.\"</p><p>IN THE NEWS:</p><p>Hunter students' projects stand out in Shape exhibition Aberglasslyn shooting was targeted say police Woman falls seven metres in Newcastle 2021 Newcastle Knights season preview magazine Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

They will be quite large and can sometimes look like a mushroom cloud,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Hope said this was the result of firefighters putting a firebreak around the edge of the area to be burned so when the area is whipped around with a firelighter torch, a mushroom cloud can form as the flames meets in the middle.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria has also begun its planned burning schedule and will be conducting planned burns in the forests.</p><p>Mr Hope said while the CFA appreciated community members remaining vigilant and calling in fires as they are observed, in order to reduce the instances of brigades being called out unnecessarily to planned burns, he encouraged people to first have a closer look.</p><p>\"Planned burns must be performed in calm conditions with no wind. If conditions are like this, people can probably safely assume it is a farmer burning off,\" he said.</p><p>\"Don't be alarmed but if you are, investigate a bit further. If you can see smoke, have a closer look and try to see if farmers are working at the fire edge. And try to get an exact address.\"</p><p>While permits are being issued for farmers, Mr Hope said the strict conditions enforced as part of the fire danger period still remained for other community members.</p><p>This means that it is illegal to light a fire in the open air, unless a permit is issued and strict requirements are abided by.</p><p>Despite this, there have been a number of illegal burn offs in recent weeks.</p><p>\"Some people think because it's rained or because farmer Joe or farmer Bill was burning in his paddock that they can, that as soon as it rains the restrictions are automatically lifted but they aren't,\" Mr Hope said.</p><p>\"To lift the fire danger period we have to go through a decision making process. It doesn't just automatically come off after it has rained.\"</p><p>A police spokesperson said that the majority of fires each summer were caused by people being careless, by leaving a campfire unattended or operating machinery on a day of total fire ban.</p><p>\"Careless behaviour regarding fires has the same potential consequences as those caused by arson, easily leading to the destruction of life and property,\" they said.</p><p>While police understand that farmers stubble burn to prepare for sowing the following season's crops, the burns are undertaken with CFA approved permits in safe conditions.</p><p>However, police have responded to stubble burns which have reignited in hotter, windier conditions several days later.</p><p>\"Farmers have a responsibility to ensure that their stubble burns are completely extinguished, including around fence lines and trees.</p><p>\"The message to all is clear, it's everyone's responsibility to be mindful of their activities during fire danger periods, otherwise your actions could result in a bushfire.\"</p><p>Depending on the circumstances, police may charge a person on summons with lighting a fire on a day of total fire ban. The penalty for lighting a fire during a total fire ban can be up to two years in jail or up to $40,000 in fines.</p><p>Further, anyone found guilty of recklessly or intentionally causing a bushfire faces a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment.</p><p>Last fire season there were two fires later in the season - one at Bunkers Hill in late March and the other at Mt Clear in mid-April.</p><p>Mr Hope said that while much of the region is greener due to recent rains, there was an underlying dryness in the forests so they could still burn in the right conditions.

I'll think to myself that I will sit here a bit longer and stay a bit longer.\"</p><p>Some places, though, make him \"feel so crook and so sick that I have to move myself back away\".</p><p>\"Once I'm gone, I feel good as gold again. There are just some sites that I cannot go to.\"</p><p>He has a book coming out, titled Spirit of Place.</p><p>\"It will continue the education work that I have been doing on these sacred sites,\" he said.</p><p>\"The whole idea of the book is to educate people and stop them going out to the sites.</p><p>\"They can experience the sites and learn the culture without them being given away.\"</p><p>Time Means Nothing Mr Taggart - also known as Uncle Warren, elder of the Wonnarua people - has been surveying Aboriginal sites all his life.</p><p>He finds himself in a different state of mind when he enters the national parks.</p><p>\"Time means nothing to me when I'm out in the mountains,\" he said.</p><p>After the Black Summer bushfires, his team received a bushfire recovery grant from the Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife.</p><p>The grant was used for the survey of Aboriginal sites in Yengo and Wollemi national parks and surrounding country.</p><p>Mr Taggart and three friends with passion for Aboriginal sites work as a team on the site surveys.</p><p>\"We aren't a formal organisation as such, but we work closely together.</p><p>\"Carol Carter and Allan Chawner are the photographers and Jim Mitchell and myself do the paperwork and the planning for the day.</p><p>\"We all clicked and we all love what we do. We're out there to look, protect, photograph and document.\"</p><p>The team surveyed up to 70 sites from May to December last year. National park rangers helped with the project.</p><p>The sites are mostly in massive areas of national park to the west of and parallel to the Hunter Region and Central Coast.</p><p>\"We went well and truly beyond the initial expectation. We did three or four sites at a time depending on the distance between them and what the weather was like,\" Mr Taggart said.</p><p>The survey spanned forest areas in which the notorious Wollemi megafire, known as the Gospers Mountain blaze, burnt more than 500,000 hectares.</p><p>It set a record for being the biggest forest fire in Australian history.</p><p>Most of the sites survived the fires, but two caves were damaged due to eroding winds in the firestorm and trees that burnt into the cave overhangs.</p><p>\"A damaged cave in Wollemi National Park had handprints that were all gone because the cave was directly facing west and the fire hit it front on,\" Mr Taggart said.</p><p>\"The majority of the caves and rock engravings remained unburnt. The fire had come up to the bottom of the caves and around sandstone plateaus and didn't enter.</p><p>\"There was only one cave that I came across - in Wollemi National Park - where the cave was completely burnt out, with only one handprint remaining.</p><p>\"I was expecting a lot more damage.\"</p><p>'Dad Showed Me' Mr Taggart said his dad was \"a man of the bush and showed me a lot of the sites growing up\".</p><p>The survey covered many areas that his dad showed him.</p><p>\"This is over 7000 square kilometres. It's impossible to do every single site,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Taggart said all Aboriginal sites were sacred.</p><p>\"Each site is significant and should be preserved and respected,\" he said.</p><p>\"When people ask me where the sites are, I tell them they're in the mountains. When they ask when I'll take them there, I say one day.</p><p>\"In other words, I won't be taking them.\"</p><p>He will make some exceptions.</p><p>\"If I take a person out there, it has to be the right person for the right reason.</p><p>\"You take the wrong person out and it becomes a domino effect because then they take someone else.</p><p>\"Before you know it, the site is vandalised because someone wants to put their name up on the walls.\"</p><p>He said the amount of vandalism at some easy-to-access sites was gobsmacking.</p><p>The sites in this survey were \"very remote\".</p><p>\"None of the sites had been given away, so fortunately none of these sites were vandalised.\"</p><p>Getting to some sites deep in the bush requires a three-hour walk.</p><p>\"It's dedication for the culture,\" Mr Taggart said.</p><p>He said the caves that weren't damaged were because \"no one knows about them and no one would want to walk in that far\".</p><p>Griffith University archaeologist Dr Jillian Huntley has written a foreword for the Spirit of Place book.</p><p>Dr Huntley has conducted research on the rock art of the Sydney Basin for more than 15 years.</p><p>\"We are privileged in Australia to have continuing cultural traditions of Aboriginal peoples,\" she said.</p><p>\"This sort of work, revisiting and redocumenting rock art sites, is one of the most important things that Aboriginal custodians can do to care for them.\"</p><p>The basis for any conservation management program was to \"understand the condition of sites, how they are preserving over time and what is affecting them\".</p><p>\"Support for this sort of survey and documentation is critical in helping Aboriginal custodians care for their sites and their cultural landscapes more broadly,\" Dr Huntley said.</p><p>\"Aboriginal people need the most up-to-date information in order to make decisions about the management of their country.</p><p>\"Rock art is just one aspect of Aboriginal cultural heritage which shows the long-lived connections people continue to have with their country.\"</p><p>Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife chief executive Ian Darbyshire said the survey was \"an extremely important contribution to preserving our Indigenous heritage\".</p><p>\"We are committed to the ongoing protection of Aboriginal sites.</p><p>\"Through grant funding, we can continue to support the work being done by passionate individuals and community.\"</p><p>IN THE NEWS:</p><p>Hunter students' projects stand out in Shape exhibition Aberglasslyn shooting was targeted say police Woman falls seven metres in Newcastle 2021 Newcastle Knights season preview magazine Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

They will be quite large and can sometimes look like a mushroom cloud,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Hope said this was the result of firefighters putting a firebreak around the edge of the area to be burned so when the area is whipped around with a firelighter torch, a mushroom cloud can form as the flames meets in the middle.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria has also begun its planned burning schedule and will be conducting planned burns in the forests.</p><p>Mr Hope said while the CFA appreciated community members remaining vigilant and calling in fires as they are observed, in order to reduce the instances of brigades being called out unnecessarily to planned burns, he encouraged people to first have a closer look.</p><p>\"Planned burns must be performed in calm conditions with no wind. If conditions are like this, people can probably safely assume it is a farmer burning off,\" he said.</p><p>\"Don't be alarmed but if you are, investigate a bit further. If you can see smoke, have a closer look and try to see if farmers are working at the fire edge. And try to get an exact address.\"</p><p>While permits are being issued for farmers, Mr Hope said the strict conditions enforced as part of the fire danger period still remained for other community members.</p><p>This means that it is illegal to light a fire in the open air, unless a permit is issued and strict requirements are abided by.</p><p>Despite this, there have been a number of illegal burn offs in recent weeks.</p><p>\"Some people think because it's rained or because farmer Joe or farmer Bill was burning in his paddock that they can, that as soon as it rains the restrictions are automatically lifted but they aren't,\" Mr Hope said.</p><p>\"To lift the fire danger period we have to go through a decision making process. It doesn't just automatically come off after it has rained.\"</p><p>A police spokesperson said that the majority of fires each summer were caused by people being careless, by leaving a campfire unattended or operating machinery on a day of total fire ban.</p><p>\"Careless behaviour regarding fires has the same potential consequences as those caused by arson, easily leading to the destruction of life and property,\" they said.</p><p>While police understand that farmers stubble burn to prepare for sowing the following season's crops, the burns are undertaken with CFA approved permits in safe conditions.</p><p>However, police have responded to stubble burns which have reignited in hotter, windier conditions several days later.</p><p>\"Farmers have a responsibility to ensure that their stubble burns are completely extinguished, including around fence lines and trees.</p><p>\"The message to all is clear, it's everyone's responsibility to be mindful of their activities during fire danger periods, otherwise your actions could result in a bushfire.\"</p><p>Depending on the circumstances, police may charge a person on summons with lighting a fire on a day of total fire ban. The penalty for lighting a fire during a total fire ban can be up to two years in jail or up to $40,000 in fines.</p><p>Further, anyone found guilty of recklessly or intentionally causing a bushfire faces a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment.</p><p>Last fire season there were two fires later in the season - one at Bunkers Hill in late March and the other at Mt Clear in mid-April.</p><p>Mr Hope said that while much of the region is greener due to recent rains, there was an underlying dryness in the forests so they could still burn in the right conditions. He said residents should not rule out warmer weather in coming weeks or the potential for a fire.</p><p>\"If we get strong winds from any direction, that would fan fires. Even though it is milder, we could still have issues so we encourage everyone to exercise caution,\" he said.</p><p>A date has not been set for the end of the fire danger period, but it is expected to remain until May.</p><p>Have you signed up to The Courier's variety of news emails?

Tackling the 20-kilometre challenge while carrying a 20-kilogram bag to symbolise the burden mental illness can have on a sufferer, he walked alongside mate Stuart Radley - another firefighter who knew Mr Shanahan well.</p><p>Mr Madden, who left the army three years ago, has overcome the often difficult step to seek help.</p><p>\"It was certainly tough asking for help initially but now that I've crossed that hurdle, it's easier,\" he said.</p><p>He began working as a firefighter almost immediately after departing the army, which assisted with his assimilation back into society.</p><p>Tearing up, he said the past 12 months had been particularly difficult as he was missing the military and some of his mates who have died.</p><p>Mr Madden believes the event is a good way to raise awareness of the mental health issues so many people face.</p><p>\"I think that's really all you can do - to encourage people to reach out and spread the word that it's 'okay not to be okay' and to ask for help.\"</p><p>It was also an emotional day for dozens of Forest Fire Management Victoria employees from across Victoria.</p><p>Chief Fire Officer Chris Hardman said the event was a powerful display of the camaraderie between the men and women of all services, who were united in a common desire to raise awareness of an issue that sees many of their own take their lives.</p><p>Articulating that he had always been motivated to attend the event, he said this year was particularly significant given the effect the fire season has had on so many people.</p><p>In this fire season alone, FFMV lost three friends and colleagues - David Moresi, Mat Kavanagh and Bill Slade.</p><p>\"We lost three fine human beings and to me as the chief, that was particularly difficult, but it pales in comparison to the loss felt by their friends and family,\" Mr Hardman said. \"Things like this do contribute to PTSD and mental illness (for others).\"</p><p>While FFMV employs measures to ensure there is a focus on employees' well-being on the job, he said staff worked in dynamic, high-risk environments that do come with stress and often anxiety and fear which has an impact.</p><p>Explaining that he too has suffered from mental illness, though in a mild way, he said he understood what it felt like to feel hopeless but that he asked for help.</p><p>\"People still don't talk enough about mental illness.

Even so, it will be impossible to include all the things that deserve attention. I should add that all of these works can be viewed online at the Metropolitan Museum website, with high-quality images and insightful, accurate commentary.</p><p>We may start with an early Crucifixion (c. 1420-23) by Fra Angelico, several years before Masaccio's work at the Brancacci Chapel. The figures do not yet have the solidity and firm stance that Masaccio introduces, but they are full of closely observed details and brimming with psychological life: there is a particularly interesting play of glances between the various characters. In the foreground, Christ's mother Mary has fainted from grief; she is attended by two holy women and Mary Magdalene in scarlet, while John, in blue and pink, weeps at the foot of the cross; the skull is that of Adam, whose original sin is redeemed by the death on the cross.</p><p>Nearby is another small painting, Giovanni di Paolo's Paradise (1445), inspired by part of Fra Angelico's Last Judgement (c. 1631), but the Sienese painter ignores the Florentine innovation of perspective in favour of an imaginary, tapestry-like space in which figures stand above rather than behind those in front of them. The composition is full of Dominicans, including Saint Dominic and Saint Thomas Aquinas, since the painting was part of a commission for that order, as well as other recognisable figures, such as Saint Augustine with his mother Monica in the centre. But above all Paradise is imagined as a place where those who loved each other in life - whether as parents, friends or lovers - will be reunited in joy.</p><p>The world of Piero di Cosimo's Hunting scene (c. 1495-1500) could not be more different. Piero, a complex and reclusive artist, is inspired by the Latin philosophical poem De Rerum natura, rediscovered in 1417 and first printed in 1473, in which its author Lucretius gives a comprehensive Epicurean and materialistic account of the world. One of the objects of the Epicureans was to banish the fear of the divine by demonstrating that the gods have no role in nature and take no interest in our conduct.</p><p>In this picture and its companion, The Return from the Hunt, also at the Met, Piero ponders the life of primitive man, as yet barely distinct from beast and still living in the company of fauns and centaurs. The forest fire raging in the background follows Lucretius's suggestion that early humans used fire to drive animals out of the woods and kill them, but it also acts as a metaphorical image of the extreme violence of the hunting and killing in the foreground. Even animals attack each other in the frenzy, and on the lower right a dead man reminds us that we are not always victorious in the contest.</p><p>Death and hunting are again associated, but only by implication, in Titian's Venus and Adonis (1550s), a subject of which Titian and his workshop produced many variants.</p><p>The immediate source of the story, as often in the renaissance, is Ovid's Metamorphoses, a poetic compendium of mythology linked by the theme of transformation, but its origins are much older. The goddess is shown trying to dissuade her young lover from going to the hunt, where he will be killed by a boar.</p><p>The strange but memorable attitude of Venus is borrowed from a minor antique relief of Cupid and Psyche (the figure of Cupid seems to have inspired Michelangelo's figure of Christ in the Piet\u00c3\u00a0 and, through this work, David's Death of Marat).</p><p>But the psychological tension of the composition is between the clinging female body and the active, departing male one, momentarily joined by an intense but ambiguous meeting of the eyes; while the pictorial magic arises from Titian's miraculous union of colour and tone, and his execution of the whole picture, figures and background, from almost the same palette.</p><p>Love is Caravaggio's theme too in one of the most important of his works to have been seen in Australia, albeit an early one, The Musicians (1597), which I last saw in the outstanding Caravaggio exhibition at the Scuderia del Quirinale in Rome in 2010 (reviewed here at the time). The picture was painted for Cardinal del Monte, one of the first to recognise the artist's talent, and includes what is generally accepted to be a self-portrait - the swarthier figure in the background, shown playing a cornet.</p><p>Although it would be anachronistic to call Caravaggio homosexual (or even bisexual), since such a category did not yet exist and the artist had relations with women as well, many of his early works are undeniably homoerotic and he seems - interestingly in view of Freud's ideas about narcissism - to have been attracted to boys who looked rather like himself. Here the connection is with the lutenist (possibly, as Keith Christiansen suggests, a castrato), and the cupid on the left binding together light and dark grapes is probably an allusion to the union of dark and fair; there is even a formal allusion in the way the two heads tilt towards each other. And the union of opposites was at the same time a familiar conception of musical harmony.</p><p>Two paintings by Rembrandt and Vermeer also have an allegorical character, and yet one is complex, explicit and programmatic, while the other is mysterious and hard to pin down. Rembrandt's late Flora (c. 1654) catches our attention by its very awkwardness, the unusual profile view of the head at right angles to the torso. Titian's Flora (c. 1515), which the artist could have seen in Amsterdam, has been cited as an inspiration, but her frontal torso is more harmoniously matched with a head seen in the normal three-quarters view. Rembrandt, however, is probably referring to a profile drawing of his wife Saskia, who had died in 1642; Orpheus-like, he conjures her back to life as the symbol of springtime and renewal, and yet she forever gazes away into the distance, and this is what imbues the painting, in spite of its ostensibly happy subject, with a mood of solemnity and sadness.</p><p>Vermeer's Allegory of the Catholic Faith (c. 1670-72) uses a familiar device, the foreground curtain, to lead us into an interior space, here imagined as a private chapel, since public celebration of the mass was illegal at the time in Protestant Holland. The composition is filled with a repertory of religious symbols, from the chalice, reminding us of the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine of the Eucharist, to the apple on the ground recalling original sin. But Vermeer's acute sense of literal reality is such that we feel as if we are looking at an elaborate mise-en-sc\u00c3\u00a8ne which never turns into a spiritual vision as in Italian baroque paintings.</p><p>One of the most important paintings in this exhibition, and again one of the most significant works by this artist to have been shown in Australia, is Nicolas Poussin's Saints Peter and John Healing the Lame Man (1655). As the museum notes, this is one of three great cityscape subjects painted at around the same time, the others being Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (1653) and The Death of Sapphira (1654), both of which are in the Louvre. All of these works reflect a renewed meditation on Raphael, partly because two of them are drawn from the Acts of the Apostles, illustrated by Raphael in the Cartoons (Victoria and Albert Museum).</p><p>More deeply, however - and as I discussed at greater length in French Painting in the Golden Age (Thames &amp; Hudson 2003) - Poussin is here concerned with the action of what Christians would consider the Holy Spirit (pneuma hagion) and what he, in his more syncretistic and philosophical perspective, identified with the Stoic Logos, the reason or spirit that governs the cosmos. This Greek philosophical term had already been used by St John in the opening of his Gospel: \"In the beginning was the Word\".</p><p>The other two paintings mentioned demonstrate the power of the Word to redeem in the first case and quite literally to bring death in the second (Sapphira's death is the consequence of her lie); and here, in the first miracle of the Apostles after Christ's death, Peter discovers that he, too, can become the instrument of the Word or Logos and heal a cripple, while John points to the celestial original of their power.</p><p>But there is more. It may seem strange that this important subject is dwarfed, in the middle ground, by apparently secondary figures in the foreground; but that is because they are not secondary after all: there are no accidents or oversights in Poussin's work. Look at the costumes: Peter is wearing the blue and yellow which are his standard colours in iconography; the young man on the right is wearing green and red, which are the colours of Saint Paul, and the point is made more emphatic by the overlapping of his figure with that of Peter.</p><p>This young man must be Saint Paul, who first appears as Saul a few chapters later in Acts, initially as an enemy of the Christians, before his famous conversion on the road to Damascus. But it is typical of Poussin's originality - as we see in his mythologies too - to adopt a more philosophical interpretation of the story: the real action of the Logos in this picture is not merely in healing the cripple, but in taking possession of the mind of Saul, who points towards the miracle while the old man on the right, departing with an appalled expression on his face, represents the mind that is impervious to the Word and remains trapped in darkness.</p><p>Thus this picture could perhaps better be titled The Conversion of Saint Paul, something which seems to have escaped all other Poussin scholars until now, and which I had not realised until I studied the picture closely in Brisbane. And there is yet more: we may see in the figure of Paul an allusion to justification by faith, while the balancing figure on the left, giving alms to a poor woman, stands for justification by deeds; but in a final example of Poussin's extraordinary originality as a philosopher-painter, the focus is not on the giver of alms, who appears almost distracted, but on the recipient of the charity, who seems to experience a kind of epiphany as she receives not a material gift but the Word itself.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-f0cbc388d3d111eb8c7b65ec41e58b106d6b344e1490fad80e7313c71dc69115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6323-TSW1-F0JP-W47H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 3, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MCB (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000672</classCode><className>EXHIBITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009UKP</classCode><className>PAINTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp;
