agencies prepare resources for the coming months. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It comes as the State Government's own analysis of residual fire fuel loads in the region sit seven per cent higher than targets, with Bureau of Meteorology climatic forecasts for spring highlighting a potential early start to bushfire season through the Wimmera, Grampians National Park, and the Mallee. </p><p>The National Emergency Management Agency has flagged areas of Australia, including Victoria's far west and southwest, as particularly vulnerable to fire risk this spring, following \"an unusually dry autumn and winter\". </p><p>Dry winter conditions aligns with the Victorian Government's own analysis of residual bushfire risk to the state, with the government's fuel-driven bushfire risk for the Grampians region and district in 2022-23 sitting at 77 per cent, seven per cent higher than the target of 70 per cent for the region. </p><p>Forest Fire Management chief officer Chris Hardman said the FFMVic has reduced bushfire risk across more than 138,000ha of public lands - including the Grampians region - throughout the year, \"building on the 90,000ha treated last year\". </p><p>It is understood FFMVic has undertaken planned burning this year, including ecological burns at Wilsons Promontory, and mosaic burns in the Otways and Lower Glenelg National Park. </p><p>\"This isn't just about a single burn or one season, it's about ongoing work we've done in the past and continue to do year round, as well as our future plans to keep protecting our communities,\" Mr Hardman said. </p><p>\"In addition to managing bushfire risk on public land, FFMVic is ready to respond with more than 3000 personnel working alongside our emergency sector partners to keep communities safe and informed about bushfire risk and how best prepare over the summer season.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The entire series of articles and interchanges is listed below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/14/an-alternative-perspective-to-david-lindenmayer-south-east-timber-association/\">South East Timber Association\u2019s (SETA) critique</url>, I want to clarify the scientific evidence and address the inaccuracies in their claims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Logging increases fire risk </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2013 the consequences of ignoring the evidence</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SETA disputes the well-documented link between logging and increased fire severity, but the scientific consensus is clear: logging fundamentally alters forests in ways that make them more flammable. The science is clear that logged forests almost always burn at higher severity than intact forest \u2013 as seen in the Black Summer wildfires from north-eastern Victoria to north-eastern New South Wales (Lindenmayer et al. 2022b) \u2013 an effect that lasts from 40-70 years after a forest has been logged (Taylor et al. 2014) (Wilson et al. 2022).</p><p>What\u2019s at stake here isn\u2019t just an academic debate\u2014it\u2019s the safety of rural communities. Fire authorities, including the NSW Rural Fire Service, already recognise this risk. During the catastrophic 2019\u20132020 wildfires, operational maps flagged recently logged areas as high-risk zones due to excessive debris accumulation. This isn\u2019t just theory; it\u2019s an acknowledged hazard in real-world firefighting.</p><p>The reasons for the link between logging and increased fire risk are well understood: logged forests are drier, windier, and littered with hundreds of tonnes of debris, creating ideal conditions for intense and severe wildfires (Lindenmayer and Zylstra 2024). This has been documented not just in Australia, but globally\u2014including both North America and South America (Lindenmayer and Zylstra 2024).</p><p>Dismissing scientific findings from detailed empirical studies that show the link between logging and wildfire isn\u2019t just misleading\u2014it\u2019s dangerous. If we ignore what the science and firefighting agencies are telling us, we increase the likelihood of more devastating fires, putting lives, property, and ecosystems at risk. Rather than debating well-established facts, the focus should be on solutions: that is, both preventing future logging-driven fire risks and also investing in smarter fire management strategies that protect both people and the environment (Lindenmayer et al. 2022a).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LoggingCoupeandstumpTas2024DL2.25.jpg\">Logging coupe and large burned stump, Hartz Mountain, Tasmania, June 2024.Photo: supplied</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Native forest logging is not economically viable</emphasis></p><p>The economic case for native forest logging is weak. Time and again, financial analyses have shown that native forest logging operates at a major loss when subsidies and environmental costs are accounted for (Frontier Economics and ANU 2021, Frontier Economics 2023). Public funds continue to prop up a native forest logging industry (Chapman et al. 2025) that degrades water supplies, biodiversity, and carbon stores\u2014all of which economic accounting studies have shown have significantly higher long-term value than native forest logging (Keith et al. 2017). The future lies in plantation-based forestry (Lindenmayer and Taylor 2022), not in the continued destruction of native forests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Logging is driving species declines</emphasis></p><p>SETA downplays the impact of logging on biodiversity, but the reality is undeniable: native forest logging is a major driver of habitat destruction (Ward et al. 2024). Species like the critically endangered Leadbeater\u2019s Possum are on the brink due to habitat loss. Old-growth forests cannot simply be \"replaced\" with young regrowth. The science is clear\u2014logging fragments ecosystems, removes critical nesting sites, and pushes species towards extinction. It is also critical to understand that recent studies show that the recovery of biodiversity following wildfires is severely impaired when forests have been subject to repeated previous disturbances, including past logging (Lindenmayer et al. 2019). This was a key result from a recent major analysis of the effects on the 2019-2020 Black Summer wildfires on biodiversity (Driscoll et al. 2024).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The way forward: smarter fire management</emphasis></p><p>Rather than continuing to debate well-established science, efforts should be directed toward solutions that reduce fire risk and protect both people and the environment. Victoria\u2019s fire management authorities have already demonstrated in just the last week, the effectiveness of proactive suppression strategies. Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) has successfully used aerial water-bombing and rapid air attack responses to control recent fire ignitions, particularly those caused by lightning strikes. These targeted interventions prevent small fires from escalating into large-scale disasters, underscoring the importance of early detection and rapid response. The best time to fight fires is when they are small (Plucinski 2012). Using new technology to help us do that is critical (Lindenmayer et al. 2022a) \u2013 something that engineers and scientists at The Australian National University have been working intensively on for several years now (Lindenmayer et al. 2022a).</p><p>The next step in strengthening fire management is developing and implementing advanced drone technology. Emerging high-tech drone systems have the potential to revolutionise firefighting by providing real-time fire surveillance, detecting ignitions faster than ever before, and even carrying out autonomous suppression efforts in hazardous conditions (Yebra et al. 2021). For example, new generation drones can carry payloads of 1000kg and hit targets such as recent ignitions with extraordinary precision. Investing in these innovations\u2014rather than continuing a logging regime that makes forests more fire-prone\u2014is the logical path forward. Moreover, developing these technologies offers important business and export opportunities for Australia to help tackle the global problem of increasing fire risk in forests (Bousfield et al. 2023).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>The scientific and economic evidence overwhelmingly supports ending native forest logging\u2014not only to protect biodiversity and water supplies but also to reduce bushfire risk and limit economic losses from a failing and highly subsidized industry (Lindenmayer 2024). The ongoing degradation of native forests contradicts both environmental responsibility and public safety. With modern fire management strategies proving their effectiveness and technological advancements offering even greater possibilities, the focus must shift toward smarter, science-driven solutions. The future of Australia\u2019s forests should be built on sound economics, resilience, conservation and innovative fire mitigation\u2014not industry myths that put communities at risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">References</emphasis>- Bousfield, C., D.

The CFA is currently deep into its calculations for the 2024-25 summer fire outlook.</p><p>\"We've had some significant rainfall deficits in the south-west region for at least 18 months,\" Dr Harris said.</p><p>\"But after a dry winter and spring, we're not just talking about the southwest now.</p><p>\"Parts of the north-east of Victoria are starting to dry out. And that south-west Gippsland area heading across to Mornington Peninsula are also dry as well.</p><p>\"So with a warm summer coming, that's really concerning.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc7y3e6uux9ldcfbpraic</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFF-NX31-F0J6-J0NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 18, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climatic disasters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Seasonal Bushfire Outlook for Summer gives a picture of the likelihood of fire over the summer months, at both a state and national level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year's outlook for Victoria predicts higher potential for fire for most of western Victoria, as well as south-west Gippsland, including Mornington Peninsula, greater Melbourne and north-east Victoria.</p><p>The potential has been assessed this way because of the dry conditions in those areas, the availability of vegetation (e.g. grass, leaves, bark, shrubs and fallen branches) to 'fuel' fires, high temperatures and the continuing lack of rainfall to bring moisture to the landscape. The fire potential elsewhere in Victoria has been assessed as 'normal', but hot, dry and windy weather can still pose a risk in areas dominated by forests, woodlands, or dense, low shrubs.</p><p>'Normal' is no reason to be complacent, but you should know Victoria is prepared and our land and fire agencies have worked all year to reduce our bushfire risk.</p><p>On public land this year, FFMVic carried out risk reduction works across more than 138,000 hectares - and because it isn't just about this summer or this season, I'm happy to tell you we also carried out works on more than 90,000 hectares the year before. The impacts are cumulative.</p><p>Risk reduction works include planned burns, mowing, mulching, slashing and spraying. Collectively, we call these works 'fuel management'. They reduce the amount of vegetation (e.g. grass, leaves, bark, shrubs and fallen branches) available to 'fuel' a fire, thereby reducing the likely speed or intensity of a bushfire. These qualities can help fire crews to respond and put out fires while they are still small. Visit plannedburns.ffm.vic.gov.au</p><p>Last month we saw some of the reward for those efforts, with a fire in the Great Otway National Park - the Chapple Vale-Colac Tree Road fire - showing reduced spread in the footprint of one of our planned burns back in August.</p><p>Recent weeks have also shown how we work together with, and alongside, our emergency sector partners. On the frontline, FFMVic has close to 1800 personnel, including full-time and seasonal firefighters, fire lookout observers and fire support officers. In recent months, many of them have completed training and accreditation to make sure they are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to be safe and help keep communities safe this summer.</p><p>They are supported by hundreds of emergency and incident management staff, including surge staff who have a fire and emergency role, in addition to their day job, as well as firefighting equipment. This includes tankers, earthmoving equipment and aircraft positioned across the state - as well as additional aircraft that can be called upon when needed. Summer is a festive time in Victoria. But opportunity is never without responsibility. Now is also the time to prepare yourself and your loved ones for the fire season. Here are some quick tips to help you get started.</p><p>Five tips for Victorians 1. Visit cfa.vic.gov.au to help you get started on a Bushfire Plan so you know what you will do in case of fire</p><p>2. Download and get to know the VicEmergency app - then set up 'watch zones' and turn on notifications</p><p>3. Get to know the Australian Fire Danger Ratings System - and work out what fire danger rating will trigger your Bushfire Plan</p><p>4. Plan your travel - visit exploreoutdoors.vic.gov.au to help you stay safe when visiting state forests</p><p>5. Never leave a campfire unattended - if they are cool to touch, they are safe to leave.</p><p>Wishing everyone a safe and happy festive season.</p><p>- Chris Hardman, Chief Fire Officer, Forest Fire Management Victoria</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc7yd5ppuaik316pe0dkcr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DKC-H4F1-JD34-V003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 7, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>National parks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSY2</classCode><className>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The budget deficit had increased by $1.4 billion since the $2.2 billion forecast in the May budget, the papers reveal.</p><p>Mr Pallas announced that the rate of the state's fire services levy - collected by councils for the state government to pay for the emergency service - would be doubled, increasing revenue from the tax by $2.14 billion over the next four years.</p><p>The median cost per household will rise from $191 to $254, but commercial properties will pay an extra $492, while the bill for farmers will jump from $621 to $1299, under the changes.</p><p>The levy will be renamed the emergency services and volunteers fund and retooled to provide money towards other emergency services, such as Triple Zero Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>\"The state always cuts it cloth to meet the needs of the community. We have to accept we are living in a changing and more dangerous environment, and we have to make provisions for it,\" Mr Pallas said.</p><p>The government will also axe a $100 discount on registrations for EVs from January 2026, which is forecast to add $165 million to state revenue by 2028.</p><p>And Victoria's congestion levy, a parking tax in inner-city Melbourne, will be expanded and increased, bringing in an extra $300 million over four years.</p><p>Mr Pallas said he did not expect the cancellation of the EV rebate to discourage EV takeup - it's original purpose was to encourage it - and that the government did not \"need to be out there proselytising that people should get onto EVs\".</p><p>\"It's a little rich to continue a process of subsiding the registration of these vehicles in circumstances where you're not paying for the use of the road,\" he said.</p><p>Net debt to GSP is projected to climb from 24.2 per cent to 25 per cent in 2025 before peaking at 25.2 per cent in 2026 and dropping back to 25 per cent in 2027-28.</p><p>Pressure has been growing on Premier Jacinta Allan over Labor's management of the state economy, and escalated when independent economist Saul Eslake published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/how-victoria-became-a-poor-state-and-the-16-charts-that-prove-it-20241122-p5ksuq\">a detailed critique</url> in The Australian Financial Review last month.</p><p>Ms Allan has rejected the criticism, and this week announced a plan to try to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/allan-vows-to-cut-red-tape-cosy-up-to-business-to-revive-victoria-20241204-p5kvpf\">revive business investment</url> in the state.</p><p>On Friday, Mr Eslake said the dire state of Victoria's finances appeared \"little changed\" in the latest update, adding: \"At least it hasn't got any worse.\"</p><p>But the government's revenue measures fell far short of what was needed to start reining in ballooning state debt and government spending.</p><p>\"There's been no material change in the government's fiscal strategy - no serious effort to rein in either operating or infrastructure spending,\" Mr Eslake said.</p><p>\"[There's] a little bit of additional revenue-raising, and as yet no credible path back to an overall cash surplus which would allow it to start paying down debt, as opposed to merely running it up at a slower pace.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, high-profile Liberal MP Sam Groth quit the opposition frontbench on Friday in what could be the first sign of a leadership move against embattled Liberal chief John Pesutto.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr Pesutto was found to have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/vic-liberal-leader-loses-nazi-defamation-trial-knives-come-out-20241209-p5kx0e\">defamed ousted Liberal MP Moira Deeming as a Nazi sympathiser</url> and ordered to pay her $300,000, worsening an internal crisis in the party.</p><p>Mr Groth - a former professional tennis player who has made no secret of his ambition to be premier - said as \"a matter of conscience\" he could not stay on the frontbench following Mr Pesutto's refusal to step down following the verdict.</p><p>Upper house MP Bev McArthur on Friday urged Mr Pesutto to test his leadership by calling a party meeting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas this week said his state was the nation's strongest performing econony. </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-p5ky8fafr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNF-MMJ1-JBJ7-N16G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"688\"/><timeReceived>7:12 AM UTC</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5889\">new study</url> shows that forest fires have become more widespread and severe amid global heating, particularly in the high northern latitudes such as Canada and Siberia where fires are most sensitive to hotter, drier conditions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The implications of this are alarming, not just for the ecosystems affected or the cities engulfed by smoke downwind, but for the planet's ability to store carbon and regulate the climate. The trend we discovered contrasts with declining fire extent in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4108\">savannah grasslands</url>, which may reflect the expansion of farming and changing rainfall patterns.</p><p>We established the leading causes of forest fires in different parts of the world using an AI algorithm. It grouped forest regions into distinct zones with similar fire patterns and underlying causes, uncovering the worrying extent to which climate change is fuelling the expansion of forest fires in Earth's high northern latitudes.</p><h>More fires in 'extratropical' forests</h><p>Since 2001, emissions from fires in forests outside of the tropics, like parts of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-s-a-boreal-forest-and-the-three-other-types-of-forests-around-the-world\">boreal forest</url> in the far north of North America and Eurasia, have nearly tripled. This rise is largely the result of hotter, drier weather occurring more frequently, combined with forests growing more efficiently in places where the cold once stunted their growth.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020RG000726\">Climate change</url> is creating ideal conditions for larger, more intense fires, which accelerate climate change in turn by releasing more carbon to the atmosphere. In fact, we found that global carbon emissions from forest fires have increased by 60% over the past two decades. The largest contributions come from fires in Siberia and western North America. </p><p>This trend shifts the focus of forest fire emissions from tropical forests, where fires set to make room for farmland have long contributed carbon to the atmosphere. Conservation policies have reduced deforestation rates since the early 2000s in some regions, particularly <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2023/11/deforestation-in-the-brazilian-amazon-falls-22-in-2023/\">Amazonia</url>. By contrast, increasing fires in northern forests, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/taiga/\">the taiga</url> - the forest of the cold sub-arctic region - are driven by changing climate conditions and generally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01322-z\">started by lightning</url>, which makes them harder to prevent.</p><p>Not only is the area affected by fires expanding but the fires themselves are growing more severe and releasing more carbon, according to our new findings. This corresponds with an <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/extreme-wildfires-have-doubled-in-just-20-years-heres-the-science-233375\">earlier study</url> that found fires are doing more damage to ecosystems globally than in the past. Fires are burning through drier and more flammable vegetation as global temperatures rise and droughts become more frequent.</p><p>In northern forests, more severe fires can burn deep into the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03437-y\">soil</url> and release carbon that has accumulated over centuries. Forests can remain <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/extreme-wildfires-are-turning-the-worlds-largest-forest-ecosystem-from-carbon-sink-into-net-emitter-201019\">net carbon emitters</url> for decades after burning and the more severe fires become, the longer it takes forests to rebound and recapture carbon lost during the fire. </p><h>What does this mean for the planet?</h><p>The steep rise in fire emissions from forests outside the tropics is a clear signal that the capacity of Earth's forest to store carbon is at increasing risk. </p><p>Forests, particularly in northern regions, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01274-4\">absorb and store CO?</url> from the atmosphere. But as fires expand and become more severe, these vital carbon sinks are weakened. This undermines the global effort to tackle climate change as forests <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adj6951?casa_token=iqXxXgUOTnkAAAAA%3AyYNvGqqxbuCpa2JVdY7vneGLjjUARJASo0JmXpiSJWSQOUBzShxew01xG1SqVx6CB0lCvxHGgsk_90T7\">offset emissions</url> from human activities that burn fossil fuels.</p><p>Forest fires, long considered part of the natural carbon cycle, are increasingly driven by human-caused <url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020RG000726\">climate change</url>. Yet, international reporting standards don't differentiate between \"natural\" levels of forest fire emissions and the higher emissions we're seeing due to climate change. </p><p>This allows excess fire emissions caused by humans to fall outside the scope of national carbon budgets tracked by organisations like the United Nations. <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.17392\">Gaps</url> emerge between the carbon emissions we think we're managing and the actual amount that's passing between the land and the atmosphere.</p><p>What drives fires in different regions varies, so addressing this growing threat requires tailored approaches. Outside of the tropics, proactive forest management is essential. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811272400197X\">Carefully managed fires</url> and thinning out vegetation can mean fires ultimately cause less damage when they do ignite. Monitoring vegetation growth, alongside fire-favourable weather conditions, can help identify and prioritise areas for intervention. </p><p>In tropical forests, reducing ignitions (especially during droughts) and preventing forest fragmentation is key to protecting these ecosystems and their carbon stocks. This may help prevent the more extreme fires that turn tropical forests from carbon sinks into <url normalizedValue=\"https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/9685/2023/\">sources</url>.</p><h>Increasing fires are a symptom of climate change</h><p>Limiting the burning of fossil fuels is central to minimising future fire risk. Without drastic cuts to <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/it-can-be-done-it-must-be-done-ipcc-delivers-definitive-report-on-climate-change-and-where-to-now-201763\">greenhouse gas emissions</url>, more severe and widespread forest fires are likely, with increasing damage to ecosystems, biodiversity and the climate.</p><p>Our study also highlighted the importance of updating international reporting standards on carbon emissions. As forest fires become more closely linked to human-driven climate change, it's crucial that fire emissions be included in national carbon budgets to provide a more accurate picture of the planet's carbon fluxes.</p><p>There is also a risk of overestimating how much carbon is stored by reforesting areas, especially outside the tropics. Many carbon offset schemes rely on planting new trees or delaying the harvest of existing ones to absorb CO?, but if the growing threat of forest fires isn't properly accounted for, these projects could fail to deliver the carbon savings they promise. </p><p>Forest fires are no longer just a natural occurrence. As they shift north and intensify, these fires are a clear symptom of human-caused climate change. </p><p>It's essential to recognise the growing role that fires play in the carbon cycle. By doing so, we can better manage fire risks, safeguard forests and ensure a more resilient future for the planet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Get our award-winning weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

Businesses will pay an additional 100 per cent and major industrial users will pay an extra 64 per cent.</p><p>The hefty levy hikes imposed on farmers and other businesses sit in stark contrast to the public benefit rate the government has applied to solar, wind and battery developments.</p><p>Renewable developers contributions will rise by just 0.1 per cent in 2025-26, as the government only charges them the public benefit rate of 5.7c/$1000 CIV.     </p><p>The <url

three months after the government raised the FSPL rate for farmers by 70 per cent, from 16.9c/$1000 in 2023-24 to $28.7c/$1000 of CIV</url>.</p><p>All up the latest hike equates to an almost 400 per

stripped the CFA of almost $70m to fund other emergency agencies</url>. </p><p>Under the new body, the ESVF will now fund up to 95 per cent of the CFA's budget, up from 77.5 per cent under the FSPL.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

So ... occasionally it's not possible for [firefighters] to make a difference,\" he said.</p><p>\"We can't stay strongly enough how critical it is that you don't leave your decisions too late. We don't want anybody to die.\"</p><p>In the Macedon Ranges, the 144-hectare Bullangarook fire near Gisborne \"has enormous potential to spread all the way into the northern suburbs of Ballarat,\" Hardman said.</p><p>On the Bass Coast, crews were using bulldozers to create a perimeter around the smaller bushfire near The Gurdies, he said. Nugent said several sheds had already been lost in that 200-hectare fire.</p><p>\"That fire has enormous potential to grow on Boxing Day,\" Hardman said.</p><p>\"And for all of the fires, think about the winds: They will start coming strongly from the north, then they will be a westerly and south-westerly change.\"</p><p/><p>Nugent said it would also be far easier for new dangerous fires to start on Thursday and Friday. He said temperatures in Victoria's north would be around 38 to 42 degrees and would be accompanied by hot, gusty northerly winds.</p><p>\"Later in the day we expect a wind change to occur late afternoon and then the strong and gusty winds from the south-west and west. They could be up to 100 km/h,\" he said.</p><p>Nugent said more than 100 extra firefighting resources had been called in from Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. Eighty specialist firefighters would be deployed to the Grampians. Seventy firefighting aircraft would be ready to support crews on the ground.</p><p>On the weekend, Emergency Services Minister Vicki Ward spoke with her federal counterpart Jenny McAllister and was told the Commonwealth was preparing disaster relief payments for those who have been displaced.</p><p>The popular tourist town of Halls Gap was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/halls-gap-evacuated-as-authorities-warn-grampians-fire-will-burn-for-weeks-20241221-p5l04y.html\">evacuated on Saturday</url> as southern winds pushed an out-of-control fire towards it.</p><p>Emergency warnings have since been downgraded to watch-and-act alerts, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/19vcyuet9d/\">Halls Gap CFA said on Monday</url> the road to the town remained closed and residents were unable to return.</p><p>Late on Sunday, incident controller Aaron Kennedy said strong south-west winds were causing spot fires to start north of Halls Gap. \"As a result, Halls Gap remains closed,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, watch-and-act alerts remained active for Pomonal, Mafeking, Moyston, Great Western, Bellfield, Bellfield Settlement, Flat Rock Crossing, Fyans Creek, Grampians Junction, Barton, Watgania, Lake Fyans, Bellellen, Black Range, Jallukar, Lake Fyans, Londonderry, Rhymney and Willaura North.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/vicemergency/status/1871031402482786426\">Twitter link</url></p><p>Two relief centres remain open in Ararat and Stawell.</p><p>In February, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/a-grampians-town-s-remarkable-recovery-after-the-beast-burnt-through-20240502-p5fojj.html\">fire raced down from the Grampians and consumed 44 homes in Pomonal</url>, destroying one-third of buildings in the tiny town.</p><p>\"Thankfully we did not lose a single life and that is because people are listening to the messaging we have,\" Nugent said on Monday.</p><p>On Saturday, incident controller Mark Gunning used a town hall meeting in Ararat to remind locals of the Mount Lubra bushfire in 2006, which burnt through about 184,000 hectares, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/counting-the-cost-of-the-states-bushfires-20060125-ge1mqb.html\">killing Malcolm Wilson, 36, and his 12-year-old son Zeke</url> when their car was engulfed by flames at Moyston.</p><p>\"I'm not comparing the two, but we did see a fire on a really bad day run about 22 kilometres in 16 minutes,\" Gunning said. \"So that gives you an idea, on those bad days, of what you've got to be prepared for.\"</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Our Breaking News Alert </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">will </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">notify you</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> of significant breaking news when it happens. </emphasis></emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p56yl1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get it here</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></emphasis></url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-p5l0ejsmh</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DPY-3RT3-RRV4-N258-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>5:57 AM UTC</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Despite this, the Allan government maintains it will record an operating surplus the year after, even though it has to spend more money on the Metro Tunnel and the state's hospitals.</p><p>The fire services levy will be renamed the emergency services and volunteers fund [ESVF] and retooled to provide money towards the State Emergency Service, Triple Zero Victoria, the State Control Centre, Forest Fire Management Victoria and Emergency Recovery Victoria.</p><p>The charge, which appears on rates notices, will grow from 8.7 cents for every $1000 of a property's capital improved value, to 17.3 cents next financial year.</p><p>The fixed-cost part of the charge will also remain but will rise in line with inflation, going from $132 this year to $136 in 2025-26.</p><p>It is forecast that by 2028 this levy will collect $1.8 billion in revenue, compared to $1.033 billion collected by the fire services levy at present. The median cost per household, according to the government's expectations, would rise from $191 to $254.</p><p>But other types of properties will be hit even harder. Commercial properties will pay $492 more on average while primary producers such as farmers will pay more than double, rising from $621 to $1299.</p><p>On the website outlining the changes, the government says every dollar raised will go towards \"vital life-saving equipment, vehicles, staff, training for volunteers, community education, and recovery support for when Victorians need it most\".</p><p>\"Variable rates will be higher under the ESVF than the FSPL [fire services levy] to account for the ESVF's larger scope.\"</p><p>Treasurer Tim Pallas also confirmed that the state's congestion levy, a tax on private and public car park operators around the inner city, would be expanded and rise in line with a similar charge in Sydney.</p><p>The charge on category 1 areas, which include Melbourne CBD, Southbank, Domain, Docklands and East Melbourne, will go up from $1690 to $3030. The category 2 zone will be expanded to include inner-eastern suburbs along Hoddle Street and Punt Road that are not currently subject to the levy. They include areas in Richmond, Prahran and South Yarra.</p><p>The costs are passed directly on to carp park users.</p><p>From January 1, 2026, zero and low-emission vehicles will also no longer receive a $100 discount on their registration. By 2027-28 this is expected to bring an extra $93 million into the state's coffers.</p><p>The mid-year budget update, released yesterday, reported Victoria's deficit, forecast in May for the 2024-25 financial year at $2.2 billion, has grown to $3.6 billion. However, the document says the budget is still on track to record an operating surplus in 2025-26, and is forecasting a $100 million improvement, with a surplus of $1.6 billion.</p><p>Speaking yesterday, Pallas denied that the changes to levies were designed to protect his budget surplus, pointing to more frequent natural disasters straining resources and a need to reduce car dependence while making congestion charges fairer.</p><p>He said the emergency services levy would cost the typical household about $60 a year extra or a \"cup of coffee a month\".</p><p>\"Victoria is now seeing net debt as a proportion of the economy fall for the first time since 2017 in this budget update,\" Pallas said.</p><p>\"Net debt and net debt as a proportion of the economy are improved ... Overall, net debt is down again now to 25 per cent of the size of the economy by the end of the estimates.\"</p><p>Net debt is now forecast to be $187.3 billion in 2028, an improvement of $500 million.</p><p>This financial year, net debt will be $155.2 billion, compared with a budget forecast of $156.2 billion.</p><p>Shadow Treasurer Brad Rowswell said Pallas' comments on the cost of a coffee showed a failure to grasp the cost-of-living pressures faced by Victorians. \"If you can't understand that, it's time to go, it is the biggest issue facing Victorians at the minute,\" he said. \"Victoria still has the highest debt of any state ... even NSW has $48 billion of debt less than Victoria does.\"</p><p>The fire levy changes came as Emergency Services Minister Jaclyn Symes announced a funding boost of more than $250 million for the Country Fire Authority and the state emergency services, including $70 million to replace trucks, tankers and pumpers.</p><p>Symes said the changes to the levy would require legislation, with the intention it would take effect by July 2025.</p><p>\"I'm hoping that other political parties will see the benefit in the support that this brings to Victorians and emergency service volunteers,\" she said.</p><p>\"Communities are asking more of their local SES volunteers than they ever have before, which is why we're giving them more funding, new trucks and the latest technology.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7ygm20snu6q1im993nlk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DMV-JRH1-JD34-V32Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

fire fears as rangers find plastic coating dumps in Bathurst area</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PATROLS have been increased in state forests in the Bathurst area after a number of incidents in which rangers found piles of plastic coating that had been burnt off cabling.</p><p>A major concern, according to Forestry Corporation, is that the fire, when the coating is being burnt off, will spread into the pine plantations.</p><p>It comes ahead of a looming hot end to February - and summer - in which Bathurst is predicted to get to 36 degrees on Thursday and 35 on Friday before temperatures cool down on the weekend.</p><p>Forestry Corporation says forest rangers have found the piles of plastic coating at several locations in the area.</p><p>Evidence found at one burn site in Sunny Corner State Forest, according to Forestry Corporation, allowed the corporation to identify and contact a local business, \"which advised that a large quantity of cabling had recently been stolen\".</p><p>Forestry Corporation says it is suspected that the offenders burn the plastic conduit off the wire because bare wire fetches higher prices with scrap metal dealers than plastic coated cable.</p><p>\"When staff find one of these sites, we notify police,\" Forestry Corporation ranger Paul Robb said.</p><p>\"A key concern for Forestry Corporation is the risk that the fires will spread into the pine plantations.</p><p>\"There is also a cost to Forestry Corporation to remove the leftover wire coating and associated rubbish from the state forests.\"</p><p>Forestry Corporation says it is increasing patrols and monitoring to identify illegal activity and has called on the public to contact authorities if they see anything suspicious in state forests.</p><p>\"A recent illegal dumping incident also saw asbestos dumped in a state forest, which had to be removed from the site by a certified contractor,\" Mr Robb said.</p><p>\"Illegal dumping of hazardous materials creates a huge public safety risk and is an unnecessary cost to the public service.\"</p><p>Forestry Corporation says acts of illegal dumping on Crown land and in state forests can be reported directly to the NSW EPA on 131 555, NSW Police on 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.</p><p>Along with on-the-spot fines for individuals of $4000 to $7500, the penalties for illegal dumping in NSW are severe and can include fines of up to $250,000 for individuals and up to $1 million for corporations.</p><p>Repeat offenders can face additional penalties, including imprisonment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In the 30 years from before 2003, the season started early just five times, but in the following 15 years it started early 10 times: a fourfold increase.</p><p>More bushfires, more area burned Dr Harris said it wasn't just the fire danger that had increased - so had actual fires. \"We've seen an increase in the number of fires, but more importantly in the area burned by fires each year,\" Dr Harris said.</p><p>\"Over the last two decades, we've had three seasons that have had over a million hectares burnt in Victoria, which is a real standout for us.</p><p>\"And that's not even including Black Saturday, which had devastating impacts, but didn't burn such a large area.\"</p><p>While the million-hectare mark had been breached three times in the past 20 years, it had only happened once in the preceding 80 years.</p><p>The pattern continued at lower thresholds, with years where 400,000 hectares were burned becoming more than five times likelier since 2003.</p><p>It's going to keep getting worse Since the Black Summer fires in 2019-20 there have been several La Nina years with milder weather.</p><p>Dr Harris said last summer was \"a strange one\".</p><p>\"We thought we were in for an extreme summer, but then I think the moment we put a seasonal outlook out it just started raining ... but then it was just like the tap turned off, and we ended up with a really dry January and had those late-seasons fires where we lost a lot of houses,\" Dr Harris said.</p><p>But she said while climate systems like ENSO - which drive the El Nino/La Nina cycle - will bring variability from year to year, the overall trend is for more frequent and intense fires.</p><p>\"In the north-west and central areas of Victoria we are looking at a doubling of the very high fire danger days by the end of the century,\" Dr Harris said.</p><p>In some areas that could mean half the year is spent in very high fire danger.</p><p>In other areas like Gippsland, where the number of fire danger days is lower, that figure is likely to triple by 2100.</p><p>What's in store this summer? The CFA is currently deep into its calculations for this summer's fire outlook.</p><p>Dr Harris said they were still assessing the weather outlook, but the winter and spring conditions had brought large parts of the state into potential fire danger.</p><p>\"We've had some significant rainfall deficits in the south-west region for at least 18 months,\" she said.</p><p>\"But after a really dry winter and spring, we're not just talking about the south-west now ... so with a warm summer coming, that's really concerning.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WRBLST-doc7y3e70nk744zcxmw5vh</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRBLST2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFF-NX31-F0J6-J0KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"607\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 18, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climatic disasters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9M</classCode><className>SEVERE SUMMER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Grampians National Park that has burnt more than 10,100ha.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With hot, dry conditions set to continue into Saturday, communities have been warned to be ready for the fire in case it \"punches out of the Grampians.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0</p><p>Vic Emergency downgraded an emergency warning for an area taking in the Grampians, Mirranatwa, Victoria Valley, Jimmy Creek to a \"Watch and Act\" just after 8.30am Thursday, with people being urged to prepare to leave.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>By Friday the bushfire had covered more than 10,100ha, with emergency services saying it \"could burn for weeks\" given its difficult position.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Residents of Mafeking and Watgania were told to leave immediately on Friday afternoon and head towards Willaura as the blaze moved east and then toward Mount William, covering skies above western Victoria - including part of Melbourne - with smoke and prompting emergency services to warn about air quality.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A relief centre was opened at Alexandra Oval Community Centre in Ararat.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"There is a bushfire in the Grampians National Park - Yarram Gap Road that is not yet under control,\" the evacuation warning read.</p><p>\"The bushfire is travelling from the Grampians National Park in a northeasterly direction towards Mt William.</p><p>\"The fire activity has increased under the southwesterly wind change.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>At an information session on Thursday in Willaura, incident controller Mark Gunning said the fire was burning in some fairly inaccessible areas and was exacerbated by two years of deficient rainfall in western Victoria.</p><p>\"This is a really serious fire,\" he said.</p><p>\"As the fire dangers increase over Friday, Saturday these communities need to be ready for fire in case it punches out of the Grampians.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Mr Gunning said the blaze was expected to continue north on Friday and Saturday, with a southerly change on Friday evening.</p><p>He said the flames had reached private land on the east and west side, with reports of damaged outbuildings and one house that firefighters successfully helped a resident protect on Wednesday night.</p><p>There have been no reported injuries.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Fifth generation farmer Geoff Gellert, who attended the Willaura meeting, said he was concerned about the fire because of fuel that recently blew into his property from a nearby swamp.</p><p>\"I thought I was in a really good condition because our paddocks were bare,\" he said.</p><p>\"But on Monday we had a tremendous wind from the north and we're alongside the Mount William swamp.</p><p>\"It blew all the fairy grass into our property and around the house.</p><p>\"There was a door we couldn't get out of ... it blew so much fairy grass against the house.\"</p><p>Photos show piles of the native plant massed high against parts of Mr Gellert's home and fence line.</p><p>\"So now we're contending with that and it's really volatile,\" he said.</p><p>\"It burns like crazy</p><p>\"I've gone from thinking, we're safe, to oh, man.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Mr Gellert's worries stem from experience.</p><p>He grew emotional as he recalled fires in 2006, when he lost livestock on a turn of the wind.</p><p>\"It just comes back to you,\" he said.</p><p>\"All of a sudden we had a wind change and it just cleaned them all up.</p><p>\"We spent the following day after the '06 fire shooting and burying sheep like so many others.</p><p>\"For farmers whose job it is to look after them, it is really gut-wrenching.\"</p><p>Mr Gellert said there should be more cool burning done in the area to reduce fuel loads.</p><p>On Thursday afternoon there were 200 firefighters from the CFA and Forest Fire Management Victoria battling the bushfire alongside what Mr Gunning called \"the vast majority\" of the state's aerial firefighting fleets.</p><p>That included 13 bombers and observers, nine helicopters, two tankers going back and forth from Avalon, and several dozers and graders.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>CFA Willaura brigade captain Robert Guttler on Thursday helped lead five tankers, five private fire trucks, and multiple motorbikes in a controlled roadside burn southeast of the main fire ground, near Bornes Hill, to prepare for possible worsening conditions.</p><p>\"We normally do this every year,\" he said.</p><p>\"Around Willaura we have done these ones already.</p><p>\"We just hadn't got to Bornes Hill side yet because of harvest and manpower.\"</p><p>He said if the wind turned on Friday, the road could be used as as fallback point.</p><p>\"If it is trickling out in grassland then hopefully if it's going slow enough we can pull it up,\" he said.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Wednesday warnings: Leave now</p><p>Residents in Mirranatwa, the Grampians and Victoria Valley were on Wednesday warned to leave immediately before it was too late.</p><p>Drivers approaching Dunkeld from the west on Wednesday afternoon were met with a large grey cloud above the Grampians in an otherwise clear sky, with the ranges smouldering on the horizon.</p><p>It's understood there were about half a dozen homes in the fire's path when it made its way over a ridge about 2pm.</p><p>Campgrounds have been evacuated in the holiday hotspot.</p><p>Yarram Gap Rd remained closed in both directions from Grampians Rd in Mafeking to Moyston-Willaura Rd in Willaura on Thursday morning.</p><p>Victoria Valley Rd is also closed in both directions between Dunkeld and Mirranatwa.</p><p>A relief centre has been opened for those seeking assistance at Sterling Place Community Centre, 14 Sterling Place, Dunkeld.</p><p>A couple staying in Dunkeld in order to attend a wedding in the Mount William area on Thursday were unperturbed by the smoke.</p><p>They said they had been asked to download the Vic Emergency app, but so far their plans stood.</p><p>Up-to-date information on the safest exit routes is available online at <url

You should leave using Casterton-Edenhope Rd and head towards Casterton. When you leave remember to take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. In the car:</p><p>If you are travelling, do not enter the area. Make a u-turn and travel to safety. Slow down and turn on your headlights. Smoke will make it difficult to see. If you are unable to leave you should shelter indoors:</p><p>Close all exterior doors, windows and vents. Turn off cooling systems. You must take shelter before the fire arrives. The extreme heat is likely to kill you well before the flames reach you. Shelter in a room that has two exits, such as a door or window including one directly to the outside. It is important to be able to see outside so you know what is happening with the fire. If your home catches on fire and the conditions inside become unbearable, you need to get out and go to an area that has already been burnt. If you cannot get indoors, other last resort options include:</p><p>Shelter in the middle of a large open area like a ploughed paddock, football oval or sporting reserve. Get into a large body of water like a dam, lake, river, the ocean or inground pool. Try to protect yourself from the fire's heat. If you are caught in fire in your car:</p><p>Park behind a solid structure to block the fire's heat or pull over to cleared area. Try to position the car towards the approaching fire. Turn on your hazard lights and headlights. Close all windows. Turn off the air-conditioning and shut all the air vents. Turn your car engine off. Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a pure woollen blanket. Impacts in your area:</p><p>The following roads are closed:</p><p>Casterton-Edenhope Rd north of Chetwynd and south of Kadnook Powers Creek-Bourkes Bridge Rd from Powers Creek. Spot fires and embers are starting fires up to 3 kilometers ahead of the main fire.</p><p>This messages was issued by Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>The next update is expected by 16/11/2024 08:00 pm or as the situation changes.</p><p>Use multiple sources to stay informed:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.emergency.vic.gov.au\">www.emergency.vic.gov.au</url> VicEmergency Hotline - freecall 1800 226 226.

You should leave using Casterton-Edenhope Rd and head towards Casterton. When you leave remember to take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. In the car:</p><p>If you are travelling, do not enter the area. Make a u-turn and travel to safety. Slow down and turn on your headlights. Smoke will make it difficult to see. If you are unable to leave you should shelter indoors:</p><p>Close all exterior doors, windows and vents. Turn off cooling systems. You must take shelter before the fire arrives. The extreme heat is likely to kill you well before the flames reach you. Shelter in a room that has two exits, such as a door or window including one directly to the outside. It is important to be able to see outside so you know what is happening with the fire. If your home catches on fire and the conditions inside become unbearable, you need to get out and go to an area that has already been burnt. If you cannot get indoors, other last resort options include:</p><p>Shelter in the middle of a large open area like a ploughed paddock, football oval or sporting reserve. Get into a large body of water like a dam, lake, river, the ocean or inground pool. Try to protect yourself from the fire's heat. If you are caught in fire in your car:</p><p>Park behind a solid structure to block the fire's heat or pull over to cleared area. Try to position the car towards the approaching fire. Turn on your hazard lights and headlights. Close all windows. Turn off the air-conditioning and shut all the air vents. Turn your car engine off. Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a pure woollen blanket. Impacts in your area:</p><p>The following roads are closed:</p><p>Casterton-Edenhope Rd north of Chetwynd and south of Kadnook Powers Creek-Bourkes Bridge Rd from Powers Creek. Spot fires and embers are starting fires up to 3 kilometers ahead of the main fire.</p><p>This messages was issued by Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>The next update is expected by 16/11/2024 08:00 pm or as the situation changes.</p><p>Use multiple sources to stay informed:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.emergency.vic.gov.au\">www.emergency.vic.gov.au</url> VicEmergency Hotline - freecall 1800 226 226.

We're asking all Victorians to understand your local risk,\" he said.</p><p>\"Only drive through the areas that are in Extreme if you absolutely have to.\"</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria's Chief Fire Officer Chris Hardman said wind changes were a significant and dangerous time during a fire.</p><p>\"Most fatalities occur on bushfires at the time of the wind change,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>He warned the south-westerly winds could cause the Grampians fire to spread rapidly towards communities on the eastern side of the blaze.</p><p>\"When Mother Natures decides that she's going to push fire at a rapid rate, it becomes what we call 'beyond suppression limits' so firefighters, occasionally, it's not possible for them to make a difference,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Hardman said a fire burning at Creswick, north of Ballarat, also had potential to threaten heavily populated areas.</p><p>\"That fire has enormous potential to spread all the way into the northern suburbs of Ballarat,\" he said.</p><p>The Country Fire Authority's Chief Officer Jason Heffernan said humidity would remain in the single digits and any rain would likely only be small showers.</p><p>\"The fuel is very dry, the bush is dry. It is ready to burn,\" he said.</p><p>\"Boxing Day will not be a day to be complacent.\"</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Vicki Ward said the state government was looking to enact disaster relief payments to those affected by the Grampians fire during the crucial Christmas period.</p><p>\"At the moment the focus is on immediate response \u2026 but of course we do also understand how challenging this can be for a community that relies very heavily on tourism,\" she said.</p><p>She thanked the fire crews as well as the volunteers at emergency relief centres.</p><p>\"A part of that gratitude means if you don't need to travel on Boxing Day, please don't,\" she said.</p><p>\"We need you to be safe, we need those communities to be safe.\"</p><p>Pomonal CFA captain Steve Field said containment lines were holding on the northern end but the southern part of the fire was generating numerous breakouts.</p><p>\"Anxiety levels between the brigade members and the local community are pretty high,\" Mr Field said.</p><p>\"Having the presence of other strike teams and fire trucks supporting us has been really great, but it's really just a watch and wait here in Pomonal.\"</p><p>Mr Field said Christmas had been put on hold.</p><p>\"With the weather going to be around 35 [degrees] on Christmas day and then up to 42 with the northerly blowing, that'll be a considerable concern for us,\" he said.</p><p>\"We just have to be prepared and hope that the containment lines are back burning work.\"</p><p>Temperatures across the state are forecast to steadily climb during the week, reaching the mid 30s on Christmas Day and as high as the low 40s in some areas on Boxing Day.</p><p>The fire danger rating on Boxing Day is forecast to be Catastrophic in the Wimmera and Extreme in the Mallee, Northern Country, North Central, South West and Central districts.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://au.livecenter.com/frame/abc-news-prod/3391/default\">[LIVE
