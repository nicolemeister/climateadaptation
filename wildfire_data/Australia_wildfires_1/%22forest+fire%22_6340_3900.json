A second heat burst set records in some northern parts of the state that had only been set a few days earlier.</p><p>\"Hot, dry northerly winds ahead of [a] trough and cold front contributed to New South Wales, southern Queensland, and areas in neighbouring states experiencing unprecedented hot weather for this time of the year,\" the bureau said in its report.</p><p>While associated with large high pressure systems, the bureau noted global warming had pushed up background temperatures by about a degree over the past century for Australia and the planet as a whole, making the occurrence of such extreme events more likely.</p><p>\"Studies undertaken by the bureau and other scientific institutions have shown that climate change has contributed to the severity and frequency of recent heat events, including spring warmth,\" it said.</p><p>The special report comes a day after new research showed Australian cities such as Melbourne and Sydney need to prepare for summer days when the temperature climbs to 50 degrees in decades to come - even if nations kept to Paris climate pledges to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees.</p><p>The bureau's report also noted that unusually dry conditions contributed to the recent abnormal heat. Both Sydney and NSW, for instance, posted their driest Septembers on record last month. Statewide, rainfall was just one-seventh of the usual amount for the month, extending a worsening dry spell that has lasted about three months.</p><p>Sydney, meanwhile, is on track to break the record for the most days in a row with less than 2 millimetres of rain.</p><p>The current record, spanning August-October 1989, stands at 64 days, a record likely to be match on Saturday and broken on Sunday, if current forecasts are correct, Blair Trewin, the bureau's senior climatologist, said.</p><p>The recent significant heat emerged on September 21, with almost all the country recording above-average temperatures, the bureau said.</p><p>Australia as a whole recorded its warmest September day on record the following day, with a mean maximum temperature on 33.47 degrees. That was more than 6 degrees warmer than the September average, and eclipsed the previous September record of 33.39 degrees set on September 30, 1998. For NSW, though, the biggest heat spike came on September 23, with a large inland area reaching 16 degrees above average during the day. Apart from setting NSW's first September day with a maximum of 40 degrees, the statewide average maximum of 35.81 degrees smashed the previous record set in 2003 by 1.61 degrees.</p><p>An odd quirk in the heat was the range during the day, with some areas warming 30 degrees from their overnight minimums.</p><p>Canberra Airport, for instance, ranged from 1.3-30.2 degrees during the day, exceeding the previous record for any month of the year for the diurnal range.</p><p>Victoria posted its hottest September reading on September 23, with Mildura clocking a 37.7 reading.</p><p>For Queensland, the peak of the heat hit on September 27 when 36 per cent of the state had its hottest September day.</p><p>The state's mean maximum temperature that day reached was 37.79 degrees, eclipsing the previous September record of 37.43 degrees set in 1988.</p><p>The ongoing lack of rain in many regions has meant less cloud cover and available soil moisture to be evaporated, helping to drive daytime temperatures higher. There is some hope for better rainfall in the weeks ahead, including signs that the Pacific is tilting towards La Nina conditions. During La Nina events, eastern Australia tends to have above-average rainfall although cyclones also tend to increase in frequency in the Australian region.</p><p>Before the change, though, farmers and fire fighters are in for an anxious few weeks if not longer.</p><p>As the bureau's special report noted, dangerous fire conditions emerged during the recent heatwaves, including during the shorter second wave at the end of September. According to the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index, values exceeded extreme levels at many sites across the country from September 22-27, the bureau said.</p><p>Most of the nation had fire danger index ratings above average at the end of September.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc6wzce4s3ueqv5uuu46v</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PMW-4G81-JD34-V46Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The submission council will make to the planning panel will propose that landowners can remove any dead vegetation from their property without a permit except for standing dead trees with a trunk diameter of 40cm or more and a height of 1.3m above ground level.</p><p>This is the same as the current ESO.</p><p>Amendment C101 has not changed people's bushfire mitigation rights. If a Bushfire Management Overlay applies, people can still clear trees up to 10m from their property and vegetation up to 50m from their property. There are more activities that people can do for bushfire mitigation that doesn't need a permit.</p><p>Visit council's website at nillumbik. vic.gov.au/c101bushfire for more details on the amendment.</p><p>If residents believe that a greater amount of vegetation management is required -beyond that allowed under the exemptions, then they can apply for a planning permit to do so, which will be assessed on its merits and with regard to CFA guidelines.</p><p>Nillumbik Council approved 98 per cent of all planning permits applications last year.</p><p>BRONNIE HATTAM, Nillumbik Mayor</p><p>Lower speed not a solution I HAVE been following the debate regarding the possible lowering of the speed limit on Chute St, Diamond Creek, with interest.</p><p>I use the crossing on Chute St about 6.15am every weekday and have done so for about the past 10 years.

The Weather Channel defines heatwaves using the 5/5 rule - five consecutive days where the maximum temperature equals or exceeds five degrees above the average.</p><p>\"There is heightened risk of bushfires this season for most of the country compared to the 2010/11 and 2011/12 seasons,\" Mr Whitaker said.</p><p>\"Grassland areas of inland New South Wales and southern inland Queensland are most at risk, thanks to the heavy rainfall of the past two La Nina years which has resulted in heavy vegetation growth,\" he said.</p><p>During the severe weather season Australia encounters two types of bushfire; grass fire and forest fire.The potential for grass fires is dependent on the previous severe weather seasons rainfall. The risk of forest fires can increase as a result of long hot, dry periods followed by days with extreme heat, strong winds and low humidity.</p><p>Hot northerly winds ahead of a south-west change is the key weather pattern to watch and has been the weather setup behind most of Australia's most devastating forest fires.</p><p>editor.liberal@ruralpress.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DUBDLY-66pamhijo6s8rigy4nq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DUBDLY2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56MB-6761-JD34-V3MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385957</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"354\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Dubbo Daily Liberal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>September 21, 2012 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp;

That method, however, is based only on weather, such as temperature, relative humidity and wind speed.</p><p>The variables includedin the National Fire Danger Rating System Probabilistic Framework range from fuel load and its type, the nature of the terrain and the housing density in a particular region.</p><p>A prototype was tested in the Sydney region including the Blue Mountains and an areaeast of Melbourne stretching from the Dandenong Ranges to Phillip Island. The model will be tested by fire authoritiesin NSW this fire season, with thefindingsto date publishedby the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.</p><p>\"You can have a region with a lower fire rating but have a particular location with a higher risk,\" Trent Penman, a bushfire behaviour specialist at the University of Melbourne, and anotherdeveloper of the new model. \"For people in those properties to know they are at higher risk would be beneficial for their preparations.\"</p><p>Victoria and NSW are divided into large fire districts, and the new model potentially could provide \"fine grained\" warnings of potential property loss down to five kilometres or less.</p><p>'National priority'</p><p>Richard Thornton, chief executive of theBushfire and Natural Hazards CRC, said the existing fire danger rating system had been largely unchanged since the 1960s.</p><p>\"A new fire danger rating system is a national priority and it is crucial that it is underpinned by the best science available,\" Dr Thornton said.</p><p>\"This is about improving public safety and using science to more accurately predict and communicate bushfire risk,\" he said. The work is being coordinated by the federalAttorney-General's Department and involvesstate and territory emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, and several universities.</p><p>Kevin Tolhurst,an associate professor in fire ecology at theUniversity of Melbourne, said the probabilistic model was one of several being considered by fire authorities.</p><p>The new system could take \"two or three years before it is routine\", and a key issue will be how the information is communicated to the public, particularly if warnings becomemuch more detailed.</p><p>While avoiding confusion will be a challenge, the more specific warning may also result in greater involvement from residents.</p><p>\"With fire management, you want individuals to respond to what is a community problem,\" Professor Tolhurst said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Communities and firefighters could soon receive real-time warnings of risks from bushfires down to a matter of kilometres, according to a new model being tested this fire season</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ILMYAU-6mssd412jvkno3zeno8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ILMYAU2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H7D-8VD1-JD34-V3RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314241</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Illawarra Newspapers Holdings Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Illawarra Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 16, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

The Brussels-based European Forest Fire Information System warns that the fire risk remains high, especially along the western Mediterranean. Many of the countries at risk are those suffering public spending cutbacks that have eaten into local rescue service budgets.</p><p>Worst hit has been Spain, where 140,000ha of woodland have been destroyed in Catalonia, in the Cabaneros National Park in the centre of the country and in the Donana National Park in the southwest.</p><p>Spanish Environment Minister Miguel Arias Canete emphasised yesterday that the national firefighting budget was the one item that had not been sliced from his budget in the tough public spending cuts. But, he added, it was up to regional governments how they allocated their resources and he could not be held responsible for their decisions. ``Each region decides freely where it will make its cuts,'' he said. ``And each region will now have to analyse whether its fire precaution measures are sufficient.''</p><p>Cold comfort in a spectacularly hot season, in particular on the Canary Islands where residents are -- in between evacuating their homes -- already demonstrating against the local administration for trying to balance the budget by sacking firefighters. Asier Antona, secretary-general of the Partido Popular (People's Party) on the Canaries, accused the governor of the islands, Casimiro Curbelo, of being a ``political pyromaniac''.</p><p>Because of the cuts there were insufficient helicopters to deal with the blaze as it swept through the ancient, thickset woodland. Mr Curbelo had to plead with the national government for six additional fire-extinguishing helicopters and had to make do with two borrowed from Morocco.</p><p>About a half-dozen firefighters have died in southern Europe.

Forty-two cases involve corporations, including two foreign investment companies - Kayung Agro Lestari (PT KAL) from Australia and PT ASP from China.</p><p>West Kalimantan police spokesperson Arianto told Fairfax Media there was fire in Kayung Agro Lestari's concession.</p><p>\"Therefore we are investigating the company,\" he said. \"We have called witnesses from the local community, from the company itself and experts. We don't have any conclusions at the moment because the investigation is still ongoing.\"</p><p>In a statement late last month, Kayung Agro Lestari said that as of September 22, 356 hectares on its 17,998 concession had caught fire. \"These fires were caused by windborne sparks from fires outside our plantation area,\" it said. \"All of these fires have been put out by our team.\"</p><p>The statement said Kalimantan was facing an extremely dry climate and high winds. \"Together they make the plantation vulnerable to outbreaks of fire, especially from wind-borne sparks originating in fires outside our plantation.\"</p><p>Kayung Agro Lestari said it was in daily coordination with the police and regional disaster management in fighting the fires and investigating their causes.</p><p>\"The most serious outbreak PT KAL has witnessed was a fire affecting a large area of land just beside our plantation. Our team has worked together with the local authorities and communities to contain the fire. We also recorded that five orangutan fled from the fire and moved into our conservation area. As far as we can determine they are unharmed.\"</p><p>Rising global demand for palm oil, which is widely used in food and cosmetics, has led to the clearing of forests in Indonesian national parks, high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the destruction of the habitat of endangered species including the Sumatran orangutan and tiger.</p><p>Kayung Agro Lestari is a subsidiary of PT Austindo Nusantara Jaya Agri, which is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.</p><p>Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certification is an assurance to buyers of palm oil products that the standard of production is sustainable.</p><p>With Amilia Rosa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1001113027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H2Y-DVT1-DXMH-114P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><timeReceived>05:19 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Neither side of politics is prepared to commit to funding much-needed health services there. The vital new Footscray Hospital is being built closer to the CBD - i.e., further away from the population it is meant to service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Werribee Mercy Hospital can only cater for 40 per cent of our current population of 270,000, which is expected to double in the next 20 years. We have no plastic surgery, no colposcopy, and huge waiting lists for orthopaedics and colonoscopies. Women are driving past Werribee Hospital to have babies at Sunshine because of capacity issues. There is not even funding to plan for an expansion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead what the west gets are community \"hospitals\" which are basically day centres. Interestingly, both Melton and Werribee bucked the statewide trend at the 2018 state election and recorded 7 per cent swings against the government. The underfunding of health services in the western suburbs is an embarrassment to both sides of politics. We deserve much better.</p><p>Dr Joe Garra, Werribee South</p><p>The right to work on site</p><p>It is disturbing that the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union was fined $50,500 for stopping work over demands for a separate toilet for a female worker and a bigger shed for 16 workers (The Age, 14/11). As a young female engineer in the 1980s, at times I had to share a male bathroom on site. It was truly horrible, particularly as the arrangements made for me to use the bathroom increased the hostility of some male workers towards having women on site.</p><p>Fortunately we got a female bathroom. This meant that more women felt safe enough to work on site. Female toilets are a vital measure in improving women's participation in non-traditional areas. It was a no-brainer 30 years ago, but we have clearly gone backwards. Thank goodness for strong unions.Andrea Bunting,</p><p>Brunswick</p><p>What's good for the goose</p><p>The chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia says the proposed demerit system for unions \"provides an incentive to make sure union officials are behaving well\" (The Age, 11/11). In which case the same should apply to executive and board members of mining companies that over-extract water, issue hazardous waste, cause air pollution, pollute waterways and fail to restore abandoned mine sites.</p><p>Jane Touzeau, Elwood</p><p>Police self-protection?</p><p>If l were a police officer confronted with a group of rowdy activists, and I felt the need to whack them with my truncheon or spray them with pepper spray or push them over, I would turn off my body-worn camera first or delete the footage afterwards (The Age, 12/11). Better to face a reprimand than a charge of assault.</p><p>Ben Laycock, Barkers Creek</p><p>Let down by my Labor</p><p>Thank you, Nick Legge - \"Devil in detail of Andrews' logging announcement\" (Comment, 13/11). When I heard that the Premier had halted the felling of old-growth trees in Victoria, I applauded. Now I see that the felling was limited and grandfather trees in the Toolangi forest and Rubicon are still open to rampant destruction in the next five years.</p><p>Of course, the \"forestry industry\" will ramp up its efforts to \"compensate\" for the decision so that there will be no trees left to seed their future. What a disappointment. I assume it has been made as a compromise between loggers' interests and those of the environmental movement to protect votes. Can't the Premier see that this compromise fails both ways? As a lifetime ALP voter, I now realise my loyalty has been terribly misguided.Martin Shaw,</p><p>Mirboo North</p><p>Liberals' crocodile tears</p><p>So the Victorian Liberals are concerned about the mental health of timber workers (The Age, 14/11). Where were their concerns when their federal counterparts closed the auto industry, putting at least 10 times as many people out of work?Geoff Mulhall, Caulfield</p><p>The forgotten birds</p><p>The peregrine falcons nesting above Collins Street have been a hit with the public (Comment, 11/11) with many thousands of people watching the livestream.</p><p>If duck-cams were on our wetlands, they would show waterbirds going about their lives - feeding, swimming, diving. But if the cameras streamed from March until June, people would see the carnage of duck shooting for themselves. There would be an outcry. All birds are equal but it seems that some birds are more equal than others.Vikki Addicott,</p><p>Preston</p><p>Ready and happy to assist</p><p>I suggest the ABC gets its act together and takes on the non-commercial broadcast rights for the 2020 Olympic Games in quick time. The broadcast of the games is at the very heart of what the ABC is supposed to be about. If budgetary constraints are really an issue, then I make my services available to the managing director. I guarantee I will be able to identify savings that are more than sufficient to finance the costs of carrying the Tokyo Games and the one after that.Garry Ringwood,</p><p>Kew</p><p>State-wide cycling issues</p><p>The lack of a unified cycling network, as raised by David Joyce in relation to Melbourne (Letters, 14/11), applies equally in country towns. Here in Port Fairy - which should be a cycling-friendly town with its wide, flat roads - we also have disappearing bike lanes, lack of signage, unsafe road edges and dangerous intersections.</p><p>It is well documented that the major barrier to cycling participation is a perceived lack of safety on the roads. Even in a small town like ours, these problems appear to be significant deterrents to cycling by old and young alike.Paul Bucci,</p><p>Port Fairy Bicycling Action Group</p><p>Protecting the residents</p><p>The fires in New South Wales and Queensland are an ominous portent of the threat facing Victoria. It is interesting, therefore, to read the most recent edition of the Indigo Shire Council newsletter. It advises that landowners must remove fire hazards on their land.</p><p>However, it also advises that unauthorised removal of dead trees and vegetation on roadsides is forbidden. The conflict between the two would be laughable if it were not so serious. It is obvious that the roadsides are fire routes into the heart of our towns. Dead trees overhang the roads and if they fall, they would block the escape route for residents. Grass and fallen timber litter the roadsides. Certainly there is a need to provide a habitat for native wildlife and endangered plants but protection of residents must be the highest priority of any council.</p><p>Bill Wilson, Beechworth</p><p>The climate science is in</p><p>Kerry Stokes, we do not need to make \"snap judgments\" about responding to climate change (The Age, 14/11). The way forward has been well and truly documented for years - see all the reports by Ross Garnaut and others. But somehow the education system has failed the government and its members cannot read and understand those policy maps. Shame on them.</p><p>Peta Colebatch, Swan Reach</p><p>Our reckless disregard</p><p>Is anyone else interested in properly describing what confronts us? Not natural disasters and acts of Mother Nature. Rather unnatural disasters with Mother Nature on the run, as are the poor victims of our reckless disregard and failure to recognise and prioritise our health and the environment.</p><p>Pip Carew, South Melbourne</p><p>The crews in green</p><p>Several readers (Letters 12/11 and 13/11) have called for a paid, full-time fire fighting force to fight bushfires, reduce fuel loads and work with Aboriginal groups to learn traditional fire management. It is an excellent idea, that is why we already have it. Forest Fire Management, the crews in green overalls, do those things.</p><p>Peter Bear, Mitcham</p><p>Seeking rational thought</p><p>Barnaby Joyce and Craig Kelly's cringe-inducing comments about bushfires only reinforce the perennial call for aptitude testing for those seeking elected office. Our politicians must demonstrate a capacity for informed, rational thought. Unless hard evidence prevails over the current conservative cult of placing greater weight in \"feelings\" and \"beliefs\", subsequent discourse is only degraded. Our modern secular democracy deserves so much better.John Bond,</p><p>Croydon</p><p>Greens must accept blame</p><p>The Greens are correct that climate change makes bushfires more frequent and more intense. They know it now and they knew it in 2009 when they voted down the Rudd government's emissions trading scheme and joined with Tony Abbott's Liberals. The Greens should accept that they helped create the very situation no less than the political parties they deflect the blame to.</p><p>Phillip Edwards, Churchill</p><p>Dangerous daylight saving</p><p>Our Deputy Prime Minister is correct. It is only leftist greenies who bang on about climate change. And the situation would be much worse if Queensland had daylight saving. Imagine that extra hour of sun at the end of each day heating things up.Michael Brinkman,</p><p>Ventnor</p><p>Hope - just for a moment</p><p>For a moment my heart leapt as I read Jessica Irvine's article - \"A speech we'd like to hear\" Comment, 14/11). If only the Prime Minister could actually say and do what was in the piece, it could arrest and even turn around the serious continuing fall in trust in government that is undermining the whole country.</p><p>Marcus Wigan, Eaglemont</p><p>Vote 1 for Irvine</p><p>Jessica Irvine should write all of Scott Morrison's speeches. Better still, let's have her as prime minister.Cath Dyson, Mount Eliza</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc77yxwaq9olfyuhll55r</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH2-P281-F0J6-J05X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

How we live in this environment, how we mitigate the risk is a conversation I should expect,\" she says.</p><p>\"Hectares are an arbitrary number, whereas what Victorians, I think, are really expecting of my teams and myself is to reduce the risk to their communities, so (a planned burn) 300ha around Lorne can have a much greater impact than 30,000ha in the back country.\" The first female and first Kiwi, to take up the role, Dr Rotarangi has more than 2500 staff working from 101 depots across the state in her charge.</p><p>Direct from New Zealand's Otago Rural Fire Authority, where she served as chief executive and principal rural fire officer - New Zealand's highest operational rank - Dr Rotarangi has more than 20 years' experience in forestry and fire management.</p><p>When it was announced in June last year that she would be crossing the ditch to join DELWP the Otago Daily Times suggested \"like Phar Lap, Crowded House and pavlova, one of (its) best senior firefighters has been claimed by the Aussies\".</p><p>In some ways Dr Rotarangi's first year as chief fire officer was made easier with a relatively quiet fire season - by March, Victoria had not experienced a bushfire that lasted more than several days.</p><p>\"One of the benefits of a quieter fire season last year was my ability to get around and meet staff and meet other agency staff and meet community members,\" she says.</p><p>Admitting she had limited experience of Victoria before arriving here, Dr Rotarangi said she had \"been on the road non-stop\" since arriving.</p><p>\"Is that enough? Definitively not, but there's only one way to approach it,\" she says.</p><p>The initiation was not without its challenges.</p><p>\"There were a lot of emergencies across the state from floods - in my first week we were straight into floods - the spring was really quite volatile and incredibly wet.</p><p>\"That ability to understand emergencies in terms of a number of hazards has been really good, working side-by-side with SES and Vic Police.\" In the course of her meeting with The Weekly Times, Dr Rotarangi singles out the ability of Victoria's emergency services to work together as \"exceptional\" on several occasions.</p><p>\"It's the jewel in our crown,\" she says. \"Gone are the days when any one agency can really meet all the needs of Victorian communities ... we all have our own statutory responsibilities, points of excellence really, but we work in a way that is collaborative \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 from the outside it might be hard to imagine how it is pieced together, but it provides a seamless service to the community.\" That includes working with the Country Fire Authority.</p><p>\"I am really conscious of how lucky we are to work beside the CFA, particularly in planned burning, because the skills that they bring and the local knowledge they bring and dedication to the community is so commendable,\" Dr Rotarangi says.</p><p>It is likely DELWP's forest fire management crews will work closely with CFA on wildfire too, with an early start to the bushfire season forecast, particularly in the east of the state. \"All the indicators at the moment are suggesting that much of Victoria will have an above average bush fire season,\" Dr Rotarangi says.</p><p>\"So you might recall a pretty warm winter - it didn't feel like it, but it was quite a warm June and July - that causes a lot of growth to germinate.</p><p>\"It is great for the farmers, but that means increased growth in the forests.\"Compounding concerns were a damp spring last year and a dry, warm autumn this year, which had created less than favourable planned burning conditions. DELWP last month announced it would bring planned burning forward as early as this month. Regardless, Dr Rotarangi says her crews are ready for the season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WeeklyTimes20170920WeeklyTimes28000331223248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHG-D3P1-F0JP-W0S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 20, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We've believed some of them, dismissed others and wondered quietly about the rest. They are urban myths, wild and crazy yarns dressed up as the gospel truth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Internet is, if anything, not much more than an exponential explosion of this kind of stuff. So it's nice to know that there are people out there checking out the bona fides of some of these wacky anecdotes.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>The best urban myth site I've been able to find is the San Fernando Valley Folklore Society Urban Legends Reference Pages , established and maintained by Barbara and David Mikkelson. This site is so ridiculously comprehensive that one suspects that you are yet again being had a lend of. Nonetheless, the Mikkelsons are convincing, and their research seems to stand up.</p><p> They log in silly stories as they emerge and investigate their credentials, truth-wise. For those of us who have been worrying about the verisimilitude of the classic urban myths, they are here, too. Here is a sample from recent research questions that have emerged.</p><p> The seeing-eye dog who led four of his owners to their deaths.</p><p> True or false?</p><p> What was in the briefcase in the movie Pulp Fiction?</p><p> If Nigerian officials send a fax offering you a reward to help them get money into American banks, don't bother!</p><p>\u00a0 (True!</p><p>I can vouch for this -and not just American banks, either.) The Mikkelsons specialise in certain areas, especially the Disney Corporation. I won't be buying into that one -Disney is reputed to have once sued a Miami kindergarten for unauthorised use of a Mickey Mouse image in a playground mural.</p><p> Here is a random selection from the Mikkelsons'</p><p>almost endless list of popular conundrums.</p><p>\u00a0 JATO DEATH Claim: the remains of a smouldering JATO-assisted Chevrolet Impala were found embedded in the side of a cliff in the Arizona desert.</p><p> Status: false.</p><p> Of all the crazy faxlore stories, this has to be the one fellas love the most. There's something about cars and solid-fuel rocket engines that draws them to this tale.</p><p>Maybe it's the Wile\u00a0 E\u00a0 Coyote-ness of it all, the \"so real you can almost touch it\" mental image of a smouldering wreck sticking out of a cliff face.</p><p> It turns out that this story has been doing the rounds by e-mail and fax for two years or more. It has no basis in fact.</p><p> The Mikkelsons quote the International Herald Tribune, which tried to get to the bottom of the story in early 1996: \"The story is not true, according to a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, who should know.</p><p> \" 'We get a call on that almost every 90 days,' said Dave Myers.</p><p> \" 'It keeps us on the map.' \"</p><p> You may have heard of this next one, too. I know I have. We ran a version of it in Picture magazine when I used to hunt these stories down for a living.</p><p> DEAD DRIVER IN A TREE Claim: in the aftermath of last year's forest fire in Malibu, the charred remains of a scuba diver were found in a tree.</p><p> Status: false.</p><p> Synopsis: fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burnt-out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wetsuit, complete with dive tank, flippers and face mask. A postmortem examination revealed that the person died not from burns but from massive internal injuries.</p><p>Investigators then set about determining how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip of the coast, some 20km away from the forest.</p><p> Here's the bit that makes this yarn so priceless: The fire-fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large buckets. The buckets were dropped in to the ocean for rapid filling, then flown to the forest fire and emptied.</p><p>One minute our diver was in the Pacific, the next he was doing breaststroke in a fire bucket 300m in the air.</p><p>Apparently, he extinguished 1.78m of the fire.</p><p> Barbara Mikkelson theorises that this story is one of those hypothetical guessing-game scenarios, in this case, \"How did this person die?\" -a scenario that took on a life of its own. Sounds conceivable.</p><p> You will notice that all of these examples have been proved false, which is not always the case. This last story, which is true, comes with a note of warning. If you are eating breakfast, either stop reading or stop eating. The combination will not agree with you.</p><p> In fact, I advise you to not only avoid breakfast, but leave the kitchen altogether.</p><p>\u00a0 SCROTUM SELF-REPAIR Claim: a machine-shop worker who made a regular practice of masturbating by holding his penis against the drive-belt of a piece of machinery, leant too close to the belt one day and caught his scrotum between the pulley wheel and the drive-belt.</p><p> The man suffered a torn scrotum and lost one of his testicles, but calmly stapled his scrotum back together and resumed work before visiting a doctor three days later.</p><p> Status : true.</p><p> Synopsis: this is an actual case that was reported in a letter submitted to the medical journal, Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality, in July 1991. We contacted the physician who penned the letter and obtained verification and further details about the unusual injury and its treatment.</p><p> The diligent Mikkelsons give us these \"further details\", chapter and verse, but I won't trouble you with them.</p><p> Crikey, I've already ruined my own breakfast!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9710041S08237754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:457Y-MHF0-0197-53GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE WEEKEND AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 4, 1997, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WALT DISNEY CO \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0WALT DISNEY CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>DIS (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp; THEME PARKS \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0NAICS515112 RADIO STATIONS \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0NAICS512110 MOTION PICTURE &amp; VIDEO PRODUCTION\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0NAICS453220 GIFT, NOVELTY &amp; SOUVENIR STORES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp; THEME PARKS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0NAICS515112 RADIO STATIONS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009UA9</classCode><className>FOLKLORE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp; CLAIMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS118</classCode><className>ARIZONA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC334</classCode><className>NIGERIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

If not, they'll find a hole in the canopy of the trees and winch those four firefighters through the canopy to the fireground,\" he said.</p><p>The teams carry rake-hoes, axes and chainsaws.</p><p>\"In most instances of a single lightning strike, it's definitely achievable to extinguish with a crew of four,\" Mr Cooper said.</p><p>Team members need wide range of skills</p><p>The team's task is primarily to contain the fire by clearing a perimeter around it, cutting down any burning trees, and calling in a water-bombing helicopter.</p><p>\"If they haven't got water-bombing support, all they can use is chainsaws, axes, and more or less use their feet and their hands to do the work,\" Mr Cooper said.</p><p>The crews need to pass a rigorous medical and fitness test and are highly trained in firefighting techniques.</p><p>They must have good bush skills in navigation, and the ability to work in dangerous environments well away from vehicle support.</p><p>The RFS and NPWS have RAFT teams, and sometimes they call on teams from ACT Parks as well.</p><p>\"It's a dangerous line of work,\" said Brian Levine, a RAFT co-ordinator with ACT Parks.</p><p>\"It's steep, hazardous terrain, so footing is crucial. Each step needs to be with purpose. And then, of course, fire-weakened trees are hazardous trees.\"</p><p>Mr Cooper said it was not an option to just a leave a remote fire to burn.</p><p>\"That small fire will continue to grow if nothing is done. And if it gets hit with very hot days and strong north-westerly winds, then it can grow and move hundreds of kilometres in a couple of days,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've got a lot of villages that would be exposed. A fire coming out of that country is going to impact on a lot of people.\"</p><p>Sometimes the conditions worsen and the rapid response crew cannot contain the fire.</p><p>Before being dropped in they will have planned an escape route, and the helicopter is ready to get them out.</p><p>Big forest fire requires a huge operation</p><p>\"If it's too big, then the control centre will ramp up the operation with additional aircraft and additional crews,\" Mr Cooper said.</p><p>\"The basis of firefighting is good planning and good management.\"</p><p>Staging posts are then established as close to the fireground as possible, providing helicopter landing sites to transport crews, while trucks shuttle in fuel for the helicopters.</p><p>An incident management team working from the fire control centre will be assigned to the fire, including operational, planning, and mapping staff.</p><p>\"The largest fires require a lot of people,\" Mr Cooper said.</p><p>\"All agencies will be involved, including police, ambulance, SES, volunteer rescue, Salvation Army, Red Cross.</p><p>\"All those people come together to form one big cell - to keep the firefighters hydrated and fed, to keep the operation running.</p><p>\"We've got day shifts and nights shifts of firefighting crews on the ground, supported by operations teams day and night.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCRNW-8041834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCRNW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MC8-1FF1-F031-X3NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300226</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><timeReceived>3:02 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Regional News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37479\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>November 21, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia:NSW:Moruya 2537</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Emergency Incidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Emergency Planning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Forests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Conservation/National Parks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Volunteers</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

Davies, the Queer as Folk creator and the producer who reimagined Doctor Who so successfully, and it's fast becoming the most talked about show of the year, along with the second season of Succession. And, inspired by both the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote, there's a neat conceit at its centre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It tells the story of the rise of a populist dictator, Viv Rook, played by Emma Thompson, but does it not by concentrating events on her terrifying rise to power - the political mechanics of her ascension - but rather on the ordinary people affected. And through their interactions slowly it reveals a measured, plausible, almost unremarkable transition to tyranny.</p><p>\"It's been boiling away in my mind for a long time, but over the past few years the world itself seems to have been boiling faster and hotter and wilder than ever,\" Davies says on the BBC's media site. \"I mean, the age, today, just seems fevered - we're either more political, or more scornful of politics, than ever. And I think, in the past, politics meant the economy to most people, but now we're seeing that it's our identity at stake.\" Beginning in 2019, with Trump still building his walls and British parliament not having worked out the troublesome Irish backstop, we encounter the extended Lyons family in Manchester one night, a diverse lot in race, sexual preference, gender identity and physical disability, presided over by Gran, played with sardonic edge by Anne Reid. Her grandchildren are Stephen, Daniel and Rosie (Rory Kinnear, Russell Tovey and Ruth Madeley). And then there's Jessica Hynes's Edith, an activist somewhere overseas again saving the planet. There's also a host of husbands, wives, sisters, sons and daughters, and Rosie's half-Chinese baby, Lincoln.</p><p>They're worried about the world they live in - the banks, politics, corporations and America with its fake news and false facts.</p><p>Tovey's Daniel sums it up early on, young Lincoln in his arms. \"Don't know if I could, have a kid in a world like this,\" he says. \"If it's this bad now, what's it going to be like for you in 30, 10, five years?\" Then, beautifully on cue, Davies always a whiz with timing, the family drama is propelled forward in time, year by year, in a series of surprising and witty montages. Trump is re-elected, Angela Merkel dies (\"Good riddance,\" remarks the omnipresent Rook, hardly off the TV as the years roll on so rapidly. \"The world just got a whole lot prettier.\") And by 2024 life has become more unbearable. London is overrun by refugees from the Ukraine, some areas requiring means-testing for entry, the border deal with Ireland has still not been settled and unrest is everywhere.</p><p>All this happens around the tight-knit Lyons family, an extended bunch who somehow manage to talk with each other constantly, always in and out of each other's lives, as they navigate extremist politics, climate change and even more technological encroachments on life. Stephen and wife Celeste have a major problem with daughter Bethany, who is in \"transition\": she wants to be transhuman or fully digital, her brain downloaded into the cloud so she can live forever as data.</p><p>And Viv Rook's populism is on the rise as she forms her own political movement to represent the people abandoned by the big, old parties. She calls it The Four Star Party, after the **** used by newspapers to convey the f-word she utters on TV the first time we see her. (Asked a question about Israel and Palestine on some talk show, she says, \"I don't give a f..k, all I want is for my bins to be collected every week\".) Davies cleverly positions Rook's development so that while central to the story she remains peripheral to the action, her face and voice constantly coming at us from ubiquitous TV screens.</p><p>Yes, this is bleak drama, so cleverly juxtaposing social realism, a kind of sci-fi dystopianism and a caustically satirical look at populist politics but it's surprisingly funny in places, with Davies admitting he can't write more than six lines without putting in a gag, witty and clever. And there's a romance, too, between Daniel, who's discovered his recent marriage to his boyfriend is all he wished for, and asylum-seeker Victor, a young Ukrainian who fled Kiev after being tortured by the Russian-allied authorities for being gay. But it's the life force of this wonderfully close family that sticks in the mind after you watch and the way that through them we gain such insights into politics and society.</p><p>Be prepared - Davies, always the magician, pulls a ferocious surprise out of his writer's hat just before the first episode ends, horrifically changing the nature of reality for the Lyons family just as they enjoy the annual outdoor birthday bash for grandmother Muriel.</p><p>The new TV version of the classic HG Wells story, The War of the Worlds, first published in serial format in Pearson's Magazine in 1897, is certainly different to anything we've seen before. Wells's story is a template for many such alien invasion stories to come. This time it's adapted by Peter Harness, best known for his writing on Doctor Who and directed by the experienced British director Craig Viveiros, who gave us the BBC's classy 2015 adaptation of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, and serial-killer drama Rillington Place.</p><p>At a time when the British exported war to distant shores in all their pompous greatness, Wells launched his alien forces into the cosy surroundings of southern England itself, infuriated by the wanton extermination of indigenous races in imperial wars.</p><p>\"We must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its own inferior races,\" his narrator says in the novel, citing the way \"the Tasmanians were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of 50 years\".</p><p>And through many relocations and successive reworkings, including not only the famous realistic radio adaptation of Orson Welles that caused a nationwide panic in the US, but films, TV series and even popular music albums, Wells's work has encapsulated the paranoia of successive ages. Whether the fear of the Nazis in the late 1930s, the Cold War in the 1950s or Steven Spielberg's hardly subtle paralleling of the 9/11 terrorist attack.</p><p>And this new version seems to stem from the Brexiteers' dystopian fantasy of domination from the continent - almost as if defeated in a war - that has become indistinguishable from reality, haunting the imagination of British conservatism; unfortunately, it's hard to know from the first episode, a rather infuriating and -meandering affair.</p><p>Almost all adaptations of Wells's story, including the Spielberg movie, have been set in the modern time in which the project was produced. But Harkness sets his reimagining in the Victorian setting of the source material, re-creating the original in a way that has not often been seen.</p><p>The minister in London, who is filling in for the absent Prime Minister, on being informed that a strange object has landed from above, insists there's nothing to be worried about. That is after he's assured it couldn't possibly be the Russians who are currently causing a fuss attacking British ships up in the North Sea.</p><p>After all, it might just be a shooting star that extinguished itself near the sleepy town of Woking in Surrey, or a small meteorite that has caused a local forest fire. Or just an act of God that has caused some rock to drop from the -heavens.</p><p>But George and Amy, the two protagonists in Harkness's version, know better. They are young lovers ostracised from formal society trying to establish a new life for themselves after George, a London journalist, has left his embittered wife and a miserable marriage largely engineered by his well-to-do family, his brother a big wig at the Admiralty. Their friend Ogilvy, an astronomer and scientist who is the first to see some explosive plumes that he telescopically spots on the surface of Mars, also is making a new life. Soon they witness the landing of a giant meteorite containing a cylinder that lands in the rural countryside of Woking, Surrey, where George and Amy have settled.</p><p>Before long, heat rays emanate from the cylinder, devastating the crowds that gather, and George and Amy are on the run from a group of massive newly assembled tripodal war machines, looming mechanisms designed to exterminate human beings with remorseless rapidity and -efficiency.</p><p>Unlike the machines, the series is a creaky, rather wobbly piece of work, the chronology alone a cause for the shaking of heads. Thankfully, though, a cast that includes Eleanor Tomlinson as Amy, Rafe Spall as George, Robert Carlyle as Ogilvie and Rupert Graves as George's brother, Freddie, battles as courageously as the characters as they attempt to survive the invasion with some credibility intact.</p><p>Years and Years, Wednesday, SBS, 8.30pm.War of the Worlds, Thursday, Fox One, 7.30pm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-df9f8030f6ed11e990dee5ef1e6dd98315f77a279187279e8eccd877c6a88f08</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD6-XHY1-JD3N-51TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1519\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQV2</classCode><className>POPULISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000777</classCode><className>LGBTQ+ PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAKE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00098X6</classCode><className>SEX &amp; GENDER ISSUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DL65</classCode><className>GENDER IDENTITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D1F7</classCode><className>BRITISH PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DTNM</classCode><className>ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DKDN</classCode><className>EMMA THOMPSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE0009UHD</classCode><className>ANGELA MERKEL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GX476</classCode><className>MANCHESTER, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I said, \"I can't ...\" - it's a horrendous scene. I said, \"Will you come and help me?\" And the chap on the - the officer on the roadblock said to me, \"I can't do it; I'm under orders.\"</p><p>JANE COWAN: Applying the forensic to the impossibly emotional, the Royal Commission unearthed a shocking array of failures, the worst among them the failure to properly warn communities as fire bore down.</p><p>SHARON MCCULLOCH, SURVIVOR (9 June, 2009): I heard the beep, beep, beep of the 10 o'clock news and the message was something that Kinglake's under ember or under fire attack and I just remember thinking, \"Well, that's a little bit too late.\"</p><p>JANE COWAN: At the highest levels of emergency management, the Commission's lawyers have said leadership was missing in the hour of crisis.</p><p>JACK RUSH, COUNSEL ASSISTING THE COMMISSION: It's, as we say, as if the senior fire personnel were powerless behind the glass, unable or unwilling to influence or attempt to influence the tragedy that was unfolding.</p><p>JANE COWAN: Whole towns were wiped out and whole families.</p><p>PAULINE ZEALLEY, SURVIVOR (17 Nov., 2009): We thought that maybe the kids were in the car and not with their mummy and daddy and we couldn't live with that.</p><p>JANE COWAN: Those at the helm struggled to explain it.</p><p>EWAN WALLER, FOREST FIRE CHIEF (26 June, 2009): Um, I'm ... (gesturing as if lost for words).</p><p>JANE COWAN: At the heart of the Commission's investigations has been the \"stay or go\" policy which has formed the bedrock of advice to bushfire-prone communities across Australia.</p><p>KRISTINE HANSCOMBE, COUNSEL FOR FIREFIGHTERS UNION: 173 people are dead who presumably intended to look after themselves. This policy has plainly failed.</p><p>COMMISSION QUESTIONER: The policy tells you not to use the road; this gives you advice what to do if you are on the road. How is someone s'posed to understand this?</p><p>BRUCE ESPLIN, EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMISSIONER (8 May, 2009): My understanding is that the CFA and the DSE have already started a process of reviewing the language in those messages.</p><p>JANE COWAN: The Commission's lawyers want the policy scrapped and replaced with a combination of voluntary evacuations and refuges.</p><p>Whatever the commissioners recommend though, the Victorian Premier John Brumby has announced a plan to consult the community before committing to anything, a move that's provoked dismay and suspicion.</p><p>KEVIN TOLHURST, FIRE SCIENTIST: To say that it needs more public consultation I think is just really a ploy to say, \"Well, we made this decision because the community said so.\" Now I think that's a hiding behind the community screen, I think.</p><p>ATHOL HODGSON, FORMER FOREST FIRE CHIEF: The Premier's off on a sham consultation process. ... The mood's turned angry, very, very angry.</p><p>BOB CAMERON, EMERGENCY SERVICES MINISTER: You take for example the volunteers of the CFA. You know, we have an arrangement with the volunteers of the CFA that we consult with them about decisions which affect them.

as the region heads towards weekend Easter rain and the winter months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Compared with heightened caution at the start of summer, fire authorities are now confident the main bushfire risk has passed.</p><p>Restrictions for Country Fire Authority district five covering City of Warrnambool and shires of Moyne and Southern Grampians will be lifted on Monday, district six which covers Corangamite and Colac Otway is likely to be lifted in a fortnight while district four which covers Glenelg Shire will be evaluated after Easter.</p><p>All CFA district leaders told The Standard yesterday milder weather conditions had reduced the likelihood of further major fires.</p><p>They said the region had escaped the summer remarkably well apart from a few outbreaks which were quickly controlled, due partly to higher preparedness by district brigades.</p><p>Unfortunately the Koroit district firebug believed responsible for about a dozen blazes is yet to be apprehended.</p><p>A small roadside grass fire near Kirkstall on Tuesday afternoon was not believed to be deliberately lit.</p><p>Warrnambool-based CFA officer Henry Barton said considering the south-west was the driest region in Victoria during summer, major fire outbreaks were low.</p><p>\"We were still kept very busy with the Koroit district incidents, Framlingham forest fire, Branxholme forest fires, power pole fires, a hazmat incident at Allansford, tar spill at Portland and truck fire,\" he said.</p><p>\"We were able to pull the fires up pretty quickly.\"</p><p>Mr Barton said CFA volunteers and staff were on a higher-than-usual state of preparedness and had upgraded their skills before the fire season.</p><p>District five operations manager Nick Brown urged people to remain vigilant and be extremely careful when burning off.</p><p>\"There is still potential for hot weather and strong winds in the coming week,\" he said.</p><p>\"Residents should be aware of daily fire danger ratings and know which fire ban district they are in, particularly if they are travelling.\"</p><p>Anyone planning a burn-off is urged to notify their local brigade beforehand.</p><p>pcollins@standard.fairfax.com.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Milder weather conditions have reduced the likelihood of further

I've never encountered a fire that size.\"</p><p>The fire, which has been blazing in the north-east province of Heilongjiang for two weeks, has killed more than 200 people and seriously injured 221, according to official estimates.

most of it - and City of Ballarat, we've had a pretty good winter,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've had average to above average rainfall - I'm working on the bogged tractor index, and we've had a lot of bogged tractors out there in paddocks - and that means, for us, we're expecting the fire danger period, which is when we declare restrictions, to be what we'd call average, somewhere around the first part of December or late November.\"</p><p>He noted there were lessons learned from the fires last year, which saw one every month through the summer and into autumn.</p><p>\"It's really significant, we're not normally that busy, and last year wasn't a super dry year for us, it was all about Gippsland, but we still had the Buninyong fire just before Christmas, the Hepburn-Mannings Road fire at the end of January, the Bunkers Hill fire out in Haddon in mid-March, and in April we had the Mount Clear fire,\" he explained.</p><p>\"Overall, we lost two homes and about 35 sheds last summer, communities lost those.</p><p>\"What we're seeing is we don't need a fire that'll going to burn thousands of hectares and run for many days to do a lot of damage.\"</p><p>He described the Bunkers Hill fire as being like a \"tornado in a caravan park\".</p><p>\"(It was) small landholdings, two or five to 10 acres, varying levels of community preparedness, a warm day but not a hot day, but an especially windy day in late summer, and ignition from powerlines,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was dangerous, for community and for our people, it was very extreme fire danger and behaviour, it was very erratic.\"</p><p>Based on this, he said landholders should begin to remove long grass and get rid of bonfire piles now.</p><p>\"People have the burn pile in the paddock, they're ready to have everyone around for a beer and barbecue and burn the pile, then the fire danger period gets declared before they expect it, so we're saying if you've got that pile of things to burn, get it done early,\" Mr Boatman said.</p><p>\"I'm saying get it done before Ballarat Show Day (November 9).\"</p><p>Council inspectors will soon be checking properties for fire-readiness as well, he added.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria is also reviewing fuel loads in the district and getting early spring burns done in risky areas - Midlands district manager Jasmine Filmer said project crews were beginning to arrive, and other initiatives, like the fire watchtower program and water point development, were under way.</p><p>\"For us, it's about making sure that we maximise the opportunities when they're there,\" she said.</p><p>\"We've got those couple of burns under our belt, and potentially there'll be another spring burn, but the spring program won't be big, the majority of it will be focused on autumn when we have more stable conditions.</p><p>\"We haven't formally kicked off the slashing program, that's where people see us out with tractors in the forest, that includes slashing of verges and other tracks through the forested areas, and would also include mowing in areas like Crown land, township blocks, and verges elsewhere.</p><p>\"The trick is, we don't want to start too early, because then we get more growth and we end up having to redo that as well, so it's a timing run with that stuff.\"</p><p>The Mount Clear fire, which threatened pine plantations close to homes, was a good example of the chain of command working well in an emergency, she added - firefighters from the Hancock plantations and FFMV worked with CFA crews to establish control over the fire quickly.</p><p>\"It was late in the season - when that was occurring, we had done planned burning in the days prior and we had scheduled planned burns for Trentham the following day,\" she said.</p><p>\"That day was warm and windy, but the day following was perfect conditions for a planned burn, so we delivered a planned burn at Trentham in a really high risk environment but in conditions that were very favourable.\"</p><p>The full aerial firefighting fleet will be available, as well as surge capacity and night firebombing crews.</p><p>The plantation crews are also ready to roll - Hancock Victoria Plantations maintains a private firefighting team in the summer, which corporate fires manager Ruth Ryan described as a \"CFA brigade in its own right\".</p><p>\"There's two tankers and five quick attack utes stationed around the Ballarat area, which respond to fires on and off our land,\" she said.</p><p>\"We take on additional crew over the summer, we have a base firefighting capacity of around 20 people during the weekdays, and people on standby over weekends.\"</p><p>The company is working closely with fire authorities on new initiatives, she added, helping to plan ahead for the summer.</p><p>\"Some of the things we're getting involved in on a more broad scale are using computer modelling to identify risk areas, and we use that to highlight potentially where we might work with FFMV to identify areas where fuel management would have the best effect, especially in protecting our plantations,\" she said.</p><p>The district's CFA brigades - all 61 of them, and their 120 vehicles - will soon begin extra training, focusing on personal safety and situational awareness while out at fires.</p><p>\"We have a tree hazard awareness training package that all of our people go through before summer,\" Mr Boatman explained.</p><p>\"We're also encouraging people to know their procedures around entrapment, if they do get caught in a burnover - there was one in Queensland, and at the Scotsburn fire we had three entrapments that day.</p><p>\"It's something we do see pop up and we're encouraging all of our members to refresh their entrapment drills so they understand what the procedures are if they're caught in that situation.</p><p>\"Everyone has a minimum level of training on the fire truck and we're re-emphasising that, so we're expecting that every person who gets on a fire truck and goes to a fire this summer will have done those three things.\"</p><p>That emphasis on safety is being echoed across the state - in a statement, Victorian emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp said multi-agency briefings had begun to make sure people know the risks and are prepared to respond.</p><p>\"This includes briefings in Ballarat, Ararat and Horsham, for emergency management personnel,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are also focused on the health and safety of our responders and emergency managers, so that they are able to continue to protect and respond to the community in emergencies.</p><p>\"Each year it is clear that summer is not just about fire alone, it is also about flooding, storms, and other emergencies. Each year we ask the community to also begin their preparedness works, taking action to complete preparations early. This year is no different.</p><p>\"While emergency management agencies are preparing, it's also important the community understands their own risk and is actively preparing. This is a shared responsibility.\"</p><p>On the ground, the focus is on forested areas and the \"interface\" between the bush and pastoral land.</p><p>\"We've had plenty of examples where they might be grass fires but they're having significant impacts, and if that's moving out of or into a forest where we've got homes, then they're really tricky ones to deal with,\" Ms Filmer said.</p><p>Mr Boatman agreed.</p><p>\"There's a place called Wheatsheaf just east of Daylesford, there's 200-odd landholders on an area of bush that's been subdivided and people live right in the middle of it,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've got a very proactive campaign around engaging with that community, and we're also looking, under a policy called Safer Together which we do with FFMV, to help landholders manage their blocks of land out there through burning and other means.</p><p>\"If you wrap around from Haddon and Smythes Creek, all the way around Smythesdale, Napoleons, the south of Ballarat across to Buninyong and Scotsburn, and across to almost Dunnstown, that area, you think about how much bush and how much interface - then if you go up from Creswick to Smoky Town over towards Newlyn, skip over into the Wombat (Forest), Daylesford, Trentham, Blackwood, there's lots of places where there's interface.</p><p>\"That's why preparation is key.\"</p><p>There are plenty of resources on the CFA website for landowners, he added, and no excuses for not checking it out now.</p><p>\"I'm a landowner on the outskirts of Ballarat, I've got 10 acres and I know what it all looks like - the conversation and thinking needs to start now,\" he said.</p><p>\"Within communities, landowners, families, neighbours, they all need to start thinking about 'what can I start to do now to minimise my risk?'\"</p><p>Planning a burnoff?

gatherings.</p><p>In 1962 he was selected for an interstate trip with Rural Youth where a friendship blossomed with Veronica Chigwidden, Clare.</p><p>They were married in Clare in 1964 and lived at Bundaleer, where they raised two children, Mary-Jane and Christopher.</p><p>While the Malones had traditionally been sheep and grain producers, John and his brother Vin started breeding Red Poll cattle in 1966, using Woodleigh and Oakwood genetics.</p><p>They met with immediate success as breeders and exhibitors, achieving grand champion female at their first Royal Adelaide Show in 1968 with their junior female exhibit.</p><p>In 1971, John and Veronica registered Maleer Red Poll Stud with their half of the foundation herd (Vin had bought Woodleigh, adding his half of the herd to that stud).</p><p>As a breeder and exhibitor, John achieved great success across four decades with an abundance of ribbons at the Royal Adelaide Show, Sydney Royal Easter Show and Wodonga Show and Sale in Vic, plus countless country shows.</p><p>But for John, these successes were far outweighed by friendships he made in and out of the cattle ring, such was his love of life and people.</p><p>John also became a sought-after cattle judge, this role taking him to royal and country shows across Australia and to New Zealand.</p><p>He became an enthusiastic contributor to the Royal Adelaide Show as a beef cattle steward, and supporter of the led steer program, beef cattle junior judging and SA Junior Heifer Expo, acknowledged with a Long Serving Volunteer Award in 2010.</p><p>John's volunteer efforts for the Jamestown Show were extraordinary and were acknowledged with life membership in 1997.</p><p>Following in his father's tradition, John was initially involved as a volunteer in the sheep section at the Jamestown Show in the 1960s.</p><p>In 1971, he became steward of the cattle section, and helped grow the cattle exhibits at the Jamestown to an impressive standard.</p><p>John also took on key leadership positions for the Jamestown Show Society, being president for three terms, vice president for six terms and patron from 2003 to 2008.</p><p>John remained actively involved on the cattle committee, officiating as emcee at the 2018 Jamestown Show.</p><p>Regionally, he served as president of the Northern Agricultural Shows Association from 1984 to 86.</p><p>He was chairman of the Agricultural Societies Council from 1993 to 1996 and served on the executive of this council for more than 10 years.</p><p>John's unwavering support for Red Poll cattle, his knowledge and positive outlook earned him widespread respect as he took on key breed and industry roles.</p><p>This included more than 45 years on the South Australian Red Poll Society committee, and 20 years as delegate to the federal council of Red Poll Cattle Society.</p><p>During this time, John served three terms as federal president of the Red Poll Society and five years as state president.</p><p>John and Veronica thoroughly enjoyed international trips with the Red Poll Society North America/Canada and to South America and were regular hosts of international visitors at Bundaleer.</p><p>Last month, Australian Red Poll Cattle Breeders Incorporated awarded life membership to John for his outstanding contribution to the industry.</p><p>He also had extensive involvement in farm industry organisations, serving at state level in the South Australian Farmers' Federation, and its predecessor, United Farmers and Graziers.</p><p>He was a member of Livestock Executive, SA Meat and Hygiene Council, Cattle Advisory Board and SA Beef Research Council.</p><p>John was also a member of the body that set up the Jamestown Truck Wash Facility, near the Jamestown saleyards, and was part of a regional lobby group that successfully retained Jamestown Hospital's acute services in the 1980s.</p><p>John was also involved in the organics industry, after he and his son Chris gradually reduced chemical use on their Bundaleer property during the 1980s.</p><p>The Malones achieved certification as organic and biodynamic farmers in 1991 and successfully established markets for their organic beef and grains.</p><p>Sport was an important part of John's life. He played football for the Jamestown Football Club and enjoyed golf and table tennis.</p><p>He whistled his way through many games of tennis at Bundaleer and in more recent years played bowls for Caltowie.</p><p>John was involved with the Bundaleer Sport and Recreation Association from its formation as the Bundaleer Progress Association in 1962.</p><p>John helped with the volunteer cropping program that funded the establishment of tennis courts, a cricket oval and the Bundaleer Hall adjacent to the Bundaleer Picnic Ground.</p><p>In the past 15 years, John and Veronica have been the contact for hundreds of visitors who have camped at the grounds and hired the facilities at Bundaleer.</p><p>He was especially gifted at making people new to the area feel welcome, whether it be campers at Bundaleer, or visitors to the Jamestown Development Association Visitor Resource Centre, which he frequently manned.</p><p>John was also actively involved in the St James Catholic Church and was a supporter of greater interaction between the churches, as a member of the interdenominational group.</p><p>John loved classical music and was extremely proud of his daughter Mary-Jane's great talent for singing and was a regular at her gigs.</p><p>John was a major contributor to all seven music and art festivals held in the Bundaleer Forest between 1999 and 2013.</p><p>He was an enthusiastic member of the management committee for each of the Bundaleer Festivals, taking on role of chair for the 2011 event.</p><p>John's extensive knowledge of Bundaleer Forest helped guide suitable venues for artistic performances along the walks and his practicality came to the fore in his role of logistics and infrastructure for the events.</p><p>For John, the Bundaleer Festival was a way to showcase and share the beauty and special nature of the place he loved so much.</p><p>He embraced the diversity of creative artistic events, relished the opportunity to meet artists such as Teddy Tahu Rhodes, and the hard work that had to go in to staging the festivals was of great enjoyment to him.</p><p>The final Bundaleer Festival was held just months after the devastating Bundaleer Forest fire.</p><p>Rumours of plans to divest Bundaleer Forest emerged soon after the fire, and John was a key part of the community-led campaign to replant the forest, save the local timber industry and ensure Australia's first plantation forest remained accessible by locals and visitors.</p><p>John was very proud to be part of the community's efforts to secure ownership and control of the sport and recreation grounds.</p><p>He was also very excited about local management of the Bundaleer Forest Picnic Ground and the new community event centre being built on-site.</p><p>John had a great sense of humour and zest for life, loved steak, red wine and BBQs at Bundaleer with family and friends.</p><p>He was a highly social being and made sincere enduring friendships through every facet of his life, whether at school, in industry meetings, welcoming visitors to Bundaleer, or just stopping for a chat when shifting the cattle along the road with his beloved dog.</p><p>He adored his community, his cattle, all things Bundaleer, and most of all, his family.</p><p>Mr Malone was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and with the care and attention of his wife Veronica and his family he was able to stay at home until just days before his passing.</p><p>He is survived by Veronica, children Mary-Jane and Christopher and five grandchildren.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STKJNL-doc74vlcisewxejs7y1efr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STKJNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVV-GN81-JD34-V467-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385747</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Stock Journal</publicationName><edition>Internet &amp;

CSIRO issued written warnings to fire agencies five years ago, stating that bushfire fighters could be risking their lives if they relied on the calculator's fire-spread predictions. The three-dial calculator, known as the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, was introduced in 1963 to help on-ground firefighters calculate flame intensity, fire height, rate and area of spread, and difficulty of suppression. It is also commonly used to calculate daily fire danger warnings. An ACT Emergency Services spokesman confirmed the device was \"one of the many tools used during the 2003 bushfire disaster\". But he was unable to confirm whether the department was aware of CSIRO warnings that the prediction system was seriously flawed. It was the speed and ferocity of the 2003 fire that took emergency services by surprise and the issue of the calculators is subject to the stalled coronial inquiry. A NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman said the calculators were \"still commonly used but there has been some criticism of them\". CSIRO bushfire research leader Jim Gould said 110 experimental fires demonstrated the danger metre seriously under-predicted the rate of spread of bushfires, particularly in dry summer conditions. \"Our research has definitely found that it doesn't perform all that well,\" he said. \"In some cases, it under-predicted the potential rate of fire spread by as much as three times or even more.\"</p><p>Mr Gould said CSIRO had distributed brochures to all fire agencies around Australia, including ACT Emergency Services, warning them of flaws in the McArthur Forest Fire Danger prediction system. He said the fire spread table used by the McArthur metre was based on relatively small, low-intensity fires. The device, developed by forestry researcher Alan McArthur \"worked just fine\" as a fire danger rating system but did not reliably predict fire behaviour. \"Fire can develop quite rapidly with just a small wind change -even just a slight increase in wind speed can result in a big change in fire behaviour, and the model doesn't pick that up,\" he said. Mr Gould said CSIRO, working in partnership with researchers from the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, aimed to have a more reliable and updated fire behaviour prediction system in place within a year. \"That could be a computer model, a new set of tables or a calculator that will fit inside a firefighter's pocket.\" Bushfire control depended on good scientific data, he said. \"Weather prediction has significantly improved in the last decade through the increasing availability of better models and better data input. \"Bushfire prediction is following the same path, by getting an enhanced understanding of the variables which affect bushfire behaviour.\" He said experimental burns conducted in Western Australia and NSW demonstrated that existing fire management guides and tables were flawed. The experiments confirmed that the potential intensity and rate of spread of fire in dry eucalypt forest is directly related to the occurrence of previous fires. \"The intensity and difficulty of suppression of fires will increase for at least 15 years after fire, because of changes taking place in fuel characteristics of the litter, shrub and bark fuels.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-3244474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FF8-P6C0-0045-53HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited</copyright><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>February 9, 2005 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0EMERGENCY SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>BUSHFIRE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH CENTRE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0EMERGENCY SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSHFIRE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH CENTRE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

The fire, reported about 3pm on Wednesday, was in Meereek State Forest. The land burnt included 80 hectares of private bushland. </p><p>Yesterday Wimmera fire-fighters contained the blaze by 2.15am and controlled it after 1pm. The firewood collector, from South Australia, used a chainsaw to remove firewood from the state forest on Wednesday. Mid-afternoon, his chainsaw cut a rotten log, sparking the fire. The man, 34, unsuccessfully tried to put the fire out, but it quickly spread out of control. He then returned to his home state to alert authorities. Horsham police then interviewed the man in Edenhope late on Wednesday. Police released the man pending possible charges on summons. Detective Sergeant Stephen Walker of Horsham Crime Investigation Unit said the man could face charges including having recklessly caused a bushfire and having engaged in high-risk activities in open air during a fire danger period. Department of Sustainability and Environment incident controller Russell Manning, of Horsham Incident Control Centre, said the department was working with police about possible further charges against the man. People are not permitted to collect firewood from designated forest areas until March. At the fire's height, more than 100 fire-fighters from the department, Parks Victoria and CFA District 17 battled the blaze. Crews worked overnight between Wednesday and yesterday and expect to fully black out the fire by Sunday night. Other resources used on the fire included four fire-bombing aircraft, two reconnaissance aircraft, three bulldozers, a small tractor and 25 loads of fire retardant. Mr Manning said the landowner whose private bushland was burnt, in the northern area of the fire, was 'very satisfied' with the fire crews' response. Det Sgt Walker advised people to check firewood collection regulations at www.cfa.vic.gov.au/restrictions/can.htm. The Meereek State Forest fire is the largest in the Wimmera this year. The previous largest fire was the 230-hectare Grampians Sawmill Track fire last month.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIMMER-63emw9p91bkx5la1ji</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIMMER2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54W2-S9B1-F0J6-J47S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386181</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wimmera Mail Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>February 3, 2012 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;
