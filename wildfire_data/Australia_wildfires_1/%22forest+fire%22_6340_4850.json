We know what the advertisements for Jeep's new Wrangler are trying to say, but they might have put it better.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>Fortunately, most 4WD owners do not park where they damn well please, except maybe in the city. And most know that wherever they go, there are rules.</p><p>True, a lot of 4WD drivers ignore the rules but they are doing so with less abandon than, say, five years ago. The message is spreading that the impact we have on our favourite spots could eventually ruin those places for our kids and their kids.</p><p>Rummaging through some old motoring column photographs recently I came across one of a 1980 Patrol at Fraser Island, with yours truly standing beside it admiring the fantastic view. The Patrol was parked on a dune, on top of new growth. Guilty. I tore the photo up.</p><p>Four-wheel-drive clubs today are usually environment conscious and subscribe to the Tread Lightly! program.</p><p>Tread Lightly! is an international campaign supported by vehicle manufacturers, some large companies, government departments, clubs and individuals with a common purpose: to protect outdoor recreation areas.</p><p>The basic idea is to help people develop the skills to enjoy themselves in the outdoors without having any lasting impact.</p><p>Tread Lightly! in Australia is spearheaded by Mrs Jan Scudamore, of Brisbane, who recently returned from the USA Tread Lightly! annual conference in Colorado.</p><p>Interestingly, at an advertising function the editor in chief of Popular Mechanics put advertising agencies and vehicle manufacturers on notice that \"they had better change their ways\".</p><p>\"The current trend of advertising is very destructive, like a forest fire out of control,\" he said, warning that the loss of access to land was accelerating so rapidly in the US that in two years motorised vehicles could be restricted to paved roads.</p><p>Mrs Scudamore sees similar trends here.</p><p>Over the past 10 years drivers, riders and other users have caused so much damage to public and private land that access to large recreational areas has been progressively restricted.</p><p>Unfortunately, this has led to more and more people being forced on to remaining areas, which then deteriorate more rapidly.</p><p>One such area is the Canning Stock route, which stretches 1872km from Wiluna to Halls Creek in Western Australia.</p><p>It is one of the few truly isolated tracks left in the world. But the famous route is in danger of being loved to death, according to Mrs Scudamore. She doesn't mince words. A big part of the problem is human excrement.</p><p>\"In the early days of the stock route, the cattle had an excuse, they didn't have to wipe their behinds,\" she said.</p><p>\"Today's modern traveller on the Canning has no excuse and plenty of options when it comes to disposal of the unmentionable and all the other rubbish.</p><p>\"Increasing numbers of thoughtless and unskilled travellers are discarding rubbish at bush campsites, chopping down living trees for fuel and doing their business in holes dug too shallow to escape the notice of dingoes, leaving a landscape of toilet paper flapping in the breeze.\"</p><p>Tread Lightly! has formed a working party to develop an education program aimed at all future travellers of the route.</p><p>The working party includes people from two WA government departments, the WA Association of 4WD Clubs, the Keep Australia Beautiful Council, the Heritage Council of WA, a 4WD magazine and a Canning route tour operator.</p><p>\"Due to the remote location, sparse population and limited resources of the area, any proposals for a management plan would need to place strong emphasis on self reliance, a code of conduct, minimal supervision and responsible self-management by visitors,\" Mrs Scudamore said.</p><p>The first priority will be to replace old rubbish signs with more appropriate signage.</p><p>Tread Lightly! also hopes that in the meantime, people will dig deep _ not only for the unmentionable, but into their pockets to help fund the long-term education and planning program.</p><p>Membership forms for Tread Lightly! can be found at most 4WD and accessories outlets or by contacting Mrs Scudamore at PO Box 123, Coorparoo 4151.</p><p>Tread Lightly! also has a toll-free information number: 1800 650 881 and its e-mail address is: huttenme</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-SML9701192119359285</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYMAIL(QLD)LTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4585-DYM0-0197-F2YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"717\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>January 19, 1997, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DSII</classCode><className>PRIVATE LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000025</classCode><className>MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RDZ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX002014</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N541810MM</classCode><className>MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000138</classCode></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS004</classCode><className>WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Their former meeting room, the Toual Public Schoolhouse built in 1888, has become a wine-tasting facility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The schoolhouse is the focal point of Ken Helm's idiosyncratic winery, 6km out of the village of Murrumbateman on the Barton Highway, and 45km from Canberra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Mention Canberra and most of us think politics, foreign embassies and the National Gallery, Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>Tasting wine would be at the bottom of the scale in most national capital tourists' must-visit lists.</p><p> Yet John Richard Hardy (no relation to the Hardy winemaking clan) planted grapevines in Yass, on the edge of Canberra, in 1853.</p><p> That was 23 years before James Busby lit what became a \"vinous forest fire\" by establishing a vineyard in the Hunter Valley.</p><p> While the Hunter wine industry never stopped growing, Canberra's had a short life until resurrected as a cottage industry in 1971 by the Lake George and Clonakilla wineries.</p><p>Canberra wine's shot-in-the-arm came when Ken Helm quit his job as a CSIRO scientist two years later and established the district's first commercial vineyard and winery.</p><p> Every successful wine region has a champion -- a local winemaker who takes it upon himself to garner publicity extolling the virtues of his area's produce.</p><p> Helm has been so successful that his face appears regularly on Canberra Tourism promotional material and in 2000 was given the title of \"Canberra's honorary ambassador\".</p><p> Inside Helm's quaint cellar door, besides thumbing your nose at those temperance wowsers with a schoolhouse tasting, you can inspect a working 1920s Bordeaux wine press that goes like the clappers during vintage.</p><p> Best way to visit Canberra is to enter the region along the Barton Highway and leave via the Federal Highway. This way you can choose from six Murrumbateman area wineries, grab an excellent yet inexpensive lunch at Barrique, built in 1879 as the Traveller's Rest Inn, then head to Canberra.</p><p> Latest, and for mine the best, attraction is the free entry National Museum of Australia, which opened on the Acton Peninsula in March last year and welcomed a million visitors in its first 12 months.</p><p> I'm no \"culture vulture\" and until my wife dragged me into the National my perception of museums was stodgy and usually boring. Put those notions aside here.</p><p> The museum houses 172,000 historical and indigenous objects, including 95,000 Aboriginal stone tools and the world's largest collection of bark paintings.</p><p> Five permanent exhibitions comprise Nation (symbols of Australia), Horizons (peopling of Australia since 1788), Eternity (stories from the nation's emotional heart), Tangled Destinies (Australia's land and people) and First Australians (a gallery of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders).</p><p> Nation, tracing Australia's development from the kangaroo to the Hills Hoist, has 700 props which help convey stories like the Bean car which Francis Birtles drove from London to Melbourne in 1927-28.</p><p> Horizons chronicles tales of early settlers like Richard Johnson, Sydney's first Anglican priest who established Christianity in a remote convict settlement; and Mary Lee, a 19th century Irish migrant who championed women's rights in South Australia.</p><p> Highlight of Eternity is an inter-active exhibit that lets visitors record their own story. So far 8000 yarns have been composed, and all will become part of the display.</p><p> Tangled Destinies explores early Europeans' reactions to Australian nature, impact of introduced species and technological innovations born of grim requirements. Here you can watch the skeleton of a diprotodon -- the largest marsupial that ever lived -- come to life, and view memorials to extinct native animals such as the Tasmanian tiger.</p><p> First Australians profiles 40,000 years of indigenous heritage, outlining five different Aboriginal communities and their living cultures.</p><p> At the hands-on, inter-active kSpace children can design vehicles and buildings in a futuristic Australia, while Our Place features a tankstand hideaway (shared with a crocodile), treehouse (complete with snake) and backyard and magic wardrobe cubby-houses.</p><p> When leaving Canberra take the Federal Highway and inspect the showpiece Kamberra Wine Tourism Complex, opened in September 2000.</p><p> Joshua Moore, who received the area's first land grant in 1824, named his property Canberra after hearing local Aborigines calling the area Kamberra.</p><p> Set on 8.5ha and surrounded by vineyards, the complex has a showcase display of Canberra's 24 wineries, a restaurant and tasting room, glassware exhibits from a local workshop and 11am daily tours.</p><p> For $10 visitors get a souvenir glass, taste a dozen new release wines and a 45-minute inspection of the workings of the winery.</p><p> It's the perfect end to a varied and never boring trip.</p><p>Fact file</p><p>Where to try wines:\u00a0 Kamberra Wine Tourism Complex and its Meeting Place restaurant, 10am-5pm daily (except Christmas Day and Good Friday).

She slammed the door and shouted at the top of her lungs: ''Honey, pack your bags. I won the lottery!''</p><p>The husband said: ''Oh my God! What should I pack, beach stuff or mountain stuff?''</p><p>''Doesn't matter,'' she said. ''Just get out.''</p><p>VERY TRUE</p><p>MARRIAGE is a relationship in which one person is always right, and the other is a husband.</p><p>TWENTY DOLLARS</p><p>ON their wedding night, the young bride approached her new husband and asked for $20 for their first lovemaking encounter.</p><p>In his highly aroused state, her husband readily agreed.</p><p>This scenario was repeated each time they made love, for more than 30 years, with him thinking that it was a cute way for her to afford new clothes and other incidentals.</p><p>Arriving home around noon one day, she was surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state.</p><p>During the next few minutes, he explained that his employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go.</p><p>It was unlikely that, at the age of 59, he'd be able to find another position that paid anywhere near what he'd been earning, and therefore, they were financially ruined.</p><p>Calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which showed more than 30 years of steady deposits and interest totalling nearly $1 million.</p><p>Then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the bank which were worth more than $2 million, and informed him that they were one of the largest depositors in the bank.</p><p>She explained that for the more than three decades she had 'charged' him for sex, these holdings had multiplied and these were the results of her savings and investments.</p><p>Faced with evidence of cash and investments worth more than $3 million, her husband was so astounded he could barely speak, but finally he found his voice and blurted out: ''If I'd had any idea what you were doing, I would have given you all my business!''</p><p>That's when she shot him.</p><p>You know, sometimes men just don't know when to keep their mouths shut.</p><p>THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR DURING SURGERY</p><p>1. Better save that. We'll need it for the autopsy.</p><p>2. Accept this sacrifice, O Great Lord of Darkness.</p><p>3. Bobo! Come back with that. Bad dog!</p><p>4. Wait a minute, if this is his spleen, then what's that?</p><p>5. Hand me that. uh. that uh. . . that thingy there.</p><p>5. Oh no! Where's my Rolex?</p><p>7. Oops! Hey, has anyone ever survived after 500ml of this stuff before?</p><p>8. There go the lights again!</p><p>9. Ya know, there's big money in kidneys and this guy's got two of 'em.</p><p>10. Everybody stand back! I lost my contact lens!</p><p>11. Could you stop that thing from beating -- it's throwing off my concentration.</p><p>12. What's this doing here?</p><p>13. I hate it when they're missing stuff in here.</p><p>14. That's cool! Now can you make his leg twitch by pressing that one?</p><p>15. Well folks, this will be an experiment for all of us.</p><p>16. Sterile schmerile. The floor's clean, right?</p><p>17. What do you mean he wasn't in for a sex change?!</p><p>18. OK, now take a picture from this angle. This is truly a freak of nature.</p><p>19. This patient has already had some kids, am I correct?</p><p>20. Nurse, did this patient sign an organ donation card?</p><p>21. Don't worry. I think it's sharp enough.</p><p>22. What do you mean 'You want a divorce?!'</p><p>23. FIRE! FIRE! Everyone get out!</p><p>24. Darn!

Most of you have read the scare-mail about the person whose kidneys were stolen while he was passed out.</p><p>Well, read on.</p><p>While the kidney story was an urban myth, this one is not.</p><p>It's happening every day.</p><p>My thighs were stolen from me during the night a few years ago. It was just that quick.</p><p>I went to sleep in my body and woke up with someone else's thighs.</p><p>The new ones had the texture of cooked oatmeal.</p><p>Who would have done such a cruel thing to legs that had been mine for years? Whose thighs were these and what happened to mine?</p><p>I spent the entire summer looking for my thighs. Finally, hurt and angry, I resigned myself to living out my life in jeans and Sheer Energy pantyhose.</p><p>Then, just when my guard was down, the thieves struck again.</p><p>My butt was next. I know it was the same gang, because they took pains to match my new rear end (although badly attached at least 8cm lower than my original) to the thighs they stuck me with earlier.</p><p>Now, my rear end complemented my legs, lump for lump.</p><p>Frantic, I prayed that long skirts would stay in fashion.</p><p>It was two years ago when I realised my arms had been switched. One morning I was fixing my hair and I watched horrified but fascinated as the flesh of my upper arms swung to and fro with the motion of the hairbrush.</p><p>This was really getting scary. My body was being replaced one section at a time.</p><p>How clever and fiendish.</p><p>Age? Age had nothing to do with it. Age is supposed to creep up, unnoticed, something like maturity.</p><p>NO, I was being attacked repeatedly and without warning. In despair I gave up my T-shirts. What could they do to me next?</p><p>My poor neck disappeared more quickly than the Thanksgiving turkey it now resembled.</p><p>That's why I decided to tell my story. I can't take on the medical profession by myself.</p><p>Women of the world, wake up and smell the coffee.</p><p>That really isn't plastic that those surgeons are using. You KNOW where they are getting those replacement parts, don't you?</p><p>The next time you suspect someone has had a face 'lifted', look again. Was it lifted from you?</p><p>I think I finally found my thighs . . . and I hope Cindy Crawford paid a really good price for them!</p><p>This is not a hoax.</p><p>This is happening to women in every town every night.</p><p>WARN YOUR FRIENDS.</p><p>P.S. I must say that last year I thought someone had stolen my breasts. I was lying in bed and they were gone!</p><p>As I jumped out of bed I was relieved to see that they had just been hiding in my armpits as I slept. Now I keep them hidden in my waistband.</p><p>DUTIES OF WIVES</p><p>THREE men were sitting together bragging about how they had given their new wives duties.</p><p>Terry had married a woman from England, and bragged that he had told his wife she needed to do all the dishes and housework.</p><p>He said that it took a couple of days but on the third day he came home to a clean house and the dishes were all washed and put away.</p><p>Jimmie had married a woman from Canada.</p><p>He bragged that he had given his wife orders that she was to do all the cleaning, dishes and the cooking.</p><p>He told them that the first day he didn't see any results, but the next day it was better. By the third day, his house was clean, the dishes were done, and he had a huge dinner on the table.</p><p>The third man had married an Australian girl.</p><p>He boasted that he told her that her duties were to keep the house cleaned, dishes washed, laundry and ironing twice a week, lawns mowed, windows cleaned and hot meals on the table for every meal.</p><p>He said the first day he didn't see anything, the second day he didn't see anything, but by the third day, most of the swelling had gone down and he could see a little out of his left eye.</p><p>Enough to fix himself a bite to eat, load the dishwasher and call a handyman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TWNBUL-BUL0612021034210917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QTWNBLLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4MGF-9X80-TX52-R1YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463812</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Townsville Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>December 2, 2006 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00096SE</classCode><className>EMAIL MARKETING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00096SE</classCode><className>EMAIL MARKETING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DROY</classCode><className>SPAMMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000568</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC MAIL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The new height of idiocy is to stop coal going from Newcastle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The backbone of NSW's second-largest city -- a Labor town built on the steel of the BHP mills and the coal from the Hunter Valley -- is still coal, despite all the changes the valley has been through.</p><p>It is also the undeniable backbone of Australia's domestic energy needs for decades to come and will continue to supply the bulk of the world's energy until 2050.</p><p>And this is not the pipedream of a fossil industry but the conclusion of the British Stern report, which urges economic changes to fight greenhouse gas emissions. We can't do without coal; we have to learn to live with it.</p><p>To try to kill off the $9billion coal industry in NSW and the exports shipped from Newcastle is to condemn the city and thousands of workers and businesses.</p><p>Yet this week, in the grip of greenhouse hysteria, the Newcastle City Council, at the behest of Greens councillors and supported by Labor councillors, determined that Newcastle's coal shipments should be limited.</p><p>The motion said the council recommended ''the NSW Government establishes a cap on coal exports from Newcastle at existing levels'' and ''initiates a moratorium on new coalmines at Anvil Hill and elsewhere in the Hunter Valley and Gunnedah Basin''.</p><p>It went one further by backing calls from conservation groups to shut down the coal industry, and called for the industry ''to fund the just transition to sustainability in the Hunter beyond coal''. That is, levy the coal industry to fund its own closure and find jobs for the displaced workers. ''Just transition'' is greenhouse-friendly code for sack workers.</p><p>Not surprisingly, local federal MP Joel Fitzgibbon, a Labor frontbencher and former resources spokesman, went ballistic: ''Extreme environmentalists are launching a jihad against the industry in an attempt to close it down, and the community must be told the other side of the story,'' he said.</p><p>''We must strive to increase the share of electricity produced by renewable technologies, burn our coal more cleanly and efficiently and tighten environmental safeguards. But killing King Coal would be a disaster for the valley.''</p><p>The heresy committed in Fitzgibbon's electorate allowed him to publicly vent feelings about anti-coal campaigns being conducted by conservationists in the name of fighting greenhouse gas emissions. There is trepidation in the ranks of Kim Beazley's supporters about the ALP being swept along in the emotional surge of anti-coal feeling.</p><p>Endorsed federal Labor candidate and potential ALP leader Bill Shorten and Victorian state Labor candidate Evan Thornley both suffered collateral damage this week because of their links with the GetUp campaign. As the national secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Shorten was defending the pay and conditions of the unsung heroes of the Melbourne Cup, the jockeys, but at the same time GetUp, of which he and Thornley are board members, was calling for an end to the coal industry and a ''just transition''. Both rapidly distanced themselves from any suggestion they supported the closure of the coal industry.</p><p>Beazley also made it clear yesterday that the future of Australia's baseload electricity power would come from coal and that he was backing the coal industry: a clean coal industry.</p><p>The Opposition Leader was emphatic about the Newcastle council's ban: ''That's not the right answer. The right answer is to go down the road of active measures for clean coal technology. We've got to become the world experts at clean coal technology and, as we export coal, we need to export those technologies with it, make sure we can survive economically and also survive environmentally.''</p><p>Beazley is right: it's a mixture of surviving economically and environmentally. But there has been too much emphasis from Labor on the potential effects of greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations.</p><p>Certainly there is a clear political differentiation between the Howard Government and Labor over the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and entering a carbon emissions trading scheme that makes coal more expensive. But Labor has to be careful not to be seen as embracing unreal emotional claptrap that threatens the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Australian workers.</p><p>Labor's industrial relations campaign and its position on Iraq have rebuilt the ALP base and secured it a steady spot above the crucial 40per cent of the primary vote in opinion polls, but it cannot afford to alienate that base in pursuit of a new campaign to pick up concerned green Liberals in leafy suburbs and keep faith with the progressive Labor Left.</p><p>Howard's response on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions has been ad hoc and sloppy. Some sort of an emissions trading scheme is inevitable, yet the Coalition is poorly placed to deal with the politics.</p><p>However, don't dismiss the prospect of Howard preparing an important statement on greenhouse emissions and climate change before Christmas in which he sets out a more coherent agenda that is unapologetically worker friendly.</p><p>Howard learned in 2004 that playing cat and mouse with Mark Latham over the Tasmanian forest issue worked in his favour in two ways: first, Latham went too green too early, and second, the reverberations of defending jobs went far beyond Tasmania. Putting forward practical steps to address greenhouse emissions and protecting jobs is a political winner.</p><p>The anti-coal brigade is already damaging Labor by association and creating internal tensions, and the next frontier of forests is yet to be reached. Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation Minister Eric Abetz started the forest fire in the Senate this week when he pointed out that plantation forests cut carbon emissions and offset greenhouse gas emissions from industry. Conservation groups have also pointed to a forgotten aspect of the Stern report, which urges a halt to deforestation and highlights the positive aspects of planting trees and using wood instead of other materials in building.</p><p>Howard was surprised last week in the face of Senate committee evidence that in 2002-03 electricity generation emitted 160 megatonnes of greenhouse gases while in just three weeks bushfires released 130 megatonnes.</p><p>Old-growth forest management, logging state forests, plantation timber and pulping are the next frontiers in the greenhouse war.</p><p>Howard has been slow to enter the fray but Labor has more to lose if the realisation dawns before the election that there are drastic and unjustified changes being proposed in the name of greenhouse panic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0611101016467815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4M9J-2F10-TX52-F339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1127\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian (Australia)</publicationName><edition>All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>November 10, 2006 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

He favours a \"Smokey the Bear\"-style campaign, mirrored on an earlier scheme that raised awareness of forest fire risks.</p><p> \"Personally, I believe any home user should not be on the web without basic firewall functionality, some intrusion detection capabilities and some ability to control the content that flows in and out of the home -- particularly if you're on a broadband connection.\"</p><p> Within organisations, most security breaches are due to lapses in policy or practices rather than failure to deploy technology.</p><p> \"People buy a lot of technologies, but they forget to update virus definitions, they forget to police passwords, they forget to remove access for people who have left the company,\" he says.</p><p> \"We know there is a significant deficit in skills, so we have developed services to help our customers deploy and use our technologies in the most effective way.\"</p><p> Security is a hotspot in the IT sector, with the US Computer Emergency Response Team reporting twice as many serious network events in 2001 than in 2000.</p><p> \"But you will also see that the complexity of those threats has grown exponentially, with Code Red and Nimda having devastating effects,\" Thompson says.</p><p> \"In fact, if the trend continues, we're going to have to employ just about everybody in the world to deal with cyber-security!\"</p><p> This may not faze Symantec too much -- the company has built on its anti-virus heritage to become the dominant global brand in internet security.</p><p> IDC estimates the market for security software and services will exceed $US25 billion by 2004.</p><p> In the past 15 months Symantec has expanded its portfolio to offer an array of technologies and services to protect the \"critical infrastructures\" of everyone from home users to corporate systems.</p><p> \"Over the last 12 months our enterprise security revenues have grown by more than 30 per cent every quarter,\" he says.</p><p> \"We have won a sizeable contract in the US for the Navy and the Marine Corps, which is the largest internet infrastructure project undertaken in our country for government.</p><p> \"In the private sector, we do business with 98 of the Fortune 100 companies, and globally more than 400 of the top 500 do business with us.\"</p><p> Many of these customers were principally focused on anti-virus products, but \"now they want to talk to us about other security technologies\".</p><p> Interest has finally reached corporate board level, he says. \"While they all rushed to web-enable parts of their business, they now recognise they can't accelerate their move to the web without appropriate security as part of that plan,\" he says. \"Success for e-commerce initiatives, and e-government initiatives, is critically dependant on how thoughtful the advocates of those approaches are in their deployment of security.\"</p><p> The release in the US last week of the SymantecGateway Security Appliance, the first to feature five applications -- firewall, anti-virus, content filtering, intrusion detection and virtual private networking -- heralds the new \"all points covered\" approach.</p><p> Thompson says his company is focusing on customer \"pain-points\" -- reducing complexity, making security applications easier to manage, driving down costs -- and ensuring its products and services are uniformly available in every region.</p><p> \"Quite frankly, our future depends now on how we grow our business base globally,\" he says.</p><p> \"Our business in Australia is exceedingly strong.

I loved that word \"augmented\". It sounded like \"tormented orchestra\" and it conjured up visions of a vast army of musicians from around the country, a legion of fiddlers, trumpeters and drummers combined to raise the roof of the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Steven Spielberg is that sort of director. He marshalls such prodigious resources that even the simplest story is given epic proportions. Spielberg's Augmented Orchestra, a congregation of dazzling talent, helps to make Always the loudest, flashiest, fastest movie in town.</p><p>Which is a bit strange because, unlike his generally underrated Empire of the Sun, Always is a little piece, an intimate story about the bonds of love and the pain of separation. But Spielberg chooses to tell it against a vast background of landscapes incinerated by flame and an army of brave firefighters on the ground and in the air.</p><p> Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss) is a fearless flier, a man who lives to get behind the controls of his converted World War II bomber, an A26, which he flies into forest fires dropping chemical retardant.His best mate Al Yackey (John Goodman) flies a Catalina flying boat.</p><p> The complicating factor is Pete's girlfriend Dorinda (Holly Hunter).Pete and Dorinda are madly in love, ideally suited to each other and blissfully happy together. It is the perfect love affair. Except, of course, for Pete's dangerous flying which gives Dorinda the heebie jeebies.Wouldn't you know it? The night he pledges to take a safe job he is called out on an emergency and crashes.</p><p> That's just the beginning. Pete finds himself on the way to heaven, but an angel (the ever-smiling Audrey Hepburn) tells him he has unfinished business on earth. He must hand on his natural, God-given ability to another flier. And he must release Dorinda from the shackles of the love she still bears for him so that she can live her life.</p><p> Nature has already set things in motion. A young, accident-prone pilot called Ted (Brad Johnson) has fallen in love with Dorinda. But Pete finds himself torn with jealousy.</p><p> Able to move freely in and out of the thoughts of Ted and Dorinda, Pete is nevertheless invisible to them (but not to us) and he's tempted to cause mischief rather than do good works.</p><p> Richard Dreyfuss makes a charming, lovesick ghost and Holly Hunter brings her unique, quirky intensity to the tomboyish Dorinda. John Goodman has some star turns as Al, and Brad Johnson makes a sexy Ted.</p><p> The central story broaches some interesting psychological territory.The theme of death, grief and rebirth is cleverly explored. It is certainly a much breezier treatment than the original 1943 film version, A Guy Named Joe, which mixed in notions of patriotism and self-sacrifice.</p><p> REMOVING the deus ex machina of a righteous war casts Spielberg's film somewhat adrift. It becomes a wacky fable, missing the portentousness, the self-importance of its forerunner.</p><p> Not that there isn't plenty of action. The flying and forest fire scenes are brilliantly staged, quite extraordinary, in fact. It's just that fighting a fire doesn't carry the same dramatic weight as saving civilisation from the dreaded Nazi hordes.</p><p> Like all Spielberg's work, Always is full of dazzling cinematic coups and brilliantly executed contributions from masters like composer John Williams.</p><p> It is a charming, slightly goofy film which critics will probably carve up here as they did in the US.A pity, really. It is highly entertaining - a bit like a chocolate with a soft, gooey centre.</p><p> END OF STORY</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A 'ghostly' Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter and Brad Johnson.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYHERALDLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49M5-J4R0-01S8-D381-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Herald</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1990 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"1990\"><dateText>April 8, 1990 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N711130MM</classCode><className>MUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UR9</classCode><className>WIND INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000385</classCode><className>CONTENT RATINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N711130MM</classCode><className>MUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UR9</classCode><className>WIND INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE000DM6I</classCode><className>HOLLY HUNTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE0009TQX</classCode><className>STEVEN SPIELBERG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>PE000DKRD</classCode><className>KATHLEEN KENNEDY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

JODIE DUFFY talks to the Dalai Lama's right-hand man.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What lights up your world?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is it money, power, religion, relationships or maybe even chocolate? In the quest for happiness the mind is wired to gravitate to external sources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But are we looking for bliss in all the wrong places? Yes, says the happiest man in the world, Matthieu Ricard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dr Ricard, a Tibetan monk who has a PHD in cellular genetics, has become something of a guru since the media bestowed on him the optimistic title.</p><p>Not that it really means anything to the Frenchman, who lives in a monastery in Nepal. \"It's nice to be called that, than the most unhappiest man,\" he says. \"But it doesn't make any sense scientifically, I mean how can you measure that.\"</p><p>Ricard certainly rubs shoulders with the world's most tranquil souls, the elite meditators of the world - sort of like the Olympic champions of the mind.</p><p>In recent years science has made inroads into proving that happiness is not just a vague feeling, but a physical state of the brain. Ricard, now 61, was the first volunteer in the initial study by US neuroscientists who hooked his skull up to 256 sensors and monitored him for three hours while he meditated, without moving a muscle, in an MRI machine. Scientists were stunned at the tremendous electrical activity in Ricard's left prefrontal-lobe. It was at a magnitude and intensity never seen before.</p><p>When the media began calling him the happiest man alive, Ricard was embarrassed to face his scientist friends. Still he says the fanciful title has allowed him to travel the world and spread the message about what he calls mind training or meditation with purpose. \"Everyone has the capacity to be the happiest man in the world,\" Ricard says. \"But they need to look for happiness in the right places.\"</p><p>Ricard is sitting in an auditorium at Darling Harbour looking out at a sea of 750 faces at the Happiness and it's Causes pre-conference workshop. As he unlocks the secrets to happiness three giant screens beam his image across the room.</p><p>It's at events like these that he can teach Westeners about the power of meditation and the good it can do for all of mankind.</p><p>Happiness according to Ricard is not intense pleasure or a burst of joy. Rather it's a way of being, found in qualities such as altruistic love, compassion, inner freedom, inner peace, contentment and the ability to deal with life as it happens.</p><p>Meditation he explains is a learned skill and not an oriental hobby or a relaxation technique. The very meaning of the word meditation in Tibet means to cultivate.</p><p>\"It's our mind that translates outer conditions to happiness or suffering. But that changes when we train our mind.\"</p><p>The aim he believes is to raise our base line. \"The base line is the platform you sit on when you're not experiencing the ups and downs of life. It's where you come back to after moments of joy and sadness.\"</p><p>While we all inherit traits to our personality, Ricard believes genes are just a blueprint which can change depending on our environment, education and childhood.</p><p>\"The mind is plastic,\" he says. \"We create 5000 new neurons, new connections and new functions in the brain every day and more if we're learning something new.\"</p><p>But it takes time to change the mind. Not that you need to spend years in quiet, reflective retreat, but the more meditation you do, the closer it brings you to fulfillment. Even 30 minutes a day for eight weeks can substantially improve health and well-being.</p><p>Meditation decreases stress by 26 per cent, can boost the immune system by 20 per cent and decreases our levels of anger and anxiety. A recent Canadian study also shows that those suffering high blood pressure can reduce it by 15 per cent through mind-training meditation.</p><p>Ricard considers the improvement to health a sideline; the real benefit for ourselves and society is in changing our minds. \"When you train the mind, you change the quality of every moment of your life,\" he says.</p><p>The mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy. The goal Ricard explains is not to be a slave to our thoughts, but to stop one thought leading to 1000 thoughts. \"One small spark of thought can suddenly give way to a forest fire of anger, jealousy or craving,\" he says. \"Let the thought go, it's not that complicated.\"</p><p>He admits that meditation is not the \"ultimate entertainment in life\". \"We don't do it for fun, but to preserve our inner peace and to be of service to others,\" he says.</p><p>Each meditation session should be dedicated to the benefit of all human beings with a final outpouring of loving kindness and compassion. \"Don't let the universe be the mail order catalogue for your desires. Every member in society has a responsibility to have compassion in their heart.\"</p><p>While emotions like despair and hopelessness are to be avoided, sadness he says is unavoidable. \"If you see a massacre and you're sad, what's wrong with that. It doesn't diminish your happiness. What it does is awake in you compassion and courage and it spurs you on to alleviate the suffering of others.\"</p><p>Ricard is involved in 30 humanitarian projects, including schools and health clinics in Tibet. \"The more I wish to serve others, even in the face of a sad event, the more I'm in a state of happiness,\" he says.</p><p>His humanitarian works can be viewed on www.karuna-asia.org. He has also written a book, Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skills.</p><p>When you feel overwhelmed by emotions</p><p>EXERCISE: Imagine a stormy sea with breakers as big as houses. Each wave is more monstrous than the last. They are about to engulf your boat, your very life hangs on those few extra yards in the rushing wall of water.</p><p>Then imagine observing the same scene from a high flying plane. From that perspective, the waves seem to form a delicate blue-and-white mosaic, barely trembling on the surface of the water. From that height in the silence of space, your eye sees these almost motionless patterns, and your mind immerses itself in clear and luminous sky.</p><p>The waves of anger or obsession seem real enough, but remind yourself that they are merely fabrications of your mind; that they will rise and also again disappear. Why stay on the boat of mental anxiety?

Others, such as young martyr Lai Ning, are newcomers to the party pantheon.</p><p>Here are a few of the legends now in vogue:</p><p>* The peasant soldier Lei Feng. Nearly two decades after his death, Chinese today offer blood, sweep streets and give free haircuts in the name of Lei, who according to one song \"walks 1,000 miles and does 1,000 good deeds\".</p><p>According to legend, the fervent patriot secretly washed the clothes of his comrades, donated his savings to help peasants hit by floods and once gave his coat to a woman and her child during a freezing rainstorm.</p><p>Lei was killed in 1962 at the age of 22 when he backed his truck into a utility pole. A year later Mao Zedong proclaimed him a communist saint in the first of many Learn from Lei Feng campaigns.</p><p>* Fourteen-year-old Lai Ning. Described by the party's official People's Daily as \"a flaming torch\" of revolutionary spirit, young Lai died in 1988 while trying to put out a forest fire near his home in northern China.</p><p>Last October he headed a list of the nation's 10 best Young Pioneers, a party-led youth organisation. Among the revelations about Lai are that he hoped to be a geologist so he could excavate precious metals from mountains around his home and \"contribute to our motherland.\"</p><p>\"Study the hero Lai Ning\" meetings are being held across the country. Beijing city has issued the book The Heroic Youth Lai Ning and organised Study Lai Ning detachments in schools.</p><p>* Model workers. Late last year 2,000 model workers were assembled at the Great Hall of the People for the first national ceremony in three decades to honour such exemplars of labour.</p><p>Others are hailed regularly in the official press, such as:</p><p>* \"Sweeper Uncle\" Jiang Daoping, a war hero who shot down seven enemy planes in the Korean War, took a job as a janitor after retiring from the military. His daughter was worried she wouldn't get a boyfriend with her father in such a lowly position. But Jiang reportedly replied: \"It is no shame to do whatever I can for society. It will benefit both my body and soul.\"</p><p>* Policewoman \"Flying Li\" Songzhi, the 52-year-old chief of a task force that battles pickpockets, is quoted as saying: \"Riding the bicycle at full speed, I can keep up with a bus when a thief is riding on it. In so doing, I feel that I have regained my youth.\"</p><p>* \"Learn from Daqing.\" This common call during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution refers to the perseverance of those who built the nation's largest oilfield in the wastelands of north-east China.</p><p>Wang Tao, head of the China National Petroleum Corporation, pledged last year during ceremonies marking the 30th anniversary of the Daqing fields that he would initiate a massive campaign to revive the Daqing spirit.</p><p>* \"The Spirit of Yanan.\" Yanan, in the dusty hills of northwest China, was Mao Zedong's base for 13 years during the 1930s and 1940s when the Red Army was fighting the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists.</p><p>Young Chinese are now told to emulate the spirit of those days, when Mao and the other communist leaders lived in caves and worked among the Yanan peasants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-4yhmr6g5tew1kvl8j8yx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW1990</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5564-5BY1-JD34-V274-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1990 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Each year about 27 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide are belched out into the atmosphere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lucky for us, not all the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere stays there and contributes to global warming (if it did it would be known as global sweltering). Of our annual 27 billion tonnes carbon dioxide output;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">&amp;#45;</emphasis> 7 billion tonnes are absorbed by oceans; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">&amp;#45;</emphasis> 7 billion tonnes are taken up by forests, and; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">&amp;#45;</emphasis> 13 billion tonnes accumulate in the atmosphere each year.</p><p>However, there's a complication to this neat little equation &amp;#8212; in the last two years, the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen much faster than expected, from an average of 13 to 18 billion tonnes. Scientists attribute this increase to humans producing more carbon dioxide and, ironically, to global warming itself &amp;#8212; as the Earth's temperature rises it decreases the ability of oceans and forests to take up carbon dioxide.</p><h>How big is a tonne of CO2 gas?</h><p>Tasmania is 68,401 km&amp;#178;. If we spread Australia's yearly production of CO2 over the surface of Tasmania it would form a 3 metre high blanket across the island.</p><p>1 gram of CO2 = 556 ml (a bit less than the volume of a bottle of water)</p><p>1 tonne CO2 = 556,000 litres or 556 m3 (about the volume of a 3 bedroom house)</p><p>Each year Australia produces 542,600,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases, of which 70&amp;#37; (379,820,000 tonnes) is CO2.</p><h>The oceans ain't sinking like they used to!</h><p>Global warming could raise the sea levels by as much as six metres (20 feet) in the next generation and the earth could be heading for a mini ice-age. Image: Reuters As the planet warms, the ability of our oceans to dissolve atmospheric carbon dioxide will decrease because of three key factors &amp;#8212; the increase in water temperature, slowing of the thermohaline current and the role of phytoplankton.</p><p>The increase in water temperature will affect the solubility capacity of the oceans because colder water absorbs more carbon dioxide. This is why most carbon dioxide absorption occurs in the icy waters of the poles in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. As ocean temperatures rise due to global warming there will simply be less room within our oceans to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p><p>Global warming is also expected to apply the breaks to the thermohaline current (THC), a crucial global current that moves surface water to the ocean depths. The THC is created by cold and salty water sinking at the poles. This current drags carbon dioxide rich water deep into the ocean and brings carbon dioxide poor water to the surface where it can in turn, absorb more carbon dioxide. A slowing of this current will again result in less atmospheric carbon dioxide being removed by the oceans.</p><h>Figuring out phytoplankton</h><p>A crucial and uncertain piece in the puzzle is the role of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are microscopic ocean plants that convert carbon dioxide to organic carbon. Fish eat the phytoplankton and the carbon is locked away from the atmosphere in the bodies of animals.</p><p>The effects of climate change on phytoplankton are not clear. On one hand more carbon dioxide may stimulate photosynthesis and encourage more phytoplankton to grow. On the other, a warmer ocean surface is thought to prevent the mixing of nutrients in the upper layer and prevent phytoplankton from flourishing.</p><p>On the whole, it's not good news. Climate models that take into account changes in water temperature, the THC and phytoplankton activity predict 14&amp;#37; less carbon dioxide will be absorbed by oceans by 2100.</p><h>Forest &amp;#8212; our lungs and our sink!</h><p>Forests are often referred to as the lungs of the Earth, providing oxygen for the rest of the planet &amp;#8212; but they are also a massive carbon sink. Plants consume carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and produce oxygen as a by-product. Plants also produce carbon dioxide during respiration, but on the whole growing plants perform more photosynthesis than respiration, leading to an overall consumption of carbon dioxide.</p><p>Carbon tied up in forests is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide when soil bacteria and fungi decompose plant matter on the forest floor or when plants burn in forest fire. The highest recorded level of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere was over 23 billion tonnes in 1998, attributed to widespread forest fires in Indonesia.</p><h>A story of many factors</h><p>Elevated carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures have complicated effects on forests. Plants use carbon dioxide to photosynthesise and grow so it's not surprising that greater concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide stimulates plant growth. However, not all plants respond to higher carbon dioxide in the same way, with some plants growing faster than others. Research in the Amazon rainforest has shown that the forest composition changed when trees were exposed to more carbon dioxide.</p><p>Until recently, it was assumed that forests would acts as carbon sinks; absorbing carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere by human activity. But a recent study showed that forests in northeast Queensland became so stressed during two dry years that they changed the way they cycled carbon. In the first dry year, they produced as much carbon dioxide as absorbed or remained carbon neutral. In the second dry year they produced a surplus of carbon dioxide. It seems that climate change may stress some forests and turn them into carbon dioxide producers.</p><p>This unexpected turnaround from carbon sink to carbon producer is because lower rainfall and increased evaporation cause photosynthesis to slow down, resulting in nett carbon dioxide production - from plant decomposition and respiration.</p><p>The effect is thought to be short-term and the forest is expected to once again become a carbon sink with a return to wetter conditions. But Australia's long-term weather forecast is for drier conditions and the role of forests as carbon absorbers may not be as reliable as the planet continues to warm.</p><h>Tangled loops</h><p>The effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on carbon dioxide uptake systems is just one of the many feedback loops in the tangled mess of climate change. It seems the more we learn about global warming and climate change, the worse the prognosis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCIONL-2857167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCIONL2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:50W8-NFF1-JB17-5246-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">369587</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Science Online (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2393\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>April 29, 2006 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Alternative Energy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Environmental Management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Environmental Impact</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001235</classCode><className>OCEANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DS5V</classCode><className>OCEAN HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS4V</classCode><className>SEA LEVEL CHANGES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2L6</classCode><className>ATLANTIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A26S</classCode><className>EARTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2L9</classCode><className>SOUTHERN OCEAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Well that's not going to happen now as the club is to stay and is redeveloping the site, but the footbridge is still expected to proceed. A major effect is, of course, to shut down the ferry terminal at Flinders St East which is a shame. The city is greatly improved by the ferries buzzing up and down. But it's all a question of when, not if, so we're unlikely to get any say in it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ACCORDING to Sunferries manager Mick Reilly there's a possibility that the city terminal might be shut down even before the footbridge makes it necessary in order to keep costs down -- it's just one-cost saving measure he's considering.</p><p>AN institution in the twin cities, Chris, the Town Cobbler in the Cat &amp; Fiddle arcade, is reeling under the rumours that he has retired, which he definitely has not.

I remember one woman who had long feet was finding it difficult to find shoes and she had very sore feet. Lo and behold she got two large herrings-in-tomato-sauce tins. She padded them and tied them on her feet. She was comfortable after she got used to them and no more sore feet. I can't remember the brand of the herrings, but I thank the manufacturers on her behalf.\"</p><p>ON the matter of the mall re-opening to traffic, one reader asks why there has been no survey done among shoppers -- those who shop there now, and those who shop in other shopping centres. She believes that this would be the quickest and most effective way of finding out what should be done and she has a point. It is, after all, the shoppers who will determine the mall's success or otherwise.</p><p>GLOBETROTTING PR whiz Marcia Marseney, who's working in Manila at the moment, reports that journalists in the Philippines are being murdered at the drop of a hat and authorities are doing nothing about it. In the two weeks between July 31 and August 12, four journalists were murdered, bringing to 55 the number killed since 1986. But police say it's the journalists' own fault and that's why they can't manage to arrest anyone.</p><p>COUNCILLOR Jack Wilson has always been well known as an entertainer, but we seldom see him in the role of clown -- but that's what he was doing, hamming it up for the babies at the baby welcoming ceremony.

But today no self-respecting Hollywood star would dream of using a dubbed voice. It would suggest there were limits to their brilliance and versatility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The makers of Walk the Line are therefore at pains to point out that Joaquin Phoenix and <person><nameText>Reese Witherspoon </nameText></person>do their own singing in the concert sequences. And they do it well. Phoenix has a deep, rasping bass that goes well with his impersonation of Johnny Cash, and Witherspoon as his wife June Carter can hold a tune quite nicely. As with Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, one is surprised to discover they can sing at all.</p><p>I was never a huge Cash fan. The songs I liked were the obvious ones: Ring of Fire, I Walk the Line, both duly performed in James Mangold's big, moody biopic, along with a dozen or so others. The difficulty with musical biopics is that they can quickly become an excuse for a string of concert numbers. This is especially true if the subjects aren't already familiar from their movies as, say, Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley or Dean Martin were. Cash recorded five songs for the soundtrack of I Walk the Line, a romantic drama from 1970, but I can't remember a film in which he appeared as himself. I Walk the Line wasn't the Johnny Cash story. That story -- about a boy from a sharecropping family who grew up in the Depression and became the first superstar of country music -- is told in Mangold's film.</p><p>Well, actually, it's not. Many a lurid and discreditable episode in Cash's drug-fuelled career has been omitted from the film. Mangold and co-writer Gill Dennis based their screenplay on two books -- Man in Black and Cash: The Autobiography -- that may well give a franker picture of the man. There's nothing in the film about Cash starting a forest fire when high on amphetamines. He was also famous for smashing up hotel rooms and fabricating a story that he was one-quarter Cherokee. In the 1950s, while serving in the US Army in Germany, his hearing was damaged when a German girl playfully stuck a pencil in his left ear, and the scar on his cheek, far from being a knife wound, was the result of a cyst being removed by a drunken doctor.</p><p>Such trivia has no place in a film largely concerned with an overblown account of Cash's marital affairs. This is a film about a great show-biz romance, or so we are meant to regard it, and all stops are out. Cash married Vivian Liberto after his discharge from the army. But his great love was Carter, from seminal country music group the Carter Family, who had been married to one of Cash's drinking buddies, country singer Carl Smith.</p><p>After a long and turbulent affair with Cash, she married and divorced a stock-car driver before accepting an onstage proposal from Cash during a concert in 1968. In the film this charming episode gives their bumpy relationship a wholesome and sentimental climax, and only a sourpuss would fail to be touched. (It wasn't the last time Cash went public with his private life. In 1997, during a late renaissance in his career, he announced during a concert that he had Parkinson's disease, and was hospitalised soon after with double pneumonia. None of this is in Mangold's film, either.)</p><p>The performances are fine. Phoenix has a muscular, craggy sexiness that goes well with the impression left by Cash's music. He can convey a sense of honest bewilderment and inner soulfulness, and he and Witherspoon make a splendid team. I don't think I've seen Witherspoon in a part that demands so much down-to-earth acting, as distinct from the ironic roles and quirky comic personalities she has specialised in. The trademark bounciness and exuberance are there, but she's good enough to give the corniest lines a ring of conviction: ''You're not nothin'. God has given you a second chance to make things right.''</p><p>Country music is largely about that sort of thing: second chances, misunderstandings, emotional dilemmas, the outpourings of troubled souls. When Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) tells June to ''stay clear of my children'', it's exactly the sort of fraught relationship the country singer dealt with. One reason the film rings true is that it seems like a dramatisation of Cash's lyrics. There is much raw, authentic emotion in Walk the Line, and it ensures that what might have been a maudlin and phony film becomes, in its best moments, one of genuine power and truthfulness.</p><p>GGG</p><p>I WISH I could say as much for North Country, a worthy and well-intentioned drama from New Zealand director Niki Caro, who had a well-deserved success with Whale Rider. Her new film is another story about woman's invincibility in the face of traditional prejudice, inspired (dread word) by a landmark US court case in the 1980s. The events depicted, though passed off as real, are fictional. And with the film-makers enjoying unlimited scope for exaggeration, the result is a film more notable for righteous hysteria than social realism.</p><p>Charlize Theron plays Josey Aimes, a working-class single mother who walks out on her abusive husband and takes a job as a coalminer to support her two children. Her presence at the mine is bitterly resented by the men, who see women as a threat to their jobs and subject Josey and her few female workmates to a vicious campaign of intimidation: slogans daubed on lavatory walls, Portaloos upended with their female occupants in them, obscene objects planted in lunch boxes. Josey is finally persuaded to sue the mining company with the aid of a sympathetic lawyer (Woody Harrelson), who is drawn to the prospect of fighting the nation's first class action for sexual harassment.</p><p>It is hard to fault Theron's performance: she brings a measured dignity and restraint missing from the film as a whole. There is fine support from Frances McDormand (who really does look like a working-class battler), and Sissy Spacek (this time playing the coalminer's mum). Best of all is Richard Jenkins as Josey's father, a miner who begins by disapproving of her behaviour before rallying to her side.</p><p>The courtroom sequences that punctuate the story bear comparison with The Verdict. But the film feels strident and overdone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0602045023592031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4J62-4510-TX5J-8252-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE WEEKEND AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><edition>All-round Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>February 4, 2006 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp;

I mean, that's why we go to movies, to see people like these guys that really invite us into their lives, to experience characters through their eyes. That's the most rewarding part of a movie like this, getting in the ring with actors like Nic and Tye, and taking a story that I have a great history with and bringing it to life.\" Cage, of course, has had one of the most fascinating, and at times beguiling, careers of any actor of his time. Growing up Hollywood royalty as part of the Coppola family, he dazzled early in films such as Rumble Fish and Birdy, then had a truly stunning three-year run in 1986-87 with romantic leads in Peggy Sue Got Married, Raising Arizona and Moonstruck. All that was before he turned 24. Eight years later, he won the Academy Award for best actor for 1995's Leaving Las Vegas.</p><p>And that's when things got a little weird. The past nearly two decades of Cage's career have been wildly polarising. He's became one of the biggest action stars in the world, much to the chagrin of many fans who think he has sold out and abandoned his thespian roots. He's also appeared in some real stinkers. Big-budget stinkers, which are the hardest to forgive, it seems.</p><p>It was always a somewhat false duality. Cage turned in excellent performances in films such as John Woo's 1997 Face/Off, Martin Scorsese's 1999 Bringing Out the Dead, Spike Jonze's 2002 Adaptation and Werner Herzog's 2009 The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans. But for many moviegoers Cage had become the hack who cashed a big cheque for a National Treasure or Ghost Rider film once or twice a year.</p><p>For a while there, Green had been accused of turning his back on sensitive indie drama himself. Still, he can be forgiven for not immediately thinking of Cage when he imagined the title part in Joe. \"Whenever I'm reading a book,\" the director says, \"I'm thinking about the movie. I've been that way since I was a little kid. My first thought, reading the Larry Brown book long ago, was: \"This is Robert Mitchum.\" Somebody who really has this sense of wit but masculinity, and dramatic ability. But when I started thinking about the reality of putting this project together, Nic is the only guy who carries those with gusto. Who has the Oscars to prove it, has the bad-assed action movies to prove it and has the hilarious comedies that I can quote to you all day to prove it. So I really wanted that kind of complicated texture.</p><p>\"And I really wanted to bring Larry out,\" he continues. \"There is a resemblance. If you look at images of Larry, when Nic grows the beard out, there's definitely a very vivid resemblance. And when I started imagining that, I couldn't get it out of my mind.\" As for Cage, he gives a \"Who, me?\" kind of shrug and passes the credit. \"The great news was,\" he says, \"when I read the script, I knew right away that this was something where I wouldn't have to act too much. That I could bring whatever my life experiences were from the last couple of years into the role. And it's interesting, when the movie premiered and my wife saw it, she said, 'Well, that's you.' \" Cage could be accused of being just a bit disingenuous here. It's never quite as simple as \"just being yourself\" on camera. First of all, it's damned hard to be yourself in such an artificial environment - in a situation that's not your real life, speaking words not your own, with cameras and bright lights and cameras trained on you and dozens of people watching. (And knowing that millions will be watching later.) And second, what feels \"just being yourself\" to an actor doesn't always translate to audiences as character information onscreen.</p><p>Still, there's certainly a truth at the heart of his point about the script, adapted from a novel by Brown, possibly the great American southern novelist. When he wants to be, Green is a truly brilliant director, and he can be brilliant at extracting very naturalistic performances from his actors. Despite his reputation for over-the-top performances in recent years, Cage treasures that sort of role. \"One of the things about working with David,\" he says, \"is that he will interview his actors. He'll invite little stories you may recall from your own life. And he'll put those in the film, so that you get that feeling of spontaneity, that feeling of real life, of that actually happening, instead of something being acted out. Little memories, little bits and pieces of dialogue, little thoughts or experiences that actors can put into their performances so that you don't have to act so much.\" The project has deep, longstanding roots in Green's life. In college his film professor, Gary Hawkins, turned him on to Brown's novels, mostly set in Mississippi and all tough, gritty, gripping stories with unforgettable characters, many of them men struggling with images of masculinity. Green was transfixed. He went on to begin his career with critically lauded indie classics like George Washington and All the Real Girls before returning to work on Hawkins' 2002 award-winning documentary about the author, The Rough South of Larry Brown.</p><p>When Brown died suddenly in 2004 from an apparent heart attack, Hawkins decided to adapt his novel Joe as a screenplay, thinking it was at once Brown's most personal work, the work that Hawkins himself most responded to, and the most cinematic of the novels. He couldn't get any interest from the industry. Nine years later, he was having an idle conversation with Green, who had since parlayed his critical acclaim into big-budget Hollywood films (Pineapple Express, The Sitter) and legendary television comedy status (Eastbound &amp; Down). Green asked his old professor if he had anything he should read and received, in return, the script for Joe.</p><p>\"When I read the script,\" Green remembers, \"it struck me as a great contemporary western, a genre I've always been drawn to and that I love. It's a story very distant from me, but it's something that really resonated with me. I felt really familiar with this world, even though I can't quite say I grew up in the squalor of Tye's character, and I can't quite say I'm as bad-assed and masculine as Nic's character. But they're people I look up to, and I wonder about. Even the horrific characters, or some of the quirkier characters, are people I feel like, in my strange life, I've met along the way. And I love to explore, and take a few steps in their shoes.\" Green had a few tricks up his sleeve to ground the film in the world in which it's set. \"I remember when Nic came to town,\" he recalls. \"We were talking about how to flesh out the cast. I really wanted it to have a raw authenticity and not a Hollywood polish. We were going to make sure these characters felt like they were of a real world, and that we were dropping in on guys who knew how to do this labour, and how to do these voices of either poetry or horror, depending on who we were looking at. We cast it, outside of Nic, with all Texans. It was all shot in and around Austin, and we'd go downtown in the morning and there'd be a construction foreman looking for guys for the job, and some people with landscaping needs looking for someone for their job, and then there we were looking for some people for our job.\" But filling one specific part was a nagging challenge, says Green: \"I wanted somebody who felt sad, in a way, and had a depth and darkness behind his eyes rather than a guy who was going to just roll up his sleeves and chew up a \"bad guy\" role. I auditioned some incredible actors \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for the part \"[Casting directors] John Williams and Karmen Leech met Gary Poulter at a bus stop downtown \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 He had actually just come back from his father's funeral. He'd been living on the streets downtown for quite a while and had had some hardships. But he had some amazing stories to tell, and a wonderful charisma, and a positive ambition to bring to the table \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It was amazing to work with him and introduce him to Cage. I introduced them at breakfast one morning, and they hit it off. Then I introduced him to Tye, and they hit it off, and we just had a wonderful time working with this guy.'</p><p>A LOT of A-list stars might have baulked at sharing significant screen time with a homeless man with no previous film experience. Not Cage. \"The thing is, Gary Poulter had a work ethic,\" he raves. \"He had the Vincent Price monologue from [Alice Cooper's TheBlack Widow] down. He would perform it. All the time. At the drop of a hat. It was outstanding. I mean he was a real, trained street performer. So when I was ready to work, he was ready to work. And vice versa. It didn't feel that much different from working with someone out of Julliard.\" Cage did his best to give Poulter a vision of the change he was in the process of making in his life. \"I said to Gary, 'Just keep it together for one year',\" he says, emotionally. \"One year, and your life is going to change dramatically. You're going to be getting all kinds of phone calls and you're going to be making all kinds of movies.\" About two months after the end of filming, Poulter's lifeless body was found in 1m of water in Lady Bird Lake in Austin. It's a loss that no one in the production can speak of without obviously raw emotion. \"It's sad,\" Cage says, shaking his head helplessly.</p><p>DURING the time Joe was being filmed, Green kept the set loose, as is his wont. \"I like working with David,\" says Sheridan, \"because he incorporates a sense of realness and honesty into his films. He's very spontaneous.\" \"Regardless of the darkness or dramatic nature of the film,\" Green explains, \"I always cast people with a sense of humour. It's about inviting a little bit of absurdity and humanness into the process. It's about remembering that no matter who we are, or what sort of pedestal or what glamorous lighting we're under, we're all eating boogers, man.\" Green was glad to have secured Sheridan at this moment in his career. He dazzled audiences in two of the best films of the past two years, 2012's The Tree of Life and 2013's Mud, directed by fellow Texans Terrence Malick and Jeff Nichols. But he hasn't quite reached that Di-Caprio level of teen celebrity. \"You sometimes get a little self-consciousness in actors,\" Green says, \"especially young actors that are starting to see themselves in ads and interviews and thinking, 'Oh man, I'm cool as shit!' \" \"I like to work with young people,\" Cage says, \"because young people haven't had their dreams kicked out of them yet. They're full of confidence and imagination and vision. And when they score, that all gets empowered. And Tye was a great example of that.\"</p><p>JOE seems much more of a piece with Green's Prince Avalanche than with any of his other recent work. The connection isn't lost on him. \"I think there is a spiritual connection between the two, in a way,\" he says. \"There's something about Mother Nature's efforts and the catastrophic nature of a forest fire, and then there's something very intimately peculiar about a man who takes a hatchet with poison and takes out a tree. As much as a lot of my films have been about strange conflicts of masculinity, I think there's also always been a template of backdrop. I'm always interested in where we are. Who are these people, in this place, in this time?\" The concern with images of masculinity in Brown's writing and Green's filmmaking is an element that resounds strongly with Cage. He even contributed one of the film's most memorable conversations to the script. \"About 2000 years ago,\" he explains, \"I had put a script together called Heartbreaker, Incorporated, which never got made. In that script, I put a line in there, but I never found a place for it to work. And I thought that maybe with Joe it could work. I don't know how it came to me. I think I was looking at old commercials of the Marlboro Man. It was always this guy who was kind of squinting and kind of smiling. And I was like, 'You look like you're in pain, but you're smiling. Is that the icon of cool? Is that what it means to be cool?' I did the math - OK, make a face of pain, now smile, yeah, that's cool. So I thought I'd put that concept into this movie.\" Still, if there's a good many pieces of Joe in Cage, the actor is keenly aware of the differ-ences. Asked in a press conference whether he's ever had to do backbreaking work like Joe does in the film, he says, \"I used to sell popcorn at the Fairfax Movie Theatre in Los Angeles; that was my first job. And I took the tickets, too. I was also the usher. And I was trying to figure how I could get from there to being on the screen. One day a guy was smoking during the movie, and my boss told me I had to go tell him to put it out. And I went up to the guy and said, 'I'm sorry, sir, you're going to have to put your cigarette out.' And he looked at me, and took one big puff, and he just blew all the smoke in my face. And I quit.</p><p>\"That was the most backbreaking work I've ever done,\" he adds. The room erupts in loud laughter. Nic Cage, A-lister, action star and thespian, can still bring the house down.</p><p>Paste, April 2014Joe is screening at Melbourne's Australian Centre for the Moving Image until September 16.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-The Australian20140906Review12000119630137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D2P-9DR1-JD3N-54V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2248\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 6, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DHZP</classCode><className>ACADEMY AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009W0D</classCode><className>DRAMA FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001110</classCode><className>MEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DHZP</classCode><className>ACADEMY AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009W0D</classCode><className>DRAMA FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>PE000A38Q</classCode><className>NICOLAS CAGE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Bernard Zuel reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AMERICAN singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright spent a lot of last year being Judy Garland. As you do. Or at least replicating her famous Carnegie Hall concert from 1961, song by song, emotion by emotion - though not exactly costume by costume, even if one\u00c2\u00a0or two outfits came close.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We didn't get to see the show here - only London and New York did - and when Wainwright plays in Sydney it will be with a band but without Garland. Still, the shows left their mark on him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Honestly, the next big thing for me is the opera, because that's been my lifelong ambition and fascination,\" Wainwright says. \"That is taking up all the mental space. And there's a large mental space there now that Judy's gone. She really carved out a cathedral that you have to replace with something.\"</p><p>Wainwright's ability to be both arch and romantic, to build songs with an emotional landscape as complex and challenging as his dramatic pop melodies, has had him singled out as a rare, if inconsistent, talent since his 1998 eponymous debut album. Sometimes even he believes his songs could get on the radio and sell a lot, though the jury is still out. Possibly because even when there's only his languid voice and piano, his songs feel like mini-operas and Broadway musicals channelled through pop.</p><p>Still, when he plays with a band he both rocks out and camps up, a highly entertaining combination - something that Sydney audiences can expect. Was the Rufus-does-Judy show another of his life's goals\u00c2\u00a0ticked off?</p><p>\"I wouldn't even say it was a life goal, it was almost like ... I don't mean to say this and be disrespectful but it was almost like her life's goal. Meaning that I had this funny little idea, in the car listening to the album ... Somehow that spark ignited this forest fire and, next thing you know, it's happening and I really do feel like there was a sort of cosmic bubble that I punctured and all of this seething need to live - whether it was her, all the songs or the songwriters I don't know - but it happened and I went along with it. I loved every moment of it. I love Judy and I love the songs but there was a sort of nether force guiding that whole project.\"</p><p>Gee, after his most recent album, his fifth, Release The Stars - which started as an intimate album for not much more than voice and piano and ended up with orchestra, massed voices and big, big songs - who would have thought that a small idea of his would blow up into something almost excessive?</p><p>Wainwright chuckles in recognition. \"Yes, that's never happened before.\"</p><p>The opera, commissioned by the New York Metropolitan Opera, has been on the horizon for several years now for the passionate operatic fan. The first act is mostly written, next he has \"the meat\" - the orchestration - which he estimates will take him a year and test him like nothing he has done before.</p><p>\"And you know, honestly, with the amount of respect I have for composers who have gone before me, I'm not going to even scratch the surface of what's possible, or of what's been done, with my first opera. It's a tall, tall mountain.\"</p><p>Is there a libretto yet? \"I'm working on it [at] the moment with a friend. We're doing it in French. English is lovely in so many ways, except opera,\" he deadpans.</p><p>Can we look forward to a death in the first act? A suicide in the third? \"There's no death. It's more of a Strauss-ian, late Strauss-ian situation within the drama. It's a very drawing-room sensibility.\"</p><p>Intense but contained? \"Yes, intense but contained and the harrowing drama, the harrowing situations of real life.\"</p><p>Speaking of harrowing situations of real life, the end of each year usually means a McGarrigle/Wainwright family show, bringing together the offspring of the McGarrigle sisters Anna and Kate (mother to Rufus and Martha, his febrile and talented sister), Loudon Wainwright III (father to Rufus, Martha and a few more from a second marriage) and sundry relatives.</p><p>Given the family's propensity for writing about each other in their songs, up to and including Martha's song about her father, Bloody Motherf---ing Asshole, yet still remaining amazingly close, it's always a psychosocial treat to witness it. But there wasn't one in December. And it wasn't just because of Kate McGarrigle's health battle, which at one stage had looked life-threatening.</p><p>\"Frankly, the problem [last] year was that I had this two-month monster tour of Europe that I only got off of a few days before [the Christmas show would have been held] and I absolutely refused to go into another production, especially Christmas. I love Christmas but I also love to enjoy it,\" he laughs.</p><p>Is his mother better? \"She's doing great. She is fierce - a warrior woman, as we all know. She's got that sort of potato famine without the potato face.\"</p><p>Does he see that in himself? \"I was on my website the other day ... and in there was this picture where she and I were facing the same direction, the angles of our faces were in a similar spot and we both have the same eyes. I am blessed for it because they are very, very strong. And I don't mean beautiful, they are beautiful but there is a kind of resilience there.\"</p><p>It must give him some confidence that whatever other adversities come up, beyond a crystal meth addiction and a generally indulgent life, he probably has the strength to fight back.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm eternally indebted to both of my parents for really being so strong that perhaps it ruined their relationship but in time created Martha and I, who are pretty tough cookies,\" he says, jokingly adding, \"If anything it's an argument for procreation and then divorce.\"</p><p>Would he consider the procreation part? \"Ah, well, my boyfriend loves children and we've been together for almost three years, so I'm sure the question will pop up at some point. I personally don't, only because I think children are faking it [he laughs]. I think they're as intelligent and as literate and as aware as adults are and when they're acting like children, they are pretending.\"</p><p>That may have been true of the young Wainwright but I don't think we can all claim such precociousness.</p><p>\"I know, I'm a bit hard. My bark is much bigger than my bite; I'd make a great father.\"</p><p>It's not something he would rule out? \"It's not something that has ever really attracted me but I don't know, I think that that can turn on a dime. Everyone thinks only women go through this but I think men go through it as well; you suddenly start to feel the need to continue your line. To be around youth and to impart your wisdom becomes quite primordial. We'll see.\"</p><p>RUFUS WAINWRIGHT</p><p>Tuesday and Wednesday, 7pm,</p><p>State Theatre, 136 100, $79.90.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS: The Ruf, the Ruf, the Ruf is on fire ...

In this outing, Canadian palaeontologist Phil Currie is out to prove his radical theory based on evidence discovered in a remote corner of Mongolia. Would that be outer Outer Mongolia then? There the remains of 90 Tarbosaurus dinosaurs -- the Chinese T. rex -- lie together, a great herd of dead beasties. Currie believes many of them were part of a single social group and that they may have hunted in packs. Of course, as various scientific nay-sayers quoted are quick to point out, the tiny reptilian brains possessed by these mammoth creatures were unlikely to have possessed the wherewithal to manage pack hunting, thought to have developed first among mammals. And they may have been heading for the hills in terror when that asteroid struck. Currie's case is not well supported by hokey CGI footage from other sources, such as old films and documentaries, which at times is completely at odds with the narration. Certain to be popular with kids staging plasticine dinosaur battles of their own in front of the television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We Were Here</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sunday, 8.30pm, ABC2</p><p>Though this documentary was made last year, its focus is the AIDS crisis in San Francisco in the 1980s. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden declared it one of the top 10 films of that year. ``Of all the cinematic explorations of the AIDS crisis, not one is more heartbreaking and inspiring than this,'' he wrote. The focus is on five individuals who were all living in San Francisco when the crisis hit. From vantage points such as those of caregiver, researcher and activist, as well as friends and lovers of the afflicted, each has an illuminating tale that is deeply personal but also speaks of the unified reaction of a community under siege. Perhaps most moving is the relatively unknown role that lesbians, not a group gay men generally made much space for, played in the hands-on care of their gay brothers. Because of the peculiarities of transmission, lesbians apparently were the safest possible group available for blood donations. They gave in buckets. Some of the social horrors, such as ostracisation, and the bleak condemnation of sufferers by the religious Right -- particularly from Southern Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell and political adviser Pat Buchanan -- are dealt with, but the focus is on the way a community, from the local florist to the nurses and doctors in AIDS wards, came together to support each other in an unprecedented way.</p><p>2 One Another</p><p>Sunday, 10.05pm, ABC2</p><p>Review editor and dance critic Deborah Jones recently wrote of this production, created and directed by Rafael Bonachela for the Sydney Dance Company, that it was all packaging and no pay-off. ``It is like a gorgeous gift box, big, shiny and promising great delights. Take off the lid and search through the artfully crumpled tissue paper, however, and one comes up empty-handed,'' Jones wrote. Here is your chance to see the whole thing for yourself and perhaps disagree. There is a quite lengthy introduction from Bonachela in which the choreographer explains what the work means to him and what he wanted it to represent. Then it's over to the Sydney Theatre to watch the whole show, filmed live during a single performance. Viewers need not fear that a camera has been turned on at the back of the theatre and left to run. Overhead angles and constantly shifting close and wide shots from left, right and centre compensate for the absence of the third dimension seen only in the theatre. Sound and lighting effects are also beautifully presented.</p><p>Revenge</p><p>Monday, 8.30pm, Seven</p><p>So now we know it was Tyler who was murdered on that beach. Unfortunately we still don't know who pulled the trigger. That makes Daniel, Jack and Amanda possible suspects. To cloud things further, Daniel, found nearby with a nasty head wound and no reliable memory of what occurred, is suspicious of Emily, who was canny enough to remove evidence from beneath her floorboards. Further flashbacks reveal how it was that patriarch Conrad Grayson got mixed up in terrorist activity in the first place. No matter how hard Conrad and Victoria try to escape their past they seem destined to repeat it. Poor things. And what of Charlotte? She has to deal with the fact David Clarke, the man who carried the can for Conrad and Victoria, is her father; she is reeling from the murder and the brutal investigation, and her weaselly little boyfriend, Jack's brother Declan, is up to his neck in it. Just wait until she finds out that show protagonist Emily Thorne is her half-sister.</p><p>Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms</p><p>Tuesday, 8.30pm, Ten</p><p>If you haven't yet caught up with Bikie Wars, brought to you on Ten by the same people who made the various series of Underbelly for Nine, the program concerns itself with the notorious Milperra Massacre, which occurred in a quiet suburban Sydney on Father's Day, September 2, 1984. In tonight's fourth episode of six, Jock Ross (Matthew Nable), supreme leader of the Comancheros, has a spot of road trouble: he is wilfully knocked off his bike by a flatbed truck in a spectacular sequence that will have you on the edge of your seat. It may be to do with his recent splitting of the club and the formation of a separate branch. Susie Porter, so fine as Jock's wife Vanessa, is a master of the, shall we say, bogan Australian female accent. Jock's Scottish accent, however, is on the level of those gentlemen we all know from the pub who think they can do a Scottish accent but actually can't. A small quibble, though, about an otherwise fine performance. As in Underbelly, gritty action sequences alternate with earthy dialogue, sex and violence are authentically and graphically depicted, and the characters are deeply flawed criminal types yet with considerable charisma. A handy catch-up montage at the beginning means willing newcomers should not find Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms too difficult to wade into at this stage.</p><p>Indian Ocean with Simon Reeve</p><p>Wednesday, 8.30pm, SBS One</p><p>Now what, you may wonder, is Seven presenter Simon Reeve doing messing about the Indian Ocean for SBS? Aha, fooled again. This Simon Reeve is very British indeed. But now we've got that straightened out, this program is absolutely gorgeous. Reeve is travelling through 16 countries on the edge of the Indian Ocean, a water mass that stretches 10,000km from Africa to Australia. Steeped in history, the Indian Ocean is vital to world trade. But it's not all pretty stuff for the cameras. Reeve investigates pirate-infested seas and war-torn lands along the way. The journey begins at the tip of Africa and then travels up the coast through Mozambique and Tanzania to the island of Zanzibar. On the first leg in Africa tonight, Reeve travels by land, sea and air through countries ravaged by war. Then, there is great peace as he explores the coral beaches of Zanzibar. As he sets off from the Cape of Good Hope, the sea churns with life and the coastline is dramatic. A delicious portent for all that lies ahead.</p><p>Offspring</p><p>Wednesday, 8.30pm, Ten</p><p>The first rule of television is never to resolve the sexual tension between characters. Domestic bliss apparently puts everyone to sleep. Another way to resolve it is to move the characters past it and on to someone else, which seems to have occurred since the last time I poked my nose into this particular doorway. As always, Asher Keddie is sensational as luckless obstetrician and lead character Nina Proudman. Her performance tonight, as a woman waking up with the hangover from hell after a night on the tiles with the girls, is beautifully played. Did she sleep with someone new? A great point of entry for latecomers.</p><p>The Story of Wales</p><p>Friday, 8.30pm, SBS One</p><p>I would wager that the extent of the knowledge of Wales possessed by most Australians is through their lovely friends Gwynedd and Dalwyn, and possibly through Daffyd, the only gay in the village, brought to these shores by Matt Lucas in the broad comedy of Little Britain. But Wales, it turns out, has a fascinating history, and a culture and identity all its own. Who better to take your hand and lead you through the streets of Cardiff than Welsh historian Huw Edwards? Tonight, pop in on episode two, Power Struggles, as Edwards recounts the building of a great frontier and Owain Glyndwr's struggle for independence. The Welsh ruler was the last native Welshman to hold the title prince of Wales. He instigated a fierce and long-running revolt against English rule.</p><p>----- PICK OF THE WEEK -----</p><p>How to Grow a Planet</p><p>Sunday, 7.30pm, ABC1</p><p>It seems that the stars of the greatest show on earth really are the plants. In this natural history program, presenter Iain Stewart demonstrates how plants changed our planet from a toxic uninhabitable mass to a blue ball in space teeming with life. In fact, if you'd been around a few billion years ago there was one supercontinent, Pangaea, surrounded by princely purple oceans. In a straightforward narrative, Stewart explains how plants first harnessed light from the sun and created the atmosphere. He uncovers an epic battle between the dinosaurs and the tallest trees. And, in controlled experiments, Stewart shows plants breathing and indisputably communicating with each other. It seems jungles may be alive with plant chatter that so far has eluded most of us.

Each week she filters out the rubbish and presents the best of spam. Enjoy</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The life of an Italian child</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. You have at least one relative who wore a black dress every day for an entire year after a funeral.</p><p>2. You spent your entire childhood thinking what you ate for lunch was pronounced `sangwich'.</p><p>3. Your family dog understood Italian.</p><p>4. Every Sunday afternoon of your childhood was spent visiting your grandparents and extended family.</p><p>5. You've experienced the phenomena of 150 people fitting into 50 square feet of yard during a family barbecue.</p><p>6. You were surprised to discover the FDA recommends you eat three meals a day, not seven.</p><p>7. You thought killing the pig each year and having salami, capacollo, pancetta and prosciutto hanging out to dry from your shed ceiling was absolutely normal.</p><p>8. You ate pasta for dinner at least three times a week, and every Sunday.</p><p>9. You grew up thinking no fruit or vegetable had a fixed price and that the price of everything was negotiable through haggling.</p><p>10. You were as tall as your grandmother by the age of seven.</p><p>11. You thought everyone's last name ended in a vowel.</p><p>12. You thought nylons were supposed to be worn rolled to the ankles.</p><p>13. Your mum's main hobby is cleaning.</p><p>14. You were surprised to find out that wine was actually sold in stores.</p><p>15. You thought that everyone made their own tomato sauce.</p><p>16. You never ate meat on Christmas Eve or any Friday.</p><p>17. You ate your salad after the main course.</p><p>18. You thought Catholic was the only religion in the world.</p><p>19. You were beaten at least once with a wooden spoon or broom.</p><p>20. You thought every meal had to be eaten with a hunk of bread in your hand.</p><p>21. You can understand Italian but you can't speak it.</p><p>22. You have at least one relative who came over on the boat.</p><p>23. All of your uncles fought in a World War.</p><p>24. You have at least six male relatives named Tony, Frank, Joe, Vince or Salvatore.</p><p>25. You have relatives who aren't really your relatives.</p><p>26. You have relatives you don't speak to.</p><p>27. You drank wine before you were a teenager.</p><p>28. You relate on some level to The Godfather and The Sopranos.</p><p>29. You grew up in a house with a yard where every patch of dirt had a flower or a vegetable growing out of it.</p><p>30. Your grandparents' furniture was as comfortable as sitting on plastic. Wait!!!! You were sitting on plastic.</p><p>31. You thought that talking loud was normal.</p><p>32. You thought sugared almonds and the Tarantella were common at all weddings.</p><p>33. You thought everyone got pinched on the cheeks and had money stuffed in their pockets by their relatives.</p><p>34. Your mother is overly protective of the males in the family no matter what their age.</p><p>35. Every condition, ailment, misfortune, memory loss and accident was attributed to the fact that you didn't eat something.</p><p>Sick leave</p><p>I urgently needed a few days off work, but I knew the boss would not allow me to take leave.</p><p>I thought that maybe if I acted a little crazy then he would tell me to take a few days off.</p><p>So I hung upside down on the ceiling and made funny noises.</p><p>My co-worker (who's blonde) asked me what I was doing.</p><p>I told her that I was pretending to be a light bulb, so that the boss would think I was crazy and give me a few days off.</p><p>A few minutes later the boss came into the office and asked ``What are you doing?''</p><p>I told him I was a light bulb.</p><p>He said: ``You are clearly stressed out.</p><p>``Go home and recuperate for a couple of days.''</p><p>I jumped down and walked out of the office.</p><p>When my co-worker (the blonde) followed me, the boss asked her: ``And where do you think you're going?''</p><p>She said: ``I'm going home too. I can't work in the dark!''</p><p>Paraprosdokian sentences</p><p>* I asked God for a bike, but I know God doesn't work that way. So I stole a bike and asked for forgiveness.</p><p>* Do not argue with an idiot. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.</p><p>* I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather. Not screaming and yelling like the passengers in his car.</p><p>* Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.</p><p>* The last thing I want to do is hurt you. But it's still on the list.</p><p>* Light travels faster than sound. This is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak.</p><p>* If I agreed with you we'd both be wrong.</p><p>* We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in public.</p><p>* War does not determine who is right -- only who is left.</p><p>* Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.</p><p>* The early bird might get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.</p><p>* Evening news is where they begin with ``Good evening'', and then proceed to tell you why it isn't.</p><p>* To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism. To steal from many is research.</p><p>* A bus station is where a bus stops. A train station is where a train stops. On my desk, I have a work station.</p><p>* How is it one careless match can start a forest fire, but it takes a whole box to start a campfire?</p><p>* Some people are like Slinkies . . . not really good for anything, but you can't help smiling when you see one tumble down the stairs.</p><p>* Dolphins are so smart that within a few weeks of captivity, they can train people to stand on the very edge of the pool and throw them fish.</p><p>* I thought I wanted a career. Turns out I just wanted pay cheques.</p><p>* A bank is a place that will lend you money, if you can prove that you don't need it.</p><p>* A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.</p><p>* You do not need a parachute to skydive. You only need a parachute to skydive twice.</p><p>* The voices in my head may not be real, but they have some good ideas!</p><p>* Always borrow money from a pessimist. He won't expect it back.</p><p>* A diplomat is someone who can tell you to go to hell in such a way that you will look forward to the trip.</p><p>* I discovered I scream the same way whether I'm about to be devoured by a great white shark or if a piece of seaweed touches my foot.</p><p>Your last coin.................</p><p>A FATHER walks into a restaurant with his young son.</p><p>He gives the young boy three 10c coins to play with to keep him occupied.</p><p>Suddenly, the boy starts choking, going blue in the face.</p><p>The father realises the boy has swallowed the coins and starts slapping him on the back.</p><p>The boy coughs up two of the 10c coins, but keeps choking.</p><p>Looking at his son, the father is panicking, shouting for help.</p><p>A well-dressed, attractive and serious-looking woman in a blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar reading a newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee.</p><p>At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, neatly folds the newspaper and places it on the counter, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.</p><p>Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy's testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.</p><p>After a few seconds, the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last 10c coin, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.</p><p>Releasing the boy's testicles, the woman hands the coin to the father and walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word.</p><p>As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, ``I've never seen anybody do anything like that before -- it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?\"</p><p>``No,'' the woman replies . . . ``I'm with Australian Taxation Office.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TWNBUL-BUL-20101016-1-066-011088</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOWNSVILLEB2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:517X-3D81-F0JP-W1CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463812</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1267\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Townsville Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>October 16, 2010 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FOOD &amp; DRUG ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00096SE</classCode><className>EMAIL MARKETING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DL5G</classCode><className>HOBBIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000A0RH</classCode><className>CATHOLICS &amp; CATHOLICISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00096SE</classCode><className>EMAIL MARKETING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DROY</classCode><className>SPAMMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And it did.</p><p>There was no sign of his wife of but a few hours; a portent of thing to come, or perhaps not to come.</p><p>A few weeks earlier I had travelled to Zaragoza, Spain, to witness a performance on the European leg of the HIStory Tour, which had begun in Prague and, by the time it was over, would see him visit five continents and play 82 shows in 58 cities of 35 countries to almost five million fans.</p><p>The fans in that small Spanish city were as fevered as those at every other stop, dancing and prancing in the streets on the way to the stadium, waving banners and singing songs.</p><p>It was 17 years on from his No.1 hit Don't Stop Till You Get Enough from the Off the Wall album that heralded the commencement of an astonishingly productive and profitable collaboration with producer Quincy Jones and, quite plainly, the world had not had enough of the enigmatic child-man.</p><p>His shows, like his albums, were deftly crafted and constructed extravaganzas, powered along by his irresistible hybrid music.</p><p>For that was at the heart of the <person><nameText>Jacko </nameText></person>phenomenon. He had done in the early '80s what Elvis Presley had done in the mid '50s.</p><p>The truck driver from Memphis redrew the face of popular music by fusing black rhythm and white country music and, while becoming a template for a new attitude and behaviour, unleashed a firestorm of uncontrollable force.</p><p>Jackson's inspired inter-weaving was black soul and funk -- his music, with white guitar rock, still the pre-eminent sound of the day.</p><p>Barriers tumbled when, as one observer put it, disco met pop.</p><p>MTV effectively had a colour bar in place as did many radio formats, but when guitar god Eddie Van Halen was called in to unleash a blistering solo on Beat It, from the Thriller album, the colours bled into each other, then and for evermore.</p><p>Black acts found a white rock audience that had eluded them. More than can be counted, who have arisen and ridden high in the mainstream since, owe him a considerable debt.</p><p>It falls to very few creative forces in a generation or an era to crystalise elements, to be the first to hear what everyone else soon will hear.</p><p>The obituary and tribute headlines are now using the world genius liberally and it is not misplaced.</p><p>His instincts and intuitions were stunning, as was his ability to integrate sound with vision in order to mould a powerful package than enabled his persona to reach into hitherto unpenetrated areas.</p><p>I remember being in another European city, Brussels I think it was, early in 1993 when Thriller -- the album that would spend 37 weeks atop the American charts and sell an unmatched 50 million copies -- was blitzing everything in its path.</p><p>I walked into a newsstand where rows upon rows of magazines, from motor mechanics to farm machinery to arts and crafts journals, seemed to have him on the front cover.</p><p>The fascination was total fascination for the single glove, for the moonwalking and other svelte moves, even for the then-endearing eccentricities like a pet chimp and an identification with Peter Pan.</p><p>He was, as all good stars should be, not just a spellbinder who could seemingly transform lives but also a slightly ethereal figure existing beyond the everyday world.</p><p>He had come out of his Jackson 5/Jacksons years with a new sophistication and sensuality eons on from the lad who sang the chirpy Rockin Robin.</p><p>The evolution had been inexorable. Performing from the age of four, recording from the age of nine, having hits from the age of 11. Indelible was the mark he left in 1969 when he appeared on our television screens as a tiny, afro-topped whirling dervish whipping through I Want You Back and ABC, his elder brothers plainly taking their lead from him, compelling and commanding with a cocky cheekiness.</p><p>You couldn't take your eyes off him. For decades to come you still wouldn't be able to.</p><p><person><nameText>Michael Jackson </nameText></person>went where no performer had gone before by understanding and drawing upon where a great many had already been, particularly black performers.</p><p>His dance moves echoed those of Billy Bojangles Robinson and Cab Calloway, his voice at its smoothest drew a line from Nat King Cole, his stage confidence and style from Sammy Davis Jr, his cool sleekness from his Motown stablemate Marvin Gaye, perhaps even his stage drama from James Brown.</p><p>In short, he knew and respected who had gone before.</p><p>In many ways it was things we'd seen before but in so many ways it was things we'd never seen.</p><p>He knew who to surround himself with to bring out his own talents and abilities.</p><p>The jazz bandleader Quincy Jones, who'd worked so effectively with Ray Charles, brought a mature, steady hand to proceedings and, like George Martin with Lennon and McCartney, was able to turn musical ideas into something more tangible.</p><p>He amplified the impact of his recordings by bringing directors such as John Landis and Martin Scorsese in the picture.</p><p>No simple promotional film clips for Michael -- he outlayed on cinematic extravaganzas to more fully assault the senses.</p><p>What he invested in, that which reached the public, was not just towering in financial terms but gruelling and exhausting in human terms -- a sad consequence of which seems to have now presented itself.</p><p>It was a sad fact that Jackson's bizarre personal life -- which led to the unflattering nickname Wacko <person><nameText>Jacko </nameText></person>-- overshadowed his performance prowess in later years.</p><p>He was criticised for dangling his baby over a balcony, sleeping in an oxygen chamber, his personal zoo and amusement park he built at his Neverland ranch and befriending a chimpanzee.</p><p>Then there was his bizarre transformation from a black man with a big nose, strong features and giant afro haircut, to a white man with straight hair and thin, pale features -- which he usually hid behind a face-mask.</p><p>He insisted his transformation to a pale complexion was due to a rare skin disease known as vitiligo, but admitted he had had several surgical procedures to change the shape of his face.</p><p>But nothing was as damaging to him as being accused in 1993 of molesting a 13-year-old boy -- a claim he denied and which was dropped after he paid the boy $27.36 million.</p><p>He was back in court a decade later accused -- and later cleared -- of sexually abusing another boy.</p><p>But through it all Jacko's contribution to music remains a monumental one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-SHS-20090628-1-082-802113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYHERAL2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W1G-J0F0-YBDY-R087-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1215\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>June 28, 2009 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001830</classCode><className>WEDDINGS &amp;

It could be a lot closer than you think. Brian Bergstein reports</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALL companies set goals, but newly formed 4Frontiers Corp is eyeing some expansive horizons. The company's mission: to open a small human settlement on Mars within 20 years or so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sure, it may sound far-fetched. And the company's initial plans are a lot more terrestrial than ethereal -- for example, developing a 2250sq m replica of a Mars settlement here on Earth, then charging tourists admission.</p><p>But the people behind the venture are serious -- as serious as the $US25 million ($32.85 million) they are seeking to raise from investors.</p><p>CEO Mark Homnick, former manager for Intel Corp, who has registered the name 4Frontiers in Florida, says he has already raised \"a couple of million\" from people he won't name. He hopes for an initial public offering within five years.</p><p>That still leaves a lot of questions: Why should people live on Mars? And if it's going to be done, should a private enterprise engage in what would be one of humanity's defining moments?</p><p>Besides, what's in it for investors?</p><p>Homnick and his co-founders -- a longtime Mars aficionado named Bruce Mackenzie and a 25-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology master's student, Joseph Palaia -- are ready with several answers.</p><p>First, they contend, humankind needs a new frontier to explore, with all the intellectual and engineering challenges that settling on Mars would present.</p><p>Also, who knows the fate of our humble Earth? Will we meet an early end at the hands of an asteroid, warfare, disease or some other catastrophe?</p><p>In that case, we'd be glad civilisation had been preserved by some colonists on Mars -- and perhaps elsewhere in the galaxy, if all goes well on the Red Planet. That broader vision of space settlement is what gives 4Frontiers its name: the frontiers being the Earth, the moon, Mars and the asteroids.</p><p>\"It's the nature of life -- life tries to expand and tries to adapt,\" Mackenzie says. \"If there's a forest fire in one valley, then all of the organisms in the next valley will slowly creep over the ridge and repopulate that valley. Any species that don't do it eventually die out.\"</p><p>Going to space, he believes, is as if \"all of Earth's life, acting together, is trying to get into the next valley. And the only way we can do it is by building rockets.\"</p><p>Mackenzie, a software developer, has devoted much of his energy to a nonprofit group called the Mars Foundation, which aims to advance knowledge about how to colonise the planet. But he also believes that a private venture such as 4Frontiers will be necessary to drive things forward.</p><p>Although US President George W. Bush has called for a manned mission to Mars, Mackenzie believes big bureaucracies might never get the job done right.</p><p>\"It's better to have lots of groups out there, all trying things,\" Mackenzie says.</p><p>Indeed, space is no longer solely the province of earnest astronauts with crew cuts and government-issued uniforms.</p><p>Space tourism is now on the verge of becoming big business. Space Adventures Ltd of Arlington, Virginia, has brokered $26.28 million trips for the wealthy on Russian rockets and is taking deposits for fly-bys of the far side of the moon. For a lot less money than that, you can sign up for a quick blast into zero gravity.</p><p>In comparison, 4Frontiers' ultimate goal of an extended stay on Mars would be an off-the-charts extreme.</p><p>It would take months to get there. Once there, you couldn't kick off your shoes and dig your toes into the sand. Life would transpire in an enclosed space with pumped-in air (unless Martian settlers could pull off the even more speculative feat of \"terraforming\" the planet by changing its toxic atmosphere). Venturing outside would require sealed suits.</p><p>To begin, 4Frontiers plans to gather patents and engineering ideas that would enable a small crew to land on Mars with home-building materials and the manufacturing capability to keep adding on.</p><p>The hot topics would include ways to miniaturise key industrial processes -- such as making plastic or steel -- and methods for exploiting resources on Mars, such as the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, iron in the ground or the water bound up in Martian ice.</p><p>As the company gains expertise, it expects to sell consulting services to aerospace companies or NASA.</p><p>It also envisions getting work designing Mars sets for movies and Mars rides for amusement parks.</p><p>Meanwhile, it plans to construct a mock-up of its Mars home and begin selling tickets to it by 2007. Potential sites in Colorado, Florida and New Mexico are being considered.</p><p>The company's business plan estimates these varied projects would bring in $44.67 million in revenue in 2010, including $9.2 million in gate receipts at the tourist site.</p><p>Profits before taxes, depreciation and amortisation are forecast at $1.84 million as early as next year, and $39.02 million in 2010.</p><p>Even if that flies, then what? A company worth $44.67 million probably isn't in a great position to begin launching rockets into space.</p><p>Homnick says 4Frontiers would probably \"stay incremental\" through the early 2010s, perhaps getting involved in robotic surveys of the surface of Mars or asteroid mining.</p><p>HOWEVER, projects like that -- and perhaps even settling Mars -- might require some clarity in space law.</p><p>The 1967 Outer Space Treaty declared that the \"exploration and use\" of outer space and celestial bodies \"shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interest of all countries\".</p><p>While that's not exactly the traditional language of private enterprise, some space scholars say it leaves room for commercial projects.</p><p>(A 1979 Moon Treaty was more explicit, holding that bodies in the solar system should not become the property of any nation, organisation or person. But most countries, including the United States, China and Russia, never ratified it.)</p><p>Considering all the possible complications, Mackenzie says 4Frontiers' real success might come simply from getting the public pumped about living on Mars. In turn, that could make Washington eager to fund a settlement.</p><p>Even if that doesn't happen, he says he is sure that eventually people will live on Mars -- and perhaps scores of other places in space.</p><p>\"It's a question of when,\" he says. \"I really hope we get started before we have an economic decline that delays it. I'd really hate to have something like the Great Depression, or the Dark Ages that lasted several hundred years, delay our getting into space.\"</p><p>Information: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.4frontiers.com\">www.4frontiers.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.marshome.org\">www.marshome.org</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML0509221015835122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THECOURIERMAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4H57-RDD0-015G-Y33G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1084\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>September 22, 2005 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>INTEL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>INTC (SWX)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0INTC (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Futhermore, the planet itself would seem as if it was a living creature. Lovelock mentioned this to his neighbor and friend, William Golding, who suggested the name Gaia, the Greek goddess of Earth, for the dynamic, self-regulating system of our planet.</p><p>At the time, the Gaia hypothesis seemed outrageous. How could micro-organisms in the sea be connected to the rhythm of the ice ages? There may be faint analogies between the properties of living creatures and the feedback mechanisms of a planet, but that is all.</p><p>But recently, the language of biology has infiltrated astronomy. Stars and planets are born and die. Galaxies evolve. Gigantic cannibal galaxies devour and digest spiral galaxies such as our Milky Way, that is whirling towards its doom. Gaia on a galactic scale.</p><p>In this exciting, at times thrilling book, astrophysicist John Gribbin uses biological terms, not merely as interesting metaphors but as expressions of facts about the universe. Elegantly, methodically, like a Hercule Poirot, he reveals, piece by piece, the evidence that leads to a mind-boggling conclusion. Our cosmos was born, grows, reproduces the seeds of galaxies and, in a vast, almost infinitely slow struggle, jostles for survival among a host of alternative universes.</p><p>Gribbin writes with authority, as physics consultant for the journal New Scientist and author of some significant books, including The Matter Myth, with Adelaide University physicist Paul Davies; and Stephen Hawking: A Life in Science, with Michael White.</p><p>In The Beginning opens with the dramatic news that, in 1992, a COBE satellite discovered ripples in the structure of the universe dating back almost 15,000 million years, confirming that our universe was born out of a tiny, hot fireball and continues to expand in spacetime.</p><p>Then Gribbin takes us into the heart of the atom, the bizarre world of neutrinos, the nuclear inferno of suns where, by incredibly narrow margins, at odds of millions to one, the atoms are forged that one day will be blown out into space to become planets and living creatures.</p><p>In the Orion Nebula, a site of star birth near to us, are 60 different kinds of molecule. The debris of dead stars, re-cycled into new stars, contains organic compounds such as formic acid, formaldehyde and ethanol.</p><p>Gribbin's argument is that stars are like cells in a human body. The human body loses more than 1kg of cells each day but does not wear out, because the cells are constantly being replaced. So it is with galaxies. A dazzling, blue-white fire burns along the leading edges of the great spirals. That brilliant light is the forest fire of exploding stars swept up in the enormous shock wave of the turning spiral. Each star burst hurls far out into space the stuff of life for the next generation of stars. Each galaxy constantly renews itself, in the process creating the conditions of, as Gribbin puts it, the Goldilocks Effect. Things are \"just right\" for the emergence of life. The laws of our universe make life not a rare accident but an inevitability on a multitudinous scale. We look out upon a living universe. Moreover, the same laws that describe supernovae account for the creation of black holes, the seeds of new galaxies. But this vast system is bounded by space-time. Our universe is finite, a tiny bubble of light, from which escape is impossible. In effect, we are trapped within a black hole; only one of countless such universes.</p><p>All the grand images and surprises of this book are more than another popularising of science, although Gribbin is an expert at that. He is involved in the efforts to find a coherent understanding of our universe. By linking evolution and cosmology, he anticipates ways of knowing what happened before the Big Bang that produced our particular universe. As he playfully puts it, \"You cannot really ask for much more of any scientific idea\" than it explains how and why everything exists.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV9309042A20788748</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEADVERTISERLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4B44-4PY0-01S8-84V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Advertiser</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1993 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"1993\"><dateText>September 4, 1993 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MILKY WAY\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp; SPACE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001330</classCode><className>PLANETS &amp; ASTEROIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0008YZS</classCode><className>PHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXR</classCode><className>ASTROPHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000283</classCode><className>ALCOHOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DBFG</classCode><className>ORGANIC ACIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DA18</classCode><className>ALDEHYDES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DI0V</classCode><className>STEPHEN HAWKING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX018</classCode><className>ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A26S</classCode><className>EARTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A28M</classCode><className>MARS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A1T9</classCode><className>MILKY WAY GALAXY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Government advisers have been on the phones to media warning the commissioners' plan would include vast numbers of homes and billions of dollars.</p><p>A report in the Herald Sun that was attributed to government sources warned that up to 49,000 houses would potentially have to be bought out at a cost of $15 billion to the taxpayer.</p><p>No explanation was given as to how these government figures were calculated.</p><p>Brumby also claims he has already received negative community feedback about the buyback proposal.</p><p>``There are certainly some people who would support this policy,'' Brumby tells Inquirer. ``But the overwhelming majority views that I have had is that this would be very complex, very difficult, very expensive and would have implications that would lead to tens of thousands of homes and would lead to a lack of confidence in small towns right across country Victoria.''</p><p>Brumby's comments sound less like those of the community than those of his own government lawyers, who told the commission in April that such a proposal would be ``complex to deliver, extremely expensive, may increase bushfire risk and be potentially damaging to the communities affected''.</p><p>The government's scare campaign on the issue has raised eyebrows among the commissioners, who used a press conference to point out that the proposed policy only applied to ``micro-sites'' rather than whole towns.</p><p>``They would be sites that are on ridge-lines, often surrounded by gullies . . . particularly if they are within 100m of bush,'' Susan Pascoe, one of the three commissioners, said.</p><p>In other words, the number of houses affected by the recommendation, and therefore the cost, would be substantially less than the government was claiming.</p><p>``I have been appalled by the government's reaction, which amounts to a gross exaggeration of the scale and the cost of what the commission was proposing,' says Michael Buxton, associate professor of environment and planning at RMIT, who was a member of the expert panel advising the commission.</p><p>``It would cost millions, rather than billions, and would only focus on very high-risk areas. It was never meant to be widely applied or to close whole towns down,'' Buxton says.</p><p>Because the government does not want the proposal to win wide public support, it is interpreting the commissioners' proposal in the widest possible manner to highlight the costs and complexities.</p><p>While the government refuses to disclose how it has costed the idea, it appears to have used as its basis a 2009 Country Fire Authority assessment that there are 52 ``high risk zones'' across the state, including highly populated areas such as the Dandenong Ranges and popular holiday towns such as Lorne.</p><p>Buxton says he believes the commission intended for the criteria to be much narrower, aiming at selected individual homes and streets rather than entire towns.</p><p>The example given in the final report was Pine Ridge Road, which runs along a mountain top in Kinglake West, where 21 people died on Black Saturday.</p><p>Buxton says such specific sites for buybacks would have only a minimal impact on country towns and that it was a scare tactic for the government to claim entire towns would die.</p><p>``Country towns have been dying in Victoria for all sorts of reasons, such as changes in manufacturing policy or agriculture,'' he says.</p><p>``Having a responsible bushfire policy would have only a minimal impact on these towns compared with those other factors.''</p><p>But the commission did not provide a formula to determine what constitutes unacceptable bushfire risk and it did not give any examples of locations beyond Pine Ridge Road and parts of the town of Marysville.</p><p>According to the government, the devil lies in this detail.</p><p>The government would have the difficult task of determining the criteria for which homes qualify for a buyback and then it would have to apply it across the state.</p><p>But assessing bushfire risk is an imperfect science and the subjective nature of such a ruling on someone's home may open the door to numerous legal challenges.</p><p>Former forest fire chief Athol Hodgson says he is not surprised by the political posturing around the issue, saying this it has all happened before.</p><p>He says buybacks of land had been suggested in Victoria after bushfires in the 1960s and then after Ash Wednesday in the 80s.</p><p>The Liberal government did successfully implement a buyback of land in the Dandenong Ranges in the 70s but the Labor government had rejected similar ideas in other parts of the state in the 80s.</p><p>``It involves freedom of choice of where to live and that is opposed by some people. So it only works if you can make it work politically,'' Hodgson says.</p><p>``It's a very tricky issue to resolve. If people live in these areas and don't take some pretty drastic management to reduce their fire risk, there is no way authorities can ensure their safety.''</p><p>Buxton believes that any decision to reject the commissioners' buyback proposal would represent a failure of leadership.</p><p>``The [Liberal Rupert] Hamer government in the 70s succeeded in limiting houses in the Dandenongs by building community support for the idea.</p><p>``What Brumby is doing is trying to scare people -- there is a stark contrast in leadership styles.''</p><p>Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu, who has committed to implement the retreat and resettlement proposal if elected, says Brumby is grossly exaggerating the impact of the planned buyback.</p><p>``I see this as a modest recommendation rather than the sky is going to fall in and everyone [who lives in the bush] will have to leave their properties,'' he tells Inquirer.</p><p>The commissioners' report advocates a dual path of offering to buy back property while also placing restrictions on developing new properties deemed to be in extreme bushfire risk zones.</p><p>Planning expert Roslynne Hansen told the royal commission that tree change and sea change trends would see more people moving to small rural properties on the outskirts of Melbourne and that ``more detailed consideration needs to be given to the strategic aspects of planning for bushfire attack''.</p><p>Buxton agrees.</p><p>``Tens of thousands of people will move into these rural areas in the future and the government has to look at this issue carefully,'' he says.</p><p>``If it does not, then it will enormously increase risks for many thousands of people.''</p><p>At its heart, the statewide retreat and resettlement proposal challenges the government to open a historic new chapter in Australian bushfire policy, ending the random nature of bush settlements.</p><p>Yet it appears to be doomed by politics even before it is properly considered.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS201008075008021512</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:803V-DKH0-YBDY-R2N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1530\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Weekend Australian</publicationName><edition>5 - Inquirer All Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>August 7, 2010 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

Less conventional are a 11m French river boat sitting at the bottom of a series of fully functional locks running up a near-vertical mountainside gully, built (in part) because his six-year-old son had been entranced by a canal trip through France.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>Seldom do you find a site that has consumed 3000 tonnes of rocks, brought down from Lake County before coming up 450m to the winery and building site, or that is home to a grove of 90-year-old olive trees saved when Stags' Leap Winery wished to expand its vineyards. (The trees only cost $200 each but $2000 each to box up and transport.) Or one that accommodates many dams that were meant to cost $180,000, but ended up at $400,000 -- dams that are variously stocked with golden trout, bass and sturgeon, the latter well over 1m in length and approaching child-bearing age (that is, caviar).</p><p> Earlier this year, Forbes Magazine put the project cost at $40million, and it is hardly surprising that Kuleto doesn't even pretend that it will provide a return of any kind. Indeed, he off-handedly says the winery has a 35,000-case permit, but he doubts whether he will take production past 10,000 cases, selling the excess grapes from the plantings -- 40ha but still expanding.</p><p> It is fair to say that even in the first six years since planting began, Kuleto has changed his mind several times about the main emphasis and direction of the estate. First it was to be sangiovese, now cabernet sauvignon, but an additional half-dozen varieties give plenty of scope for future changes and expansion.</p><p> This self-taught former carpenter and building contractor more or less stumbled into restaurant design and building in the 1970s, having had a brief stint as a waiter. He built more than 20 Refectory Steakhouses. It was then he made his ill-timed move into real estate investment, initially making millions before being caught in a 1980-81 credit squeeze.</p><p> He went back into restaurant design and in 1984 created San Francisco's Fog City Diner. His 110th restaurant, it was a breakthrough in design and established his reputation nationwide. He has now designed more than 150 restaurants across the US and has ventured as far afield as Indonesia and Japan.</p><p> Heading the list are three of San Francisco's most famous restaurants, and Kuleto is a partner in these: Jardiniere, Farallon and Boulevard. More recently, he opened Martini House at St Helena in the Napa Valley. A superb wine list with more than 600 wines and equally wonderful food (I chose crispy sweetbreads, then lobster on roasted asparagus, then squab with wild mushrooms) makes it a powerful challenger to Napa icon restaurants such as Tra Vigne.</p><p> His skill in designing restaurants comes from his innate ability to immediately envision three-dimensional design, and as he strode through the vast upper storey of the winery -- still at gyprock stage and as big as a football field -- glass walls, huge tables, leather couches, fireplaces and dozens of other ideas came pouring from his mind. And he never does things by half-measure.</p><p> The winery won't be open to the public in the normal sense (the planning permit won't allow it, for one thing) but by arrangement. Visitors will be able to spend a whole day at the estate, which is inevitably described as a vinous Disneyland.</p><p> Kuleto is still actively scheming \"add-on\" experiences for future visitors;\u00a0 my disbelief grew\u00a0 through my visit.</p><p> Finally, consider this in the land of the free: until recent changes in the law, he couldn't sell his wine to or through any of the restaurants in which he had a proprietary interest. Now he can sell to two -- but only two -- of them. Alice in Wonderland could not have provided a better storyline.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.winepros.com.au\">www.winepros.com.au</url></p><p>The Australian's Winter Reds 2002</p><p>Now that the cooler months have arrived, be quick to take advantage of The Australian's Winter Reds 2002 offer.

It s brilliant, pale straw-green in colour, and the delicate and restrained bouquet is completely at odds with the 14.5 degrees alcohol, as is the youthful, vibrant grapefruit, nectarine and melon fruit of the palate. Finer and with less obvious complexity than some of the previous releases, it could develop into something quite special, even by the standards of Leeuwin Estate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0206291R20971698</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:465D-1TD0-015G-P3DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Weekend Australian</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>June 29, 2002, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>LAKE COUNTY PRESS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009ZO4</classCode><className>CREDIT CRISIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000166</classCode><className>INSOLVENCY &amp; BANKRUPTCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N312130MM</classCode><className>WINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001843</classCode><className>WINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N111332MM</classCode><className>GRAPE VINEYARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N230000CC</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001455</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009S2V</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A2W7</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST00096KM</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE INVESTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D1HM</classCode><className>NAPA VALLEY, CA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Hundreds if not thousands of good, decent, honest, hard-working Hobartians who were inconvenienced, had plans disrupted, income lost and lives put at risk due to emergency vehicles not being able to respond in sufficient time through gridlocked traffic may now react as I have.</p><p>Good on you extremists, you have just had a 100 per cent negative effect for green support in the public arena.</p><p>Ray Carter</p><p>Kingston</p><p>Activists unpaid</p><p>I MUST take issue with Brian Bresnahan's claim that there is a group of paid protesters who travel the country disrupting forestry operations (Letters, October 8).</p><p>I have been involved with forest defence for seven years in my birthplace of the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, in my adopted home in the Huon and several other areas at the request of local communities and I am yet to come across these mythical paid protesters. The truth that is unpalatable to those shortsighted enough to support the status quo of the forestry industry is that people are willing to give up their normal lives in order to defend our ancient forests.</p><p>The commitment of volunteer forest activists is in sharp contrast to those timber industry front groups who claim they represent timber communities.</p><p>When was the last time someone from Timber Communities Australia could not afford to buy food or had to scrape together a few dollars to afford petrol or stationary?</p><p>Warrick Jordan</p><p>Huon Valley Environment Centre</p><p>Angel stunt</p><p>ALLANA Beltran's heart is in the right place but to impersonate an angel is merely a publicity stunt and to religious believers may be distasteful and presumptions.

Those who tut tut the Burmese military junta for clamping down on basic democratic rights should be careful before agreeing that it is OK for Tasmanian police to sue forest protesters for causing them inconvenience.</p><p>Civil liberties are most felt when they are lost.

These people appear to care only about power and maximising the rate of return to pulp mill investors. On the other side we have many voters who feel disenfranchised, motivated by the desire to ensure that future generations inherit a planet that has well husbanded resources. The present brand of forest-fire capitalism will consume the earth's resources at an ever increasing pace. The pulp mill is a manifestation of a society incapable of putting an adequate environmental cost on production and associated pollution.</p><p>Time to get busy people. Protest in any way you can. The ''pulp mill war'' has just started.</p><p>Miles Harrison</p><p>Blackmans Bay</p><p>In the limelight</p><p>WITH at least 85 per cent of voters not wanting the Greens, why did all channels on Sunday night TV news lead with what the Greens want?

Why then is just about every commentary-based ABC program still promoting the</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">opposite viewpoint? Sometimes they even cite the IPCC as the source for this view when what they say is the opposite of what was reported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How much longer must the public be forced to sponsor an organisation that appears to be more concerned with a single ideological viewpoint than facts and data or allowing other views to be expressed?</p><p>James Hein, Hackney, SA</p><p>NOW that former US vice-president Al Gore has bought into the NSW</p><p>bushfires, courtesy of the ABC, it is time for a reality check. Planet Earth's climate is not, and never has been,</p><p>static. It is in a constant state of flux. There are many examples to demonstrate this.</p><p>Perhaps the most dramatic in recent times (on a planetary timescale) began with the end of the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago. In the period from then to about 10,000 years ago, the estimated increase in global median temperatures was 8C and the rise in sea levels was 140m. This cut off Tasmania from the mainland. During this time, human intervention and carbon emissions were not relevant.</p><p>W. D. Kavanagh, Macleay Island, Qld</p><p>I AGREE with Geoffrey Luck's letter arguing for water-bombing aircraft (24/10). In Spain recently, I witnessed them bombing a large forest fire in the mountains. What struck me was how quickly these planes returned with another load and how much water they are able to carry.</p><p>I presume the official reluctance to purchase them must be related to our comparatively few reservoirs and</p><p>accessible rivers.</p><p>Richard Zweck, Buderim, Qld</p><p>PRIME Minister <person><nameText>Tony Abbott </nameText></person>insulted the UN and several international studies when he said that those who suggest a link between climate change and an impending increase in the severity and occurrence of natural disasters such as the NSW fires are talking through their hats.</p><p>With the greatest respect, I believe that on this issue, the Prime Minister is speaking out of his backside.</p><p>Brian Cavanagh, Moorooka, Qld</p><p>ELOQUENTLY described by Edmund Capon in the ABC's series on Australian art is the 1851 picture by William Strutt, Black Thursday. The bushfire he brilliantly depicted destroyed a quarter of Victoria, killing 12 people and a million sheep in extreme temperatures. Was this a result of man-made climate change or fire that is an intrinsic part of our landscape going back thousands of years?</p><p>D. Mackay, Dungog, NSW</p><p>I WAS not surprised when Greens MP Adam Bandt in effect blamed the federal government for the bushfires. Yes, climate change is real, and the statistical likelihood of fires will rise. However, having a carbon tax does not appear to have diminished bushfire occurrence. Deliberate and unintentional lighting of fires is a significant contributor as evidenced by proximity to populated areas.</p><p>While the Greens may have an apocalyptic view of the future, the political temperature seems to be disproportionate to actual temperatures.</p><p>M. Gordon, Flynn, ACT</p><p>IT'S quite simple, really. Yes, we have always had bushfires. That's because of the volatile nature of much of our flora, combined with our climate -- hot, dry summers. Climate change will result in longer, hotter summers. The result? More, fiercer fires.</p><p>While we're there, flood-prone areas will experience more frequent flooding. How many once-in-a-100-year events have we experienced over the past few years? It's not rocket science; it's climate science.</p><p>Judy Crozier, Preston, Vic</p><p>Sea ice at the poles can't be compared</p><p>THE fact that record sea ice extent in the Antarctic is far outweighed by the decline in sea ice in the Arctic, while correct, disguises the fact that 90 per cent of Earth's ice is in the Antarctic (``Record ice cover in Antarctica'', 24/10). This is because the North Pole is situated in ocean whereas the South Pole is on a continent covered by up to 3km of ice.</p><p>Perhaps the sea ice extent in the Arctic is no longer declining because, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, its September 2013 sea ice extent is the highest since 2007. The sea ice extent in the Arctic can be moderated by volcanic activity under its relatively shallow ocean and this apparently happened earlier this century.</p><p>Brent Walker, Killcare, NSW</p><p>THE revelation that there is record ice cover in Antarctica must be devastating news for the Greens whose whole raison d'etre is dependent on the opposite result. Perhaps Adam Bandt would like to credit <person><nameText>Tony Abbott </nameText></person>for this latest phenomenon too.</p><p>Ian Mastin, Woodgate Beach, Qld</p><p>Union inquiry needed</p><p>KAYE Darveniza makes an important point in light of guilty pleas recently entered by former Labor Party national president Michael Williamson to charges of corrupt conduct as boss of the Health Services Union (``Please Mr Abbott, clean up the unions for sake of members'', 24/10).</p><p>The fall from grace of such a senior Labor figure confirms the need for a wide-ranging royal commission of inquiry into the trade union movement.</p><p>The terms of inquiry should focus on at least four areas: allegations of corruption; corrupt conduct; corporate governance across the sector; and the extent to which the law and practice (in areas such as union elections) encourage or enable corrupt conduct.</p><p>The virtual lock-step relationship between trade unions and politics at the highest level makes such an inquiry imperative. Bill Shorten's elevation to Labor leader, with AWU support, reminds us of the political clout wielded by union bosses.</p><p>James Miller, Woolloomooloo, NSW</p><p>Correct on clap trap</p><p>ALANNAH MacTiernan's commentary is a fitting example of why she is so respected on both sides of the house in Western Australia (``Postmodern clap trap rules in schools'', 24/10). Her claim ``a few hundred academics and mid-ranking bureaucrats who prioritise their own careers over the literacy of our children'' should be believed because the lady knows what she is talking about.</p><p>The widening gulf between rich and poor in this country can possibly be linked to literacy (and numeracy) decline among those parents who failed to learn under the clap-trap scheme who are now unable to teach their children any better.</p><p>Kudos to the principal of Challis and the teachers who embraced truth rather than bow to the bureaucracy of the local education desk occupiers.</p><p>Frank Wright, Cottesloe, WA</p><p>Weathering the gas crisis</p><p>THE story ``Seeney pours water on LNG compo'' (24/10) illustrates the need to make clear the Australian Industry Group's position on the gas</p><p>crisis. Our focus is to lift supply barriers threatening gas availability and to find ways for industry to weather the rise in prices.</p><p>We are not advocating handouts but proposing solutions to these critical problems and highlighting the risk that poor policy responses may be responsible for adding costs on industry. This includes a national interest test which would give greater consideration before the export of gas from new or extended facilities is approved.</p><p>It is the lack of such consideration by former governments, not business decisions by gas users, that has helped create the risks we now face. If supply is uncertain and the price spike is permanent, the rational response may be to relocate future investment -- and eventually, production -- to the US and the Middle East. The loss of high value-added industries is unlikely to leave Australia better off.</p><p>We think there should be a sensible public discussion of the merits of all policy actions and all non-actions in relation to the emerging dynamics in the gas market. We have been pushing for this discussion for some time and are pleased these issues are now getting some attention.</p><p>Innes Willox, chief executive, Australian Industry Group, Forrest, ACT</p><p>Cut perks for former PMs</p><p>THE recent attention on entitlements for sitting parliamentarians emphasises the need for a thorough review of the entire system.</p><p>With <person><nameText>Tony Abbott </nameText></person>urging us to be lifters not leaners, let our elected representatives start by setting a good example. And let's look further than sitting parliamentarians. Why are all former prime ministers afforded the generous entitlements they enjoy? Is this a lifetime free ride on our economy? Former PMs deserve some recognition for their service, but they all have comfortable superannuation. I believe cutting their perks would set a good example.</p><p>Lyn Wilson, Southport, Qld</p><p>I HAVE rarely read a better solution to a political problem (``Entitlement enlightenment'', 23/10). <person><nameText>Tony Abbott </nameText></person>should read and implement Janet</p><p>Albrechtsen's advice.</p><p>Alan Cole, Mt Warren Park, Qld</p><p>Sad saga about Carr</p><p>THE resignation of Bob Carr as a senator is the end to a sad saga in Australia's political history in which gross abuse of voter trust has taken place.</p><p>Originally hatched as a master plan by the Labor Party to boost its standing in government, it has ended in tears for all concerned.</p><p>By revelling in the role of foreign minister but being unable to commit as a member of the opposition, Carr has failed the character test. To be elected to parliament is a great honour. Unfortunately, Carr does not seem to appreciate this.</p><p>Peter D. Surkitt, Hampton, Vic</p><p>LAST POST</p><p>How inconvenient that Australia's carbon tax has only improved the sea ice cover in Antarctica and not extinguished the phenomenon of El Nino bushfires after La Nina wet years, that have been occurring for millennia.</p><p>Bryan Connor, Cloncurry, Qld</p><p>The global warming catastrophists keep trying to find the missing heat in face of temperatures not having risen in lockstep with CO2 emissions. Perhaps the record Antarctic sea ice is actually dry ice (frozen CO2).</p><p>Mike Young, Swanbourne, WA</p><p>Wouldn't it be a bit more relevant to the national interest for our soldiers to be trained in firefighting rather than using live ordnance to cause destruction in fire-prone areas?</p><p>John James, Claremont, WA</p><p>While <person><nameText>Tony Abbott </nameText></person>is fighting bushfires, it would be pleasing to know that Adam Bandt is saving the planet by taking cold showers, riding a bicycle and living in an unheated house.</p><p>David Barber, Kew, Vic</p><p>Bob Carr says Labor lacked cunning. No such problem for the crafty, sweet-talking smoothie himself, who conned us into believing his intention was to remain in the Senate for the long term.</p><p>George Fishman, Vaucluse, NSW</p><p>It was always obvious Bob Carr was an opportunist and it has been Labor's worst kept secret that he would resign. Eighteen months on the public teat.</p><p>Claire Jolliffe, Buderim, Qld</p><p>Only six weeks into the job and Treasurer Joe Hockey is already being accused of failure and creative accounting by D. J. Fraser (Letters, 24/10). It would seem Fraser's insight is inversely proportional to the number of times his thoughts are published.</p><p>Peter M. Wargent, Mosman, NSW</p><p>The idea of a website showing politicians' expense claims is a good idea from Janet Albrechtsen (``Entitlement enlightenment'', 23/10). It's called common sense, something sadly lacking for the past few years.</p><p>Mark Postle, Mundubbera, Qld</p><p>Nice pun, Margaret Pritchard (Letters, 24/10), but don't let facts get in the way. In Barrie Cassidy's words, ``It is a bit odd to claim this is a political favour -- or any favour at all -- when I am the one doing the favour. It is a job that carries no fee and no perks of any kind.''</p><p>Monty Arnhold, Port Melbourne, Vic</p><p>Campbell Newman has the courage to act against bikie gangs but hasn't the gumption to bring in daylight saving which would reduce power bills, saving an hour of electricity every night to help the economy and reduce our carbon footprint.</p><p>Brian Doherty, Beenleigh, Qld</p><p>Send letters to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:letters@theaustralian.com.au\">letters@theaustralian.com.au</email> (no attachments); GPO Box 4162, Sydney, NSW, 2001; Fax 02 9288 3077</p><p>Emails and letters should bear a full postal address and day and night telephone numbers.

Y2K is shaping up as the year of the Internet shake-out.</p><p>Already, unprofitable e-tailers are reassessing strategies after holiday marketing spending sprees failed to affect the bottom line.</p><p> E-tailers such as Value America, Beyond.com and Boo.com, have made staff cuts.</p><p> Meanwhile, venture capitalists are using a larger filter before pouring money into a company.</p><p> So while we have all these dire predictions, why are Internet incubators flourishing?</p><p> Even though venture capitalists have taken a heavier hand in directing the strategies of their investments, incubators take a more active role and offer burgeoning companies management, administrative and strategic support, as well as technology expertise.</p><p> The incubators are small enough to properly care for their young, breeding about 12 firms a year. In exchange for these services, the incubators can get a 30 per cent to 60 per cent cut of the company.</p><p> Incubators have been around for a long time, but the number entering the Internet world has grown in the US and in Europe.</p><p> More than 50 have been launched in the US in the past two years. In Europe, incubators have grown from a handful to 100 in six months, the majority in London.</p><p> For the most part, incubators are going ahead as planned, even in the face of change.</p><p> But Paul Alofs, a former MP3.com exec and music marketing whiz, pulled the plug on his Canadian incubator before it even began, blaming the changing economics of the Internet.</p><p> \"There will be more pressure on Internet start-ups to not only generate revenue but profits, and I think there will be Internet start-up deals available that will be profitable,\" Alofs told a Canadian newspaper.</p><p> So why the proliferation in such an unsure market? The model resembles a music label that invests in hundreds of artists, hoping one will catch fire internationally.</p><p> \"You just have to figure if they hit with 10 per cent of their investments, they're way ahead of the game,\" Credit Lyonnais Securities analyst Richard Read said.</p><p> Richard Koffler, the head of incubator Koffler Ventures, said he was placing his bets in niche areas of the Internet and wasn't necessarily looking for a company with a $US5 billion valuation, but one with more modest growth.</p><p> There were 300,000 dotcom business plans floating around in the US, he said.</p><p> Is there room for all? Not even close. Most of them are garbage, but there's still a lot of stuff with good ideas.</p><p> In the end, he sees the plethora of companies being hand- held by incubators as a good thing, thinking of them as all these experiments taking place.</p><p> \"No one really knows what the next wave of applications and technology will bring,\" Internet.com analyst Luke Fronefield said.</p><p> \"Portals were the first wave, then e-tailers, and now were seeing a focus on B2B and wireless.\"</p><p> Interestingly enough, incubators like CMGI cover the majority of sub-sectors.</p><p> Besides allowing incubators to share support, CMGI encourages its incubated companies to work together.</p><p> The heads of all its companies meet regularly to discuss plans and projects which could lead to strategic partnerships.</p><p> Once these companies move out of beta into launching, analysts expect these types of relationships to be the next step in the new generation of incubators.</p><p>New York-based Doublespace has entered the Internet incubator space with three new cyber-projects.</p><p>Doublespace principle Scott Osman said the company had been helping Internet firms build brands for five years, and it seemed natural to become an incubator.</p><p> He remains undaunted by the prospects of a shake-out.</p><p> \"There are so many great ideas that are still being developed. We've only scratched the surface,\" he said.</p><p> Analysts for the most part agreed there were sectors that hadn't been Internet-ised, yet.</p><p> Brian Bedol, who recently co-founded Fusient Media Ventures in Manhattan, will focus on funding content players for this broadband age.</p><p> His incubator will succeed because they're focusing on the next wave of value.</p><p> \"Content is somewhere around the bicycle or Model T in the Internet life cycle,\" he said.

We don't know if fire enhances the flavour as well as the aroma, but the animals are pretty keen to get at them,\" Claridge says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are around 2400 Australian truffle-like species of fruiting fungi (compared to a few hundred in Europe) but most of these don't exude an alluring fragrance like France's famous gourmet black truffles.</p><p>\"Imagine you've left an onion sealed in a plastic container for a month and it's gone off. The smell that would assault your nostrils when you whipped off the lid is pretty much the same smell that seems to drive bandicoots and potoroos crazy for truffles.\"</p><p>It seems fire may release or intensify the aroma of these underground fungi as a kind of survival mechanism for the species. The animals sniff out, dig up and eat the intensely aromatic truffles, spreading spores across the landscape in their scats and creating new truffle colonies in their wake. \"That's the neat way nature works. The bandicoots and potoroos critters that are basically a truffle-seeking nose on legs get a food reward for turning over the soil after a fire. They're the engineers of the forest ecosystem, they keep it healthy.\"</p><p>Claridge recently played a leading role in one of Australia's biggest temperate forest fire research programs, studying the recovery of native plants and animals after fire in Ben Boyd National Park on the NSW south- east coast. Last winter, parks staff conducted a prescribed burn across 1900ha of the park, after a 12-year research program led by Claridge showed populations of southern brown bandicoots, long- nosed bandicoots and long-nosed potoroos were in decline.</p><p>\"We'd assumed that if we got rid of foxes in the park with a 1080 baiting program, the native animals would thrive. We got the fox population down to unprecedented low levels, but despite the program's success, the bandicoot and potoroo populations were just idling along.</p><p>They weren't bouncing back in the way we'd expected, so there had to be other factors at work.\"</p><p>A survey of park vegetation with CSIRO scientists, measuring litter layers, canopy cover and native shrub species, showed there had also been a decline in habitat complexity with the loss of ground cover and understorey plants like banksias, hakeas and acacias.</p><p>\"These plants were reaching the end of their cycle. They were dying, and they need fire to regenerate. The understorey wasn't providing the dense habitat the animals needed.\"</p><p>A previous study in the mid- 1990s by CSIRO's former Division of Wildlife and Ecology established very different fire regimes were needed to regenerate the habitat of red-necked wallabies, eastern grey kangaroos, swamp wallabies, ground parrots, eastern bristle- birds and long-nosed potoroos.</p><p>The research, undertaken in Nadgee Nature Reserve near Eden in south-east NSW, was the first fire study of its kind in Australia and was headed by the late Dr Alan Newsome and Dr Peter Catling. Their research findings suggested six different species- specific fire management \"rules\" were needed for prescribed burns.</p><p>The CSIRO team warned against a one-size-fits-all approach to prescribed burning. They had developed a system of \"decision rules\" to guide burning, based on combinations of differing habitat requirements, vegetation and time elapsed since previous fires. The \"wrong fire regime\" could be counter-productive, degrading forest ecosystems and destroying habitat. Claridge describes this 30-year fire management project as \"incredibly valuable, just brilliant\". The research prompted his decision to do a prescribed burn in Ben Boyd National Park.</p><p>\"Their research showed bandicoots and potoroos started popping up around 10 years after their habitat was burned. That's when the regenerating understorey is at its thickest, and the animals thrive because they can escape into the understorey and hide from predators.\"</p><p>Mapping and designing the Ben Boyd prescribed burn took \"months and months of careful planning to get it right\", he says.</p><p>Staff safety and achieving a mosaic burn \"with large areas of unburnt habitat\" were non-negotiable priorities. \"We didn't want to raze the forest to a charred mess, and we had lives to protect. We were literally playing with fire, and the outcome could be good or bad, depending on how well we'd prepared. It could burn too hot and not leave any patches as wildlife refuges, or it could be a complete fizzer if weather conditions weren't right. There was a lot of risk to consider and manage.\"</p><p>Getting it right and making it safe involved a team of more than 20 staff, poring over a bank of information drawn from detailed park topography maps, long-range weather forecasts, computer modelling, vegetation data and details of previous fires in the region. All this data was needed to identify fire control lines, problematic areas and safety zones.</p><p>During the fire and in the days after it, Claridge's team set up 30 infra-red digital cameras at fixed points in burned and unburnt areas to film the movements of bandicoots and potoroos.</p><p>The cameras are used in conjuction with olfactory bait stations a small steel container scented with (what else?) French truffle oil. Claridge has pioneered this combination of truffle oil and digital technology to monitor wildlife, successfully using it to replace traps and sticky tubes that gather animal hair for analysis.</p><p>\"It's less stressful for the animals than being hauled out of a trap. We can actually see how they behave in the wild, get a better sense of how they interact with the habitat.\"</p><p>The cameras showed bandicoots and potoroos responding to their \"improved\" habitat, actively foraging in the burned areas. But a massive high intensity fire, in which a large section of bushland was burned, would be likely to have a less benign impact on plants and animals. In a book co- written with the late John Seebeck and University of Tasmania zoologist Dr Randy Rose, Claridge explains research shows some native animals bettongs and bandicoots can survive low- intensity fire by remaining in their nest sites \"until the very last minute\". The animals move ahead of the fire until they encounter an unburnt patch of habitat. If no unburnt habitat was found, they \"doubled back through the flames to the safety of burnt ground\".</p><p>Claridge writes that after an experimental fire in Western Australia, animals were observed \"sitting on burnt ground, seemingly dazed, near their original nest sites\". Survival was low, possibly because the exposed animals became easy prey for foxes.</p><p>The impact of the Ben Boyd burn is still being monitored through data collected by the remote cameras. So far, results seem to indicate a well-managed fire regime can be used successfully to regenerate habitat and revive declining populations.</p><p>But there are still big information gaps. Studies of how fire and Australia's ecosystems interact and possibly depend on each other are rare, and pitifully under-funded, despite predictions of a dramatically increased bushfire risk as a result of current climate change trends.</p><p>\"Fire is always a big risk to manage when you're doing research,\" Claridge says. \"There's still so much we don't know about the way we should go about introducing fire into the landscape. Our research results are promising, but indicate timing and planning are critical when you're burning for ecological reasons. We can only understand these things if we're in fire research for the long haul.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-12255077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VCT-22P1-2R6N-62HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1303\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 6, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Safety Zones</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REY5MDNGNUQxMjZGNDIyQ0E4MEVBRTFCRDdCMTM0NzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjY1RENBNzc2NUE5NDgzOEI1MDEwMDVFMjI4QjFDMDQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp;

Paul Gogarty runs the rule over some of the high spots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DON'T MISS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Grand Palace: The walled complex, with its extravagant temples, glittering palaces, golden stupas, monkey gods, 6m demons and other mythical statuary and frescoes, deserves several hours of your time, if not two visits. It is particularly beautiful when seen from the river at night. Open daily 8.30am-3.50pm; admission $5.20.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National Museum and Gallery: You won't have time for everything here. Pavilion No 1 tells the country's history from 1238, but Gallery 17 is the big draw, with its exquisite royal palanquins and gaudy carriages five storeys tall. Open 9am-4pm Wednesday-Sunday; admission $1.80. The adjacent National Gallery, which displays traditional and contemporary art, is open the same hours and admission is $1.30.</p><p>Chatuchak Weekend Market: One of the world's great markets. Operates Saturday and Sunday; Sunday is better because there is less traffic. Arrive at about 10am when it is still not too busy. Allow yourself two or three hours to trawl the Thai furniture and antiques, bird cages, food, Burmese handicrafts, carpets, second-hand porcelain, sarongs, coolie hats, watches, opium pipes, wall hangings, amulets, clothes and shoes. It is mostly covered so you won't get fried and there are plenty of food and drink stalls to dive into.</p><p>Aaron Shrine: The four-headed multi-armed Brahma is believed to be the best source of good luck in the city. A forest fire of incense skirts the railings alongside a mountain of marigold garlands and lotus flowers. The World Trade Centre in the city's best one-stop shopping centre is just across the street where you can cool off by ice skating if the air conditioning's not strong enough for you.</p><p>Bailout Sky Hotel observation deck: A see-through external wall lift rockets you 77 floors in one minute, 20 seconds for $1.70. It is 2,060 steps and a one-hour climb if the lifts break down. Good information panels at the top and telescope stations offer close-ups of the 360-degree views across the city.</p><p>War Foe: The oldest and biggest temple in Bangkok, with the country's largest reclining buddha and most substantial collection of buddha images. Open 9am-5pm daily; admission 90\u00a2. It is also the national centre for traditional Thai medicine. Massage is available at $3 an hour, using traditional herbs. You can also do one-week and 10-day massage courses.</p><p>Wat Arun Pagoda: 82m high, decorated with ceramic tiles and multicoloured porcelain, located on the west bank of the river. Known as the Temple of Dawn but most glorious when seen from the eastern bank of the river at sunset. Open daily 7am-5pm; admission 45\u00a2.</p><p>Jim Thompson's House: 6 Soi Kasemsan 2, Rama 1 Road. Traditional Thai house containing Asian artifacts collected by the mysterious American who revitalised Thailand's silk industry, only to disappear in 1967. Open daily 9am-4.30pm; admission $4.</p><p>Long-tailed boat ride: Hire one for a couple of hours and tour the houses on stilts and orchid gardens along the side canals. WHERE TO EAT</p><p>Thai food stalls are great for grazing you'll get a meal of soup, fish, fried rice and water for under $2.</p><p>BEST buys are clothes, traditional crafts, wickerwork, jewellery and pirated goods. With devaluation and endless sales, department stores can be as cheap as markets these days.</p><p>Chatuchak Weekend Market: Buy anything from a mongoose to a second-hand kimono.</p><p>The MBK Centre: (Mah Boon Krong), Siam Square, is where locals buy clothes, PlayStation games (about $1.30 each but you will need an adaptor), sports and electronic gadgetry. The World Trade Centre on Rajadamri Road is best for all-in-one shopping. Just wander. Discounts abound. Zen is good for general gifts and clothes.</p><p>Narayana Phand Pavilion: Opposite WTC, a government-subsidised craft centre (the biggest in Thailand). Thai silk, cotton, silverware, porcelain, Thai dolls, mother-of-pearl inlay, pewterware, wood carving, basketry.</p><p>Central Gems International: 232 Praram 5 Road, is the best and safest place to buy gems. An explanatory five-minute video is followed by a brief tour of the workshop floor where gems (mostly sapphire, ruby, garnet and emerald) are cut, polished and set in 18- and 14-carat gold. You can have jewellery made up in 24 hours. Sapphires cost from about $330. Expect to pay $1,300 for one set in a gold ring.IN THE KNOW</p><p>DIAL 1155 within Bangkok between 8am and midnight for the English-speaking Tourist Service Centre. The tourist police provide similar assistance on 1699.TIPS</p><p>TOUTS get up to 40 per cent commissions from shops, so if you are looking for a bargain, go alone.</p><p>Use only yellow and black licensed taxis. Be wary of unqualified tourist guides ask to see their licences.</p><p>Use an umbrella as shelter from the heat and the cloudbursts.</p><p>Avoid having goods shipped to your home address. It's risky.</p><p>Cover shoulders and wear long trousers/skirt to visit the temples, particularly the Grand Palace.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: TOP SPOT: Temple of the Emerald Buddha.

This exhibition is a fabulous mixture of paintings, sculpture, and printmaking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Certainly the imagery is generally based within traditional concepts, but when you see the etchings, you'll know what I mean. Urban Aboriginal artists have now for some time straddled the limits of both western and traditional Aboriginal art, and personalities such as the late Lin Onus or Western Australia's Sally Morgan have cut their niche in Australian art history.</p><p>Now traditional areas, which have a fine record of providing art since the 1960s (and the Tiwi communities of Bathurst and Melville Islands are just some of them) have embraced technology in the best possible way. It is pioneering stuff, riding the crest of a wave, metaphorically speaking, by grasping and joining two cultural practices, and coming up with a superb result.A Storm in a Teacup</p><p>Mr Woobys, Salamanca Square</p><p>Price range: $90 to $140</p><p>WELL-KNOWN ceramist and printmaker Carolyn Canty is currently showing at Mr Woobys restaurant-cum-gallery.</p><p> Mr Woobys has long been a staunch supporter of artists in the Sullivans Cove precinct, and is one of the few places that will give young, as yet untried, art practitioners a chance to show their work.</p><p> But for every \"young gun\" airing their work, Mr Woobys keeps the standard by also showing the work of Tasmania's premier artists.</p><p> Canty is not only well known as a practitioner, but also a leading teacher of her profession, and indeed practises what she preaches.</p><p> In keeping with the venue, Canty has created a series of artworks featuring food iconographically. Using a combination of techniques, such as embossing, printing, and ceramic detail, Canty has produced a marvellous array of plaques. Her subtle use of lettering as texture also adds to the feel of these items, and if you are looking for art with an unusual edge, don't miss this exhibition.The Spring Exhibition</p><p>Expressions of Interest Gallery, Bothwell</p><p>Price range: $120 to $560</p><p>FEEL like a spring excursion? Well, Bothwell is a comfortable distance for a weekend afternoon trip, and the countryside is absolutely glorious at present.</p><p> When the Hibiscus Gallery in Sandy Bay closed its doors a couple of years ago, and subsequently the Affordable Art group at Walch's, many mid-range painters were disenfranchised.</p><p> By mid-range I mean artists who largely work as hobbyists, don't charge an arm and a leg for their work and simply enjoy showing the results of their vocation.</p><p> The Expressions of Interest Gallery at Bothwell became a real alternative for these artists, and several times each year, the gallery is home to some substantial exhibitions featuring this sort of work. It is pleasant work, featuring botanical themes, land and seascapes, views of the highlands in winter, and in general is soundly produced and well presented.</p><p> Mini highlights are a floral study of Camellias by Margaret Parham, and a highlands snow scene by Jennifer Eaton. Radio personality Bob Cure's misty landscape also makes quite an impact, helping keep a fine level of expertise running throughout the show.Student Exhibition</p><p>Rosny College and Art Space, Clarence City</p><p>Price range: POA</p><p>EVERY now and then this column handles exhibitions from the state or private education system, and Rosny College's final year art results have been too good to miss.</p><p> As the college sets fairly high standards and elicited prize donations from two of Hobart's art-related businesses, the result is great, and the exhibition is well worth the attention of the wider public. The college has agreed to let the exhibition -- usually a short-lived affair -- remain on the walls until next Thursday. If you are interested in what next year's intake at the University's School of Art could possibly foreshadow, feel free to visit the college.</p><p> College art has the tendency to be far less inhibited when compared to the work the same students will perform under the umbrella of art schools. Unfortunately the exertion of often-tighter discipline also somewhat shrinks the exuberance of spirit -- many talented students finding the process extremely limiting.</p><p> Perhaps it's natural selection at work, but it often disguises conformity to institutional pressures, which takes a strong and stubborn character to resist in order to survive the process. Please try to see this exhibition, as the best work represents as yet unfettered vitality.Nyrrippi Art</p><p>Long Gallery, Salamanca Arts Centre</p><p>Price range: $60 to $16,000</p><p>THE Nyrrippi community of Central Australia is making its mark on the wider art market.</p><p> Located 300km northwest of Alice Springs, the Nyrrippi community is adding to the national pool of indigenous art, and it is the first time Tasmania is seeing the work. Art broker and curator Tim Crosby is presenting this body of paintings at the Long Gallery, with the exhibition lasting a week, closing next Saturday.</p><p> Collectors of indigenous art now have a new source to ponder, as the national art market is steadily growing. Indeed, from what I'm told, Aboriginal art represents the largest and most successful art market in Australia, outselling all other forms of art.Forest/Fire</p><p>Devonport Regional Gallery</p><p>Price range: POA</p><p>JUST a short note should readers journey to the north of the state, that Lorraine Biggs and Kay Jensen are showing paintings and ceramics respectively at the Regional Gallery in Devonport.</p><p> Biggs's use of rag paper and pastels to create a series of images from within the old growth forests is breathtaking, and in partnering with ceramist Kay Jensen, makes a superb show.

We had a lot of animals, and I milked them before school. I wanted to be an army hero and used all the local backyards as military bases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moving to Pinjarra in Western Australia at 11 was the best thing that ever happened to me. I joked that my dad should get a place with a river in the backyard, and he did. The bush was my ultimate war scene, but it all stopped when I was 12 and fell in love. She was two years older, and when she saw my clubhouse with toy guns, I felt embarrassed and knew it was time to stop. That, along with my father insisting I wasn't going to die for an oil company.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>If I had to describe my teens in three words, they'd be isolation, rebellion and adventure. In Pinjarra, my American accent got me chased out of parties. I ran from many a fight. There was a lot of small-town racism, and I was determined not to be like them. I had Aboriginal friends and related to how they saw society - I felt just as much of an outcast as them. But we had good times, too. My friend, Michael, my girlfriend and I would go looking for caves, set up camp in tree hollows and swim.</p><p>From my father, who's Australian, I inherited discipline and business sense. He taught me to save and invest money, which helped my business [Butler co-owns Jarrah Records with West Australian folk band The Waifs]. From my mum, who's American, I inherited compassion and a giving nature. I love to share with both strangers and people I know. I also have her spacey humour.</p><p>It's not enough to be popular, have money and be successful. I started The JB Seed [a program awarding five $10,000 arts grants] to give something back. When I started out, West Australian arts grants helped me record Three [2001] and tour, so now I want to do the same for others. Australia has a unique arts scene that needs to be encouraged.</p><p>Money makes people treat you funny. I've had people in interviews mention me being a millionaire. My business has had millions run through it, but it's expensive to run, and we donate a lot [to charities such as The Wilderness Society, Refugee Action Coalition (NSW) and Greenpeace]. People are so geared around money that they see a dollar sign on your forehead and forget who you are.</p><p>Playing guitar never made me attractive to women. When I play, I make so many faces that it looks like I'm trying to poo. When I was busking, kids would never mention my playing, just my grunting.</p><p>I have acrylic nails on my right hand. Because of finger picking, my nails wore down to the quick and hurt when I played. A guitarist friend had fake nails, so I got them, too. It's like having a pick on each finger.</p><p>I live in Byron Bay and have a house in Melbourne but don't actually live anywhere any more. Last year, I toured so much that I spent three months at home, but each year, after I've toured, my wife, Danielle, and I go to Broome. She once lived on an Aboriginal community there and now they're part of our family - we camp with them.</p><p>When I met Danielle, in 1999, I realised I could make babies with her. Apart from being sexy, attractive and funny, she was wise, inspiring and I knew she'd be a good mother.</p><p>I caught my daughter Banjo [now two] in my hands. We were going to have a natural delivery, but after 30 hours, it was getting dangerous, so we decided to drive 45 minutes through the hills to the hospital. After 38 hours, she was born - and I was right there. We called her Banjo as we love the name, the instrument and the poet [Banjo Paterson].</p><p>I am a different person at age 29 to 19. At 19, I was pretty angry, addicted and passionate - I'm still passionate. I was hurt and in pain. I was angry about bad things that happened in my childhood and hung on to that anger. In the past 10 years, I've let go of a lot of it as it's not very productive for my child's life or what I want to achieve.</p><p>Weed made me paranoid. I stopped smoking it six years ago because it wasn't fun and it made me anxious.</p><p>A pivotal life moment occurred while 65 metres up a eucalyptus tree in Tasmania. It was a publicity stunt to stop woodchipping in the Styx Valley [December 2003]. I sat in the world's highest tree, played my grandfather's guitar and sang \"Treat Yo Mama\", a song about respecting where you live. My grandfather died in Western Australia, in 1952, fighting a forest fire. I thought of him up there.</p><p>I care about the environment, so I'm branded a tree-hugging hippie. The fact that I have dreadlocks only makes it worse. But who doesn't want clean air and water? At home in Byron Bay we probably go through a shopping bag full of trash per week. Our house has a composting toilet and runs off rainwater, but nobody can be environmentally perfect. But when you sing about it and promote it, people expect you to be.</p><p>I would describe myself as a person of good intent. I'm honest, passionate, rough around the edges and a bit of a yobbo, but sensitive.</p><p>My biggest faults are self-doubt and not loving myself enough. I've done a lot of good things and if I honoured myself the way I deserved, I could do a lot of good.</p><p>For more information on The JB Seed, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thejbseed.com\">www.thejbseed.com</url> (expressions of interest close March 15)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-STM0501301015255614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYMAGAZINELTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FC4-3T90-015G-S1NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Magazine (Sydney, Australia) (Sydney, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>January 30, 2005 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>REFUGEE ACTION COALITION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp;

We had a lot of animals, and I milked them before school. I wanted to be an army hero and used all the local backyards as military bases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moving to Pinjarra in Western Australia at 11 was the best thing that ever happened to me. I joked that my dad should get a place with a river in the backyard, and he did. The bush was my ultimate war scene, but it all stopped when I was 12 and fell in love. She was two years older, and when she saw my clubhouse with toy guns, I felt embarrassed and knew it was time to stop. That, along with my father insisting I wasn't going to die for an oil company.</p><p>If I had to describe my teens in three words, they'd be isolation, rebellion and adventure. In Pinjarra, my American accent got me chased out of parties. I ran from many a fight. There was a lot of small-town racism, and I was determined not to be like them. I had Aboriginal friends and related to how they saw society - I felt just as much of an outcast as them. But we had good times, too. My friend, Michael, my girlfriend and I would go looking for caves, set up camp in tree hollows and swim.</p><p>From my father, who's Australian, I inherited discipline and business sense. He taught me to save and invest money, which helped my business [Butler co-owns Jarrah Records with West Australian folk band The Waifs]. From my mum, who's American, I inherited compassion and a giving nature. I love to share with both strangers and people I know. I also have her spacey humour.</p><p>It's not enough to be popular, have money and be successful. I started The JB Seed [a program awarding five $10,000 arts grants] to give something back. When I started out, West Australian arts grants helped me record Three [2001] and tour, so now I want to do the same for others. Australia has a unique arts scene that needs to be encouraged.</p><p>Money makes people treat you funny. I've had people in interviews mention me being a millionaire. My business has had millions run through it, but it's expensive to run, and we donate a lot [to charities such as The Wilderness Society, Refugee Action Coalition (NSW) and Greenpeace]. People are so geared around money that they see a dollar sign on your forehead and forget who you are.</p><p>Playing guitar never made me attractive to women. When I play, I make so many faces that it looks like I'm trying to poo. When I was busking, kids would never mention my playing, just my grunting.</p><p>I have acrylic nails on my right hand. Because of finger picking, my nails wore down to the quick and hurt when I played. A guitarist friend had fake nails, so I got them, too. It's like having a pick on each finger.</p><p>I live in Byron Bay and have a house in Melbourne but don't actually live anywhere any more. Last year, I toured so much that I spent three months at home, but each year, after I've toured, my wife, Danielle, and I go to Broome. She once lived on an Aboriginal community there and now they're part of our family - we camp with them.</p><p>When I met Danielle, in 1999, I realised I could make babies with her. Apart from being sexy, attractive and funny, she was wise, inspiring and I knew she'd be a good mother.</p><p>I caught my daughter Banjo [now two] in my hands. We were going to have a natural delivery, but after 30 hours, it was getting dangerous, so we decided to drive 45 minutes through the hills to the hospital. After 38 hours, she was born - and I was right there. We called her Banjo as we love the name, the instrument and the poet [Banjo Paterson].</p><p>I am a different person at age 29 to 19. At 19, I was pretty angry, addicted and passionate - I'm still passionate. I was hurt and in pain. I was angry about bad things that happened in my childhood and hung on to that anger. In the past 10 years, I've let go of a lot of it as it's not very productive for my child's life or what I want to achieve.</p><p>Weed made me paranoid. I stopped smoking it six years ago because it wasn't fun and it made me anxious.</p><p>A pivotal life moment occurred while 65 metres up a eucalyptus tree in Tasmania. It was a publicity stunt to stop woodchipping in the Styx Valley [December 2003]. I sat in the world's highest tree, played my grandfather's guitar and sang \"Treat Yo Mama\", a song about respecting where you live. My grandfather died in Western Australia, in 1952, fighting a forest fire. I thought of him up there.</p><p>I care about the environment, so I'm branded a tree-hugging hippie. The fact that I have dreadlocks only makes it worse. But who doesn't want clean air and water? At home in Byron Bay we probably go through a shopping bag full of trash per week. Our house has a composting toilet and runs off rainwater, but nobody can be environmentally perfect. But when you sing about it and promote it, people expect you to be.</p><p>I would describe myself as a person of good intent. I'm honest, passionate, rough around the edges and a bit of a yobbo, but sensitive.</p><p>My biggest faults are self-doubt and not loving myself enough. I've done a lot of good things and if I honoured myself the way I deserved, I could do a lot of good.</p><p>For more information on The JB Seed, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thejbseed.com\">www.thejbseed.com</url> (expressions of interest close March 15)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HSM0501301015557595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYMAGAZINELTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FC4-3TG0-015G-P1DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"908\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Herald Sun Sunday Style Magazine</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>January 30, 2005 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>REFUGEE ACTION COALITION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp;

Inside a ramshackle house where ideas and spirits collide, Andrew Purcell meets the man behind the Momix magic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Draped in a white sheet, Moses Pendleton careened down the</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">hillside, pursued by a herd of cattle. He had rehearsed, so he knew his dancers - pure-bred Holstein-Friesians from the family farm in Vermont - could be relied upon to follow him as he swerved from side to side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the shrouded figure hurtled towards them, a few people backed away uneasily. The stampede, 50 cows the size of a minibus, appeared to be out of control. Just before reaching the crowd, Pendleton threw himself into a ditch. The cattle, with nothing more to chase, stopped running and began to graze. A volunteer from Vermont Natural Theatre rang a bell and audience members were led into an adjacent meadow, where they were encouraged to strip naked and swim across a lake to the farmhouse, to discuss the experience over hot cider and soy bread.</p><p>This would be Pendleton's first and last attempt at \"cow-ography\", but his debut as a performance artist contained the germ of a creative method that has served him ever since. It began with a single arresting image - black-and-white shapes on a green background - and confounded expectations. As the director of Momix, one of the world's most successful dance companies, he has produced hundreds of inventive variations on this simple formula.</p><p>From August 7-11, Momix returns to Arts Centre Melbourne with a full complement of dancers for the first time since a sell-out run a decade ago. The Sunday Age's dance critic, Neil Jillett, described that show, Opus Cactus, as \"a combination of the high points of Disney's Fantasia, Sydney Dance Company at its most inventive and Cirque du Soleil at its slickest\". Momix typically has two or three productions on tour at any time, mostly in the US, Italy and Brazil, where the dancers are greeted like rock stars.</p><p>The company is run from a ramshackle house in Washington, Connecticut, deep in New York's banker belt. On a gusty spring morning, the doors were open and there was music playing from an unattended computer. As nobody answered, I let myself in and wandered from room to room, taking in the awesome, borderline obsessive-compulsive clutter, peering around corners and calling out, until Pendleton emerged from the basement.</p><p>He has lived in Washington since 1978 with his common-law wife and creative foil, Cynthia Quinn, the nearest thing Momix has to a prima ballerina. They intended to buy the barn across the road as a rehearsal space, but the estate agent convinced them to take a look at the house and when he stepped inside, Pendleton was entranced by the late-afternoon sunlight. \"The wallpaper was aglow,\" he recalled. \"It was a mystical experience.\"</p><p>He was so enamoured of the wallpaper, in fact, he hasn't changed it in 35 years. On the stairwell, above papier-mache gargoyles of Verdi and Vivaldi, it is peeling off in metre-long strips. On every shelf are sunflower and daffodil blooms, not so much dried as interestingly dead, in shapes Pendleton found too appealing to let go.</p><p>As we toured the property, he kept up a relentless stream-of-consciousness monologue. The eight bathrooms all have original fixtures but only one is fully operational, he told me. His daughter, Quinn Pendleton, is getting married to a Turkish prince who dances with her at the Monte Carlo Ballet.</p><p>The house is haunted: \"If people have that in them to think that it might have some spirits, they're more apt to catch them.\"</p><p>All of this was captured on not one but two digital audio devices. \"We'll double-tape,\" Pendleton told me. By habit, he carries a recorder at all times, on the off chance that his conversations might contain ideas worth keeping. His assistant's main job is to catalogue the thousands of tapes and terabytes of new data. \"If the tape's running, you've got to put something on it,\" he explained. \"Say something of importance, confess something that's really heartfelt. Dare you.\"</p><p>Although he stopped dancing professionally long ago, he still has a dancer's sinewy physique, thanks to a daily exercise regime that includes a swim in the lake, an hour cycling and a 13-kilometre walk, listening to himself on headphones. He always takes a camera, to ensure he never misses an image. Last month, he shot some \"Rauschenberg-esque crow poop\". In March, he spent hours lying flat on country roads, taking extreme close-ups of ice crystals forming and melting. Each spring, he sets fire to last year's Christmas tree and films the flames.</p><p>Botanica is the end product of this exploration. The dancing flowers, bees and fireflies, the worms and sprouting plants are imaginative responses to Connecticut's changing seasons. It seems unlikely that Pendleton saw centaurs or a triceratops mating with a daffodil on his walk, but something in the hedgerows or the orchard grass set him off. \"You think you're in a Wyeth painting,\" he told me. \"You need the wind to get the grass to show you the dance.\"</p><p>Momix shows often reflect his enthusiasms - sex, baseball and astronomy - but Botanica is born of obsession. Each spring, Pendleton plants thousands of sunflowers. One sad summer, Verticillium wilt and Rhizoctonia laid waste to the monoculture, so he now plants marigolds on the lawn, in beds like a child's drawing of the sun, and rents \"terroir\" from a farmer for the sunflowers.</p><p>\"Botanica isn't just the piece you see on stage. It really started with digging the soil, putting in these marigold plants,\" Pendleton said. \"Monet grew his muse. He would say, when he referred to his act of painting, 'je pioche', and that in French means 'I hoe'.\"</p><p>Unlike most dance companies, Momix does not receive funds from the government or charitable foundations. Much of its income is derived from corporate partnerships with BMW, MAC cosmetics, Target stores and Hanes underwear, among others. Botanica is the fruit of three such arrangements, with Mercedes-Benz, Kohler bathroom fittings and a chain of Las Vegas casinos. For the Frankfurt Motor Show, Pendleton conceived the metamorphosis of a giant tree into a Mercedes, the dancers transforming branches into car parts, to emphasise the company's green credentials.</p><p>Because Momix needs to sell tickets (its peers can afford to make a loss at the box office), its shows are unashamedly populist, more likely to please crowds than dance critics, who have sometimes been rather sniffy about its blend of acrobatics, physical theatre and surrealism. Writing in The New York Times, Alastair MacAulay described a performance as \"sensationalist trash so brightly harmless that I wish I could fall in line with those who enjoy it as sheer sensation\".</p><p>Pendleton calls his troupe \"dancer-illusionists\". Half the pleasure of watching a Momix show is in working out how the visual effects are created and enjoying the feeling of being tricked. Although illusion is cheap in the multimedia age, it is amazing what can be achieved with 10 preternaturally lithe bodies, a few props and some ingenious lighting. When fans complain that Pendleton has started using computer-generated imagery, he is tempted to employ \"a lightning bolt, a subliminal flash, to show the dancer behind the fabric\" and prove he's done no such thing.</p><p>Hanging over Pendleton and Quinn's bed is a picture of merino sheep by a river bank in the shade of eucalyptus trees - an image that was printed on every box of blankets made by his family's woollen company. In the late 1930s, his father, Nelson Augustus Pendleton, spent two years working on a sheep station \"somewhere near Brisbane\" and thought about emigrating to Australia - \"I should know more,\" Pendleton admitted - but on a visit back to the US he was severely injured in an explosion at a hotel in San Francisco.</p><p>Badly disfigured, he was \"brought back in a box\" to convalesce in New York, fell in love with his nurse and proposed marriage before the bandages had been taken off his eyes. Pendleton's grandfather, Moses Pendleton snr, set the newlyweds up with a farm in Vermont and the beginnings of a herd of Holstein-Friesians. Moses, the fourth of six children, grew up believing he would breed the ultimate dairy cow, but in 1962, in haying season, his father committed suicide.</p><p>\"I was 12 years old. And everything changed. This whole fantasy of creating the perfect Holstein, all of this, shut down.\"</p><p>Pendleton's mother sent him to Dartmouth College, to train with the Olympic ski team. He first took a dance class as a form of physiotherapy after breaking his leg on the slopes. Momix began as an offshoot of Pilobolus Dance Theatre, the company he founded with his teacher, Alison Chase, and a group of fellow students.</p><p>When Frank Zappa asked them to open for him, the reception they got from \"2000 screaming girls\" convinced them there was a market for performance art that fused choreography, gymnastics and the absurd.</p><p>It was October 1971, the dog days of the Vietnam era, and students all over the US lived in terror of being drafted. \"I got a high number, but two of my close friends burnt their draft cards and went to prison,\" Pendleton said. \"The war was an event that caused potential lawyers and doctors and businessmen to head into the frigging hills and learn how to play drums on hollowed-out spruce logs.\"</p><p>He suggested that dance was most profound without an audience, and that this was something pioneers such as Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham understood: \"They did it for themselves, as a kind of spiritual awakening. It wasn't a performance art.\"</p><p>We dropped in on rehearsal, in the barn, where Quinn was teaching a group of six young female dancers their roles in Alchemia, the newest Momix production, in preparation for a run at the Roman amphitheatre in Verona.</p><p>As a mix of Ennio Morricone and the hissing, popping noises of a forest fire played over the speakers, the dancers skipped, twisted and twirled, their red stretch dresses trailing like flames. It looked a little bare, without lights, despite the level of technical skill and the unfeasibly flexible bodies on display. \"If someone is so highly trained and musical and has the ability to defy gravity, that is still something that fascinates people, because we all identify with the body,\" Pendleton said.</p><p>In a second sketch, referred to by Quinn as \"bubble butts\", the dancers wore pads beneath their dresses in the shape of half melons, shifting them from buttocks, to hips, to bust as the dance progressed, giving them a grotesque, surgically enhanced look.</p><p>Most Momix shows have an element of titillation. The couple's dog, Mojito, wears a collar that gives him an electric shock if he strays too far from the house, and Pendleton joked that \"Cynthia's getting me one as well. I can walk the further perimeter but I can't get out.\"</p><p>That this might be prudent became clear over lunch at the country club. As our waitress, to my eyes a fairly nondescript young woman, approached the table, Pendleton deployed the full force of his charm: \"Well, speaking of an angel! Where's that accent from? What's your name? Do you say it Zo-ay, or Zo-ee?\"</p><p>When she left, he turned to me in raptures. \"Zoe gave me enough energy right there to almost burn my midnight candle,\" he said. \"When you get to be 64, you don't need much. You don't go anywhere near there, but if you are a good receiver, you can pick up the feminine fire, the all-required celestial heat, in one quick exchange of bread and ... god, life is beautiful. If I were alone, I'd have five glasses of that white wine, stay until five, have two espressos, go out in the garden, talk to one of my flowers and call her Zoe.\"</p><p>This afternoon, he would settle for meditating under the hawthorn tree in full bloom, then join Quinn on the verandah for dinner, to discuss the day's inspirations. \"It's always been my problem: whether or not you want to just see a flower grow and feel your art is complete, or do you need to take that experience into a studio, try to translate it into Momix dancers and see if they can somehow, through dance, give you a feeling of a flower growing,\" he said. \"I'm not sure it's possible.\"</p><p>\"Botanica is at the State Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne, August 7-11.</p><p>artscentremelbourne.com.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>EIGHT PHOTOS: From inspiration to stage, an image from Moses Pendleton's garden, left, is brought to life in Botanica.

Sally Browne reports on a remarkable journey of self-discovery heading back to the top</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'It wipes everything out for a while, and then you have to kind of regrow, heal, rebuild. You've been dismantled and dismembered. And then all your bits start coming back together and it's wonderful'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHE looks exactly the same, but Toni Childs has been on quite a journey to get to where she is today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the early 1990s, the US singer had the world at her feet. Her debut album Union (1988) was an international hit, spawning such memorable songs as Stop Your Fussin', Don't Walk Away and Zimbabwe.</p><p>I've Got To Go Now from her second album House of Hope (1991), was a No.5 hit in Australia.</p><p>Her powerful voice and soulful tunes cut to the heart of the listening public and in 1988 she was nominated for two Grammy awards. Although she didn't win, she delivered a memorable performance, with Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger in the audience.</p><p>While working on a fourth album, Childs plunged herself into charity work, starting the Dream a Dolphin charity for sick kids. It was then she discovered that she, too, was sick. She had a disease she had never heard of. It was Graves Disease, a thyroid condition brought on by stress.</p><p>``My right eye was popping out of my head and I was waking up with my hands and feet cramping,'' she recalls. ``These are classic symptoms. I didn't know what it was. I thought, `I know I need to go to an eye doctor' but I was so busy and my life was so crazy.</p><p>``I remember I was visiting my grandmother and my Aunt Linda said, `You know what? I bet you have Graves Disease'.''</p><p>Sure enough, she did. She went to a doctor who told her that her resting pulse rate was 120 beats a minute, and immediately put her on heart inhibitors.</p><p>``It was a shock because each one of the doctors said I had to dismantle my life.''</p><p>She put the brakes on her projects and recording career and spent the next eight years focusing on getting well. She describes the experience as like a forest fire.</p><p>``It takes everything down,'' she says. ``It wipes everything out for a while, and then you have to kind of regrow, heal, rebuild. You've been dismantled and dismembered. And then all your bits start coming back together and it's wonderful. It gives you this amazing appreciation for life and the privilege of getting to do what you love.''</p><p>What she loves is music, and Childs finally has a new album out. It's titled, aptly, Keep the Faith.</p><p>Not only that, her journey to recovery brought with it other rewards. Part of her healing ritual was to treat her body with salt rubs, reminding herself that each part of her body was beautiful.</p><p>Gradually, she was able to wean herself off her medication. The process inspired her to create a line of organic bodycare products, with names such as I Love My Body and I Love My Hair, which will be released in Australia next month.</p><p>Childs worked on the products from the ingredients to the packaging. She spent time scouting for a manufacturer in Australia who could handle smaller quantities, and found one in Melbourne. She still has her ritual salt rubs by her outdoor shower at her home on the island of Kauai, Hawaii.</p><p>It was a serendipitous meeting that led her back to the recording studio.</p><p>Childs was performing in a local production of The Vagina Monologues and it just so happened that Eve Ensler, the creator of that play, was in the audience. She sought out Childs after the show.</p><p>``When she came we were all nervous. We were in this receiving line waiting for her. She didn't really recognise who I was because she thought it was the black gal in the cast, and said, `Oh, so who's Toni Childs?' pointing and looking at this other gal and I said (in a small voice) `No, it's me!'.'' Childs laughs at the memory.</p><p>What came next was a deep bonding experience for both women. Ensler told her that her record, Union, had had a profound impact on her life. When Ensler was down in the dumps and living out of her car, she listened to the record over and over again.</p><p>She took Childs aside and told her she needed to start singing again.</p><p>``She said, `You need to be singing. This is your gift. Why aren't you singing?' She really gave me a hard time and then she asked me the craziest thing: `Okay, I want you to write an anthem that will inspire people to end violence against women and children for all time.'</p><p>``And what's really scary was I actually contemplated whether I could do it or not. That's the funny part.''</p><p>Childs ended up writing the song Because You're Beautiful for Ensler's documentary Until the Violence Stops. The song won an Emmy Award.</p><p>``I wanted to address how women need to know they are beautiful,'' she says. ``I think we as women are really hard on ourselves. I think we have what I call a beauty wound, needing a lot of outside reflection that we're okay and there's these vulnerable parts of ourselves and we give our power away.''</p><p>Where does that beauty wound come from?</p><p>\"You know, Oh, God,\" she sighs. ``I'm writing a book. It's called Living Beauty: Alchemy of Acceptance, and this is a big piece of this book, because I'm really looking at my own stuff, and my girlfriends'. It's something I've been working on since '94. In fact, writing that song for Eve was the catalyst to start writing the book.</p><p>``It's centuries old, this wound, and I think there are certain things that happened in our history which created a situation for women to stay more in the background. I believe right now that a lot of women in the world, not all women in the world, are coming into their own.''</p><p>At the age of 50 Childs is finding her voice again, both as a speaker and a singer. She says her new record is more rootsy and home-spun than her earlier work and she has noticed that her voice is more ``open''. The music industry has changed a lot since Childs last released a record, for the better she thinks.</p><p>``It's actually becoming more karmically balanced,'' she laughs. ``It also asks the artist to become more business savvy. With computers and the internet and also the ability to really connect with people, it's much better now.''</p><p>Her life is much more karmically balanced, too. She lives on a beautiful property with two dogs, a cat, a horse named Sunny, 50 ducks and 100 chickens.</p><p>A particularly plucky rooster likes to crow outside her window to let her know it's breakfast time.

For central Australia, from August until April.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Central Australia, which doesn't even have a fire season every year, is experiencing what Bushfires NT director Steve Sutton described as a one-in-30-year event.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Sutton said fires would continue to burn in the centre for most of the season running through to the end of April and would likely move into both South Australia and Queensland.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It will be a very large number for the total area burnt,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Record rainfall right across the territory has led to enormous amounts of grass growth, while there's also the problem of introduced species of grass which grow denser and burn hotter than native grass species, he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The fuel loads are, in some areas, potentially higher than they have ever been,\" Mr Sutton said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He said Bushfires NT had a vigorous fire mitigation program but the problem this year was that the record rain continued through the mitigation season, making it difficult to conduct prescribed burning to reduce the fuel load.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 It's been situation normal in the Top End of the NT, where there's lots of fires each year, but the season should end within the next month with the first widespread showers of the wet season.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 NSW<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Bushfire season: October 1 to March 31. Bushfire danger period declared in 31 local government areas since September 1.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Drought-breaking rains have generated significant grass growth with NSW facing a difficult fire season, the NSW Rural Fire Service says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said that after one of the quietest fire seasons in many years last year, there was every potential for a difficult season in NSW.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We are coming into a fire season which is going to prove particularly challenging, I suspect, and particularly so given the grassland conditions the likes of which we haven't seen for 30 or 40 years,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He said that even over winter there were dozens of grass fires a week, as a lot of vegetation dried and died.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Any new growth we get now with any spring rain, as we come into summer you only need a couple of days of hot, dry, windy conditions and you've got a landscape that is very susceptible to ignition, and should ignition start under those conditions fires will spread very quickly.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Fire authorities and the brigade's 70,000 volunteers had been focusing on hazard reduction work and raising awareness among communities to ensure they were prepared for a difficult fire season.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 While the focus was on grass fires, Mr Fitzsimmons said there was still a lot of bush across NSW that would be prone to bushfire this season.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 QUEENSLAND<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Bushfire season: Started August 1. End date not set but generally runs to end October or November. Fire danger period, requiring permits to light fires, runs September 4 to January 1.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The warm weather has already brought with it bushfires and days of severe fire danger for large parts of Queensland.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Queensland Fire and Rescue Service acting assistant commissioner Paul Adcock said the fires were moving quickly, due to an abundance of thick grass load, particularly in the west and south-west of the state.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"In essence we've got a normal fire season but with a very high grass load which makes it difficult to control fires,\" Mr Adcock said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 After the state's extensive floods, higher soil moisture meant the fire danger rating was lower in forested areas than in grass areas, but Mr Adcock said warm dry winds over the next month or two would start to dry out the forests as well.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Adcock said it looked like being a busy season but not one like 2009, when Queensland experienced one of its worst bushfire seasons on record with dry conditions fanning thousands of blazes.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think this year we're going to find that there'll be perhaps less fires but some of the fires may be more difficult to control because of the higher fuel loads,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Adcock said October was the month of concern for fire activity, before the storm season began.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Bushfire season: Dates not set yet. Some districts could start from mid-October but generally begins from November 1 into early December, and then runs until late March or late April.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The north-east and north-west pastoral districts and the west coast face above-average fire potential, with SA fire authorities providing resourcing to those areas above what would they would normally be provided.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The abundance of grass in those areas due to well-above average rainfall had increased the risk of bushfires in those areas above what they would normally see, SA Country Fire Service manager operations services Rob Sandford said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"When you talk to a number of people, long-time residents in the pastoral country, particularly on the stations, they're saying they haven't seen growth like that for a long time,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The risk remains for the rest of the state.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Sandford said the fuel load was there but the level of fire activity was very much weather dependent.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He said everyone needed a bushfire action plan, including people travelling through SA's outback.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 TASMANIA<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Bushfire season: Dates yet to be set.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Tasmania Fire Serve district officer Jeff Knight says it's too early to tell what sort of fire season the state faces.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He said the weather bureau had indicated it would be an average year but it would take until the end of October for there to be a good indication of the season.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Knight said in some years large areas which had experienced flooding earlier in the year then had fires in early October, while in other years there were no major fires until after Christmas.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We had an average season last year and the year before,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We'll always get fires, but it just depends on how many and how frequent and how big.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 VICTORIA<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Bushfire season: Dates not set yet.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Victorian fire authorities say this year's rainfall, coming after 10 years of drought, has changed the outlook for the 2011-12 season and the state faces a significantly higher grass fire risk than it has for many years.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Mallee and Wimmera region in the north-west, where fires are a normal occurrence each year, has had significant and widespread native grass growth.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Fire Services Commissioner Craig Lapsley said central Victoria had experienced similar conditions. There the grassland ran into small forest areas and there was a dispersed population of small hamlets, rural agricultural country and regional centres.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Lapsley said this summer had the potential for large grass fires but also warned there was still a risk of bushland fires.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We should never underestimate what fire can do in the bushland and particularly after a dry spell of weather, of what fire can do in any part of Victoria,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Victoria has experienced a couple of benign fire seasons since the devastating Black Saturday bushfires in February 2009 killed 173 people.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Work was continuing to implement the Bushfires Royal Commission's recommendations.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Have we implemented everything yet? The answer's no. Have we got everything moving? Yes we have, but not everything is in its final state yet,\" Mr Lapsley said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We're certainly in a far better position.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Bushfire season: Northwest WA June to late October. Rest of the state October to April.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Most of WA is facing a risk of above-average bushfire activity, because the rains have promoted grassland growth in the outback and pastoral areas.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We've got above-average growth and I guess above-average potential across about 80 per cent of our state,\" said Chris Arnol, assistant chief operations officer (country) at the Fire &amp; Emergency Services Authority of WA.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The south-west corner of WA is expecting normal bushfire activity this season, but Mr Arnol said it would still be significant fires in those forested areas and a key issue facing fire authorities was urban interface fires.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"If the rains continue we'll probably have a later onset of the season so January/February could still be quite horrendous for us, because that's our peak (for the south season),\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The bushfire season in the north is coming to an end but fires have been burning particularly in the Kimberley, including one which trapped ultramarathon runners in early September.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"As the summer comes down the continent we have fires progressively come down,\" Mr Arnol said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Arnol said WA probably undertook the most hazard reduction burning of any state, including aerial control burning up north and work to protect towns identified as being most at risk.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53X9-M2N1-DYG0-91C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1711\"/><timeReceived>11:34 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Australian Associated Press Pty.

Since then, he has published two novels, The Ultimate Good Luck and The Sportswriter, and a volume of short stories, Rock Springs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of Ford's fiction concerns poor folks, the unemployed, the just plain unlucky, and adulterers - the little betrayals that make us human. Although Ford is college-educated, his father was a travelling salesman. You feel confident that the author knows his unstable, \"low-life\", small-town milieu.</p><p>Richard Ford has been associated with a new generation of American realists, whose fiction has been described as \"devoted to the local details, the nuances, the little disturbances in language and gesture ... the belly-side of contemporary life\".</p><p>Wildlife is set over three days in Great Falls, Montana, a city of 60,000, just one hundred kilometres from the Canadian border. Ford's stories are often located in the rural American north-west, where it gets damned cold in winter. A cold tale's best for winter, as the Bard hath it. Ford is a winter writer -climatically, emotionally, and stylistically. Each of his fictions charts a decisive moment of change - to call it a crisis would be too strong, would sensationalise the restraint of his writing. A moment of change that is always for the worse:</p><p>In the Fall of 1960, when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working, my mother met a man named Warren Miller and fell in love with him. This was in Great Falls, Montana, at the time of the Gypsy Basin oil boom, and my father had brought us there in the spring of that year from Lewiston, Idaho, in the belief that people - small people like him - were making money in Montana or soon would be, and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of it collapsed and was gone in the wind.</p><p>That's a damned fine opening paragraph. Unassertive, limpid, economic. Ford is a master of economy. In a hundred words he gives us the principals, the location, the father's \"misfortunate\" fate, the mother's infidelity, charted the plot for us - delivered both history and prophecy - and, perhaps most important, exposed us to the 16-year-old narrator's tone, the tone, albeit, of that narrator some years later.</p><p>Tone is Ford's characteristic triumph. The American novel, from Huckleberry Finn on, is littered with adolescent (J. D. Salinger, Bret Easton Ellis) or arrested adolescent (Jack Kerouac) first-person male narrators. While the Joe of Wildlife experiences the same traumas as Huck Finn and Holden Caulfield(loneliness, loss, the prospect of death), his essential restraint makes him, appropriately, a singular figure.</p><p>Joe's mother tells him: \"Your life doesn't mean what you have, sweetheart, or what you get. It's what you're willing to give up ... That's the rule. It's the major rule for everything.\" Loss is perhaps the Lesson of Literature. Joe reflects: \"What I thought about as I fell asleep in my bed late in that morning was loss and how I would get along with it alone and what I had of myself that I was willing to lose.\" Indeed, his narrative restraint, his mature detachment in telling of his adolescent exposure to the facts of adult life - bad luck, deception, compromise - may just be the index of what he has lost.</p><p>Why the title - Wildlife? Well, the principals do lead a \"wild life\", as one remarks. And they are surrounded by Nature, Tennysonianly red in tooth and claw. Great Falls is threatened by a forest fire, which Joe's father quixotically fights. It is then that he sees the bear, as Jimmy Buffet would say.</p><p>Your father said he saw a bear catch on fire.

For the family of four there's breakfast to be had, school lunches to be made and maybe clothes to be ironed before it's into the car, or on to the bus, and off to school or work. Australia bears the unhappy distinction of having the world's highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the average Sydneysider, this dubious honour might seem unfair -- particularly when most of us wouldn't call our lifestyles extravagant or luxurious.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the world stage, Australia is responsible for 1.4 per cent of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions -- or about 27.2 tonnes of greenhouse gas per person. Inside the country, 50 per cent</p><p>of greenhouse gas comes from making stationery energy, such as the electricity which powers our homes and industries, and 13 per cent comes from energy for transport, such as the petrol in our cars.</p><p>That's some 387 million tonnes of emissions out of 565 produced each year, using the 2004 figures.</p><p>The average Australian home, according to calculations by climate change solutions group Easy Being Green, puts out about 11 tonnes of greenhouse gas per annum. So how does an average Sydney home stack up?</p><p>A day with the Westons shows where we run up our greenhouse gas bill -- and also illustrates that the humble home is only part of the problem.</p><p>Brad Weston is a finance director with a major property consultant firm.</p><p>''[Reducing emissions] isn't at the forefront of our thinking all the time, but as opportunities arise, we are replacing our lightbulbs with energy-efficient ones, for example,'' he says. ''As the opportunity or circumstances change we rethink the way we can do things.''</p><p>The 42-year-old starts most days early with a 5am drive from Cherrybrook to the gym, which is 10 minutes away at Pennant Hills. After he gets home, the family has breakfast together, then Brad's wife, Ban, drives Dani, 10, and Talia, 7, to school before getting started on her own work day. Ban, an organisational psychologist, usually works from home but drives her four-cylinder BMW into the city about three times a week to see clients. Brad drives his Ford Fairmont to the bus stop 2km away for a bus into the city where he works.</p><p>Using the online Australian Greenhouse Calculator to estimate the greenhouse impact of running their two-storey home and two cars puts the Westons above the average of 11 tonnes of greenhouse gas per annum.</p><p>It's a figure that's skewed because Ban has an office at home, pushing up energy use in the day. Ban says she was surprised at the carbon emissions from running their household but running an office from home would contribute to the high figure. \"I think that's going to impact on it a lot,\" she says. \"But I also have to use my car a lot.\"</p><p>Neither Brad nor Ban describe themselves as \"greenies\", although Brad says that he is \"becoming more aware\", mostly as a result of the growing attention given to the issue in the media.</p><p>\"It's an issue that I think about a lot in terms of our kids in the future,\"Ban says.</p><p>\"It alarms me a bit. Being on the road brings it home more than anything else - just the pollution you see.\"</p><p>Chief executive of Easy Being Green Paul Gilding says much of Australia's high per-capita emissions are the result of industry. \"About 20 per cent of emissions in Australia come out of the home and personal driving - the things under your personal control - though that doesn't mean that's all you are responsible for because you are buying things that require CO2 to be made,\" he says.</p><p>However, Gilding believes that despite our highest-polluter per capita tag, Australians are generally very aware when it comes to the environment.</p><p>\"I've worked in Europe a lot so I know that Australians are among the most environmental consumers in the world,\" he says. \"What we are missing in Australia has been government and business action to mobilise that belief that people have into action. The most important thing we have to do is put a price on carbon so that people are rewarded for acting.\"</p><p>. Appliance calculations made using Energy Australia's Small Appliance Calculator.

There will be fines of up to $100,000 for any breaches.</p><p>The decision by the Forest Practices Authority to crack down on forest burns was welcomed by the Australia Medical Association.</p><p>Of particular concern to the AMA has been the issue of new high-intensity forest fires being lit when smoke haze from previous burns is still lingering.</p><p>``Patients are much more sophisticated and they know what's what, and I don't think they're prepared to put up with the smoke any more -- and quite rightly so,'' said AMA Tasmanian president Professor Haydn Walters.</p><p>``You can't keep lighting these fires day after day; you've just got to back off and let the smoke clear, whereas what we've seen this year is the haze begins, but nobody backs off and it just builds up day after day after day.''</p><p>Forestry Tasmania has also reacted to criticism from wine growers about the impact of forest smoke on the grape harvest.</p><p>It has agreed to consult with the wine industry about the timing and location of fires, so that smoke taint does not affect picked grape loads.</p><p>On Wednesday, further evidence of a weather change in the Government's seemingly unrelenting solidarity with the most red-necked elements of the forestry industry came with the decision by Primary Industries Minister David Llewellyn to impose tougher controls on chemical spraying.</p><p>Mr Llewellyn announced that, after years of public outcry by communities where homes and schools border tree plantations, aerial and ground spraying of pesticides within 100m of residential property would now be illegal.</p><p>Similar exclusion zones where chemical spraying is prohibited will also be established around schools, water bodies and catchments.</p><p>Like the proposed forest-fire weather guidelines, the new chemical spraying rules sound like common sense.</p><p>Many would rightly wonder why they had not been introduced earlier if they can so easily be proposed now and immediately win the support of conservative groups such as the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association.</p><p>The answer is that community pressure is a powerful force.</p><p>It is impossible not to see these welcome, if overdue, moves as anything but clear evidence that community angst and unrest -- not to mention political agitation -- is starting to hit home in the highest levels of the Government.</p><p>But, before community and environmental groups who have agitated for such changes become too euphoric, it is worth also looking at the contradictory signals circulating through the political airwaves this week.</p><p>The biggest was the release of the strange $15 million ``sovereign risk'' agreement on Monday, signed four months earlier between the State Government and Gunns over wood to be supplied to its planned $2 billion pulp mill and adjacent wood-fired power plant.</p><p>Despite what the Tasmanian Greens claim, there is nothing bizarre at all about the existence of such an agreement in the commercial world.</p><p>It effectively agrees that the state Treasury will pay compensation of a maximum of $15 million over 20 years to Gunns, if political decisions taken by the State Government to restrict logging prevent Forestry Tasmania from meeting its contract to supply Gunns with a set amount of wood for the pulp mill.</p><p>But what is strange is the timing and value of the sovereign risk agreement.</p><p>Why release it now, four months after it has been signed? Why is it for $15 million, which appears to bear no relation to the value of the contracted wood to be supplied?</p><p>There are some indications that the Government has reverted to type over this sovereign risk deal and tried, as so often has happened in the past, to hide its existence from the public.</p><p>Even now, it may only have been forced to release details of the agreement this week because it was about to turn up elsewhere. Exactly how and where it would have been unveiled is not clear.</p><p>It could be that the $15 million deal will be referred to as a liability in the upcoming June 12 state Budget. Or it might have been uncovered in a Freedom of Information request or during the June estimates sessions, when departments and their ministers are quizzed by opposition politicians about their budgets and deals.</p><p>However, another interesting option is the possibility that, in the current tight global credit market, Gunns may have to announce a capital-raising offer -- either via a rights issue or a share plan -- to partly finance its pulp mill.</p><p>Such an offer would need to provide financial security about the guaranteed safety of funds raised and effectively lent to Gunns for its massive project.</p><p>It may be that the sovereign risk deal, besides its compensatory effect, also effectively confers on Gunns the ``protection'' of the Tasmanian Government's own current triple-A credit rating from Moodys, allowing it to borrow funds at a cheaper interest rate or capital raised to be offered with more investor confidence.</p><p>Not quite a government guarantee, but close to it.</p><p>Either way, some better explanation from the Government and Treasurer Michael Aird of the deal's intent would have been welcome and, indeed, should have been provided.</p><p>So too would some explanation about why 25 documents -- held within the Department of Economic Development relating to the Government's well-advanced plans to fund the private pulp mill's $65 million water supply pipeline -- could not be made publicly available.</p><p>A Freedom of Information request to obtain this information this week received a blanket refusal on the grounds the information was commercial-in-confidence and formed part of protected information provided to the Government's inner Cabinet.</p><p>Increasingly around Australia, both arguments are being used as a form of obfuscation by governments seeking to prevent the public using FOI laws to discover what is actually going on behind the thick walls and closed doors of executive government.</p><p>The problem is, as Michael McKinnon, Australia's leading FOI media exponent told a packed lecture at the University of Tasmania on Thursday, these excuses are usually used as a cover-up.</p><p>``Where you get this sort of government secrecy [in relation to FOI requests], you can almost always guarantee that there is a sweetheart deal going on,'' McKinnon said bluntly this week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Twenty homes were evacuated as a forest fire burned out of control near Motueka in the north of New Zealand's South Island, Radio New Zealand reported yesterday. It said the fire had engulfed around 20sq km of a forestry block of radiata pine. One hundred firefighters were battling the blaze, backed by four helicopters, 12 fire engines, six water tankers and five bulldozers. </p><p>Pornography sentences LOS ANGELES. Three US-based members of an international child pornography ring that used the Internet to transmit pictures of children being sexually molested were sentenced to long jail terms in San Jose yesterday. The ring had members as far afield as Australia, Finland and Canada, investigators said. Ronald Riva, 38, of Greenfield, California, was sentenced to 30 years in prison; David Tank, 35, of Cheney, Washington, to 19 years and seven months; and Christopher Saemisch, 38, of Lawrence, Kansas, to 11 years. Suicide organs donated NEW YORK. A controversial American doctor who assists terminally ill people to commit suicide said yesterday he planned to offer organs harvested from his suicide patients to people who need transplants. Retired pathologist Dr Jack Kevorkian said the first organs, most likely lungs and a heart, would be donated on a first-come, first-serve basis. Algerians vote again ALGIERS. Millions of Algerians, rocked by a recent series of massacres and years of bloodletting, voted yesterday in local elections that the Government says will complete the establishment of a democracy. But for Algerians it was their third election in under two years and they appeared to have abandoned hope that the poll will end the nearly six-year-old civil strife that has killed more than 65,000 people. More executives arrested TOKYO. Police have arrested three Mitsubishi Motors Corp executives on charges of making illegal payments to suspected racketeers, the eighth such case against a major Japanese company so far this year. An assistant managing director of Mitsubishi, Mr Atsushi Ueba, and two other executives are suspected of funnelling more than Y9million ($A106,000) to `sokaiya' racketeers over the past two years. Sexual harassment charges WELLINGTON. Eleven New Zealand Navy staff face disciplinary charges for sexual harassment of a woman sailor on a Navy frigate during patrol duties in the Persian Gulf, in a case seen as a landmark for sexual harassment in the NZ armed forces. Larissa Turner, 21, left the NZ Navy in March, 1996, after alleging she was verbally and physically harassed continually during her six-month tour of sea duty on HMNZS Wellington. She said she was commonly grabbed by her buttocks and breasts and subjected to indecent suggestions. Minister dismissed PORT MORESBY. Papua New Guinea's new government has suffered its first casualty with the dismissal from office for misconduct of the Minister for Education, and former top public servant, Mr Gabriel Dusava. Mr Dusava, elected to Parliament in PNG's June elections, was found guilty by a leadership tribunal recently of 17 counts of misconduct while in his former post as Secretary for Foreign Affairs. The charges related to money he paid himself as advances on salary. Fires worsen haze JAKARTA. New fires are adding to the haze which has covered Indonesia and large parts of South-East Asia for the past three months, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Sarwono Kusumaaatmadja, said yesterday. Farmers who believed mistakenly that sporadic rainfalls in some areas meant the rainy season had started were clearing their fields with slash-and-burn methods to prepare them for planting, Mr Sarwono said. Reports said new blazes had flared up in various provinces of Sumatra and Kalimantan in recent days. Fiji says sorry LONDON. The Fijian Prime Minister, Mr Sitiveni Rabuka, went to Windsor Castle on Wednesday and presented Queen Elizabeth with a whale's tooth by way of apology for a military coup that transformed Fiji into a republic 10 years ago and ousted her as its head of state. Buckingham Palace said the Queen accepted Mr Rabuka's apology, and the whale's tooth, and that the two had 30 minutes of `the most cordial and friendly talks'. UN vote on Iraqi bans UNITED NATIONS. The United States and Britain have given up their demand to impose immediate travel sanctions against Iraq and instead proposed a UN Security Council resolution that prepares for new measures. The new resolution would require another Security Council vote before any sanctions would go into effect, as France and Russia have insisted. The measures would bar travel abroad by certain Iraqi officials except for diplomatic purposes. Jackson's brother jailed NEW YORK. The Reverend Jesse Jackson's half brother has been sentenced to life in prison for laundering drug profits for a street gang and hiring its members to kill former business partners. Noah Robinson was sentenced yesterday. He was convicted by a federal jury last year on racketeering, drug conspiracy and murder-for-hire charges that stemmed from a federal investigation into a gang that controlled drug trafficking on Chicago's South Side in the 1970s and 1980s. Human rights neglected PHNOM PENH. Amnesty International accused yesterday the Cambodian Government of gross neglect in protecting human rights, saying its commitment amounted to nothing more than an empty promise. In its harshest criticism yet, the London-based organisation blasted the Government for its failure to investigate scores of alleged abuses since 1993, especially following July's violent overthrow of co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P89-SSR0-TXN5-T3CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NHLDAU-4yhwucqz2fc16lnh0c4n</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NHLDAU1997</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314240</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newcastle Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 24, 1997 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Computer &amp;

This is not a business-as-usual scenario, this is a disaster scenario,\" the Minister for Environment, Mr Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, said of the way the fires have exposed flaws in land-use policies, the legal system and disaster-response capability.</p><p>Mr Sarwono, an advocate of political and bureaucratic reform, has always been seen as the out-gunned good guy when it came to defending the environment against the two-pronged assault of population pressures and politically influential companies. Now, with Indonesia facing intense criticism from its neighbours, the minister may have won just the lever he needs to push through some new monitoring procedures and more serious scrutiny of land use.</p><p>But before the Government has to confront the economic and social complexities of slowing down the conversion of up to 300,000 hectares of land a year for new agriculture, it has up to 176 opportunities to demonstrate its new environmental awareness - the number of plantation, timber and construction companies that have been identified as possible users of fire to clear land despite the unusually long dry season. They all have 15 days to defend themselves before various government agencies can scrap licences, levy damages and encourage financiers to turn off the flow of capital.</p><p>Close analysis of the fires shows that an unusually large number break out in the morning, when land clearance work begins, and remarkably few have occurred in protected forest areas, despite starting in nearby areas that have been approved for commercial land use.</p><p>For more than a decade Indonesia has promised to stop the fires at their source as its neighbours have become perturbed at the trans-border pollution threat that became reality this week.</p><p>But no serious attempt was made to link the burning to land ownership until May this year, when satellite images of fires were manually brought together with various land-use maps.</p><p>Then last Friday week, just days after Mr Soeharto gave his clear stamp of approval to a new approach, Mr Sarwono called in the country's new generation - well educated young mapping specialists, who cut across the boundaries of the old departmental rivalries which often strangle reform projects in Indonesia.</p><p>Over the weekend, volunteers from non-government organisations worked with government officials to create a makeshift control centre, where computer-generated maps can immediately highlight who owns the land where fires have started.</p><p>Mr Sarwono says he called company executives to his house to demonstrate how their anonymity as arsonists was finally over. \"He had to admit. He couldn't run away any more,\" he recalls with a grin about one sheepish corporate heavy.</p><p>THE FIRES: HOW BAD CAN IT GET?</p><p>The Cause</p><p>* Long dry season (2 months longer than usual El Nino impact)</p><p>* Excessive land clearing by fire</p><p>The Impact</p><p>* 8 Indonesian airports closed</p><p>* 1,000 flights disrupted</p><p>* Health threat to 20 million Indonesians</p><p>* Evacuation plans in Indonesia and Malaysia</p><p>* Diplomatic embarassment for Indonesia</p><p>* Severe pollution in Singapore and Malaysia</p><p>The Solution</p><p>* Better weather forecasting</p><p>* Satellite monitoring of spot fires</p><p>* Sanctions on companies</p><p>* New land clearing methods</p><p>The Geography</p><p>The fires are in central and southern Kalimantan 1 (affects Singapore) 2 and central Sumatra 3 (affects Malaysia) 4 and have been developing gradually over 3 months.

But it is likely to flare again this morning.</p><p>\"Fires in the Somersby area continue to cause concern. Fire brigades are working hard to stop the further spread of this front, along Wisemans Ferry Road.\"</p><p>Yesterday afternoon, about 200 firefighters and 18 units moved into the Somersby area near Gosford.</p><p>Two houses were burnt in Mt White, along with an NRMA depot which included a service station.</p><p>The Central Coast was isolated after rail and road services were cut. Both the highway and the freeway were closed after police described the freeway as a \"tunnel of flame\". Train services were cut from Hornsby to Gosford as the fires in the Hawkesbury region spread and phone lines to the Central Coast were jammed.</p><p>Those evacuated from homes, retirement villages and youth centres flocked to the Central Coast Leagues Club last night to wait out the emergency. A spokeswoman for the club said arrangements were being made to accommodate the evacuees at the club overnight and that many people in the area had offered the use of their homes. Local residents and charities were supplying bedding for the evacuees.</p><p>* Firefighters late last night hoped to bring under control a blaze which had destroyed 800 hectares of the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park.</p><p>The fire, which started at Cottage Point at 4.30 yesterday afternoon, was thought to have been deliberately lit.</p><p>National Parks and Wildlife spokesman Mr Michael McFadyen said hazard reduction last year had slowed the fire's progress to the north and south and the main campaign would be fought to the east, with backburning near McCarrs Creek Road.</p><p>Early this morning, the Ku-ring-gai fire had spotted east across to Bayview where it was burning in the Katandra Bushland Sanctuary, between Cabbage Tree and Mona Vale Roads.</p><p>NORTH COAST: The entire north-eastern corner of NSW was declared a fire emergency area yesterday as the number of uncontrolled fires jumped to 68.</p><p>A Grafton fire control spokesman, Mr Laurie Orel, said a small amount of overnight rain had done little more than hamper bush firefighters who were backburning through the night.</p><p>The Bundjalung National Park fire, which began shortly after Christmas, had joined with another already in the Doubleduke State Forest and destroyed more than 20,000 hectares.</p><p>The Banyabba fire was running over 25,000 hectares and Mr Orel said while fire activity was stable, forecast high winds would cause more trouble for firefighters.</p><p>By midday the temperature was 35 degrees and Mr Orel said he was expecting similar conditions today. Police were having difficulty finding \"alternative dwellers\" living in remote areas of bushland, he said.</p><p>NEWCASTLE: Half a dozen major fires are surrounding Newcastle, while a fire at Singleton has burnt thousands of hectares. The main fires are at Wollombi, Medowie, Williamtown and Nelson Bay, West Wallsend, Barnsley, Martinsville and Belmont North.</p><p>A police spokeswoman said there was concern for Killingworth and Barnsley, where a halfway house with 10 severely disabled persons in Bendigo Street had to be evacuated.</p><p>Campers in the Allynbrook and Dungog areas were evacuated, while residents of the Banksia Grove retirement village were evacuated.</p><p>SOUTH COAST: The NSW Fire Brigade confirmed last night that three people were trapped in a house in Yates Road, Bangor. Fire authorities said a water tanker had reported the three could not escape the house and required help.</p><p>A Fire Brigade spokesman did not know whether they had been successfully freed from the house.</p><p>Tents were on fire last night as a blaze swept through a camping site at Dolphin Point, south of Ulladulla. There were no reports of injuries. The Runnyford fire between Mogo and Batemans Bay has spread claiming 15,000 hectares of the Mogo State Forest.</p><p>Fire last night continued to threaten the western parts of Batemans Bay through to the south of Surf Beach, where property was damaged.</p><p>CENTRAL WEST: About 150 firefighters battled a blaze which has burnt about 1,000 hectares in the Hervey Ranges of the north-west of the Cabone Shire, near Yeoval.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: Photographs by: James Alcock, Patrick Cummings, Elizabeth Dobbie, Sahlan Hayes, Dallas Kilponen, Andrew Meares, Steven Siewert, Andrew Taylor, Greg White.
