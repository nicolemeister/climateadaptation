Don't let your dogs near it, it will kill them',\" Ms Turner said.</p><p>\"I'm heading back to the car to get the leads for my dogs when this other lady's dog comes flying forward and it came off its lead and made a b-line for Ralph.</p><p>\"He he was running away from the dog, but it was was too late and it grabbed him by his back leg and smashed Ralph's head into the ground.</p><p>Ms Turner said she thought the dog was an American staffy but claimed the owner told her it was a pitbull and she couldn't make it release Ms Turner's dog.</p><p>In trying to save Ralph, Ms Turner was also bitten by the other dog, sustaining two puncture wounds on her thigh.</p><p>Ralph suffered a dislocated hip and many lacerations as well as broken tendons and ligament, muscle, and nerve damage; he may still lose his leg if he cannot fully recover.</p><p>Ms Turner attempted to report the attack at the Ballarat Police Station but said the police there were not interested in helping her.</p><p>Police at Ballarat confirmed to The Courier they were not currently investigating any dog attacks.</p><p>\"I called the council but they said there was nothing they can do either,\" she said.</p><p>\"DELWP fobbed me off as well; they took my details and said they would will it pass on to the council ranger, I have been hand-balled in circles.</p><p>\"I'm angry that the owner took that dog in a public place knowing it was dangerous, it could have been a child that was attacked, it could have been their face mauled off.\"</p><p>Another camper at Burrumbeet on Australia Day, who wished not to be identified, said they would not camp there again on an event weekend.</p><p>The woman and her family were planning to spend the weekend camping but dangerous behaviour and fighting ruined their trip.</p><p>\"We went to bed at about 10pm and the at about about 2am a car, don't know how fast, flew along the dirt road and then two more cars possibly chasing it.</p><p>\"There were kids asleep in tents and swags everywhere and I was really worried.</p><p>She said she could hear people fighting all night and spent her night worried for her family's safety.</p><p>\"It was feral, there was a speed boat out on the water at 2am and I thought someone would get killed; I thought it was crazy,\" she said.</p><p>The woman and Ms Turner were left frustrated with the lack of supervision and responsibility authorities provided at the lake.\u00e2\u20ac\u2039</p><p>\"Maybe there needs to be some monitoring or something done, it's a shame it has to come to that,\" Ms Turner said.</p><p>\"You would think adults would be responsible enough to have a drink and enjoy camping without all of this.\"</p><p>\"I think before they provide supervision, they will just ban camping,\" the other camper said.</p><p>\"People need to learn to look after it and leave it as a place people can go and enjoy it.\"</p><p>Who is responsible for managing the Lake Burrumbeet Campgrounds?</p><p>Following the damage and refuse left behind at Lake Burrumbeet on Australia Day, The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and City of Ballarat have both distanced themselves from management responsibilities of the area.</p><p>DELWP are officially responsible for the management of Lake Burrumbeet after City of Ballarat handed over management in 2015, except in the case of the caravan park and the racecourse.</p><p>City of Ballarat Director of Infrastructure and Environment Terry Demeo said council have no plans to take back over management of the lake campgrounds despite recent events.</p><p>\"Following extensive negotiations with the Crown, Council resolved to relinquish its committee of management status over Lake Burrumbeet in 2014, and the handover to DELWP was completed in 2015,\" he said.</p><p>\"At this stage, Council has no plans to seek the reversal of that decision.\"</p><p>While DELWP are responsible for management of the campgrounds at the lake, Forest Fire Management Victoria Midlands District Manager, Jasmine Filmer said decisions about the area are not made by DELWP alone.</p><p>\"Management decisions are made in consultation with partners and key stakeholders,\" she said.</p><p>\"DELWP manages Lake Burrumbeet in partnership with the City of Ballarat, the Wathaurung Aboriginal Corporation, Fisheries Victoria and the Glenelg Hopkins CMA.\"</p><p>Ms Filmer said enforecmet of the campground rules are enforced but it is the responsibility of campers in the area to treat each other, the provided facilities, and the land with respect.</p><p>\"Appropriate use of the lake is guided by legislation and council local laws with officers from DELWP, Victoria Police, Fisheries Victoria, Game Management Authority, and City of Ballarat monitoring the lake area,\" she said.</p><p>\"DELWP maintains the toilet facilities, but does not provide bins so campers are expected to take their rubbish home with them.\"</p><p>\"DELWP's authorised officers monitor this camp site on a regular basis.\"\u00e2\u20ac\u2039</p><p>Lake left trashed\u00e2\u20ac\u2039</p><p>Rangers were left astounded by the condition of the Lake Burrumbeet campsite following Australia Day celebrations.</p><p>Rangers attended the site on Monday to find alcohol bottles and cans, food packaging, syringes and other waste strewn all over the camping ground.</p><p>A Forest Fire Management Victoria crew were tasked with cleaning up the refuse and bagged up all the rubbish before filling seven trailers with dumped trash.</p><p>FFM Victoria Midlands District Manager Jasmine Filmer said she was offended by the state the site was left in and the lack of respect shown by those who were there.</p><p>\"This behaviour not only has a negative effect for fellow holiday-makers but also for those left with the job of cleaning up after an obviously wild weekend,\" she said.</p><p>\"It has taken an entire work day for a four-person crew to clean up the rubbish left at the site, which included general waste, bits of old carpet and syringes.\"</p><p>As well as the rubbish, the facilities at the camp site were damaged with crews having to return for repairs.</p><p>\"We have never seen so much rubbish left behind after a long weekend at any campsite in the Midlands District, despite our repeated efforts to encourage campers to pack up their rubbish and take it home,\" Ms Filmer said.</p><p>\"In addition, a Variable Message Sign located at the entry to the park showing important safety messaging for camp users leading into an extremely hot weekend, was deliberately vandalised, a serious criminal offence.</p><p>\"It is an affront to our crews to have to clean up and fix up after willful and lazy revelers.</p><p>\"The outcome of such disrespect is that our crew then becomes unavailable for more important forestry and fuel management activities.</p><p>\"It is visually offensive, can be dangerous to humans and wildlife, and is damaging to the environment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Wet periods in autumn, though, curbed hazard-reduction burning to half the year-earlier totals in NSW and curtailed it in Victoria. Authorities stress a significant rain event may yet push fire risks for the coming season back towards more typical levels but note there is little sign of such a development.</p><p>High-pressure systems have dominated southern Australia, nudging rain-bearing systems south of the continent.</p><p>Barring some unexpected instability, July will join last month as among Australia's driest. Nationally, last month was the second-driest June since standard data began in 1910. Rainfall was barely a third of average, the Bureau of Meteorology said.</p><p>Victoria had its driest June, NSW was the driest in 15 years and the Murray Darling Basin posted its lowest rainfall totals since 1986.</p><p>\"It very much seems to be centring on the border between Victoria and NSW,\" Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre, said of the rainfall deficits.</p><p>Winter-to-date rainfall levels have been \"very much below average\" for most of southern Australia, bureau data shows.</p><p>Up until June, Forest Fire Management Victoria crews conducted 351 burns over 113,172 hectares. \"The wet winter and spring conditions proved difficult, however our prioritisation of burns based on risk has resulted in the statewide risk being maintained at 2015-16 levels,\" said Stephanie Rotarangi, the agency's chief fire officer.</p><p>The key influence behind this relatively dry winter is far to the south. A positive phase in the so-called Southern Annular Mode marks a polewards contraction of the westerly winds belt towards Antarctica.</p><p>As the bureau notes, such a phase marked the \"big dry\" of 1997 -2010. High-pressure systems that normally sit further north track across more southerly parts of Australia, blocking rain-bearing cold fronts.</p><p>In June, average mean sea level pressure readings were at record highs for many parts of southern Australia, including all but one site in South Australia and all but three in Victoria. As the bureau noted: \"Mean sea level pressure over southern Australia has been increasing in winter over recent decades. This pattern is consistent with future climate change projections for the Australian region.\"</p><p>Dr Thornton said that, along with trends towards drier winters for southern Australia, warmer-than-average temperatures during July to September were also the new norm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc6vwtusepqwjc1w527f6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2W-G741-JD34-V46F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Don't let your dogs near it, it will kill them',\" Ms Turner said.</p><p>\"I'm heading back to the car to get the leads for my dogs when this other lady's dog comes flying forward and it came off its lead and made a b-line for Ralph.</p><p>\"He he was running away from the dog, but it was was too late and it grabbed him by his back leg and smashed Ralph's head into the ground.</p><p>Ms Turner said she thought the dog was an American staffy but claimed the owner told her it was a pitbull and she couldn't make it release Ms Turner's dog.</p><p>In trying to save Ralph, Ms Turner was also bitten by the other dog, sustaining two puncture wounds on her thigh.</p><p>Ralph suffered a dislocated hip and many lacerations as well as broken tendons and ligament, muscle, and nerve damage; he may still lose his leg if he cannot fully recover.</p><p>Ms Turner attempted to report the attack at the Ballarat Police Station but said the police there were not interested in helping her.</p><p>Police at Ballarat confirmed to The Courier they were not currently investigating any dog attacks.</p><p>\"I called the council but they said there was nothing they can do either,\" she said.</p><p>\"DELWP fobbed me off as well; they took my details and said they would will it pass on to the council ranger, I have been hand-balled in circles.</p><p>\"I'm angry that the owner took that dog in a public place knowing it was dangerous, it could have been a child that was attacked, it could have been their face mauled off.\"</p><p>Another camper at Burrumbeet on Australia Day, who wished not to be identified, said they would not camp there again on an event weekend.</p><p>The woman and her family were planning to spend the weekend camping but dangerous behaviour and fighting ruined their

speed boat out on the water at 2am and I thought someone would get killed; I thought it was crazy,\" she said.</p><p>The woman and Ms Turner were left frustrated with the lack of supervision and responsibility authorities provided at the lake.\u00e2\u20ac\u2039</p><p>\"Maybe there needs to be some monitoring or something done, it's a shame it has to come to that,\" Ms Turner said.</p><p>\"You

District Manager Jasmine Filmer said she was offended by the state the site was left in and the lack of respect shown by those who were there.</p><p>\"This behaviour not only has a negative effect for

rubbish left at the site, which included general waste, bits of old carpet and syringes.\"</p><p>As well as the rubbish, the facilities at the camp site were damaged with crews having to return for repairs.</p><p>\"We have never seen so much rubbish left behind after a long weekend at any campsite in the Midlands District, despite our repeated efforts to encourage campers to pack up their rubbish and take it home,\" Ms Filmer said.</p><p>\"In addition, a Variable Message Sign located at the entry to the park showing important safety messaging for camp users leading into an extremely hot weekend, was deliberately vandalised, a serious criminal offence.</p><p>\"It is an affront to our crews to have to clean up and fix up after willful and lazy revelers.</p><p>\"The outcome of such disrespect is that our crew then becomes unavailable for more important forestry and fuel management activities.</p><p>\"It is visually offensive, can be dangerous to humans and wildlife, and is

beat the state's searing weekend heat, but it wasn't enough to help everyone keep their cool.</p><p>More than 50 volunteer firefighters were needed to contain a large forest fire south of Adelaide yesterday as temperatures soared.</p><p>The fire began just after 4pm in grassland and a tree plantation at Tooperang, near Goolwa, and was burning out of control before 11 CFS crews attended.</p><p>Water bombers and aerial surveillance aircraft provided support from above for the crews as they battled the fire in temperatures in the mid-30Cs.</p><p>SA Health said that nine people presented to emergency departments across the state yesterday with heat-related illness, three of who were admitted for further treatment.</p><p>This was down from another 16 people who sought treatment on Saturday, out of which six were admitted to hospital.</p><p>Temperatures reached 47C at Maree in the state's north at 4.07pm, with 46.6C recorded at Oodnadatta, 46.1 in Coober Pedy and Woomera and 46C at Moomba.</p><p>In Adelaide, it reached a sweltering 44.1C at Kent Town at 1.21pm, although the West Terrace reading peaked at 41.8C at 11.53am.</p><p>Cloud cover was expected to keep last night's minimum to a fairly high 23C, before a cool change with showers and a maximum of 28C forecast for today and fine weather in the mid-to-high 20s for the rest of the working week.</p><p>While some of the events at this year's Crush Festival at Adelaide Hills wineries were cancelled because of the extreme weather, those which went ahead still found plenty of patrons in search of a refreshing drink and shady vista.</p><p>Water activities remained a popular way to beat the heat.</p><p>At Moana Beach, Rachel Glendinning was celebrating her birthday with her daughter Scarlett, 2, and friends Jade and Adam Hicks, with their one-year-old daughter Sierra and son Brayden, 5.</p><p>In the northern suburbs, those with the energy to dance got to cool off with a dip between tracks with a DJ at Waterworld Aquatic Centre.</p><p>Waterslides and an inflatable obstacle course added to the activities for a big turnout at the Marion Outdoor Pool open day, where Sally Haynes and her sons Chaen, 8, and Jack, 12, joined the fun.</p><p>Although The Piece Project street art and music event at Longview Vineyard in Macclesfield was postponed due to the extreme weather, its star attraction, British DJ Norman Jay, instead played a Sunset Session last night for a sellout dance crowd on the River Torrens pontoon in Elder Park.</p><p>SEVEN-DAY FORECAST FOR ADELAIDE [PAGE

whipper snipping - it's too late - all you're going to be doing is starting a bushfire.\"</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services has issued heat health alerts for the Mallee, Wimmera, Northern Country, North Central and North East district with most of Victoria set for temperatures of more than 40 degrees.</p><p>Dehydration, lack of airflow, sun exposure and hot and crowded conditions can cause heat stress or heat related illness.</p><p>Symptoms include deterioration in existing medical conditions, heat rash, heat cramps, dizziness and fainting, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc73h8dzrwnkp27vbs78z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3Y-3FH1-F0J6-J44F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environmental pollution</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X9G</classCode><className>POPULATION DENSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

whipper snipping - it's too late - all you're going to be doing is starting a bushfire.\"</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services has issued heat health alerts for the Mallee, Wimmera, Northern Country, North Central and North East district with most of Victoria set for temperatures of more than 40 degrees.</p><p>Dehydration, lack of airflow, sun exposure and hot and crowded conditions can cause heat stress or heat related illness.</p><p>Symptoms include deterioration in existing medical conditions, heat rash, heat cramps, dizziness and fainting, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc73h8e79qwpi9cjuk78z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3Y-3FH1-F0J6-J43V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environmental pollution</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X9G</classCode><className>POPULATION DENSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He was especially gifted at making people new to the area welcome, whether it be new employees in the Bundaleer Forest in the years prior to 1995, or more recently visitors to Bundaleer recreation grounds or the Jamestown Visitor Resource Centre, which he frequently manned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His extensive involvement in agricultural spans five decades, taking on leadership positions, stewardship and judging at local, regional and state level. He was Jamestown Show president in 1977, 1978 and 1986, Patron from 2003-2008, and member of the Cattle Committee until his passing. He was granted Honorary Life Membership in 1997.</p><p>He also served as President of the Northern Agricultural Shows Association from 1984-86 and was chairman of the Agricultural Societies Council from 1993 to 1996. As a breeder and exhibitor of Red Poll Cattle, John left his mark at the Royal Adelaide Show, Sydney Easter Show, Wodonga Show and Sale, and countless country shows.</p><p>But for John, these successes were far outweighed by friendships he made, such was his love of life and people. He hosted many visitors to his Maleer Red Poll Stud, including international visitors on Australian Cattle Industry tours. He took on presidency of both federal and state councils of the Red Poll Society and devoted more than 45 years at committee level, recently acknowledged with life membership. John had extensive involvement in farm industry organisations, serving on numerous State and regional committees of the South Australian Farmers Federation, and its predecessor, United Farmers &amp; Graziers.</p><p>He was a member of the body that set up the Jamestown Truck Wash Facility and was also part of a lobby group which successfully retained Jamestown Hospital's acute services in the 1980s. John was also involved in the organics industry, after he and his son Chris achieved certification as organic and biodynamic farmers in 1991.</p><p>Sport was an important part of John's life. He played football, tennis, golf and table tennis and in more recent years played bowls. John was involved with the Bundaleer Sport and Recreation Association from its formation as the Bundaleer Progress Association in 1962. He helped with the volunteer cropping program which funded the establishment of tennis courts, a cricket oval and the Bundaleer Hall adjacent the Bundaleer Picnic Ground. In the last 15 years, John and Veronica have been the contact for hundreds of visitors who have camped at the grounds and hired the facilities at Bundaleer.</p><p>John was also actively involved in the St James Catholic Church and was a supporter of greater interaction between the churches, as a member of the interdenominational group. John loved classical music and was extremely proud of his daughter Mary Jane's great talent for singing and was a regular at her gigs. He was a major contributor to planning and managing all seven music and art festivals held in the Bundaleer Forest between 1999 and 2013 and he chaired the 2011 event. The final Bundaleer Festival was held just months after the devastating forest fire. John was a key part of the campaign to replant the forest, save the local timber industry and ensure Australia's first plantation forest remained accessible by locals and visitors.</p><p>John was proud to be part of the community's efforts to secure ownership and control of the sport and recreation grounds and co-management of the Bundaleer Forest Picnic Ground. He had a great sense of humour and zest for life, loved steak, red wine and barbecues at Bundaleer. He was a highly social being and made enduring friendships through every facet of his life, whether at school, in cattle industry and show meetings, welcoming visitors to Bundaleer, or just stopping for a chat when shifting the cattle along the road with his beloved dog. He adored his community, his cattle, all things Bundaleer, and most of all, his family. John was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and he endured the rigorous treatment regime with his usual optimistic approach to life. With the loving care of Veronica and family he was able to stay at home until just days before his passing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLNNWS-doc74y62vn1rzm19pjbsmmq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLNNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWX-BPH1-JD34-V3P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That legal battle has already cost the union nearly $1.5 million in defence costs and the matter is not yet completed: it is still the subject of an appeal by the conservationists and Wilderness Society.</p><p>The blitzkrieg this week by Gunns Limited, Australia's biggest forestry company and the state's biggest private company, will serve only to escalate the horrida bella -- encouraging both sides to dig in even further and making the prospect of compromise in the forests even more remote.</p><p>Australian Greens leader and Tasmanian Senator Bob Brown -- one of 20 conservationists and forest protesters being sued by Gunns for $6.3 million for damaging its business and its reputation -- said on Wednesday after the Franklin Square protest in Hobart against the lawsuits: \"They can take every penny, they can take every peaceful night's sleep, they can take every home comfort [but] they will never stop me campaigning against their vile destruction of Tasmanian forests and its wildlife. Not ever. They misjudge we defenders of the forests.\"</p><p>CFMEU national assistant secretary Michael O'Connor said: \"Our members are sick and tired of the outrageous antics of the Green protesters which have resulted in working people in the forests not being able to earn a living, sometimes for months on end. We have had enough of it.\"</p><p>Both sides are trying to assume the moral high ground. The Greens and Wilderness Society repeatedly claim public opinion is on their side and that as much as 85 per cent of Australians want logging ended in old-growth native forests.</p><p>However, Gunns chief John Gay said this week, in justifying the decision to sue forest protesters: \"Gunns Limited and the majority of Tasmanians are sick and tired of the misleading information being peddled about our industry and our state.\"</p><p>The writs against the 20 individuals and groups involved in forest protests and campaigns against logging are an expression of the company's frustration at what it says has been years of disruption of its activities, the resulting financial loss and vilification of its standing and reputation. The writs cite a range of events and activities, from assault of an employee to sabotage of machinery and interference and disruption of company activities.</p><p>Experienced legal sources have expressed surprise the company would try to demonstrate it has been badly damaged by the forest protests, given that only four months ago it boasted a huge record profit of $105 million for the year, a 42 per cent increase on last year, and that this week its shares have been trading at an all-time high.</p><p>The State Government is staying well out of the legal fracas. It does not want to provide oxygen to the polemic pleadings of the Greens; to jeopardise plans or public support for a billion dollar pulp mill; or to compromise the sensitive negotiations with the Federal Government on a 170,000 hectare, $50 million expansion of state forest conservation reserves.</p><p>The Greens and their supporters say Gunns' legal action is nothing more than \"SLAPP writs\" -- an acronym for Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation -- aimed purely at depriving ordinary citizens of their right of free speech by intimidating them with legal action that will occupy a great deal of their time and attention and cost them a lot in legal and court expenses, whether or not the lawsuits are successful.</p><p>The CFMEU's Michael O'Connor -- who has been charged with disloyalty to the ALP for his stand against Mark Latham's controversial election promise to lock up 240,000ha of Tasmanian old-growth forest, preventing it from being logged -- says the environmentalists have brought the trouble on themselves.</p><p>When a group of conservationists disrupted logging in Victoria's Otway Range in 1999, the CFMEU responded by setting up a picket line across the only access road to the rainforest. The conservationists, backed by the Wilderness Society, subsequently sued 15 individual timber workers and a CFMEU official in the Victorian Supreme Court, alleging the protesters had been held hostage for five days, \"imprisoned\" behind the picket line. There were claims the protesters had been threatened, floodlights were trained on them at night and 44-gallon drums were banged to keep them awake.</p><p>The loggers then lodged counter-claims, suing the protesters for loss of income caused by the \"direct action\" of the environmentalists.</p><p>After years of delays, and evidence from 43 witnesses during a 64-day hearing, Judge David Ashley rejected the allegations of wrongful imprisonment and dismissed about 90 per cent of the hundreds of claims filed by the protesters. He did accept, though, that five protesters had suffered mental distress and awarded them more than $133,000 damages. The environmentalists are appealing the decision.</p><p>The Wilderness Society, meanwhile, quietly settled out of court on the counter suit and paid $45,000 to the contractors, effectively accepting that the protest action had caused them loss of income.</p><p>When the Gunns writs were issued this week, Bob Brown -- one of the \"Gunns 20\" as they are calling themselves -- said he would not be cowed by the company's \"power of destruction\" and accused Gunns of trying to \"hector\" the environmental movement into silence and submission while the \"chainsaws and poison\" destroy the forests and their wildlife.</p><p>Michael O'Connor, who heads the national forest workers section of the CFMEU, says the union backs Gunns' legal move. He says it is aimed at \"protecting the security of our members and the future of our members' families and the survival of timber communities and safety of the workers in the industry\", which he claims is jeopardised by the forest protests.</p><p>He says nobody had even considered Supreme Court action over the forest protests until the environmentalists initiated it against forest workers. \"They have sown the wind and now they will reap the whirlwind,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think it's ironic that Bob Brown encouraged the action against ordinary working people in the timber industry by Green activists -- and had no sympathy for the workers being sued -- and is now bleating because somebody else in the industry has decided to take action against him in the same Supreme Court. I don't think he's got much to complain about.\"</p><p>Still, the Greens are past masters at appealing to public sentiment and will milk every last drop of sympathy and emotion from the issue, which will have the effect of drawing the movement's support base closer together.</p><p>The Franklin River, the Wesley Vale pulp mill -- and now the bully from the big end of town trying to sue into submission those who assert their only motivation is to protect the heritage of the nation.</p><p>With the \"ordinary working folk\" on one side and the altruistic \"defenders of the forests\" on the other, John Gay has ignited a new shemozzle which will help keep the issue burning <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:indefinitely.waynecrawford@msn.com.au\">indefinitely.waynecrawford@msn.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-MER0412181019485224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEMERCURYLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4F20-TGS0-015H-9431-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1326\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>December 18, 2004 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GUNNS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>THE WILDERNESS SOCIETY \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0THE WILDERNESS SOCIETY\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GNS (ASX)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423310 LUMBER, PLYWOOD, MILLWORK &amp;

He was especially gifted at making people new to the area welcome, whether it be new employees in the Bundaleer Forest in the years prior to 1995, or more recently visitors to Bundaleer recreation grounds or the Jamestown Visitor Resource Centre, which he frequently manned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His extensive involvement in agricultural spans five decades, taking on leadership positions, stewardship and judging at local, regional and state level. He was Jamestown Show president in 1977, 1978 and 1986, Patron from 2003-2008, and member of the Cattle Committee until his passing. He was granted Honorary Life Membership in 1997.</p><p>He also served as President of the Northern Agricultural Shows Association from 1984-86 and was chairman of the Agricultural Societies Council from 1993 to 1996. As a breeder and exhibitor of Red Poll Cattle, John left his mark at the Royal Adelaide Show, Sydney Easter Show, Wodonga Show and Sale, and countless country shows.</p><p>But for John, these successes were far outweighed by friendships he made, such was his love of life and people. He hosted many visitors to his Maleer Red Poll Stud, including international visitors on Australian Cattle Industry tours. He took on presidency of both federal and state councils of the Red Poll Society and devoted more than 45 years at committee level, recently acknowledged with life membership. John had extensive involvement in farm industry organisations, serving on numerous State and regional committees of the South Australian Farmers Federation, and its predecessor, United Farmers &amp; Graziers.</p><p>He was a member of the body that set up the Jamestown Truck Wash Facility and was also part of a lobby group which successfully retained Jamestown Hospital's acute services in the 1980s. John was also involved in the organics industry, after he and his son Chris achieved certification as organic and biodynamic farmers in 1991.</p><p>Sport was an important part of John's life. He played football, tennis, golf and table tennis and in more recent years played bowls. John was involved with the Bundaleer Sport and Recreation Association from its formation as the Bundaleer Progress Association in 1962. He helped with the volunteer cropping program which funded the establishment of tennis courts, a cricket oval and the Bundaleer Hall adjacent the Bundaleer Picnic Ground. In the last 15 years, John and Veronica have been the contact for hundreds of visitors who have camped at the grounds and hired the facilities at Bundaleer.</p><p>John was also actively involved in the St James Catholic Church and was a supporter of greater interaction between the churches, as a member of the interdenominational group. John loved classical music and was extremely proud of his daughter Mary Jane's great talent for singing and was a regular at her gigs. He was a major contributor to planning and managing all seven music and art festivals held in the Bundaleer Forest between 1999 and 2013 and he chaired the 2011 event. The final Bundaleer Festival was held just months after the devastating forest fire. John was a key part of the campaign to replant the forest, save the local timber industry and ensure Australia's first plantation forest remained accessible by locals and visitors.</p><p>John was proud to be part of the community's efforts to secure ownership and control of the sport and recreation grounds and co-management of the Bundaleer Forest Picnic Ground. He had a great sense of humour and zest for life, loved steak, red wine and barbecues at Bundaleer. He was a highly social being and made enduring friendships through every facet of his life, whether at school, in cattle industry and show meetings, welcoming visitors to Bundaleer, or just stopping for a chat when shifting the cattle along the road with his beloved dog. He adored his community, his cattle, all things Bundaleer, and most of all, his family. John was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and he endured the rigorous treatment regime with his usual optimistic approach to life. With the loving care of Veronica and family he was able to stay at home until just days before his passing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLNNWS-doc74v2zd9tnesn43v53i5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLNNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVM-HCH1-F0J6-J0KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

RURAL Fire - to manage, through volunteers, fires in rural areas, including small towns, villages and hamlets.</p><p>Victorian UFU boss Peter Marshall did not respond- to The Weekly Times' calls for comment.</p><p>Volunteers warn any restructure- would strip the CFA of its surge capacity during major fires and potentially drive up the cost of the Fire Services Property Levy.</p><p>\"We rely on surge capacity from outer metropolitan areas,\" Kilmore CFA Captain Dave Williams said.</p><p>\"If you take out Bendigo, Ballarat, Shepparton and other cities, you'll also lose the volunteers.\" \"I don't think the community can afford it.\" Mr Williams said volunteers would reject the retained firefighters model. \"Volunteers in Victoria have rejected the NSW model before,\" he said.\"We're volunteers, so we don't get paid.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WeeklyTimes20170222WeeklyTimes3000227042723</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MXP-BWS1-F0JP-W2BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 22, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

Locals have told The Courier they understood the fire may have started along Sago Hill Road.</p><p>Ballarat CIU and the CFA are still working to pinpoint the fire's cause, and have so far been unable to rule out whether it was deliberately lit.</p><p>The Bunkers Hill fire crossed 134 hectares of land heading in a south-easterly direction towards Smythes Creek before being brought under control before the wind change pushed it towards Ballarat.</p><p>A number of houses and sheds were lost in the blaze.</p><p>Three people were taken to hospital as a result of the Bunkers Hill fire due to smoke inhalation, while three firefighters required assistance from paramedics, two for smoke inhalation and one with a 'severely lacerated hand'.</p><p>Evan Dower, who lives close to where the blaze began, in Greenhalghs Road, said in almost 20 years living in the area, he had never seen a fire like it.</p><p>\"We were working in the shed and the power went out, it was only me and my eldest son Luke who were around,\" Mr Dower said.</p><p>\"By the time we got back to the house, it was coming down at us.</p><p>\"Luke looked after the animals and rang the fire brigade and I tried to fire an arc around the house. We lost some sheds and machinery, I had to go to hospital with smoke inhalation.\"</p><p>Mr Dower said he initially heard that a tree had fallen onto a powerline.</p><p>\"I've never felt wind like it,\" he said. \"It was like being in a war zone, trees were falling and crashing all over the place.</p><p>\"I've lived here almost 20 years and I've never had to use the fire pump before, fortunately I was able to get it going, only thing that saved the house. The firey's, police, volunteers were absolutely unbelievable, the firey's were here all night</p><p>\"We lost two sheds, some quad bikes, motorbikes, splitters and lots of fences, probably about $30,000 but it could have been a lot worse.\"</p><p>CFA Region 15 operations manager Gavin Hope said, in all, four blazes took hold on Friday afternoon, which saw emergency warnings issued west of Learmonth and Mount Mercer while another blaze was detected at Mount Wallace.</p><p>\"The Learmonth blaze we believe was a result of a previous burn off, which was of no fault of the farmer and although Geelong is handling the Mount Mercer blaze, we believe it was something similar,\" he said.</p><p>\"We also had a small fire out at Mount Wallace, which was actually in the process in the being controlled and it jumped out of containment lines.</p><p>\"The Bunkers Hill blaze is still under investigation. We had an aircraft go up on Saturday to have a look at where it burned.\"</p><p>Mr Hope described the cooperation of all fires crews on the day as \"magnificent.\"</p><p>\"It was a mighty effort to stop it in its tracks, it moved very quickly,\" he said \"In all we had four incidents in the area and it did put a strain on our resources, but we managed to get enough trucks.</p><p>\"While the aircraft had been scaled back, we managed to get a helicopter just in time. The timing was impeccable. It was very sad to lose what we host, but there are a number of houses down there and without that help, it could have been much much worse.</p><p>\"It was an incredible wind, it was as though a mini-tornado blew through, dangerous fire conditions are around 41km/h, we were over 100km/h.\"</p><p>He also singled out for praise the efforts of crews from Bacchus Marsh and Maryborough and Forest Fire Management Victoria who continued to work over the weekend, particularly in the identification of dangerous trees.\"</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology said while there were no tornadoes recorded in the area, winds did gust as much as 85km/h around 2pm.</p><p>And people are being warned that another similar day can be expected on Friday with temperatures expected to reach the mid 20s and winds picking up again, however the next change is not expected until Saturday morning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc74qfxlxw0i8naw0s85i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSP-M6W1-JD34-V30C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Traffic accident</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>N621399OG</classCode><className>PARAMEDICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DO78</classCode><className>ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>N621399OG</classCode><className>PARAMEDICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Nowra's FFDI was the highest in 14 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wind gusts of 109km/h and 104km/h were recorded at Bellambi and Nowra, respectively, on Wednesday morning.</p><p>It has been almost two years since Bellambi had a wind gust that strong.</p><p>The vigorous west to northwesterly winds came ahead of a cold front, which was due to arrive on Wednesday night.</p><p>The dangers posed by the strong winds were compounded by temperatures that climbed as high as eight degrees above average for this time of the year.</p><p>A maximum of 25.6 degrees was recorded at Bellambi, it was 24.5 in Albion Park and 23.5 at Nowra.</p><p>A fire weather warning was issued for the Illawarra/Shoalhaven, Greater Sydney and Greater Hunter fire districts late-morning.</p><p>Total fire bans were also issued in those areas - the earliest bans of the season in almost a decade, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS).</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's NSW severe weather manager Simon Louis said the strong winds and dry conditions combined to cause very-high to severe fire danger across the Illawarra.</p><p>The lack of recent rainfall and \"very dry fuels\" also contributed to the severe fire danger conditions, Mr Louis said.</p><p>\"We haven't had a fire weather warning for the Illawarra in August since 2009, and that again comes back to the very dry lead-in we've had to this season and the very dry state that the fuels are in,\" he said.</p><p>While major fires burned in the Nowra and Ulladulla areas, fallen power lines did spark a blaze off Mount Brandon Road at Jerrara, west of Kiama, just before 9am.</p><p>RFS and Fire and Rescue NSW crews worked quickly to protect properties as gusty winds fanned the flames.</p><p>RFS district officer David Hitchens described the wind as \"quite severe\".</p><p>\"Winds that are above 100km/h ... from multiple directions [makes it] very hard to contain a fire and the crews that were here today [Wednesday] did an extremely good job to do that,\" Mr Hitchens said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the wild winds saw NSW State Emergency Service (SES) crews respond to about 65 jobs across the Illawarra and South Coast on Wednesday.</p><p>More than 30 of the jobs, most of which were for roof damage and fallen trees and branches, were in the Illawarra.</p><p>The remainder stretched across the Shoalhaven, as far south as Milton.</p><p>Buildings have been destroyed after two separate, out-of-control fires ripped through bush and burned quickly towards homes in the Shoalhaven on Wednesday.</p><p>Wild winds fanned fires in Bomaderry and at Mount Kingiman, west of Ulladulla, with emergency alerts issued for residents in both areas.</p><p>At Bomaderry, a bushfire burning between West Cambewarra Road and the Princes Highway flared about 11am.</p><p>The fire destroyed at least one shed in a residential backyard, as firefighters on the ground and in the sky worked to halt its spread.</p><p>The fire's alert level was downgraded mid-afternoon, but it remained uncontrolled late on Wednesday.</p><p>Down the coast, residents in the Woodstock area, west of Ulladulla, were told it was too late to leave as a fast-moving fire approached.</p><p>One shed was confirmed lost in that fire, which was downgraded to a 'watch and act' alert level on Wednesday evening.</p><p>RFS building assessment teams have been deployed to the Shoalhaven to assess the property damage associated with both fires.</p><p>How the events of Wednesday unfolded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Its plan appears to be to call for a convoy of methylated spirits to be trucked in and to blast a stream of the stuff on the flames at the merest sign the conflagration might die down.</p><p>How else to explain that the acting minister for emergency services, Lisa Neville, was forced yesterday to slither away, humiliated, from her own apparently greatly exaggerated rumour of the early demise of the former MFB fire chief, Peter Rau?</p><p>After months of farce concerning the United Firefighters Union, the CFA and the government's inability to put out an ember without sacking or forcing the resignation of everyone in sight - including Ms Neville's predecessor as emergency services minister, Jane Garrett - Ms Neville has now dropped a match into the Metropolitan Fire Brigade's protracted industrial bushfire.</p><p>Peter Rau, she declared publicly, had resigned because he was \"gravely ill\". In normal public discourse, such language is used when someone is at death's door.</p><p>Not true, fumes Mr Rau's wife, Tracey Rau. Why, she and her husband had been forced to reassure family and friends it wasn't the case at all. The main reason her husband had resigned, Mrs Rau stated, was because of stress caused by bullying dished out by the United Firefighters Union and the mess surrounding the dispute over enterprise bargaining.</p><p>Ms Neville was left falling over herself, declaring she was \"absolutely genuinely sorry ... if I have caused any distress to Peter and his family\". If?</p><p>But why would a minister have consigned a senior official to retirement among the ranks of the \"gravely ill\" in the first place?</p><p>Mrs Rau believes it was to distract attention from bullying union tactics against MFB management during the past two years of industrial disputation. That may very well be so. but it still doesn't explain how a government, from Premier Andrews down, has allowed itself to burn up months and months of political capital on the UFU, the CFA and everything associated, and has now set a new blaze flaring around the MFB for no reason at all.

Both, surely.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc6rn5dq8zeop1iywlsag9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KT4-51J1-JD34-V085-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>September 27, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Labour/Occupations/Firemen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics/Political Parties Groups/Australian Labor Party/ALP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001480</classCode><className>RESIGNATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000CFSV</classCode><className>BULLYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009QXJ</classCode><className>COLLECTIVE BARGAINING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The first statewide total fire ban of the summer was ordered on Monday as temperatures peaked at 41.3C at Mildura and 40.7C at Swan Hill.</p><p>Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning's Murray Goldfields forest fire manager Paul Bates said this fire season had been \"interesting\", with only a handful of fire bans declared despite high fuel loads caused by record rain last year.</p><p>\"It's like the fire season has been delayed,\" Mr Bates said. \"(But) we've still got six weeks to two months of fire risk (left) in the landscape. There's still a lot of summer to go.</p><p>\"What's unusual is the grass growth on the roadside and in paddocks - that says the risk is still present.\" Incoming Victorian Farmers Federation grains president Ross Johns, of Warracknabeal, said the drier outlook heading into autumn would not be too much of a concern to farmers \"as long as it remembers to rain\" after April.</p><p>The Bureau's outlook points to the likelihood of a drier-than-average three months for all of Victoria, NSW, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. The forecast followed a mixed month of rain for southeast Australia during January, with some centres receiving more than one-and-a-half times their monthly rain while other struggled to achieve a quarter.</p><p>The best falls, compared with the long-term average, were in western Victoria, with Ararat picking up 60.8mm for the month to 9am yesterday or 155 per cent of its 39.1mm January average.At the other end of the scale, Sale, in Gippsland, had just 11.6mm of rain for the month, or 26 per cent of its long-term average.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WeeklyTimes20170201WeeklyTimes7000216871802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MS7-03J1-JD3N-51BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"374\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 1, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS003</classCode><className>SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Current Affair journalist, who was suspended from the network after his April arrest, was in court yesterday as his lawyer asked a magistrate for three more weeks to complete negotiations with the prosecution. Sam Macedone said a plea \"will be entered\" when the matter returns to court on September 26. McCormack, 43, has been charged with two counts of using a carriage service to transmit, publish or promote child porn.</p><p>Police powers bolstered on terror QUEENSLAND: Police will now have extra powers to respond to terror threats after the state parliament passed tough new laws. Officers will be able to access and search electronic devices during a declared terror emergency, to more quickly identify people and gain access to information. The laws also strengthen surveillance powers as well as give police greater latitude to move and destroy homemade explosives. The government said safeguards had also been built into the laws to ensure a \"balance\" between the new powers and individuals rights and liberties. A public interest monitor will be tasked with putting together an annual report on surveillance warrants.</p><p>State warned to brace for fire threat VICTORIA: Victorians need to brace themselves for a potentially harsher and earlier fire season than normal, authorities warn. After one of Australia's warmest and driest winters on record, large parts of the eastern states and South Australia have been marked \"red\" in the 2017 Southern Australia Seasonal Bushfire Outlook. The CFA and Forest Fire Management Victoria have also brought forward prevention strategies, including burn-offs.</p><p>Anglicans strengthen rules to keep kids safe QUEENSLAND: Anglican priests across Australia will be required to follow strict new rules to protect children from abuse after legislation was passed by its governing body. Clergy and church workers will now be required to abide by a code of conduct which they had previously only needed to treat as recommendations. \"It covers things like transport, no corporal punishment, issues of touch and photographs,\" Royal Commission Working Group chair Garth Blake said. Stricter screening of sex offenders in parishes will also apply and could even result in some being turned away. The Anglican Church of Australia unanimously voted in favour of the mandatory guidelines at its three-yearly General Synod on the Sunshine Coast yesterday.</p><p>Cop charged with uploading sex videoNSW: A NSW police officer has been charged with secretly filming himself having sex with a female colleague and uploading the footage to social media. The pair met up in Sydney's CBD in July this year while they were both off duty. The 27-year-old, a senior constable attached to a specialist command, was arrested and charged on Monday, police revealed in a statement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20170906Australian2000324263962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PDG-TH71-F0JP-W060-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 6, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

If it had been a northerly wind it would have blown to the houses or dairy,\" Mr Moir said.</p><p>\"It just shows how easily it can happen on a day you wouldn't expect.</p><p>\"If it had been 32 degrees instead of 22 degrees they would have been at the neighbour's place to stop it before it reached the bush.\"</p><p>The fire brought back memories of the January 10 Framlingham Forest fire that burnt the western boundary of his property 11 years ago.</p><p>The eagle, which was found dead in the paddock, was believed to have hit the powerline and sparked the blaze.</p><p>Mr Moir said that there had been a breeding pair of wedge-tailed eagles that had lived in a big gum tree on the edge of the Framlingham Forest for more than 20 years.</p><p>And even though that tree was burnt in the fire a decade ago, the eagles could be seen every two years flying around the area with their young. \"We're just hoping it's not one of the breeding pair,\" Mr Moir said.</p><p>Mr Moir said he was impressed with how well organised the CFA was and how quickly they contained the blaze.</p><p>Crews spent two hours mopping up after the blaze and Mr Moir spent the night regularly checking on it, including getting up at 4am.</p><p>\"All farmers do, you feel a responsibility even though there's no fault or blame anywhere. Then you think sure I could have rolled over and slept til 6.30am and then got up. If I hadn't got up two hours before and it had flared up and all of a sudden my neighbour's place is on fire because I didn't check it....that's what you do.\"</p><p>Region 5 operations operations manager Richard Bourke said the rapid response from the brigades and planes helped contain the blaze to under five hectares.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WRBLST-doc6z21bvamalt11rz84f57</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRBLST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRY-STR1-JD34-V1JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"450\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Traffic accident</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N112120MM</classCode><className>DAIRY FARMING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

That method, however, is based only on weather, such as temperature, relative humidity and wind speed.</p><p>A prototype was tested in the Sydney region, including the Blue Mountains, and east of Melbourne. The model will be tested in NSW this year.</p><p>\"You can have a region with a lower fire rating but have a particular location with a higher risk,\" said Trent Penman, a bushfire behaviour specialist at the University of Melbourne, and another developer of the new model. \"For people in those properties to know they are at higher risk would be beneficial for their preparations.\"</p><p>Victoria and NSW are divided into large fire districts.

I told them: 'If we don't do a burn-off now, there'll be no birds. There'll be no goannas, no snakes, no wallabies. They'll all be bar-becued.\" Another Tonimbuk resident, cartoonist Mark Knight, said some residents were left to defend their homes without assistance from the CFA. \"We fought this fire for three days on our own,\" he said. \"Black Saturday they were all over us. They were fantastic. We didn't see them this year.\" A spokesman for the CFA said: \"There are more than 2000 emergency services personnel currently working on multiple fires across the state. We can't have a firetruck on everyone's doorstep and we prioritise accordingly.\" Rex Newton, 70, returned to his Tonimbuk home and wildlife refuge- yesterday to find it burnt to the ground. He said he was near the rear of his property when he saw fire race over a hill towards his back door. \"I only have the clothes on my back and it isn't that nice a shirt,\" he told the ABC as he sifted through ash and twisted metal. By the time he managed to load his dog, cat and cockatoo and jump into a car, the fire had singed the hair on his arms.</p><p>Firefighting resources have been stretched to breaking point, with crews tackling almost 20 significant- fires across the state. Although the crisis had abated last night, emergency services were bracing for the impact of a viole-nt weather change expected to bring strong winds, lightning strikes and possibly snow to some of the same alpine areas scorched by fire.</p><p>A Forest Fire Management Victoria spokesman, when asked why fuel reduction burning had not been carried out on the crown land next to the Bunyip State Park, said that under a change to fire risk management, burning had become- more targeted.</p><p>\"We are using a risk-reduction target to focus our fuel-management strategies on areas that will have the greatest impact,\" the spokesman said. \"This target means we are burning smarter, rather than focusing on a number-of-hectares target.</p><p>\"In some cases this may mean less planned burns - in other areas it may mean more - but communities can be assured that our activities are focused on making them safer and protecting their local environment.\" The immediate threat shifted yesterday from Tonimbuk to the alpine town of Dargo, where the small community was at one point menaced by two bushfires.</p><p>Leanne Estcourt said from insid-e the historic Dargo Hotel that the town was encircled by smoke, with the skies glowing lumin-ous orange. Some town residents sought shelter in the pub.</p><p>\"We have got some people that are here that the fires are affecting their properties as we speak,\" Ms Estcourt said. \"It is pretty stressful when you don't know the situation and how bad it is.\" By late afternoon, the threat to properties in Dargo had eased, althoug-h the fires were not under control.</p><p>The Tonimbuk fire was the worst to hit the area since Black Saturday 10 years ago, when a fire which began in the Bunyip State Park destroyed 31 houses and burnt more than 26,000ha.Graeme Moore, the Mayor of Cardinia Shire, which takes in Tonimbuk, said his community had been hammered by the fire but praised the CFA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-b2e82a863e5811e9a3a1619e5d1779923a9de5b148948c737d7fde5ab3e74aec</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJR-N8M1-JD3N-512X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

There are fears possible thunderstorms coupled with dry lightning strikes could ignite new blazes.</p><p>There are total fire bans in effect for 11 areas, including those facing \"extreme\" and \"severe\" fire danger.</p><p>Shoalhaven Council alderman and volunteer firefighter Mitchell Pakes said fire conditions would worsen today and tomorrow with rising temperatures and dry winds.</p><p>\"If you can delay travel plans, it's a good idea to do that,\" Mr Pakes said.</p><p>\"A lot of coastal villages have one road in and out. My advice for holidaymakers on the coast is that it's too late to leave now, particularly with the weather worsening tonight and into tomorrow.\"</p><p>This warning also covers towns including Mollymook, Lake Conjola and Huskisson.</p><p>\"The reality is if you are in a small coastal village, it's safer for you to stay there,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Pakes said the warning was not a \"knee-jerk reaction\" and was instead well calculated.</p><p>Just across the border, the Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota was awaiting the flames last night. An emergency community meeting was held in the town, which is surrounded by the wilderness of the Croajingolong National Park, early yesterday and only hours after more than 100 firefighters arrived overnight.</p><p>\"The concern is a big fire could be coming, but it will be coming in the middle of the night,\" Darryl Burns, ranger in charge of fire and emergency operations in East Gippsland, said at the meeting. \"That wind change will drive the fire towards us. It will be a long day and a long night.\"</p><p>Mallacoota resident Michelle Roberts, who owns the Croajingolong Cafe overlooking the inlet, was closing up just after 2pm and planning to evacuate her house.</p><p>\"We're all very nervous here,\" she said. \"There are a lot of tourists around, getting coffees and wanting to be fed, I don't think they are taking it as seriously as the locals.\"</p><p>Ms Roberts was going home to quickly pack some of her belongings before returning to her cafe and taking shelter there overnight.</p><p>\"There is no real safe place so a lot of people are being told to come down and wait near the wharf which is where my cafe is so I will just wait it out here,\" she said.</p><p>NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman Greg Allen said, \"Our advice is certainly not to be in bushland areas if you don't have to be and, if that means delaying travel until these conditions are more benign, that would be our advice.</p><p>\"The last thing we want to see is people stuck on any road away from their home and property, so please delay travel if you can and stay away from bushland areas.\"</p><p>Mr Allen said major road closures were possible and would be determined by fire conditions.</p><p>Sydney residents Liz and Tony Whittingham arrived in Lake Conjola on Friday and are booked to stay until January 2, but because of changing fire conditions the couple have not unpacked and are considering cutting short their holiday.</p><p>\"It's a bit of a different holiday, rather than just mooching around, you've got one eye on the weather two or three times a day,\" Mrs Whittingham said.</p><p>They were likely to stay unless the weather conditions deteriorated further. \"We have to ride with it,\" she said.</p><p>Illawarra resident Michael Webb is holidaying in Mossy Point, 16 kilometres from Batemans Bay, and said ash was raining down on his car.</p><p>\"It's been a bit spooky - the sun is very red,\" he said. \"We are now surrounded by fire on three sides so the sea will be the only route of escape.\"</p><p>He said the bushfires had not disrupted his holiday and he was unlikely to cut it short, but said the smoke levels and visibility had been particularly bad yesterday.</p><p>At 3pm, 100 fires were burning around the state, 50 of which were yet to be contained.</p><p>The four fires at \"emergency warning\" level last night were the Dunns Road fire near Wagga Wagga, the Green Valley fire in Greater Hume, Myrtle Mountain Road near Bega, and the Charleys Forest fire near Queanbeyan. Four other fires along the South Coast were at \"watch and act\".</p><p>The Southern Ranges, Illawarra and Shoalhaven areas face \"extreme\" fire danger ratings today, while areas including Greater Sydney, Greater Hunter, central ranges and the Far South Coast have been issued \"severe\" fire danger ratings.</p><p>The Rural Fire Service said yesterday 911 homes had been destroyed in NSW to date in this bushfire season, along with 72 facilities and more than 2000 outbuildings.</p><p>with Melissa Cunningham</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc78mmeq2cv5514x3zpi74</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVW-B8W1-JD34-V0YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

''You could assume that as the frequency [of high-risk fire weather days] increases you might get a longer fire season.''</p><p>Scientists have warned of more days of extreme fire danger due to climate change for decades.</p><p>Changes in the Forest Fire Danger Index have already shown that many regions have had an increase in extreme fire weather, partly due to the increasing intensity and duration of hot days - January this year was the hottest month on record.</p><p>The index increased significantly at 16 of 38 weather stations across Australia between 1973 and 2010, producing a longer fire season.</p><p>A 2006 CSIRO report updated this year stated the combined frequencies of days with very high and extreme fire danger ratings are likely to increase by 4 per cent to 25 per cent by 2020 and 15 per cent to 70 per cent by 2050.</p><p>However, Professor Bradstock said the present fires were not particularly unusual in the context of the past 50 years.</p><p>''They are within what we could call the historical range of variation. They are not outside the envelope. We haven't seen anything that breaks records,'' he said. ''[But] it's getting warmer and drier, and we may see more of the extreme fire days if the climate change predictions come to fruition.''</p><p>The director of ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, Andy Pitman, said global warming meant warmer winters, which would create vegetation conditions suitable for fires.</p><p>''It's perfectly plausible'' there could be a week of days with 35-degree maximum heat and 50km/h winds in the future, he said.</p><p>''We are clearly and demonstrably vulnerable [to fires] and all of the trends point to that vulnerability being amplified in the future,'' Professor Pitman said.</p><p>Public concern tended to be temporary, he said, with complacency setting in quickly. ''Even the Black Saturday fires [in Victoria] really don't change people's behaviour for more than a year or two.''</p><p>Six months ago, the former Climate Commission released its Critical Decade report warning extreme fire weather days had been on the rise for 30 years in many parts of Australia, including southern NSW.</p><p>''The projections for the future indicate a significant increase in dangerous fire weather for south-east Australia,'' it said.</p><p>In the red</p><p>70% of Australia experienced severe heatwave across late Dec 2012/ early Jan 2013. Temperature records were set in every state and territory.</p><p>40.3\u00c2\u00b0C Hottest ever average Australian maximum temperature on January 7, 2013.</p><p>16 out of 38 weather stations across Australia, showed a significant increase in the Forest Fire Danger Index between 1973 and 2010.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>GRAPH: Heatwave SOURCE: CLIMATE COMMISSION REPORT THE CRITICAL DECADE: EXTREME WEATHER, AFAC, CSIRO.
