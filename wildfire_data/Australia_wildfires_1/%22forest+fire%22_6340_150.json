reflect the sun's energy back into space, we're getting clearer skies in Europe and clearer skies mean we're getting more of the Sun's radiation hitting the surface of the Earth,\" she said.</p><p>She said that human-induced climate change would likely result in \"more heatwaves that are more intense, that last longer and that impact a larger region\".</p><p>\"2024 was the warmest year on record, followed by 2023, and 2025 is on track to be probably the third warmest year on record,\" she said.</p><p>\"The only way that we are going to reduce future warming of our planet \u2026 is rapid

Michael Douglas produced the 1975 box-office hit before his own movie career took off. In his late 20s, Douglas got the rights to adapt Ken Kesey's 1962 novel from his father, Kirk Douglas, who originated the lead role of Randle McMurphy, a maverick who up-ends a psychiatric ward, in a 1963 Broadway production. The film won five Academy awards, including best picture and Oscars for Nicholson, Nurse Ratched actor Louise Fletcher and director Milos Forman. For the film's 50th anniversary, Fathom Entertainment is releasing a restored version this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The book made a tremendous impression on me in college and I saw my father in the stage production. He had bought rights to the book when it was in galley form. After the play he tried for about five years to set the picture up. I said, \"Let me try to run with it.\" Dad said, \"Sure, give the kid a chance.\" I would try to get him the money he wanted and the part of McMurphy in the movie.</p><p>In my dad's files on the project I found this company, Fantasy Records in Berkeley, California, run by a gentleman named Saul Zaentz. In the 60s, Fantasy had a band called the Golliwogs, which became Creedence Clearwater Revival. It was the profits from Creedence that would pay for Cuckoo's Nest. John Fogerty from Creedence later had a pretty substantial lawsuit against Saul over music profits.</p><p>We put together a deal where I would share half of my back-end profits with my father. Our budget was a couple million when we started and ended up at about $4m, which was more than most independent movies. Saul's partners thought I was railroading him and taking all the money out of Fantasy.</p><p>At the time I was on a crime show called The Streets of San Francisco with Karl Malden. It was a hit and I had Emmy nominations and a five-year contract, but I asked to leave early to produce this picture.</p><p>Saul and I made mistakes but we also trusted our instincts. Instead of using a stage in Hollywood, we decided to shoot the film on location. In Oregon. In January. When it gets dark at three in the afternoon. In a hospital ward. For verisimilitude.</p><p>But it was one of those fateful decisions because we found the Oregon State Hospital and the superintendent, Dean Brooks, became an extraordinary collaborator. He ended up playing the part of McMurphy's doctor. He also allowed the actors into group therapy sessions and he suggested patients to actually be part of our crew. We had an arsonist working in the art department.</p><p>I remember walking through these empty wards of the hospital. It was a very isolated, lonely place that we were able to bring all this life to. We had two weeks of rehearsal before we started, and several of the actors were sleeping at the hospital.</p><p>Did I consider trying to play McMurphy? No, I was 29 years old. McMurphy had to be a little bit over the hill. Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando had turned it down. For a while Milos was seriously thinking about Burt Reynolds. I always felt bad about my father not getting the part. But Jack was such a good choice to be our guide into this world, with that sly angle that it was going to be easier than jail time for him. It did cross my mind that maybe I could play Billy Bibbit. Then Brad Dourif came in for an audition, and I just said, \"Well, that's our Billy.\" Will Sampson, who played Chief Bromden, was one of those casting dreams. I got a call about him from a used-car salesman I had met on an aeroplane. Will was working as a forest-fire ranger in Yakima, Washington, and he flew down to Portland to meet us for the first time. So we're down there at the gate waiting, and Will comes through the gate with his cowboy hat and boots that made him close to 7 feet tall. Jack goes, \"Oh, my god, it's the Chief!\" Will flew back with us in this twin engine plane that was very small. So he sat in the front seat and Jack sat in his lap. He just kept saying, \"It's the Chief, man, it's the Chief!\" We had some trouble because at first Milos wasn't showing footage to the cast. And our cinematographer, Haskell Wexler, didn't like what Milos was doing and that was beginning to leak into the cast. So I had to fire Haskell. I felt like an idiot going up to this super-talented man who was old enough to be my father but it had to be done.</p><p>We also had a big drama with William Redfield, who played Harding. We discovered he had leukaemia and we had to gamble on whether he could finish the picture. He passed away a couple of weeks after the picture was over. His performance was just magical.</p><p>We kept pushing Milos to get out of the hospital, but he was resisting the idea of shooting the scenes where McMurphy steals the fishing boat. We finally did it and the cast was violently seasick. I remember Danny DeVito on the morning of the third day crying, \"I can't go out!\" At first we didn't really know what the purpose of the fishing trip was but then it became about the patients coming together as a group and recognising McMurphy was the leader.</p><p>On set, we were rocking. Jack improvised a lot to McMurphy calling the imaginary baseball game because Jack knew his sports, but everything was pretty scripted.</p><p>To this day it's an acting lesson. I can show you a 1000-foot roll of film, 10 minutes of Jack saying nothing, simply doing reactions to the group therapy meeting, and you'll be mesmerised.</p><p>The film is a star vehicle for Jack, but it's an ensemble film at its heart. What we're seeing on the screen is camaraderie and I think that's why it stood the test of time. It's also a funny movie. Yes it gets sad, but when the Chief breaks out and Christopher Lloyd is triumphant, it ends on a very positive note. I think that's partly why it succeeded.</p><p>When the picture was finished, we went looking for distribution but could not make a deal with anybody. The studios saw the exact same movie that would get nominated for nine Oscars but they all turned us down.</p><p>United Artists, respectfully, was like your last choice in those days but they made us a decent deal. Then they went on a run. They won best picture three years in a row starting with us, then Rocky, then Annie Hall.</p><p>Saul Zaentz won three best picture awards in his career, including Amadeus in the 80s, and The English Patient in the 90s. I don't think he's ever given proper credit, probably because he was from the outside.</p><p>It was an independent picture that was signed, sealed and delivered to the studio. It certainly brought in a lot of money for us in the first 25 years, and now we have receipts for 50 years. For Jack in particular it was a very financially rewarding film.</p><p>I used to tease my father that his half of my back end was more money than he ever made for any picture in his career. For him the money helped ease the pain, but not by much, of not getting the role of McMurphy. Now I'm old enough to understand that you get maybe four really good parts in your life if you're lucky, and that certainly seemed like one of those parts to my father.</p><p>Thank god the movie wasn't a turkey! That was probably the most nervous I was when I invited Dad up to see our first cut of the movie. He was a fan. He complimented Jack and what a beautiful job we did. His running joke after that was, \"If I knew Michael was going to be so successful, I would have been nicer to him!\" I was recently in a picture with my older son Cameron, and my younger ones are just starting in the business. I really take offence to this term \"nepo babies\". It's a nasty slap. Oh yeah, I know how it feels. My dad would say, \"Son, you have it much harder than me. I had the rags-to-riches story, but people think of you as a kid with a silver spoon in your mouth.\" THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-f2d13be45d2611f0a64451825dcb8384ff830c60036b52b2af46dd131aa10839</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8D-H9P3-RRW8-20J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1314\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 15, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DHZP</classCode><className>ACADEMY AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp;

leaving just 39 officers to patrol Victoria's 2,512-kilometre coastline, 10,000 square-kilometres of ocean waters and 170,000 kilometres of inland water frontage along 85,000 kilometres of rivers and creeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then in a separate decision, on Friday, June 13, 2025, the VFA stripped the remaining officers of their duties to \"respond to any emergency\" by deleting these duties from their Position Descriptions.</p><p>This decision was communicated by email from the authority's human resources manager to an organiser at the state branch of the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU Vic) at 5:13 p.m..</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Controversy</emphasis></p><p>It also came amid statewide controversy over the Allan Government's new Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund (ESVF) and whether it will actually deliver value for rural ratepayers, or subsidise Fire Rescue Victoria service provision to urban areas and metropolitan Melbourne.</p><p>When interviewed on ABC Statewide Drive in Ballarat on June 25, 2025, the new Emergency Management Commissioner, Tim Wiebusch, was asked whether Fisheries Officers fell within his \"remit\" \u2013 and under his management \u2013 in an emergency.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Co-ordination</emphasis></p><p>\"The role that I'm in now has a role in providing co-ordination across all our government departments and agencies and that does include the likes of the Victorian Fisheries Authority... because they provide support to a range of emergencies,\" Commissioner Wiebusch said.</p><p>\"They have a high level of on-water capability.\"</p><p>Under Section 8(kc) of the Victorian Fisheries Authority Act 2016, it is a statutory function of Fisheries Officers \"to respond to any emergency...\"</p><p>The June 13 decision of the fisheries authority will have the effect of permanently preventing Fisheries Officers from providing that function in future, regardless of the Emergency Management Commissioner's expectations when the next emergency happens.</p><p>The fisheries authority on May 20 confirmed, in response to a Freedom of Information request, that it implemented its 2025 workplace changes \u2013 which involve both the shedding of frontline personnel and reductions in the duties of remaining staff \u2013 without a risk assessment.</p><p>Mr Wiebusch told the ABC that SES, Catchment Management authorities, Lifesaving Victoria and Victoria Police also operated boats and could be called upon, if the Victorian Fisheries Authority could no longer be called out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No contact</emphasis></p><p>None of these organisations or agencies have been contacted to confirm their equivalence to the \"high level of on-water capability\" of professional Fisheries Officers, nor has the Allan Government announced supplementary funding for this purpose.</p><p>However, the Premier's Office did reportedly tell Ballarat newspaper \"The Courier\" that the Victorian Fisheries Authority is \"not an emergency service.\"</p><p>Neither the Catchment Management authorities, Lifesaving Victoria, Victoria Police, nor the Victorian Fisheries Authority are funded for their emergency work from the Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund, and neither do they fall under the jurisdiction of the Inspector-General for Emergency Management.</p><p>An entire page of the Emergency Management Victoria (EMV) website is filled by the Role statement \u2013 Victorian Fisheries Authority. It specifically details the critical roles of Fisheries Officers in responding to multiple categories of general and specialist emergencies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Serious gap</emphasis></p><p>Permanently stripping Fisheries Officers of their duties to \"to respond to any emergency\" will leave a serious capability gap in the State Emergency Management Plan (SEMP) and significantly undermine Victoria's counter-disaster resilience.</p><p>Former Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Kel Glare, his Community Advocacy Alliance and more than 12,900 concerned Victorians have so far hit back with an online petition for an inquiry into the fisheries authority, because the restructure had gone ahead without a risk assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Skills and experience</emphasis></p><p>In the past five years alone, the skills and experience of Fisheries Officers were not only of critical and strategic importance, but indispensable in the safe and expeditious execution of co-ordinated emergency responses to at least two major disasters in this state: the 2020 East Gippsland bushfires and the 2022 Goulburn Valley floods.</p><p>In October 2022, Greater Shepparton was impacted by significant and widespread flooding due to intense rainfalls in the catchment areas of the Goulburn and Broken rivers.</p><p>Veteran retired Supervising Fisheries Officer and sometimes Regional Manager (North East), Greg Sharp, was the Operations Lead for the Victorian Fisheries Authority, in the Incident Control Centre, during the 2022 Goulburn Valley floods.</p><p>He said the rainfall caused the rivers to rise rapidly, leading to extensive flooding in urban and rural areas.</p><p>\"Fisheries Officers, having specialist skills and experience in the operation of suitable vessels for the circumstances, were mustered from all over Victoria,\" Mr Sharp said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Support</emphasis></p><p>\"Our boat crews provided round-the-clock support to Ambulance Victoria and GV Health, and relief agencies \u2013 Salvation Army, Society of St Vincent de Paul \u2013 delivering food and emergency medicine to householders stranded by flood waters in and around Shepparton and Tatura.</p><p>\"Fisheries Officers also assisted with wildlife management in the weeks after the floods receded, assisting professional shooters to euthanise stranded wildlife otherwise facing a slow lingering death from starvation. This was no fly-by-night operation, it went on for weeks!\"</p><p>Mr Sharp said Fisheries Officers also provided indispensable water-borne transport services during and after the January 2020 Mallacoota bushfires which destroyed 123 houses \u2013 including five owned by CFA volunteers \u2013 and 65 sheds.</p><p>\"In the immediate aftermath of the 2020 fires, the only road into Mallacoota was utterly impassable; littered with debris and lined with scorched trees ready to shed limbs at the slightest breeze,\" Mr Sharp said.</p><p>\"It was therefore necessary for Fisheries Officers \u2013 in Kevlacat patrol vessels \u2013 to ferry supplies, personnel and essential equipment into the town by sea from Lakes Entrance. There was so much smoke in the air, flying in was not an option. Aircraft were grounded!\"</p><p>He said personnel ferried in and out by Fisheries Officers included Country Fire Authority relief crews, needed to complete the mopping-up after the initial major firefight and to respond if smouldering tree roots or other hidden detritus flared-up again.</p><p>And when the Fisheries Officers were not boating into Mallacoota, they were just as busy landing supplies and Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighters on to beaches in the remote Croajingolong National Park via Mallacoota Inlet.</p><p>\"Not even the navy could get in. Our vessels provided the necessary shuttle service between offshore vessels and onshore landing points; whether they be the wharf, a jetty or one of the beaches,\" Mr Sharp said.</p><p>\"Of course, our people did not just turn up after the event. They went in while the fire was still raging, to engage in a daring race against time, to capture and evacuate by sea many critically endangered eastern bristlebirds nesting in the paths of approaching fire fronts.\"</p><p>Mr Sharp said that while these fires and floods had happened within the past five years, they also typified a long history of major-disaster emergency responses by a great many Fisheries Officers who, since the 1950s, were subsequently decorated for their extraordinary service.</p><p>\"Yes, I was awarded an NEM (National Emergency Medal) for my participation as a Fisheries Officer in responding to the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires,\" Mr Sharp said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/07/04/the-buloke-times-4-july-2025/\"/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BulokeTimes4July2025p1.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>This article appeared in <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/07/04/the-buloke-times-4-july-2025/\">The Buloke Times, 4 July 2025</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARRNEW-227187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARRNEW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G6V-7BS3-RYYV-F4FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484198</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1374\"/><timeReceived>9:22 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Acquisdata Inc.

with authorities already bracing for a tough 2026. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2025 fires burnt 320,434ha in Victoria - equivalent to the Melbourne CBD burning more than 155 times over. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite this there remained a significant load of fuel across the state heading into autumn and winter months where little rain was expected.</p><p>Last season's fires burnt about 70,000ha more than the average amount of land torched by fires in the past decade.</p><p>The only other season to do this was the 2019-20 Black Summer fires.</p><p>Lightning started a fire in the Little Desert National Park in January 2025 which burnt more than 95,000ha, while two fires in the Grampians burnt a combined 120,000ha. </p><p>Dimboola Fire Brigade captain Lyndon Kuhne said he had been fighting fires for nearly 20 years and had never seen a fire behave the way it did. </p><p>\"For a small town like Dimboola, where everyone knows each other, the emotional weight was immense,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's incredibly tough knowing you're responsible for protecting both your town and your personal world.\"</p><p>But Mr Kuhne said Dimboola's community spirit shone in the weeks after the fire.</p><p>\"Protecting the town was truly a team effort, and together we succeeded,\" he said.</p><p>Mirranatwa Fire Brigade captain Jarrod Dark said Grampians fires were impossible to completely completely.</p><p>\"When you're out at the back of your property and you can see the flames, it's confronting,\" he said. </p><p>\"You hear the fire, and it sounds like a jet engine because of the pure power of it. </p><p>\"There was a staggering amount of Forest Fire Management Victoria, CFA and interstate crews out there doing their best to contain and control the fire.\"</p><p>Mr Dark said it was lucky the Grampians had a tight knit community. </p><p>\"Everyone was pitching in and doing their bit,\" he said. </p><p>\"We're grateful beyond words for every CFA member, emergency responder, and community member who played a role.\"</p><p>In the past 10 years nearly 11 per cent of Victoria's total land mass has been burnt by fire. </p><p>During the 2019-2020 Black Summer fires the amount of land burnt was equivalent to 2610 Melbourne CBDs. </p><p>While fewer than 10,000ha were torched in 2021 - the season following Black Summer - it did not mean this trend would continue, with fire authorities bracing for a gruelling 2026.</p><p>Country Fire Authority chief officer Jason Heffernan said dry conditions and an active fire season were expected for next summer. </p><p>He said historically seasons with less hectares burnt had been wet La Nina years but there was no regular pattern. </p><p>\"Severe rainfall deficits remain right across western Victoria and, despite all the bushfires this season, there are still many high-risk bushfire areas in the west, such as the Otways National Park and Wombat State Forest that have not had major bushfires for many years, as well as other areas of the state, which could be susceptible next season,\" he said. </p><p>\"When underlying dryness persists multi-year it becomes harder to recover. </p><p>\"Significant rainfall is required to deeply saturate soils and reduce flammability, which would mean consecutive months of well-above normal rainfall. </p><p>\"At the end March, there are no indications of this being likely through autumn and winter this year.\"</p><p>Ahead of the 2024-25 summer the Australian Seasonal Bushfire Outlook  indicated a lack of rainfall created more fuel available to burn across parts of the state and that there would be a higher chance of warmer maximum temperatures. </p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said crews worked to reduce bushfire risk year-round. </p><p>\"With the fire risk being higher than average this autumn, we urge people to take extreme care if lighting campfires, undertaking private burn-offs, or working with machinery in dry parts of the state,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

nitf:lede=\"true\">Authorities say weather conditions have been \"testing\" as fire crews attempt to contain anout-of-control bushfire in central Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said containment efforts had gone well on Sunday afternoon, despite low humidity and winds picking up.\"The fire behaviour has dropped off,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>\"We're hoping to deliver some good news to the community by tomorrow morning.\"</p><p>More than 250 firefighters have been deployed to the bushfire near the Old Tom Track in Hepburn Regional Park, south-west of Daylesford.</p><p>Fire authorities confirmed they lost control of a 200-hectare planned burn on Friday, which grew to 300 hectares on Sunday.</p><p>A Watch and Act warning is in place for communities south-west of Daylesford, including Sailors Hill, Sailors Falls and Musk Vale.</p><p>On Sunday, the blaze came within 100 metres of properties.Musk Vale resident Tracey Petrie said people in the area were \"very, very nervous\" they could lose their homes.</p><p>Ms Petrie, who is in the final stages of building a house in Musk Vale, said without a water connection she \"couldn't do anything\" to protect her property.\"Most of my neighbours have been watering their gardens all last night, all day today, and they have their bags packed,\" Ms Petrie said.</p><p>\"Unfortunately my property doesn't have water tanks in it because they don't arrive for another two weeks.\"</p><p>She said her property had been inundated by ash and smoke, and there was little she could do to \"wet down\" her house or prevent spot fires without access to water.</p><p>Communities have been advised to remain on high alert and monitor changing conditions.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Mr Kontelj implored others to protest against the proposed changes. \"We encourage ratepayers to join our advocacy, contact their local MPs and share their views on this expanded tax,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Kontelj's letter follows calls for the federal government to reverse funding changes to aged care.</p><p>Amendments to the Aged Care Act to be implemented from July 1 would put the council in a \"difficult position\", Mr Kontelj said.</p><p>\"Council will be required to find several millions of dollars per annum out of operations to subsidise the ongoing provision of aged care services,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Kontelj said the changes would go against the wishes of the community. \"We've heard loud and clear about how much they value our in-home community care service,\" he said.</p><p>\"We agree - that's why we're calling on the commonwealth government to commit to aged care by providing the additional funding.\" Earlier this month, Geelong council was slammed by industry unions and local MPs for planning to cut up to 300 aged care jobs. The future of the in-home community care service is still uncertain, with a decision to be made once consultations finish.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-f844609824cc11f099eff7eb887ca2b478042e373f94795ebe1d5614d861ca33</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FPD-PGR3-RV4R-61YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Geelong Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 1, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001680</classCode><className>TAX INCREASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008WYU</classCode><className>COST OF LIVING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

the fire.</p><p>\"They're obviously suspicious, there's been no lightning out there in weeks,\" he said.</p><p>\"The fire danger at this time of year is pretty low, really, although it is very dry out

About $205m of that will come from farmers.</p><p>The state government said the increase for the average farm was $13 a week, and that active volunteers and life members of VICSES and CFA were exempt from the levy \"in recognition of the work they do to keep us all safe\".</p><p>\"We'll continue to work to pass these changes, because this legislation will give our volunteers and emergency services the tools and resources they need to keep communities safe and save lives,\" the spokesman said Volunteers, however, will have to apply for a rebate on the tax, which will apply to farmland or single farm enterprises.</p><p>Revenue from the new tax is intended to fund up to 95 per cent of the budgets for Victoria SES, triple-0, the State Control Centre, Emergency Management Victoria, Emergency Recovery Victoria, and Forest Fire Management Victoria. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:abby.walter@news.com.au\">abby.walter@news.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-2506f5182a0f11f09a4813b53b7a49d32876b1c6fefc99eaa522b04d0e1fe3df</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FS4-G0R3-RRH7-S566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 9, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D05Y</classCode><className>MENTAL HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The new levy has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsnow.io/story/8968439/\"> politically toxic for the government </url>, triggering protests both on the steps of parliament and across the state.</p><p>But the government persisted with the plan and pushed the levy through parliament, despite the blowback.</p><p>The government has sold the new levy as \"equipping our emergency services for the future\".</p><p>Treasurer Jaclyn Symes has promised every cent will go into emergency services.</p><p>\"These changes will give emergency services the funding and equipment they need as they face natural disasters which are happening more often and becoming more destructive.\"</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Vicki Ward also stressed the \"modern equipment\" the new fund would provide.</p><p>The government announced $406 million in new funding over five years for emergency services in the 2025 budget and 2024 mid-year budget update.</p><p>This funding includes $110 million for new trucks for the CFA, FRV and VICSES, but it's unclear whether it will be funded through the new levy.</p><p>But this funding would represent barely 5 per cent of the revenue raised by the levy.</p><p>On the other hand, the government has promised 95 per cent of CFA and VICSES's budgets will come from the levy, as well as 90 per cent of FRV's funding.</p><p>An analysis of these budgets showed this was a huge amount of money, so much money that it would suck up the majority of the levy funds. In 2023-24, the government provided $1.07 billion in grant funding to FRV, with the agency also recording a $101 million deficit. In 2023-24, the CFA received $342 million in grant funding and VICSES received $86 million.</p><p>That makes a total of $1.5 billion for the three agencies, with FRV making up more than 70 per cent.</p><p>But those were the grant costs in 2023-24, so what are they likely to be in 2025-26, the first year of the levy?</p><p>CFA and VICSES funding has only grown minimally over the past few years, and the government has given no indication of a rise in grant funding, so it is likely they will be about $350 million and $90 million.</p><p>But FRV's costs have risen hugely since the organisation was founded in 2020. On average, they have risen by $100 million every year. If they keep rising at the same rate, FRV's grant funding could be close to $1.3 billion in 2025-26.</p><p>If the government provides 90 per cent of this funding from the levy, that would be more than $1.15 billion.</p><p>The new levy was only projected to raise $1.62 billion in 2025-26, meaning FRV would soak up 70 per cent of the money.</p><p>This would leave barely enough for the promised CFA and VICSES funding, let alone other services like Triple Zero Victoria, Emergency Management Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria, which are also supposed to be funded through the levy.</p><p>The government told ACM there was \"sufficient forecast revenue\" to cover the promised costs.</p><p>Victorian Nationals leader and opposition emergency services spokesperson Danny O'Brien said the figures showed the levy was just a cost-shifting exercise.</p><p>\"Labor needs to explain in detail whether our emergency services are actually getting any benefit from a $3 billion new tax.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/134792293/5e0671c5-0308-4133-aff6-da2b7e95eb41.JPG\">Premier Jacinta Allan at last week's announcement.

Head north for tropical warmth or immerse yourself in some of the state's cooler climes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brisbane</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's manta ray season all year long in the waters surrounding Lady Elliot Island but it reaches fever pitch in winter. For those pressed for time,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.emporiumhotels.com.au/\"> Emporium South Bank</url> in Brisbane offers the chance to snorkel with squadrons of the graceful giants, wrapped up in a two-night Reef &amp; Retreat getaway. Pairing a pampered stay at the hotel, guests are then flown to the eco island resort for an action-packed day, with glass-bottom boat tour, guided snorkelling, fish feeding and a tropical buffet lunch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the British &amp; Irish Lions descend on Brisbane for two matches (July 2 and 19), guests at the new<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.minorhotels.com/en/destinations/australia/brisbane/queens-wharf-residences\"> Queens Wharf Residences </url>will have their home away from home sorted. There are more than 200 well-appointed apartments in the tallest tower of the Queen's Wharf Precinct,  delivering river and botanic garden views, plus in-room amenities by Elysia Wellness Retreat. Footy fever or not, it makes for a chic city stay, with a new public art trail to wander, a wine lounge, sauna and steam room.</p><p>Tropical North QLD </p><p>Swap the southern chill for the swaying palms and lagoon pools of the Sheraton Grand Mirage  in Port Douglas, home base for Australia's premier tropical food festival. At <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tasteportdouglas.com.au/\">Taste Port Douglas (August 7-10)</url>, guests can mingle with master chefs, join cooking classes and walk off indulgent meals along golden sands. Highlights include the Long Lunch series beneath the sprawling canopies of poinciana trees in Market Park, and the theatrical Flames of the Forest fire show set deep in the Daintree Rainforest. Festival packages are available. </p><p>After three seasons in the Med, the 41m Benetti superyacht <url normalizedValue=\"https://morrisnautical.au/\">MY Northern Escape</url> has been relocated to Cairns. During the winter months, migrating dwarf minke and humpback whales add an extra layer of excitement to tailored itineraries. Most requested is a five- to seven-night journey from Cairns to Lizard Island, with stops to dive or snorkel the Ribbon Reefs. Or kick things up a notch with the new Outback to Ocean package, connecting Luxury Lodges of Australia member Mt Mulligan Lodge with a bespoke Morris Nautical Charter and a stay at Orpheus Island resort or the ultra-private and chic house on Pelorus Island.</p><p>Gold Coast Hinterland </p><p>It's hard to think of an Australian hot tub with a more surprising view than that of the one cleverly perched at the edge of <url normalizedValue=\"https://vhcountryestate.com.au/\">Verandah House Country Estate, Mount Tamborine</url>. The cedar tub offers not only a magnesium soak but a glimpse of distant Gold Coast skyscrapers. Life here is a world away from the Glitter Strip. Think cheeky king parrots eyeing your breakfast, crackling in-room fireplaces and an onsite barrel sauna. It's enough to attract celebrity guests such as actor Jude Law. </p><p>Scenic Rim </p><p>Just over an hour's drive from Brisbane,  Spicers Hidden Vale is well known among foodies. They flock to<url normalizedValue=\"https://spicersretreats.com/retreats/spicers-hidden-vale/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=gmb\"> the rural retreat's </url>Homage restaurant for languid lunches starring local ingredients such as Marburg emu and Toowoomba beef (request a table on the deck with its striking views overlooking the infinity pool and mango tree). Fully relax by overnighting in a heritage cottage or contemporary cabin with a soaring stone fireplace and outdoor bath on a secluded deck. Say hi to the kangaroos that pop by to graze the lawns. </p><p>Sunshine Coast Hinterland </p><p>On a working farm in Kin Kin, <url normalizedValue=\"https://mayanfarm.com.au/\">Mayan Farm </url>pairs pastoral charm with quiet luxury just 40\u00a0minutes from Noosa. Four new rammed-earth villas sit gently on the land, two with outdoor spas, two welcoming pets, all with views\u00a0that overlook Kin Kin Creek and tucked\u00a0away from the bite of westerly winds. Days unfold slowly here: a pottery class, horse riding, perhaps a long lunch prepared by a private chef. As evening falls, smoke drifts from\u00a0the outdoor kitchen with six grills and a pizza oven.</p><p>K'gari/Fraser Island</p><p>Winter on the Fraser Coast brings a rare kind of magic. Migrating humpback whales don't simply cruise by; they stay and play in the warm waters of Hervey Bay. From mid-July to late October, <url normalizedValue=\"https://fraserislandboatcharters.com.au/\">Fraser Island Boat Charters </url>offers private, skippered multi-day sailings aboard luxury catamaran K'gari Breeze, with tailored itineraries and seafood caught fresh each day. Guests can expect up-close encounters with the cetaceans, the chance to swim alongside them, and to be lulled to sleep by their songs captured by the onboard hydraphone.</p><p>Magnetic Island </p><p>It's always summer on Magnetic, the modest Queensland island off the Townsville coast where national park meets the Great Barrier Reef. Balmy winters signal the onset of whale season - watch them fluking from the beach at Geoffrey Bay - but koalas, rock wallabies and rich birdlife are year-round attractions. Choose from two dozen beaches, four towns, myriad hiking trails and watersport options including half and full-day outings aboard the sailing  yacht <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pilgrimsailing.com.au/\">Pilgrim</url>. To stay, <url normalizedValue=\"https://bestofmagnetic.com/\">Best of Magnetic </url>has a choice selection of villas, apartments and\u00a0houses.</p><p>Torres Strait </p><p>It's just a two-hour flight from Cairns but Horn Island, entry point to the vast Torres Strait archipelago in our far north, feels a world away from the rest of Australia. Base yourself on nearby Thursday Island/Waiben, home to the Gab Titui Cultural Centre, military sights and the nation's most northerly pub. For lofty views take a scenic heli flight with Nautilus Aviation over the tip of the continent. <url normalizedValue=\"https://straitexperience.com.au/\">Strait Experience </url>can organise one  to three-day \u00adadventurous itineraries ex-Cairns. Stay at the self-catering <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.islandvillas.com.au/\">Island Villas</url>.</p><p>NORTHERN TERRITORY</p><p>Uluru</p><p>Running anywhere in the red centre in summer is unthinkable. In July, however, when average daily temperatures hover around 18C, dipping close to zero overnight, jogging becomes a much more palatable proposition. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://australianoutbackmarathon.com/\">Australian Outback Marathon</url> attracts runners to the nation's spiritual heart on July 26 for an event that features full and half marathons plus 11km and 6km fun runs. Routes traverse red dirt tracks, unsealed roads and sand dunes, and whether you're a spectator or a participant, the scenery promises to be spectacular. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ayersrockresort.com.au/offers?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20528846384&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD97UsqVAwRGedNbpUc0bn_MTef2a&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgIXCBhDBARIsAELC9ZicXwbYFkr97d4hh3c53jylnYO67XojpXAM5K-Q7MVjZS9E-xru08kaAlRmEALw_wcB\">Ayers Rock Resort </url>has a range of accommodation to suit all budgets.

About $205m of that will come from farmers.</p><p>The state government said the increase for the average farm was $13 a week, and that active volunteers and life members of VICSES and CFA were exempt from the levy \"in recognition of the work they do to keep us all safe\".</p><p>\"We'll continue to work to pass these changes, because this legislation will give our volunteers and emergency services the tools and resources they need to keep communities safe and save lives,\" the spokesman said Volunteers, however, will have to apply for a rebate on the tax, which will apply to farmland or single farm enterprises. VICSES and CFA volunteers and life members will be eligible for a rebate on their primary places of residence or farms, capped to the value of a $5m farm.</p><p>Revenue from the new tax is intended to fund up to 95 per cent of the budgets for Victoria SES, triple-0, the State Control Centre, Emergency Management Victoria, Emergency Recovery Victoria, and Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:abby.walter@news.com.au\">abby.walter@news.com.au</email></p><p>HAVE YOUR SAY heraldsun.com.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-2506f5182a0f11f09a4813b53b7a49d30f27a354327ba1ea5ee8e313c915dbed</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FS4-G0R3-RRPG-2010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 9, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D05Y</classCode><className>MENTAL HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

These included checking the council's regulations about when and where burning off is permitted, monitoring the weather conditions, ensuring an adequate water supply, cleaning up the perimeter of the burn site beforehand, registering the burn-off, notifying neighbours, and making sure the fire is fully extinguished afterwards.</p><p>Mr Myers said it was important to do a mineral earth line around the burn-off, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/8951877/five-fire-trucks-attend-west-albury-house-blaze-on-april-27/\"> which would prevent the fire from spreading further by removing the fuel. </url></p><p>\"It is quite complacent for people to light a fire and then walk away and leave it. Before you know it, it's spread into areas that weren't intended to be burnt and potentially causing devastation,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's all about remaining vigilant. Controlling a fire on your property is your responsibility. It could be quite an embarrassing phone call to triple zero to request assistance for an out of control fire that you have inadvertently created.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/168477368/8927cd10-e769-4b0e-a3fa-c1fb18620355.jpg\">CFA District 24 assistant chief fire officer Brett Myers says people need to be more vigilant when it comes to burning off, especially with fire restrictions lifting from today.

nitf:lede=\"true\">A weak state budget for agriculture is set to see little boost for Victoria's farmers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Treasurer Jaclyn Symes has announced new funding of just $36.6 million for the state's $20 billion farm sector in the 2025/26 budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The majority of this funding will be directed into biosecurity and disease control and supporting farmers as they adapt to the challenges of climate change.</p><p>A total of $6.1m will be spent on such climate change initiatives, with the exact parameters and reach of the funding yet to specified.</p><p>The state will spend approximately $7.6m next year on extra resourcing and equipment to make sure Agriculture Victoria is ready to respond to future biosecurity emergencies, such as further <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stockandland.com.au/story/8898055/bird-flu-detected-on-third-euroa-property-in-northern-victoria/\"> avian influenza outbreaks </url>.</p><p>A further $9m has been allocated to cover the work of animal welfare organisations, including the work of the RSPCA Inspectorate on behalf of the state.</p><p>This will include the inspection and regulation of dog breeders, for example, an area under the remit of Agriculture Victoria.</p><p>The budget provides $11.3m for pest control over the next year, with $2.1m of this to be spent on the continuation of Victoria's Fox Bounty.</p><p>The remaining $9.2m will be spent on the control of other pests such as deer, feral cats, foxes and pigs.</p><p>However, there will be no new funding for the control of wild dogs, an issue affecting producers across much of the state at present.</p><p>In contrast, $400,000 is budgeted for the development of a new hemp industry, including the cost of forming legislation to bolster the sector.</p><p>Farmers unable to farm sheep due to growing wild dog numbers could get into hemp farming, perhaps.</p><p>The budget invests $1.2m to encourage more women into leadership in agriculture.</p><p>The budget announcement does not include the $15.9m announced on Friday for additional support for drought-hit farmers, nor the $900,000 also announced then for the National Centre for Farmer Health.</p><p>Agriculture Minister Ros Spence said the budget was aimed where farmers needed it most.</p><p>\"Victorian farmers supply the fresh food and produce that feeds our state and beyond,\" she said.</p><p>\"This budget protects them from biosecurity threats and diseases, helping them grow and adapt to our changing climate.\"</p><p>Overall, the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA), in which Agriculture Victoria sits, is budgeted to spend $2.65bn for the financial year 2025/26.</p><p>This is up about $200m on the $2.45bn budgeted for 2024/25.</p><p>Within the DEECA budget, agriculture has been projected to have a total output of $537.2m for 2025/26.</p><p>Of other benefit to rural and regional Victorians, Tuesday's budget allocated $967m in total investment to fix potholes and resurface roads across the state.</p><p>The funding will see the rehabilitation of the San Remo Bridge connecting Philip Island to the mainland.</p><p>It will also be spent on strengthening the Mt Emu Creek Bridge on the Princes Highway West in Terang to accommodate high-productivity freight vehicles.</p><p>There will also be saftey upgrades on the Princes Highway East in Lakes Entrance.</p><p>Elsewhere, Forest Fire Management Victoria is set to get a funding boost.</p><p>With an allocated $23.5m, it will complete planned burns and other critical fuel management to lower bushfire risk.</p><p>The budget also invests $21.1m to protect state parks, forests and beaches.</p><p>Within this, $17.3m will go toward Landcare and Coastcare projects to care for the bush and beaches.</p><p>The additional $3.8m will be spent on creating and maintaining 'Liwik Barring', a wildlife habitat which spans through parts of the farmland in the Yarra Valley and Dandenong ranges.</p><p>Premier Jacinta Allan said the budget was \"focused on what matters most\" and highlighted some of the measures to support families struggling with the high cost of living.</p><p>Public transport will be made free for all those under 18 years old across the state.</p><p>The same provision will be made for seniors at weekends, anywhere in the state.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/229623862/b73e316c-862f-4586-b19b-23cf0273cd52.png\">Treasurer

nitf:lede=\"true\">Farmers and Country Fire Authority volunteers have warned that the government's green agenda worsened the extent and impact of the recent Grampians bushfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They feel a lack of a \"common sense\" approach to forest fire management and prevention meant more <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stockandland.com.au/video/x9bpkgu/victorias-most-endangered-mammal-may-have-survived-grampians-bushfires/\"> wildlife were lost </url> and extra farmland was burned. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Westmere Fire Brigades group officer Pat Millear, Willaura, heads up a team of 18 brigades which protect 400,000 hectares, east of the Grampians. </p><p>He is also captain of his own local Willaura CFA and shares the views of his fellow volunteers. </p><p>The sheep farmer said the Forest Fire Management (FFM) team for the Grampians have a plan for proper bushfire prevention in the state park and need to be allowed to implement it.</p><p>Mr Millear warned that nothing has been learned since the Mount Lubra fires in January 2006 which saw 47 per cent of the Grampians National Park burn. </p><p>\"Forest Fire Management have been trying to manage [prevention] as best they can,\" he said. </p><p>\"But since the Mount Lubra fire in 2006, the green movement is obviously holding them back from burning or putting in strategic breaks which they want to do.</p><p>\"They're fighting them because they don't want them burning more than they have to, knocking over trees or building in containment lines.</p><p>\"We all feel that they have to build bigger containment lines.</p><p>\"The government has got to come in and just oversee this and be really strong.</p><p>\"If this is forest management, it's not working.\"</p><p>Mr Millear suggested that the green agenda preventing FFM from putting in proper fire breaks has meant more wildlife and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stockandland.com.au/video/x9b31si/grampians-bushfire-continues-out-of-control-as-emergency-warning-issued/\"> forest has been lost </url>. </p><p>\"It's been burnt twice now inside 20 years and the wildlife that's been lost has been so significant,\" he said. </p><p>\"We're just lucky we didn't lose any lives in this one.\"</p><p>Mr Millear said the same issue was arising across Victoria's state lands and forests and going forward, the government needed to listen to those in these rural areas. </p><p>\"Local knowledge is second to none and if they just listened to us, it could help people understand more,\" he said.</p><p>He said if fire breaks weren't put in going forward, the same situation would be repeated, where a Grampians bushfire takes hold too quickly and becomes very difficult to control.</p><p>\"Their fall back lines aren't big enough or good enough to stop a running fire in the mountains,\" Mr Millear said. </p><p>\"They can't burn back off anything.</p><p>\"Government just needs to put money into it.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most striking part of the recent effort to control and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stockandland.com.au/story/8860216/grampians-bush-fire-contained-recovery-efforts-underway/\"> eventually contain </url> the Grampians bushfires, was the level of farmer involvement.</p><p>The Westmere group of 18 brigades benefited from the availability of as many as 400 private tankers when fighting the flames.</p><p>Mr Millear said 95pc of these private units were manned by farming men and women. </p><p>Many of these farmers gave up their Christmas to join neighbours and friends at the fire front.</p><p>\"We were a very professional, well organised group,\" he said. </p><p>\"We were really well-planned and our crews were well versed and trained.</p><p>\"They did a really great job.\"</p><p>In total, 76,000 hectares of the national park was burned and a further 9310 hectares of private farm land. </p><p>Mr Millear said the physical and mental toll on the more than 400 volunteers was major and to put salt in their wounds, plans to hike the Fire Service Levy were coming down the track.</p><p>\"All our members are a tough bunch but they're still feeling it,\" he said. </p><p>\"Mentally, it's been a big drain.\"</p><p>He said the levy hike would be fought \"really hard\" and farmers were in talks with the opposition and the Victorian Farmers' Federation. </p><p>\"That's just going to be a massive cost on volunteers,\" he said. </p><p>\"The money won't be spent here.</p><p>\"We'll fight it tooth and nail because it's far from equitable.\"</p><p>However, overall, Mr Millear wished to highlight the bravery and hard work of all those volunteers and farmers who stepped up to control the fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url

nitf:lede=\"true\">Councillors were 'united' in slamming the emergency services tax.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ballarat's mayor says the city is pleased to hear the state government will cap its Emergency Services and Volunteer Fund (ESVF) levy for all primary production properties across Victoria, after councillors labelled the tax increase \"cruel\", \"toxic\" and \"out of touch\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a council meeting on May 28, the council unanimously passed a motion condemning the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8977233/victorias-esvf-how-the-rate-hikes-hit-farmers-and-landowners/\"> new tax </url> as a \"significant financial burden\" on Victorian property owners.</p><p>The motion also called on the city to advocate for the responsibility for the collection of the ESVF to be transferred to the Victorian Treasury and for the council to write to relevant state ministers and local MPs denouncing the new tax.</p><p>Mayor Tracey Hargreaves said she was concerned by the \"significant financial burden\" it would place on residents, but the council was unable to refuse to collect the tax.</p><p>While deputy mayor Ben Taylor said the municipality's emergency services levy total sat at $10 million in 2020, and it would rise to $22 million under the new ESVF.</p><p>It comes after <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Courier </emphasis>revealed that Ballarat ratepayers would see an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8975191/new-esvf-levy-hits-ballarat-ratepayers-with-34-per-cent-increase/\"> average increase </url> in emergency services-related payments of 45.9 per cent.</p><p>This includes a 34 per cent increase in levy charges for residential property owners on their 2025-26 rates notices, while primary production properties are facing a 148 per cent increase.</p><p>The ESVF, which was passed by parliament in the early hours of May 16, is replacing the cheaper Fire Services Property Levy and has been met <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8888286/ballarat-mayor-criticises-state-government-triggered-rates-rise/\"> with widespread fury </url> from rural residents and councils, who feel disproportionately affected by the new tax.</p><p>Under the ESVF, additional funds will go to services including VICSES, Triple Zero Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria, which were not supported by the previous levy.</p><p>Just days later, on Friday, May 30, the government announced that the levy would be capped at the 2024/25 rate for all primary production properties across the state for the coming financial year. </p><p>\"We understand that the rate for primary production properties will remain at 28.7, the same as it was in 2024/25 for the duration of the 2025/26 financial year,\" Cr Hargreaves said, following the announcement. </p><p>\"This is hard-fought recognition of the unique difficulties farmers are currently facing in devastating drought conditions.</p><p>\"Despite this welcome reprieve for farmers, council remains committed to the motion that was passed on Wednesday night in which all nine councillors voted to formally oppose the Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund and the mandated requirement to collect it on behalf of the state government.\"</p><p>On Wednesday night, the first to speak in favour of the motion was councillor Ted Lapkin, who called the ESVF a \"crushing burden\" for Victorian farmers.</p><p>In an impassioned speech, Cr Lapkin quoted protester placards, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Financial Review</emphasis> and an 1819 US Supreme Court decision, and compared the City of Ballarat to ancient Roman tax collectors.</p><p>He also called on the community to pressure their local MPs over the \"outrageous tax\".</p><p>\"To this Labor government, country Victoria is expendable and exploitable, it sees rural regions as a source of low-hanging revenue fruit that can be taxed to the hilt,\" he said.</p><p>\"The Victorian government's emergency services tax will destroy livelihoods and perhaps even lives ... we must express our dissent in the strongest possible terms.</p><p>\"Only if ordinary Victorians exert sustained political pressure do we stand any chance at all of repealing and reversing this toxic tax.\"</p><p>Cr Lapkin's motion was then seconded by councillor Jay Morrison, who was also critical of the burden the ESVF would put on the city's ratepayers.</p><p>\"The timing of this levy could not be worse; we are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are not just making a statement, we are taking action, we are standing up for our community and are calling for a better, fairer approach.\"</p><p>When voicing his support for the motion, Cr Taylor said it would send a \"clear message\" that the tax was unacceptable, particularly for businesses and farmers who would experience the steepest rises.</p><p>Councillor Des Hudson recommended that future rates notices should highlight how much money would go to the ESVF, and also include contact information for state MPs so ratepayers could voice their concerns regarding the tax.</p><p>\"This is unfair, it's a burden, it's at a time when we can least afford it, and we deserve a better outcome,\" he said.</p><p>Councillor Samantha McIntosh and councillor Damon Saunders both cited concerns for farmers' mental health while outlining their support for the motion.</p><p>\"This cruel impost is going to create mental health problems,\" Cr Saunders said.</p><p>\"This cruel and sneaky tax is abhorrent.\"</p><p>In also opposing the ESVF, councillor Jim Rinaldi said members of the state government \"wouldn't have any idea what it's like to struggle for a dollar\" and that they were \"out of touch\" with the ordinary person.</p><p>Finally, councillor Tess Morgan said she was \"proud to hear a united voice among councillors\" and urged the council to keep its share of the rates low when it came to its forthcoming budget.</p><p>\"I'm proud this appears to be a [council] group aware of the cost of living,\" she said.</p><p>On Tuesday, neighbouring council Hepburn Shire passed a similar motion, which voiced strong opposition to the ESVF.</p><p>In a press release, the Hepburn Shire stated it would \"join the many other councils opposing the levy\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/200884286/32c15ca9-a212-4b80-ac2b-780e0f993265.jpg\">City of

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

To find a day this hot so late in April takes a bit of effort, and we have to go further back in the records.</p><p>\"We got to 33.8 degrees on April 13, 1985, and we got to 34.4 degrees on April 17 back in 1922. It's not impossible to get days this hot late in April, but it's not very often.\"</p><p>The temperature will drop today to an expected top of 23 degrees with the possibility of a few showers in the morning.</p><p>But Timcke said the weather was forecast to warm up again later in the week as Easter began.</p><p>\"We get another high that moves in over the Tasman Sea so the winds go northerly again, and we get a few warmer days towards the end of the week,\" he said.</p><p>\"It looks like 26 degrees for Tuesday, 29 degrees for Wednesday and Thursday, and then 28 for Friday. So we've got a few warmer days to finish off the week.\"</p><p>Timcke said the warm weekend had been the result of a hot air mass in the north of Victoria.</p><p>\"That's directed more northerly winds over us and dragged some of that hot air down from the north because we've had a pretty good run of pretty hot days over the north of the state for a while now,\" Timcke said.</p><p>\"So the northerly has just brought some of that hot air down from the north.\"</p><p>Firefighters battled a bushfire four kilometres south-west of Daylesford yesterday afternoon.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria said 72 vehicles and 250 firefighters were fighting the fire that had burnt through more than 96 hectares of land..</p><p>A watch-and-act warning was in place yesterday for the communities of Musk Vale, Sailors Falls and Sailors Hill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc806tlz0p9cxmi5eiwv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJN-91G3-RTDB-T24C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 14, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DUIZ</classCode><className>SEAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000A2L8</classCode><className>PACIFIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Through a free online resource hub, first responders can find specially designed content, including videos about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and suicide prevention, along with mental health tips, educational articles and contacts for occupationally aware support groups and counselors in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's support for wildland firefighting efforts in the Pacific Northwest began in the aftermath of the Yacolt Burn in 1902, when the company began advocating for Washington's first forest fire legislation and the funding of community fire prevention education and patrols. Today, as Weyerhaeuser celebrates its 125th anniversary, the company continues to play an active role in fire prevention and response through its forest management operations. Weyerhaeuser employees and contractors receive annual fire readiness training, build fire breaks and containment lines, conduct aerial surveys and deploy tanker trucks, helicopters and quick-response crews to wildland fires.</p><p>\"After launching the Fighting Fires Together campaign with FBHA four years ago, we're proud to continue this effort to support wildland firefighters and their mental health as they work in challenging conditions to protect our communities,\" says Bill Frings, vice president of Western Timberlands for Weyerhaeuser.</p><p>SECTION 4 THE PAST QUARTER: NEWS AND BUZZ</p><p>4.1 Stock Buzz</p><p>Source: Other Publishers</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_20\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"424\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Aug</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Publisher</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Thu 21</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Weyerhaeuser (WY) Receives a Buy from RBC Capital</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">The Globe and Mail</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Thu 21</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">DA Davidson Keeps Buy on Weyerhaeuser (WY) After Q2 Results</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Yahoo Finance UK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Fri 15</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">How Much Would It Take To Earn $100 A Month From Weyerhaeuser Stock</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Yahoo Finance</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Please view more Stock Buzz stories in DATA DOWNLOAD CENTER</p><p>SECTION 5  10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>SECTION 6 BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.18% is 0.74 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.31%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_21\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.18</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.31</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.13</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.2% is better than the Index average of 1.0%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.2%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.0% is 324.5%.

Photo: Jackie Peacock</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the early hours of Friday May 16, Labor and members of the Animal Justice Party, The Greens and Legalise Cannabis Party, colluded with the Allan Labor Government to pass their latest tax, the Emergency Services and \u2018Volunteers\u2019 Fund. Those hardest hit by the tax will be country Victorians, a large portion of those CFA volunteers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Nationals Member for Murray Plains, Peter Walsh, has labelled the new Emergency Services Levy as a land tax by stealth \u2013 targeting the farming community in particular \u2013 and as \u201csocialism gone mad in Victoria\u201d.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Front-2.jpg\">Protesters gathered at the steps of parliament house on Thursday. Photo: Jackie Peacock</url></p><p>He said the new \u2018levy\u2019 is the Allan Labor government \u201cconniving to push through an unprecedented and deliberate land tax on farms\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAgricultural land, which is what feeds and clothes this state, and this country, has rightly been exempt for this traditionally pernicious cash grab for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>Walsh said this is now about every property in Victoria being hit with an increased land tax. </p><p>\u201cWith this tax the Premier and her bloated bureaucracy are ignoring the voices of everyday Victorians who are saying enough is enough,\u201d Mr Walsh added.</p><p>\u201cLabor has wasted tens of billions of dollars on cost blowouts on its ridiculous and corruption-riddled major projects in Melbourne, and now they want to have a land tax to make up that huge black hole,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis is Labor showing its contempt for the common people and giving us a frightening glimpse of its socialist lunacy.\u201d</p><p>Gannawarra Shire Council has joined municipalities across Victoria to oppose the State Government\u2019s implementation of the Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund.</p><p>The fund, to come into effect from July, will replace the Fire Services Levy and will be used to support VICSES, Triple Zero Victoria, the State Control Centre, Forest Fire Management Victoria and Emergency Recovery Victoria, as well as the Country Fire Authority (CFA) and Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV).</p><p>As with the former Fire Services Levy, local government will be responsible for collecting payment as part of the annual municipal rates process, with the amount each landowner is required to pay to increase compared to the previous levy. The amount this will increase will depend on the property\u2019s land classification.</p><p>\u201cMy fellow Councillors and I outrightly oppose this unjustifiable levy that all landowners in the Gannawarra Shire will face. We must stand up for our community against this blatant cash grab,\u201d Mayor Garner Smith said.</p><p>\u201cMany of our landowners have already been hit with massive increases in land tax, and this new tax is estimated to take millions of dollars away from our residents. This will have a flow-on effect on our local businesses and sectors, especially the agriculture sector.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Front-3.jpg\">Protesters gathered at the steps of parliament house on Thursday. Photo: Jackie Peacock</url></p><p>\u201cAll this levy will do is fund activities and organisations that have previously been funded out of general tax revenue. The State Government must show the people of Gannawarra how the money raised from this levy will flow back to our community.\u201d</p><p> As part of its opposition to the implementation of the fund, Gannawarra Shire Council requests that the Municipal Association of Victoria and Rural Councils Victoria investigate ways councils can avoid collecting this funding from landowners.</p><p> \u201cThe expense and administrative burden our staff will face in determining the cost of this levy, then asking landowners to pay, will be huge,\u201d Mayor Smith said.</p><p> \u201cThe State Government has options available for collecting this levy, including the State Revenue Office, which collects land tax on behalf of the government</p><p>\u201cIt is important that our residents know that this decision has nothing to do with Council. My fellow Councillors, Council staff and I will take every opportunity to raise our objection to this levy with the State Government on behalf of our community.\u201d</p><p>Jackie Peacock, a digital creator from near St Arnaud Victoria, attended the rally and said morale in her community was very low. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of people getting more desperate and maybe not being themselves,\u201d said Jackie. </p><p>\u201cI think they are really feeling like they\u2019re unheard and they don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir mental health thing is something that\u2019s probably not being fully recognised, especially out here when we don\u2019t have good opportunities to seek professional help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real worry.

Please make sure you are over prepared when doing any burning off and do not be complacent. Just because summer is over and our days are colder does not mean fires are not a risk,\" Cape Clear CFA said in a social media post.</p><p>\"We are going to continue to see above average fire behaviour, and greater intensity of fire behaviour than we normally see at this time of year,\" Mr Redman said.</p><p>\"The bush ... and native grassland and stubble will still burn quite well.\"</p><p>That type of fire is exactly what the Australian and New Zealand Fire and Emergency Services Council (AFAC) Seasonal Bushfire Outlook for winter warns is likely across the region.</p><p>March and April saw the fourth-highest temperatures on record,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8972675/water-pumped-to-ballarat-via-superpipe-after-six-year-hiatus/\"> below-average rainfall </url>across much of Victoria and an extension of the Fire Danger Period in some parts of the state for the first time since 2019.</p><p>These conditions, coupled with existing underlying dryness, have led to a higher level of dried grass and vegetation. </p><p>The increased risk isn't for long-running bushfires, but events caused by uncontrolled burn-offs and other activities.</p><p>Just 13.8 millimetres of rain fell in Ballarat during May making it the driest month since March 2024. The average rainfall for the month of May in Ballarat is 63.9 millimetres.</p><p>Fires are possible on dry and windy days in areas with dry or cured vegetation.</p><p>While the small amount of rain has created a \"green tinge\" across paddocks and grassland, Mr Redman warned it was still dry.</p><p>A green drought</p><p>\"We haven't had enough rain to promote growth but there will be a green tinge,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's a green drought ... dams are dry and farmers are having to destock. If and when we do get rain we will see prolific grass growth, then they won't have the stock to graze the grass out, so longer term we might experience more fires.\"</p><p>Mr Redman said burnoffs and campfires would remain a particular concern, especially if windy conditions are forecast.</p><p>\"Be mindful when doing burns. Look at the forecast and if it's going to windy, looking as far out (at the forecast) as you can see ... if there's a day of wind we probably advice don't go ahead with the burn off,\" he said.</p><p>\"And the bush remains so dry. If you have a campfire in the bush, look at the conditions, the wind, and make sure you fully extinguish it when you finish.\"</p><p>Campfire warning</p><p>Forest Fire Management has also issued a warning around campfires, in the lead-up to the King's Birthday long weekend.</p><p>FFMV chief fire officer Chris Hardman said with cooler temperatures settling in, it might feel like the fire risk had passed but campfires could quickly escape and become devastating bushfires.</p><p>\"Even at this time of year, just one unattended or poorly managed campfire can cause serious damage to the environment and put lives and property at risk,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>\"This season, we've responded to more than 370 incidents involving campfires. This included the Boroka Lookout Fire, where an illegal campfire turned into a bushfire in difficult terrain, on the edge of the cliff diverting resources responding to bushfires in the Grampians National Park.\"</p><p>Mr Redman said the winter bushfire outlook meant there would likely be little respite for CFA crews already exhausted from a long and intense summer bushfire period.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're not seeing any respite before the next fire season,\" he said.</p><p>Acting CFA chief officer Garry Cook urged people not to become complacent in winter.</p><p>\"The lack of rainfall and dry vegetation across many parts of the state is a great concern for firefighters this time of the year and we're asking people to remain vigilant and not become complacent just because we're not in summer anymore,\" Mr Cook said.</p><p>\"While cooler days are arriving, the landscape remains dry enough to allow fires to start and spread quickly if a burn-off gets out of control, especially when coupled with strong winds.</p><p>\"The impact and damage of an escaped fire on local communities and emergency services can be devastating.\"</p><p>Winter is a time when traditionally the CFA switch to fire safety messaging around smoke alarms, checking appliances and ensuring home chimney flues are cleaned prior to using but there would still need to be a focus on bushfire and grassfires.</p><p>While normal rainfall is expected across parts of Victoria, last week Bureau of Meteorology climatologist Jonathan Pollock said Ballarat could expect average rainfall for June but there were \"strong signals\" of lower than average rainfall in July and August.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/michelle.smith/d6a215a1-8180-457c-a3d7-5ae4a40898b4.jpg\">Firefighters tackled a blaze at Mount Buninyong in March.

I mean, come on, you can't have it both ways.\"</p><p>Mr O'Brien stood alongside <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/8948372/regional-funding-battle-heats-up-ahead-of-bendigo-elections/\"> Victorian upper house member Gaelle Broad </url> criticising the Allan government's 2025/26 budget for not delivering for Bendigo.</p><p>\"There are things on paper, but it's whether or not the actual government delivers on what they say because time and time again, they've said big things, they've talked the big talk, but we haven't seen that in reality,\" Ms Broad said.</p><p>She said the government didn't have any left over to fund Bendigo projects, such as an upgrade to intersection in Maiden Gully that could lead to thousands of homes being built.</p><p>The Nationals and Liberals in Victoria announced they would \"scrap\" the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/8968285/cfa-brigades-go-offline-to-protest-emergency-services-levy/\"> emergency services levy </url> if voted in at the 2026 state election.</p><p>Mr O'Brien said regional Victorians would be hit worst by the levy, which would fund services provided by Fire Rescue Victoria and the Country Fire Authority.</p><p>The Victorian government said the Emergency Services and Volunteers Levy would expand the services funded by the existing Fire Services Property Levy to include VICSES, Triple Zero Victoria, the State Control Centre, Forest Fire Management and Emergency Recovery Victoria.</p><p>Funds raised would go towards vital life-saving equipment, vehicles, staff, training for volunteers, community education and recovery support, the state government said.</p><p>\"The new emergency services tax is $3 billion of extra cost to Victoria over the next four years,\" Mr O'Brien said.</p><p>\"In Bendigo, the additional cost here for that tax is going to be $8 million out of this city. That's a big hit, that's money not being spent in our local economies, in our local shops, it's an impact on businesses ... that's why the Liberals and Nationals have promised to scrap that tax.\"</p><p>The federal Nationals ran a strong campaign at the federal election, with star candidate Andrew Lethlean closing the gap to retaining MP Lisa Chesters.</p><p>Mr O'Brien hinted the Victorian Nationals would look to do something similar at the November 2026 state election.</p><p>\"Certainly, post the federal election, we think there's an opportunity for us to establish a stronger presence here in Bendigo,\" he said. \"We've already got Gaelle [Broad] based here as the upper house member, we've had that for over a number of years and we think that regional cities are looking for an opportunity to vote differently. The federal election showed that they're prepared to put their faith in the Nationals when we have a good candidate, a great, strong local champion, and we'll certainly be continuing to be here and establish that presence.\"</p><p>It was unclear at this time if Mr Lethlean would contest the state election.</p><p>\"Andrew did an absolutely stellar job here in Bendigo and we would hope that we'll have a similar candidate for the state election when it comes up next year,\" Mr O'Brien said. </p><p>The Nationals have contested Ms Allan's seat of Bendigo East once in the past three years, with Ms Broad receiving 16 per cent of the primary vote in 2018.</p><p>Ms Allan won the 2022 election with 60.8 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote.</p><p>The seat of Bendigo East appears to be more of a target for the Victorian Coalition, with Bendigo West held comfortably by MP Maree Edwards since 2010. </p><p>Ms Allan said she would \"continue to fight hard\" for her electorate.</p><p>\"As a proud Bendigo local, it's a true privilege to represent the community of Bendigo East in Parliament - and I'll continue to work hard every single day. This election offered a clear choice - and the people of Bendigo chose a government that's on their side. Lisa Chesters offered a future that says yes to Medicare, renewable energy, free TAFE, infrastructure, workers' rights, and the values of opportunity and compassion, while the Nationals ran a fly-in campaign that spent millions, paid volunteers and couldn't buy genuine local trust in Bendigo.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/189568677/36e6cff3-cd06-4c02-b17f-6ef392cd5d89.jpg\">Member for Northern Victoria Gaelle Broad and leader of the Victorian National Party Danny O'Brien.

Real emission reduction must be the aim.</p><p>But achieving that is difficult. As Professor Richard Eckard of Melbourne University noted regarding his research at Jigsaw Farms in Victoria, carbon sequestration through forestry is only a temporary fix and \"unless you do something about the methane, you're not going to stay net zero.\" Research from Central Queensland University - using water-soluble methane-reducing additives in paddock water - is promising. The four World Angus Forum sessions in Brisbane on carbon and methane emissions could make valuable reading in this paper.</p><p>Ray Peck, Hawthorn</p><p>Compensation cry We cannot afford to lose experienced and dedicated CFA volunteers. But according to the government's website, \"active volunteers and life members of the CFA\" are exempt. It also says, \"single farm enterprises\" will receive concessions.</p><p>Most income will come from city ratepayers. But even here, pensioners and veterans will receive concessions.</p><p>Where farmers use their own time and equipment to fight fires or participate in roadside burns, this should be appropriately recognised and compensated.</p><p>Where planned burns by Forest Fire Management Victoria escape, as happened recently near Daylesford, the state government should pay compensation to those farmers who used their own equipment to fight it. The federal government should implement a \"polluters pay\" levy on coal and gas producers proposed by senior economists Ross Garnaut and Rod Sims.</p><p>It would raise about $100bn per annum and would help regional communities increasingly threatened by climate-fuelled fires and floods.</p><p>Sue Rechter, Talbot</p><p>Hurt hits harder Farmers across Victoria, particularly in the southwest, are facing the worst drought in decades.</p><p>Dams are drying out, and a lack of rain over the Easter break means even if it does rain now, it's unlikely any feed will grow over winter due to the cold temperatures.</p><p>There is very little fodder available in Victoria, South Australia or most of NSW.</p><p>This scarcity has a double impact on the cost of keeping stock alive, with both fodder prices and the cost to freight across increasing distances soaring.</p><p>Last month, the South Australian government boosted its drought support to $73m, including much needed fodder and water freight relief, mental health support and even significant rebates on the emergency services tax.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Victoria, instead of expanding support to our farmers like other states, the Allan Labor government has slugged Victoria's food producers with a huge new tax.</p><p>Regional communities and farmers are set to be hit hardest with tax hikes up to 189 per cent.

responsible.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A truck crash that left 60 head ofcattle dead, dying and injured by the side of a road in north-west Victoria has prompted calls for a better animal welfare response from state authorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Warning: This story contains images of dead animals that some readers may find distressing.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the livestock carrier rolled near the small town of Patchewollock on February 11, a total of five state government agencies, two local councils, and two insurance companies were called in to respond.</p><p>But none claimed responsibility for removing the carcasses, euthanasing the injured cattle, rounding up the runaways, or providing food and water.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, farmers were left to deal with the mess and the bureaucratic buck-passing that followed.</p><p>Patchewollock farmer Ash Jackson found himself as the point of contact on the ground, fielding hundreds of calls from various agencies for days.</p><p>\"Over 70 phone calls I had for the day on Wednesday and then same again on Thursday, backwards and forwards,\" Mr Jackson said.</p><p>Those agencies included Victoria Police, Agriculture Victoria, Forest Fire Management Victoria, Parks Victoria, VicRoads, Mildura Rural City Council, Yarriambiack Shire Council, a livestock agency, a transport company<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis>and insurance companies Elders and Sedgwick.</p><p>The ABC understands that, three weeks later, seven head of cattle remain on the loose.</p><h>A brief timeline</h><p>When the cattle truck rolled on that Tuesday evening in February, 13 animals died and the remainder fled the scene.</p><p>The 60-year-old driver of the truck was not injured.</p><p>Mr Jackson was called in and spent three hours with local CFA crews dragging dead and injured cattle from the truck.</p><p>\"The tow truck company were going to take the dead cattle on the ground away, however, [Agriculture Victoria] made contact and said they'd take care of everything,\" Mr Jackson said.</p><p>That never happened.</p><p>When Mr Jackson returned on Wednesday morning, he said the carcasses were untouched, and 16 head of cattle were walking on the road \"looking around for what to do and where to go\".</p><p>He again made contact with Agriculture Victoria, as he understood them to be the agency in charge, and was told \"there was no plan in place\".</p><p>Over the next few days, as temperatures soared into the 40s, Mr Jackson was promised \"all sorts of things\" from Agriculture Victoria \u2014 planes, gyrocopters, holding yards, troughs, water, feed, signage, and a \"clean-up crew for the carcasses\".</p><p>\"At one point, there were people organised to come on horseback, and sure enough that never happened,\" Mr Jackson said.</p><p>In text messages seen by the ABC, Agriculture Victoria conceded the operation had been \"a balls-up\".\u00a0</p><p>Mr Jackson said the only action taken by any organisation was to remove VicRoads signage that warned locals about cattle on the road.</p><p>\"Now locals think [the] job is done and everyone else passing through has no clue of any hazards,\" he wrote in a text message to Agriculture Victoria.</p><p>Patchewollock farmer Simon Grigg \u2014 one of many who volunteered to help \u2014\u00a0called the response an \"absolute disgrace\" and said no-one had any idea who was in control or responsible for the animals.</p><p>\"If a farmer did this, we'd be prosecuted,\" Mr Grigg said.</p><p>\"A couple of these animals collapsed and died when we tried to give them water and [Agriculture Victoria] claim to be worried about cruelty to animals.\"</p><p>Agriculture Victoria did not comment on whether its handling of the incident constituted an animal welfare issue.</p><p>RSPCA Victoria told the ABC this was a matter for Agriculture Victoria.</p><p>\"Any matters regarding more than 10 head of commercial livestock are under their jurisdiction \u2014 this is part of the [Memorandum of Understanding] RSPCA Victoria have with them,\" a spokesperson said.</p><h>Who's responsible?</h><p>In short, no-one knows.</p><p>Victoria Police, whose officers were first on scene and initially in charge deferred the case to Forest Fire Management Victoria and Parks Victoria.</p><p>Parks Victoria does not manage state forests, the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action [DEECA] does.</p><p>DEECA, who gave the ABC a joint statement on behalf of Forest Fire Management Victoria and Agriculture Victoria, did not comment on which agency was responsible but said it was \"working with local authorities and the livestock carrier to capture the\u00a0remaining cattle\".</p><p>In an earlier statement, a spokesperson for Agriculture Victoria \u2014\u00a0which, according to local farmers, assumed the role of chief liaison \u2014\u00a0said it assisted with animal welfare concerns at traffic incidents \"when requested\".</p><p>However, the ABC understands that the bulk of the clean-up and care of cattle post-accident was done by farmers.</p><p>While wandering cattle are typically the responsibility of local shires, both Yarriambiack and Mildura councils said this case was not their responsibility because the stock were wandering in a state park.</p><p>Yarriambiack Shire Council officers directed the ABC to Victoria Police, the Department of Transport and Planning, and Mildura City Council, while Mildura council officers directed the ABC to Victoria Police and Agriculture Victoria.</p><p>The Department of Transport and Planning said its jurisdiction was exclusively roads and traffic management.</p><p>Meanwhile, the livestock agent said this was an issue for Agriculture Victoria and insurance companies.</p><p>The two relevant insurance companies declined to comment.</p><p>The ABC understands one of the insurance companies assigned a maritime expert to assess the cattle truck rollover, which allegedly caused a hold-up in the clean-up.</p><h>Who should be responsible?</h><p>According to Emergency Management Victoria's State Emergency Management Plan, Victoria Police is responsible for road crashes and Agriculture Victoria manages anything involving animal welfare.</p><p>But the chief operating officer of Livestock and Rural Transporters Association of Victoria, Alina Hawkins, said the \"first point of contact\" for any emergency involving heavy vehicles carrying livestock should be the national hotline LivestockAssist.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, in this case, the protocol was not followed due to extraordinary circumstances,\" Ms Hawkins said.</p><p>She said, typically, LivestockAssist would liaise with Agriculture Victoria on incidents like this, and the two agencies would coordinate the clean-up and after-care in conjunction with the livestock carrier, cattle owners, and tow truck operator.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

nitf:lede=\"true\">Councillors were 'united' in slamming the emergency services tax.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ballarat's mayor says the city is pleased to hear the state government will cap its Emergency Services and Volunteer Fund (ESVF) levy for all primary production properties across Victoria, after councillors labelled the tax increase \"cruel\", \"toxic\" and \"out of touch\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a council meeting on May 28, 2025, the council unanimously passed a motion condemning the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8977233/victorias-esvf-how-the-rate-hikes-hit-farmers-and-landowners/\"> new tax </url> as a \"significant financial burden\" on Victorian property owners.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The motion also called on the city to advocate for the responsibility for the collection of the ESVF to be transferred to the Victorian Treasury and for the council to write to relevant state ministers and local MPs denouncing the new tax.</p><p>Mayor Tracey Hargreaves said she was concerned by the \"significant financial burden\" it would place on residents, but the council was unable to refuse to collect the tax.</p><p>While deputy mayor Ben Taylor said the municipality's emergency services levy total sat at $10 million in 2020, and it would rise to $22 million under the new ESVF.</p><p>It comes after <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Courier </emphasis>revealed that Ballarat ratepayers would see an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8975191/new-esvf-levy-hits-ballarat-ratepayers-with-34-per-cent-increase/\"> average increase </url> in emergency services-related payments of 45.9 per cent.</p><p>This includes a 34 per cent increase in levy charges for residential property owners on their 2025-26 rates notices, while primary production properties are facing a 148 per cent increase.</p><p>The ESVF, which was passed by parliament in the early hours of May 16, is replacing the cheaper Fire Services Property Levy and has been met <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8888286/ballarat-mayor-criticises-state-government-triggered-rates-rise/\"> with widespread fury </url> from rural residents and councils, who feel disproportionately affected by the new tax.</p><p>Under the ESVF, additional funds will go to services including VICSES, Triple Zero Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria, which were not supported by the previous levy.</p><p>Just days later, on Friday, May 30, the government announced that the levy would be capped at the 2024/25 rate for all primary production properties across the state for the coming financial year. </p><p>\"We understand that the rate for primary production properties will remain at 28.7, the same as it was in 2024/25 for the duration of the 2025/26 financial year,\" Cr Hargreaves said, following the announcement. </p><p>\"This is hard-fought recognition of the unique difficulties farmers are currently facing in devastating drought conditions.</p><p>\"Despite this welcome reprieve for farmers, council remains committed to the motion that was passed on Wednesday night in which all nine councillors voted to formally oppose the Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund and the mandated requirement to collect it on behalf of the state government.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESVF a 'crushing burden' for rate payers</emphasis></p><p>On Wednesday night, the first to speak in favour of the motion was councillor Ted Lapkin, who called the ESVF a \"crushing burden\" for Victorian farmers.</p><p>In an impassioned speech, Cr Lapkin quoted protester placards, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Financial Review</emphasis> and an 1819 US Supreme Court decision, and compared the City of Ballarat to ancient Roman tax collectors.</p><p>He also called on the community to pressure their local MPs over the \"outrageous tax\".</p><p>\"To this Labor government, country Victoria is expendable and exploitable, it sees rural regions as a source of low-hanging revenue fruit that can be taxed to the hilt,\" he said.</p><p>\"The Victorian government's emergency services tax will destroy livelihoods and perhaps even lives ... we must express our dissent in the strongest possible terms.</p><p>\"Only if ordinary Victorians exert sustained political pressure do we stand any chance at all of repealing and reversing this toxic tax.\"</p><p>Cr Lapkin's motion was then seconded by councillor Jay Morrison, who was also critical of the burden the ESVF would put on the city's ratepayers.</p><p>\"The timing of this levy could not be worse; we are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are not just making a statement, we are taking action, we are standing up for our community and are calling for a better, fairer approach.\"</p><p>When voicing his support for the motion, Cr Taylor said it would send a \"clear message\" that the tax was unacceptable, particularly for businesses and farmers who would experience the steepest rises.</p><p>Councillor Des Hudson recommended that future rates notices should highlight how much money would go to the ESVF, and also include contact information for state MPs so ratepayers could voice their concerns regarding the tax.</p><p>\"This is unfair, it's a burden, it's at a time when we can least afford it, and we deserve a better outcome,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Mental health problems': Concerns for farmers highlighted </emphasis></p><p>Councillor Samantha McIntosh and councillor Damon Saunders both cited concerns for farmers' mental health while outlining their support for the motion.</p><p>\"This cruel impost is going to create mental health problems,\" Cr Saunders said.</p><p>\"This cruel and sneaky tax is abhorrent.\"</p><p>In also opposing the ESVF, councillor Jim Rinaldi said members of the state government \"wouldn't have any idea what it's like to struggle for a dollar\" and that they were \"out of touch\" with the ordinary person.</p><p>Finally, councillor Tess Morgan said she was \"proud to hear a united voice among councillors\" and urged the council to keep its share of the rates low when it came to its forthcoming budget.</p><p>\"I'm proud this appears to be a [council] group aware of the cost of living,\" she said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Neighbouring council voices strong opposition to ESVF</emphasis></p><p>On Tuesday, neighbouring council Hepburn Shire passed a similar motion, which voiced strong opposition to the ESVF.</p><p>In a press release, the Hepburn Shire stated it would \"join the many other councils opposing the levy\".</p><p>While the ESVF is proving unpopular with regional councils, earlier in May, Ballarat's MPs defended their decision<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/8972580/ballarat-mps-address-concerns-over-emergency-services-levy/\"> to back the new legislation </url>.</p><p>When explaining her stance on the ESVF, member for Wendouree Juliana Addison cited the need for more funding for emergency services to combat the increase in climate change-related disasters.</p><p>\"We need to create a funding model that is sustainable in a world where disasters are going to become a more common occurrence,\" she said.</p><p>\"That was at the forefront of my supporting this bill, making sure that our volunteers are supported.\"</p><p>Member for Eureka, Michaela Settle, and Member for Ripon, Matha Haylett, also voted in favour of the ESVF, but both cited rebates for drought-affected farmers and CFA and SES volunteers as an important aspect of the legislation.</p><p>\"I have always fiercely fought for my community in Parliament, and I will continue to do so,\" Ms Haylett said.</p><p>\"I know this is a very difficult time for many members of our community, particularly farmers, with drought conditions and bad harvests.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/200884286/32c15ca9-a212-4b80-ac2b-780e0f993265.jpg\">City of

Within days, they were needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On December 17, lightning sparked a fire in the rugged Grampians, which was tinder-dry after 18 months of little rain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fleet - included several water-bombing helicopters, a clutch of smaller cropduster-style planes, and two large air tankers, owned by Canadian company Conair and operated by Australian partner Field Air - had work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the next four weeks, an airborne assault dropped 5723 payloads of water and retardant as ground crews often struggled to reach flames in inaccessible terrain. Those payloads helped save the popular tourist town of Halls Gap from an inferno with a 422-kilometre perimeter.</p><p>To show exactly how they did it, The Age has combined flight and fire data with accounts from those on the ground.</p><p>Some helicopters hoovered water up from dams. Other aircraft guided commercial-size firebombing jets. A few planes scouted for flare-ups. And one helicopter used an infra-red camera to scan through thick smoke and help authorities issue alerts.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria's deputy incident controller Glenn Rudolph said better weather and a significant ground effort to build control lines ultimately contained the blaze, but an intense aerial attack was crucial in buying time.</p><p>It's why Craig Lapsley, Victoria's first emergency management commissioner, fears any loss of the state's biggest firebombing aircraft - currently procured through contracts with international aviation companies - could seriously hinder firefighting efforts when they are needed most.</p><p>Lapsley points to the Los Angeles winter fires as evidence of climate change driving year-round threats, potentially tying up firebombers overseas that Australia would otherwise use.</p><p>\"Victoria, I think, may struggle in years to come with the availability of large aircraft,\" Lapsley says. \"They're living on an old model that may have serviced Victoria very well ... but I think they're missing an opportunity.\"</p><p>The aftermath</p><p>The first Grampians bushfire scorched more than 76,000 hectares of national park and farmland. Four homes in Moyston and Mafeking were lost along with 40 outbuildings. Thousands of animals died.</p><p>And yet, it could have been worse.</p><p>Amid the LA fires in January, The Age reported Australia risked losing large international waterbombing aircraft as climate change lengthened fire seasons, keeping planes busy in the northern hemisphere. Underscoring the risk were deadly and record-breaking fires in South Korea last month.</p><p>NSW felt the affects of prolonged fire danger in the mid-2010s when early season starts - such as in 2018 - meant the Rural Fire Service (RFS) was unable to immediately get all the planes needed from overseas. That prompted the RFS to pursue its own standing fleet to guarantee some sovereign capability, starting with the acquisition of a 737 air tanker in 2019.</p><p>\"Ever since then, the availability [of large firebombers] has become even more pressured,\" RFS commissioner Rob Rogers said. \"There's a real shortage of these things around the world, so there's a lot of competition.\"</p><p>NSW's top firefighter said the LA fires meant American demand would remain strong. South American countries such as Argentina and Chile, whose southern hemisphere summer fire seasons nearly mirror Australia's, were increasingly seeking planes too, he added. \"You've also got some of the European countries, particularly Greece, that used to rely heavily on the Russian machines. And obviously, since the Ukraine situation, that's become problematic,\" Rogers said.</p><p>The Black Summer fires spurred a further expansion of the NSW fleet, including the purchase of a large Chinook helicopter in 2023. Although the cost may be hefty, Rogers said \"the cost increases were just nowhere near as volatile when you own the asset\".</p><p>Some of the state's fire-bombers are still contracted from aviation companies via the National Aerial Firefighting Centre. But the NSW fleet employs and trains locals under a $400 million, 10-year operations deal with Canada's Coulson Aviation.</p><p>Victoria does not have a standalone fleet like this, which ex-Emergency Management Victoria chief Craig Lapsley thinks is a problem.</p><p>\"I'm not one to say Victoria has got it dramatically wrong,\" he said. \"I just think Victoria's got a risk of not having what they want, when they need it, under the current arrangements.\"</p><p>Lapsley argued an investment would be worthwhile even if there were no fires to fight over winter, as crews could tackle other natural disasters and train. He pointed out that a NSW large air tanker recouped some money as it was briefly sent to tackle fires overseas, albeit a small amount.</p><p>Alternatively, the contract-model could be enhanced, Lapsley suggested, by increasing operation days each year so planes remained in Victoria consistently. \"We shouldn't have to rely on bringing people from overseas if you build the industry in Australia,\" he said.</p><p>Field Air general manager Stephen Holding said Victoria already had some sovereign capacity as one of its Q400ATs, which is ultimately owned by Canadian company Conair, is based at Avalon year-round, operating in Queensland before Victoria and then staying in Australia over winter for maintenance.</p><p>\"It's just been offered a contract structure that provides enough days commercially for an operator to leave it here. It doesn't have to go and do another season somewhere else in the world. And that's another way you can achieve sovereignty without the taxpayer having to fund it,\" he said.</p><p>Josephine Stirling, director of the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which co-ordinates aircraft procurement for states and territories, said seven aircraft moved between North America and Australia this bushfire season as part of their contracts. She indicated that increasing competition for them was an issue.</p><p>\"With changing fire seasons globally and demand for the larger resources growing, this arrangement will be challenged in future years,\" she said.</p><p>Asked if direct investment in aircraft like NSW was being considered, Forest Fire Management Victoria's chief fire officer, Chris Hardman, backed the current contract-model.</p><p>\"This approach, delivered through Victoria's Emergency Management agencies, ensures we have an effective, flexible and innovative aviation firefighting capability to help fight fires and keep Victoria's community, assets and environment safe,\" he said.</p><p>\"Aircraft are just one tool to keep the community safe. In any given season, our aircraft fleet supports thousands of firefighters, hundreds of firefighting trucks, heavy machinery and plant equipment on the ground.\"</p><p>Acting emergency management commissioner Tim Wiebusch said Victoria was \"well resourced\" to fight fires with aircraft.</p><p>\"The majority of aircraft in the Victorian fleet are locally based and the state has contractual and contingency arrangements in place to ensure appropriate aircraft are available across the higher risk weather season,\" he said. \"Victoria also has access to more than 100 call-when-needed aircraft that are available year-round to respond to emergencies.\"</p><p>Ex-NSW fire chief Greg Mullins has long called for Australia to develop more sovereign aerial firefighting capacity. But he stresses that firebombing from the sky couldn't stop bushfires altogether, and boots on the ground would always be needed.</p><p>\"It's overrated in the public's eye,\" he said. \"It's of great assistance in certain circumstances, but it's not a silver bullet, and never will be.\"</p><p>Mullins pointed out that severe weather might stop planes from being able to fly safely, as happened in the Grampians on Boxing Day, or break up retardant drops. In the first Grampians fire this summer, only 50 drops - albeit those with the biggest payloads - were from large air tankers.</p><p>\"It takes some intensity out of the fire, and slows it down and gives the ground forces a chance. [But] worldwide, firefighters know aerial attack does not extinguish fires,\" he said. \"People on the ground do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc80dhjfqby5w1hgj3lo06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FND-V253-RRV4-M06W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Monivae College also provided use of their facility, at no cost to the council.</p><p>The sites were used to provide temporary accommodation for more than 16 displaced individuals.</p><p>Displaced pets and animals were given accommodation at the Hamilton Pound and Hamilton Regional Livestock Exchange.</p><p>Bottled water was supplied to the town of Glenthompson, where the water supply was disrupted. An alternative option was provided by Wannon Water.</p><p>The Glenthompson Outdoor Swimming Pool was used as a water source and storage for fire management purposes.</p><p>At Hamilton Aerodrome, the council supplied water, and, through support from Wannon Water, increased water pressure which reduced water refilling time for airtankers and water bombers.</p><p>A neighbouring business, Sustainable Plastic Solutions, altered its operations to reduce its water demand during the fire period.</p><p>Council documents note the tourism sector was severely impacted during the fire period. It stated tourism infrastructure within the park, including the Grampians Peaks Trail, would be closed for a long period.</p><p>The southern end (Dunkeld) would be cut off from the northern end until such time works were scoped.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/134792786/b49e1193-f1a8-4732-89ee-ef69b2a4c1d0.jpg\">Southern Grampians Shire Council has revealed some residents are struggling to receive compensation for damaged property in the aftermath of the Grampians National Park bushfires.
