out-of-control bushfire forced the closure of the Gariwerd/Grampians National Park, the popular tourist town of Halls Gap has reopened.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Struggling tourism operators who usually earn 25 per cent of their annual income in the three weeks after Christmas say they are desperate for visitors to return.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is the second consecutive summer in bushfires have torn through the Grampians region in Victoria's south west, after fires in the 300-strong community of Pomonal destroyed 46 homes in February 2024.</p><p>Grampians Wimmera Mallee Tourism chief executive Marc Sleeman said the closure of Halls Gap this summer had cost businesses <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-22/halls-gap-tourism-travel-grampians-bushfire/104755626\">$1.9 million per day</url>.</p><p>\"Most businesses were preparing for a really busy period \u2014 most were only just getting on their feet after the February, March fires and the downturn in business throughout the middle of the year,\" he said.</p><p>\"We understand there is going to be some hesitation from travellers \u2026 but Victorians are going to stand by Victorians, and I think you'll see a swell of support coming.\"</p><h>Long battle</h><p>Firefighters <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-06/cool-change-rain-grampians-national-park-bushfire-contained/104787242\">contained the fire on Monday</url>, after it burned through 76,000 hectares of national park and farmland, destroyed four homes and 40 outbuildings, and killed more than 700 animals over three weeks.</p><p>According to Vic Emergency, there is currently no threat to communities, but visitors are being told to stay informed and monitor conditions.</p><p>Firefighters continue to monitor hotspots, treat hazardous trees and clear tracks.</p><p>Halls Gap Zoo reopened to the public on Tuesday, after being forced to evacuate its animals during the bushfires.</p><p>Owner Mark Treweek took some of the animals into his own home to ensure they were safe, while others were transported to the Ballarat or Werribee zoos.</p><p>\"I'm getting back to where they're relaxed in their homes, so staff are happy they're back and everyone's nice and relaxed at the moment,\" Mr Treweek said.</p><p>\"There's not much for businesses to keep going, so we need everyone to come back as soon as everything opens back up.</p><p>\"There's still plenty to see and do so come down before the end of these holidays and keep visiting throughout the year.\"</p><p>Halls Gap Lakeside Tourist Park owner Josephina McDonald said she had almost 650 cancellations over the Christmas and New Year period.</p><p>She said she kept some staff on to run the park for Forest Fire Management Victoria crews.</p><p>Ms McDonald said businesses would struggle as many in Halls Gap chose not to have insurance because of the high cost.</p><p>The Victorian government said it had given 392 personal hardship assistance payments to those affected by the fires, worth about $460,000.</p><p>A spokesperson for federal Emergency Management Minister Jenny McAllister said the federal government had granted 43 disaster recovery allowance claims as of January 5, and paid almost $15,000.</p><p>Individuals and businesses have until June 23 to make claims.</p><h>Gradual reopenings</h><p>Northern Grampians Shire Council deputy mayor and Halls Gap resident and business owner Justine Hide said businesses were excited to hear more sections in the north of the park would open on Friday.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, south of that, The Pinnacle area is closed but [authorities] have indicated it should open shortly,\" she said.</p><p>\"Anyone in the regional area that can come up \u2014 even just for a day \u2014 and buy an ice cream and a picnic, go for a short walk, go to the zoo or one of our wineries \u2026 you know if you're spending your money here, you're really supporting a good bunch of humans.\"</p><p>Parks Victoria said other sections of the Gariwerd/Grampians National Park would reopen gradually, with MacKenzie Falls, Venus Baths and Boroka Lookout open from Friday morning.</p><p>While the Grampians Peaks Trail's northern section will reopen \u2014 the southern end was impacted by the fires.</p><p>Bookings are now open for campgrounds that are reopening on Friday.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

where it's run out of the edge of the national park and almost comes to a screaming stop - that's because our forest fire management crews, CFA crews and the locals know how to tackle a fire when it comes out into grassland.</p><p>\"That's where we generally had a high level of success of being able to slow the spread of the fire.</p><p>\"When [the fire] did leave the national park, it was running into primarily agricultural land so that was a big impact for those communities, but certainly the bulk of the fire was within the national park.\"</p><p>With a fire footprint circumference of 422 kilometres, the fire perimeter is marked by containment lines that span from Halls Gap in the north, down to just north of Dunkeld, out west to near Moyston and contained to the fire's western edge in the middle of the Grampians National Park.</p><p>In total, more than 76,000ha of national park and agricultural land was burnt. </p><p>The fire began on December 17 after dry lightning started multiple fires in the southern part of the national park.</p><p>Preliminary data indicates livestock losses include 775 sheep, one horse, one beef cattle and 1285 beehives.</p><p>The fire claimed four residential properties in Moyston and Mafeking, and 40 outbuildings in Moyston, Willaura, Willaura North, Mafeking, Pomonal, Glenthompson and Mirranatwa.</p><p>Mr Heagerty said the rain on Monday was \"the cherry on top\" in containing the blaze after soaring temperatures over the weekend threatened to halt any progress in the three-week-long fire-fighting effort. </p><p>\"The test was over this weekend, and because we got through the weekend without any spread of fire, that's given us the confidence to say 'okay, we've achieved the containment of this fire',\" he said.</p><p>Large parts of the fire-affected area received over 10 millimetres of rain, with some sections receiving more than that.</p><p>\"That rain will certainly settle things down both at the fire, but more generally, it'll give us a week of respite and a chance to recharge for all of our crews,\" Mr Heagerty said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/239500232/acddac4f-bcfa-44f3-ba0c-6cada739654d.jpg\">Authorities have praised the work of fire crews for the tight containment lines of the Grampians National Park bushfire in saving farmland.

Nationals Party has criticised the state government's decision to increase the Fire Services Property Levy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government announced the Fire Services Property Levy will be replaced by the new Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund from July 1 next year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government announced the levy, which is paid for by all Victorian landowners through rates, would increase significantly in the 2024-25 state budget.</p><p>The tax hike will see Victorian ratepayers fork out an extra $60 a year on average, to fund a range of emergency services bundled together as part of a levy rebrand.</p><p>The new levy will encompass a range of state emergency services including Vic SES, Triple Zero Victoria, the State Control Centre, Forest Fire Management Victoria, Emergency Recovery Victoria, the CFA and Fire Rescue Victoria.</p><p>Victorian property owners will pay an additional $2.1 billion more than the old fire levy through the new levy.</p><p>Also included in the announcement was a funding package of more than $250 million for CFA and SES volunteers, and improvements to the VicEmergency app.</p><p>Member for Mildura Jade Benham called the rebrand \"an insult wrapped in a cuddle\".</p><p>Ms Benham said the \"only positive\" was that the government had announced CFA and SES volunteers would be eligible for exemptions from paying the levy.</p><p>\"That's great but it's going to do nothing to increase the CFA morale,\" she said.</p><p>\"They've kicked the CFA while they're down but at the same time said 'oh but it's okay because our CFA volunteers will be exempt from the levy'.\"</p><p>Member for Euroa Annabelle Cleeland said the \"convoluted\" announcements had been met with criticism from regional landowners and volunteer firefighters.</p><p>Ms Cleeland said CFA volunteers were concerned the increased levy would be diluted across more services and there would be less transparency on where and how money was spent.</p><p>\"Labor's inability to manage core government services has resulted in the funding for the rest of our emergency services being diluted,\" she said.</p><p>\"It sounds like a good deal but we know there are issues with Triple Zero, there are issues with our paramedics and our emergency response systems, as well as the CFA and FRV, so to bundle them all together is just going to compound a crisis, it's not fixing anything.</p><p>\"And the costs once again are passed onto taxpayers.\"</p><p>She said the levy increase had done little to support regional CFA brigades which remained under-funded.</p><p>\"No one feels happy about this announcement because no one trusts the government is actually going to be allocating sufficient money to the CFA still,\" she said.</p><p>\"We are still waiting on the delivery of 28 of the 48 critical new heavy tankers that were promised in 2021.</p><p>\"Only 15 are currently in active service, so they are great at promising things but we've never seen them come through with the goods.\"</p><p>A state government spokesperson said the levy increase was about improving the state's capacity to fight natural disasters.</p><p>The spokesperson said the changes meant more funding for the CFA, not less.</p><p>\"This will bring Victoria's funding arrangements for emergency services into line with other states,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>\"Every single dollar raised will fund vital life-saving equipment, vehicles, staff, training for volunteers, community education and recovery support for when Victorians need it most.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Its practical impact upon people's wellbeing is real and our capacity to affect property in what is the most fire-prone region in the world has to be subject to constant capital by government,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Ms Symes said the SES, triple zero, Emergency Recovery Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria would benefit from the levy revenue and volunteers and long-serving ex-volunteers would be exempt.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Electric car drivers will have to start paying more in 2026 with the government to scrap a $100 discount for electric vehicle registrations.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The decision comes after the High Court struck down the government's EV levy in 2023.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It is a bit rich if we're actually incentivising them for using the roads in circumstances where they're not paying for the use of it,\" Mr Pallas said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Victoria is set to \"harmonise\" with Sydney and hike the congestion levy from 2026 and extend the costs into Melbourne's inner-eastern suburbs.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 This could lead to cost increases to off-street private and public car parking spaces, the budget update revealed.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"These changes aim to reduce congestion and encourage the use of public transport by commuters to the CBD and inner-city areas,\" the budget update read.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 On-street parking, private car parking lots, universities and charities are among those exempt from the charges, Mr Pallas confirmed.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The aim here is to recognise that congestion is going to cost the Victorian economy about $10 billion a year by 2030,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Opposition Leader John Pesutto described the budget update as \"annus horribilis for many businesses and Victorians\".<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It always picks off those most vulnerable - households, farmers, businesses - that are struggling to stay afloat ... and they target them because they're easy prey for a government that can't manage money,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DMT-6SW1-JC0X-K0W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><timeReceived>4:11 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.

I noticed that there was a fire alert, but I couldn't see any smoke,\" Mr Breen said.</p><p>\"All of a sudden, there was a small band of smoke coming from there; within 10 minutes, it was billowing. Someone from the CFA called in and said, 'You must leave now', which I did.\"</p><p>CFA trucks arrived at his property just as quickly as the fire swelled in size.</p><p>Thankfully there was minimal damage - sections of bushland on the other side of his dam had been burned with no damage to the canopy.</p><p>The damage was unlike 1997's more severe fire, which burnt most of his property but spared his house.</p><p>\"When I came back it was just black, everything. All of that forest was just not a very good sight,\" Mr Breen said.</p><p>His neighbours gave similar stories of yesterday's fire, which flared up quickly and was met with a strong CFA response.</p><p>Liam Downes, who owns Black Cat Truffle farm and restaurant, had to evacuate his property when the fire approached.</p><p>\"About 5pm, I got a call from a farmer friend; he let me know that there was a fire to the north in the bush at the back of our property,\" Mr Downes said.</p><p>\"From there, I went to have a look, and it basically went from being a campfire to something pretty major in 10 minutes.</p><p>\"We enacted our fire plan and got in the car with our dogs and animals. You kind of think you know what your fire plan is going to be until that moment. The kids are panicking, the dog doesn't want to get in.\"</p><p>The collection of French and English oaks at the back of the property, under which his truffles grow, were saved by the efforts of firefighters.</p><p>\"They did a bloody good job.</p><p>\"My brother was in the Mallacoota fires. He was camping down there and had to evacuate into the water.</p><p>\"That is the time that it hit close to home. It was never something that I had dealt with personally. It is good to know that what we had in place did work.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, crews from Forest Fire Management Victoria used heavy machinery to clear fallen trees in the affected areas.</p><p>A few CFA units were still nearby to contain and extinguish the smouldering hot spots that remained.</p><p>Rob Turley took his bus to the Dean Recreation Reserve overnight, just in case he had to evacuate his property nearby.</p><p>Mr Turley had lived in the area during the 1997 fire and said yesterday's fire took a similar course.</p><p>\"I stayed there until the last bit. I had myself set up with water. I just waited and waited,\" Mr Turley said.</p><p>\"I didn't want to go too early because I had pumps running. If you start the pumps too early you will run out of fuel, so you have to time it right.</p><p>\"Didn't have to use them, thank Christ.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc7yit6no6q6g4m58i4bl</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNR-6C83-RSHB-713V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 18, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Traffic accident</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Despite this, the Allan government maintains it will record an operating surplus the year after, even though it has to spend more money on the Metro Tunnel and the state's hospitals.</p><p>The fire services levy will be renamed the emergency services and volunteers fund [ESVF] and retooled to provide money towards the State Emergency Service, Triple Zero Victoria, the State Control Centre, Forest Fire Management Victoria and Emergency Recovery Victoria.</p><p>The charge, which appears on rates notices, will grow from 8.7 cents for every $1000 of a property's capital improved value, to 17.3 cents next financial year.</p><p>The fixed cost part of the charge will also remain but will rise in line with inflation, going from $132 this year to $136 in 2025-26.</p><p>It's forecast that by 2028 this levy will collect $1.8 billion in revenue, compared to $1.033 billion collected by the fire services levy at present.</p><p>On the website outlining the changes, the government says every dollar raised would go towards \"vital life-saving equipment, vehicles, staff, training for volunteers, community education, and recovery support for when Victorians need it most\".</p><p>\"Variable rates will be higher under the ESVF than the FSPL [fire services levy] to account for the ESVF's larger scope.\"</p><p>The state's mid-year budget update, released on Friday, reported Victoria's deficit, forecast in May for the 2024-25 financial year at $2.2 billion, has grown to $3.6 billion.</p><p>However, the document says the budget is still on track to record an operating surplus in 2025-26, and is forecasting a $100 million improvement with a surplus of $1.6 billion.</p><p>The report also detailed a slight change to net debt, which is now forecast to be $187.3 billion in 2028, an improvement of $500 million.</p><p>This financial year, net debt will be $155.2 billion compared to a budget forecast of $156.2 billion.</p><p>The fire levy changes came as Emergency Services Minister Jaclyn Symes announced a funding boost of more than $250 million for the Country Fire Authority and the state emergency services, including $70 million to replace trucks, tankers and pumpers.</p><p>Symes said the changes to the levy would require legislation, with the intention it would take effect by July 2025.</p><p>\"I'm hoping that other political parties will see the benefit in the support that this brings to Victorians and emergency service volunteers,\" she said.</p><p>\"Communities are asking more of their local SES volunteers than they ever have before, which is why we're giving them more funding, new trucks and the latest technology.</p><p>\"Our emergency services put their lives on the line without a second thought.

Jodie Bruton reports. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cath Davies was heavily pregnant with her first child when bushfires raged out of control in the Upper Murray five years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A firefighter on maternity leave, Ms Davies watched helplessly as crews headed towards Towong to spare lives and defend property.</p><p>But once the main firefront went through Corryong, she knew exactly what she had to do.</p><p>She returned to Forest Fire Management Victoria's Corryong office to work as a radio operator.</p><p>\"I didn't want to go to Albury-Wodonga because I thought being separated from the farm and the people I love would be even more stressful than staying,\" she recalled.</p><p>\"I was worried about smoke in the air but there was smoke in Albury-Wodonga too; I kept going into work wearing a facemask every day.\"</p><p>The fire, which started near Walwa, burnt until mid-January and destroyed 82 homes, impacted hundreds of properties and killed more than 6000 livestock.</p><p>A week after the fire was contained, Ms Davies and husband Joel welcomed the safe arrival of their first-born child Archie.</p><p>Ms Davies said it seemed like an eternity and the blink of an eye simultaneously since the Black Summer bushfires blackened the Upper Murray landscape.</p><p>Now a mother-of-two, she said the global pandemic had also skewed time.</p><p>\"The time has gone really quickly and also slow in some ways,\" Ms Davies said.</p><p>\"It feels like yesterday and it's still very raw for some people; some haven't finished rebuilding their houses or fixing up all of their fences yet.\"</p><p>As deputy chairwoman of Towong Community Recovery Committee, Ms Davies said there were ample logistical and bureaucratic challenges in the weeks and months after the bushfires.</p><p>She said initially there was a revolving door of specialists leading the recovery effort.</p><p>\"For the first three months the help was a bit superficial,\" she said.</p><p>\"We'd form a relationship with one group and a month later we'd have to start again with a new group; it was tricky. Overall, house building was really slow and permits were not fast-tracked.\"</p><p>On the other hand, Ms Davies said the Albury-Wodonga-based Border Trust had worked hard to ensure funds met Towong Shire needs after it set up the Towong Community Bushfire Disaster Relief Fund in 2021. The fund gave $2.05 million to recovery initiatives, from community gardens and hall refurbishments to health and wellbeing programs.</p><p>\"Even though we're rebuilding we also wanted to encourage resilience,\" Ms Davies said.</p><p>\"A walking track and a new barbecue area are part of that. The Towong Hall was upgraded through bushfire recovery money; it's been the meeting place for mental health nights and lots of different functions.</p><p>\"We're a closer community because of it; we used to be more disjointed and only got together once a year for the Christmas Tree but now we get together more often.</p><p>\"It was reassuring to know we all had each other's backs during and after the fires.\"</p><p>Working for Ambulance Victoria and a decades-long CFA volunteer, Sharyn Nankervis had to put all of her efforts into Victoria State Emergency Service duties when the Black Summer bushfires hit.</p><p>Initially, only three SES volunteers were on the ground for Road Crash Rescue.</p><p>They were dispatched to the accident where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/6964037/riverina-firefighter-who-died-at-jingellic-added-to-memorial/\"> volunteer firefighter Samuel McPaul, 28, died after his truck was flipped by a fire tornado in the Green Valley blaze </url> at Jingellic. Two other Rural Fire Service Morven brigade firefighters were hurt too.</p><p>\"It was really hard,\" she said.</p><p>\"The fires were extremely devastating.</p><p>\"We also lost native animals by the millions; driving around, it was black and black and black for miles.</p><p>\"We knew a lot of houses had burnt but to drive around and see the houses of people we knew gone was very confronting.\"</p><p>When more SES crews arrived in the Upper Murray, Ms Nankervis was freed up to help with the local mail run in the early weeks and later took a lead on the bushfire recovery.</p><p>A CFA volunteer for almost 40 years, she was part of a small team that helped breathe new life into Towong Soldiers Memorial Hall over the two-year project.</p><p>Officially opened in October 2024, the 99-year-old hall was now an elegant and upgraded version of its former self and a valuable community asset.</p><p>It had a new iron roof and exterior cladding, restored pressed metal ceiling and wall panels, upgraded kitchen and new deck.</p><p>\"Five years on, most people have rebuilt and farmers have replaced their fences and are getting themselves together,\" Ms Nankervis said.</p><p>\"Towong now has some beautiful halls out of bushfire recovery money.</p><p>\"This helps with community connectedness. Before the fires, people knew their immediate neighbours; now, people know so many more neighbours.\"</p><p>Border Trust recently shared the results of community feedback about Towong Shire's ongoing needs as part of the bushfire recovery.</p><p>The survey showed key areas needing investment included mental health and community connections; youth and education initiatives such as driving programs and career pathways; infrastructure and community spaces; sustainable recovery projects such as environmental initiatives and preventative health programs; and economic growth and tourism.</p><p>Border Trust executive officer Sue Gold said the survey highlighted the emerging needs of the Towong Shire. </p><p>\"The results mirror feedback we've received via our on-the-ground community engagement and will help us prioritise projects that not only address urgent challenges but also create enduring benefits for the community,\" she said.</p><p>Ms Nankervis said the Towong hall was now a beautiful place to gather inside or on the deck. They hope to book functions and weddings to generate income to maintain the building. </p><p>\"It was a little diamond that came out of the fires,\" she said. \"Most people are back in their homes or have new homes. Some people did leave the area but that happened after the 2003 fires as well. People have been quiet around the anniversary but maybe they've dealt with it as much as they can for now. I like to think the majority of people are coping better now; some people will have trauma forever though.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/9jp2tjuwKpcNcyMwTq82JY/80bf9b3a-8d99-446d-9757-769e47d0ef69.jpg\">Cath Davies, who is pictured with her daughter Billie and son Archie, was pregnant with her first child when the Black Summer bushfires hit Corryong in 2019-2020.

calls for action, dating back to early last year</url>, little progress has been made on clearing what recent analysis shows is about 600,000 tonnes of fallen trees, spread across 2500ha at densities ranging from 200 to 240 tonnes per hectare.</p><p>The fallen timber load across another 20,000ha of the Wombat Forest sits at close to 100t/ha, compared to undamaged forest loads of 20 to 50 tonnes per hectare. </p><p>The nation's top bushfire scientist, University of Melbourne Associate Professor Kevin Tolhurst, has warned the fallen timber risks fuelling a fire storm that would engulf nearby towns. </p><p>\"That's when you see these big mushroom clouds, up to 12km high (as the fire) creates its own weather,\" Prof Tolhurst said. </p><p>He said normally the Wombat Forest would not be regarded as big enough to create the massive convection-driven fires that Victorians had seen on Black Saturday 2009 and during the 2019-20 summer.</p><p>\"(But) with all this fallen wood you get five times as much energy resulting from every hectare, so you only need a fifth of the area to produce that convection column,\" Prof Tolhurst said. \"It's impossible to stop.\"</p><p>Yet despite these warnings VicForests' attempts to clear the Wombat forest of fallen timber have been repeatedly stymied by government bureaucrats, legal action by environmental groups, protests and <url

machinery</url>.</p><p>Just this week the Wombat Forestcare Group lodged a summons with VicForests trying to block local firewood cutters Dale Tiley and Gary Kirby salvaging fallen trees from a 20ha site in the Wombat Forest.</p><p>Mr Tiley said they only had a quota of 4000 tonnes, which would hardly make a dent in the massive fuel load of twisted logs and debris that still lay across the forest.</p><p>But now he had no idea as to whether they could continue working on the coupe.    </p><p>Wombat Forestcare convener Gayle Osborne said legal action was being taken because VicForests had failed to adequately survey the site for threatened species.</p><p>However Ms Osborne refused to make further comment until she had spoken to her barrister.</p><p>Meanwhile Mr Kirby said: \"We're all just banging our heads against a brick wall\", with no support from the Andrews Government.</p><p>Prof Tolhurst said it would take 40 to 50 years for the fallen timber to break down.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said \"record rain over the past two years has provided challenges to safely clear storm fallen timber in Wombat Forest\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Cooler conditions have brought some relief to fire crews battling the inferno, but it could be weeks until the fire is fully extinguished given its size and the challenging mountainous terrain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Anthony Albanese said the activation of the disaster recovery allowance would help communities get back on their feet. \"This has been a devastating fire event here in the Grampians that is particularly acutely felt because of the time of year,\" he said while visiting Horsham, in western Victoria, yesterday.</p><p>\"We live in a country which has harsh conditions. It's always had fires, it's always had these extreme weather events. But the truth is they're becoming more frequent and more intense.\"</p><p>The payments, which will be available from this afternoon, are for workers and sole traders directly impacted by the fire who have experienced loss of income in the local government areas of Ararat, Macedon Ranges, Northern Grampians and Southern Grampians.</p><p>Grampians Wimmera Mallee Tourism chief executive Marc Sleeman said the fires were devastating for businesses in western Victoria.</p><p>\"A lot of businesses at this time of year generate 30 per cent of their income,\" he said. \"And [the fires] are going to go on for weeks and weeks.</p><p>\"People's livelihoods are at stake here. Families have also been put off over Christmas from their employer. They're going to have to start looking for other jobs because we don't know how long it's going to take to reopen the Grampians National Park.\"</p><p>Sleeman said there had been some close calls but, at this stage, no tourism businesses had been destroyed. \"The CFA and Forest Fire Management were able to save a couple of key businesses - two that came under direct threat.\"</p><p>The disaster allowance has been made available alongside other support, including state and federal hardship payments as well as disaster assistance from councils.</p><p>While Sleeman thanked the prime minister for the latest round of payments, he said locals needed more from state and federal governments given the region had been hit by devastating bushfires twice in 12 months.</p><p>\"We saw a 20 per cent decline in visitor spend in the six months to June as a result of the February fires. We're going to need some long-term strategies to get our visitor economy back on its feet.\"</p><p>As well as the three homes confirmed lost in Moyston, nearly a dozen outbuildings have been destroyed around the Grampians National Park and Macedon Ranges by the fire, which has so far scorched more than 76,000 hectares.</p><p>Premier Jacinta Allan said the number of damaged homes could rise as crews continued to assess the area.</p><p>\"Part of the challenge with this Grampians fire is that it's still burning ... so where the crews can, they are in there undertaking rapid impact assessments to get a sense of property loss. So that number may go up,\" she said.</p><p>She expressed her support for farmers who had lost livestock, fences and other infrastructure, as well as tourism operators who would otherwise be welcoming visitors for the summer holidays.</p><p>She encouraged Victorians to remain alert to changing conditions and advice, warning the fire was still a threat.</p><p>\"There's something like a 384-kilometre perimeter around this Grampians fire and on any given day, if the wind goes the wrong way, that can be an ignition point out of that perimeter,\" Allan said.</p><p>\"We've got plenty more hot days ahead of us, so that's why crews are in there while the weather is a little bit more benign to do everything they can to suppress the most dangerous parts of the fire.\"</p><p>State Control Centre spokesman James Taylor said mild weather gave crews the chance to strengthen containment lines. \"Crews will continue to black out the fire with help from machinery and aircraft today,\" he said yesterday.</p><p>The entire eastern side of the Grampians, including the towns of Halls Gap, Pomonal and Moyston, are still subject to a \"watch and act\" message.</p><p>With AAP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7youu9jwvc117fsex5km</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DS8-3SK3-RVVM-C0D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

I noticed that there was a fire alert, but I couldn't see any smoke,\" Mr Breen said.</p><p>\"All of a sudden, there was a small band of smoke coming from there; within 10 minutes, it was billowing. Someone from the CFA called in and said, 'You must leave now', which I did.\"</p><p>CFA trucks arrived at his property just as quickly as the fire swelled in size.</p><p>Thankfully there was minimal damage - sections of bushland on the other side of his dam had been burned with no damage to the canopy. </p><p>The damage was unlike 1997's more severe fire, which burnt most of his property but spared his house. </p><p>\"When I came back it was just black, everything. All of that forest was just not a very good sight,\" Mr Breen said. </p><p>His neighbours gave similar stories of yesterday's fire, which flared up quickly and was met with a strong CFA response. </p><p>Liam Downes, who owns Black Cat Truffle farm and restaurant, had to evacuate his property when the fire approached. </p><p>\"About 5pm, I got a call from a farmer friend; he let me know that there was a fire to the north in the bush at the back of our property,\" Mr Downes said.</p><p>\"From there, I went to have a look, and it basically went from being a campfire to something pretty major in 10 minutes.</p><p>\"We enacted our fire plan and got in the car with our dogs and animals. You kind of think you know what your fire plan is going to be until that moment. The kids are panicking, the dog doesn't want to get in.\"</p><p>The collection of French and English oaks at the back of the property, under which his truffles grow, were saved by the efforts of firefighters. </p><p>\"They did a bloody good job. </p><p>\"My brother was in the Mallacoota fires. He was camping down there and had to evacuate into the water. </p><p>\"That is the time that it hit close to home. It was never something that I had dealt with personally. It is good to know that what we had in place did work.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, crews from Forest Fire Management Victoria used heavy machinery to clear fallen trees in the affected areas. </p><p>A few CFA units were still nearby to contain and extinguish the smouldering hot spots that remained.</p><p>Rob Turley took his bus to the Dean Recreation Reserve overnight, just in case he had to evacuate his property nearby. </p><p>Mr Turley had lived in the area during the 1997 fire and said yesterday's fire took a similar course.</p><p>\"I stayed there until the last bit. I had myself set up with water. I just waited and waited,\" Mr Turley said. </p><p>\"I didn't want to go too early because I had pumps running. If you start the pumps too early you will run out of fuel, so you have to time it right. </p><p>\"Didn't have to use them, thank Christ.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/116423175/3b322a81-c6a9-43e8-a4a7-6ed913b3c32a.jpg\">Fire damaged parts of John Breen's property.

The ability of these programs to scour the web and gather data is undeniably impressive. But is the data accurate? Are their programs biased? And how do you get to the heart of a question?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Who could forget when Google\u2019s AI platform Gemini couldn\u2019t help but inject DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policy into historical images it was asked to create. A storm erupted when a picture of the US\u2019s Founding Fathers replaced the historically accurate Anglo-Saxons heritage of these men with ones of African-American, Asian and Native American heritage. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Grok-1.jpg\">I requested Grok 3 to create a picture of us having a conversation. Photo: The Koondrook and Barham Bridge Newspaper</url></p><p>I thought the launch of Grok 3 was a good time to test how AI is evolving. I started with some basic questions on the direction and governance of our nation. Contained among the lengthy response was a statement \u201cDroughts, floods, and bushfires are intensifying.\u201d Bearing in mind that these LLM\u2019s gather data from articles, papers, posts and regurgitate it, I wanted to delve deeper. </p><p>\u201cAre droughts, fires and floods really intensifying based on historical data?\u201d I probed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dig into whether droughts, fires, and floods in Australia are truly intensifying, using historical data as our anchor. The claim gets tossed around a lot\u2014especially with climate change in the mix\u2014but we\u2019ll stick to what the records say, not headlines or vibes. Here\u2019s the breakdown, based on long-term trends up to March 2, 2025.\u201d Replied Grok</p><p>While we have a relatively short dataset on Australia\u2019s climatic conditions, Grok did indulge me.</p><p>Historical data demonstrated that droughts aren\u2019t necessarily more frequent, but they\u2019re getting more severe and prolonged in certain regions. Grok concluded not more droughts but hotter, drier ones that hit agriculture and water harder, citing an increase in temperature up 1.4\u00b0C since 1910.</p><p>Having seen the nation\u2019s temperature rise being called into question due to a change from mercury to digital thermometers and the influence of heat sinks generated by construction, I probed deeper. </p><p>\u201cHow does the move from mercury temperature records to digital affect the temperature data?\u201d I asked</p><p>\u201cThe shift from mercury thermometers to digital (electronic) sensors\u2014mostly completed by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) in the 1990s\u2014has sparked debate about its affect on temperature records.\u201d replied Grok, pointing to four considerations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Measurement differences:</emphasis></p><p>Mercury thermometers, used widely pre-1990s, measure temperature via liquid expansion in glass, read manually once or twice daily (typically 9 AM and 3 PM). Digital sensors, like the platinum resistance probes in Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), record continuously, sampling every second and averaging over a minute. Mercury\u2019s slow response smooths out fleeting spikes\u2014say, a 30-second heat burst from a gust over asphalt. Digital sensors catch those blips, potentially pushing daily maxima up. BoM\u2019s own tests (e.g., 2013 parallel studies) show AWS can read 0.3\u20130.5\u00b0C higher than mercury under identical conditions, especially on hot, windy days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Siting and standards:</emphasis></p><p>The transition overlapped with station upgrades. Pre-1990s, many mercury thermometers sat in Stevenson screens at rural sites\u2014grass fields, less urban heat interference. AWS rollout sometimes moved sensors closer to heat sources (e.g., concrete, airports). A 2017 audit by the Australian National Audit Office flagged 20 per cent of BoM sites breaching siting guidelines\u2014like Thredbo\u2019s AWS near a carpark, skewing readings up. BoM insists adjustments (homogenization) fix this, but critics like Jennifer Marohasy argue the tweaks underestimate urban heat island effects, inflating trends by 0.2\u00b0C per century.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data continuity:</emphasis></p><p>BoM\u2019s ACORN-SAT dataset, starting 1910, blends both eras, adjusting raw data to account for equipment shifts. The switch itself isn\u2019t logged as a clean break\u2014parallel recordings (mercury vs. AWS) ran briefly at sites like Rutherglen (1994\u20131996), showing AWS maxima averaging 0.4\u00b0C higher. BoM caps AWS readings at a 5-second response time to mimic mercury lag, but skeptics say this doesn\u2019t fully bridge the gap. Result? Post-1990\u2019s maxima likely edge higher\u2014maybe 0.1\u20130.3\u00b0C\u2014than if mercury had stayed. Trends (1.4\u00b0C warming since 1910) hold broad shape, but the rate might be slightly overstated, especially in heatwave records.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bottom line:</emphasis></p><p>The switch doesn\u2019t \u201cfake\u201d warming\u2014global datasets like NASA GISS align with BoM\u2019s trend\u2014but it nudges absolute temperatures up a fraction and sharpens extremes. Without unadjusted raw data (rarely public), it\u2019s hard to pin the exact skew, but it\u2019s not zero. Think tenths of a degree, not whole degrees.</p><p>Grok appeared quite considered in it\u2019s response. Noting I didn\u2019t ask about the impacts of deforestation, drying out of landscapes that could also contribute to the issue. </p><p>I did delve into bushfires more. </p><p>\u201cHow does the lack of management and traditional burn backs influence bushfires?\u201d I asked</p><p>\u201cThe decline in fuel management\u2014especially traditional Indigenous burning\u2014and modern fire suppression policies have reshaped bushfire intensity. Here\u2019s the data and logic:\u201d replied Grok, with it\u2019s reasoning. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Historical context:</emphasis></p><p>Indigenous burn-backs, documented since pre-1788 via colonial journals and pollen records, used low-intensity fires every 2\u20135 years to clear undergrowth. Charcoal layers in southeast soils (e.g., Lake George) show frequent, small burns kept fuel loads at 2\u20134 tonnes per hectare. Post-colonization, European grazing and fire bans slashed this\u2014by 1900, burning dropped 80 per cent in areas like Victoria\u2019s Gippsland. Today\u2019s eucalypt forests carry 10\u201330 tonnes per hectare, per CSIRO fuel assessments, 3\u201310 times pre-colonial levels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modern management:</emphasis></p><p>Hazard reduction burns\u2014controlled fires to thin fuel\u2014aim to mimic this but fall short. In NSW, the Rural Fire Service targets 135,000 hectares annually; from 2010\u20132019, it averaged 120,000, just 1 per cent of public land. Victoria hit 130,000 hectares in 2023\u20142 per cent of forests\u2014against a 5 per cent goal. Weather (narrow burn windows), funding (A$100 million/year vs. estimated A$300 million needed), and urban sprawl (smoke complaints) throttle efforts. Compare: Black Summer 2019\u201320 burned 18 million hectares\u2014unmanaged fuel let it rip.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire behaviour:</emphasis></p><p>Fuel load drives fire intensity. The Byram fireline intensity equation (I = H \u00d7 W \u00d7 R) ties heat output (I) to fuel weight (W). Double the fuel, double the energy\u201410 tonnes/hectare might yield 5,000 kW/m; 30 tonnes hits 15,000 kW/m, jumping from controllable to crown-fire territory. Black Saturday 2009 (15 million hectares) and Black Summer saw Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) values soar\u2014100+ vs. a 1970s average of 25\u2014partly due to drought, but heavy fuel turned dry spells into infernos. Indigenous burns kept FFDI-equivalent risk lower; explorer Thomas Mitchell noted \u201cpark-like\u201d landscapes in 1836, rarely seen now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evidence:</emphasis></p><p>Studies (e.g., 2020 Bushfire Royal Commission) link poor fuel management to 30\u201350 per cent higher fire severity. X posts from rural users\u2014like \u201c20 years unburnt, then boom\u201d\u2014echo CSIRO\u2019s 2024 finding: unburnt sites near Sydney had 40 per cent thicker undergrowth than managed plots, doubling flame heights in tests. Suppression (putting out small fires) also builds fuel\u2014decades of \u201csave everything\u201d left forests primed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Grok-2.jpg\">The results when I asked Grok 3 to add my beard. Photo: The Koondrook and Barham Bridge Newspaper</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bottom line:</emphasis></p><p>Lack of burn-backs\u2014traditional or modern\u2014supercharges bushfires. Intensity\u2019s up (50 per cent more extreme fire days since 1980s, per BoM) because fuel\u2019s unchecked. Drought and heat set the stage, but 10\u201320 extra tonnes of dry scrub turn sparks into monsters. Managed burning is no cure-all\u2014scale and climate limit it\u2014but the data\u2019s clear: neglect stacks the deck for bigger blazes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Connecting the dots:</emphasis></p><p>Hotter digital readings might slightly hype the drought-fire link, but the bushfire surge is more about fuel than thermometers. Both shifts\u2014tech and land management\u2014amplify perceptions of \u201cintensifying\u201d extremes, though the core drivers (warming, fuel loads) stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>It took some prompting, but we did get to some of the broader considerations of the original statement. </p><p>Having challenged the nation's direction, I turned to the joy, or lack thereof, of humanity. I probed about ancient practices of yoga, meditation and our modern values. After a few back-and-forths Grok simple stated,</p><p> \u201cWhy Not More Joyful Already? Systems aren\u2019t built for it. Capitalism thrives on scarcity\u2014keep people chasing, not chilling. Schools churn out workers, not feel-good masters. Pharma\u2019s a A$50 billion industry in Australia (2024)\u2014pills trump prana for profit. And pain\u2019s loud\u2014joy\u2019s quiet, so we fixate on what screams. X posts reflect this: \u201cWorld\u2019s a mess\u201d gets 10x the likes of \u201cHad a great day.\u201d Attention bias skews us grim.\u201d</p><p>What a time to be alive! </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/03/06/the-koondrook-and-barham-bridge-newspaper-6-march-2025/\"/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/KBB6March2025p1.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>This article appeared in\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/03/06/the-koondrook-and-barham-bridge-newspaper-6-march-2025/\">The Koondrook and Barham Bridge Newspaper, 6 March 2025</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>I requested Grok 3 to create a picture of us having a conversation.

It will be a nasty day, we need to make sure we are ready.\"</p><p>Heffernan also said western locations such as Lake Bolac, Westmere and Streatham could be \"pushing to the low end of catastrophic\" based on weather predictions.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said many parts of the state's forests were ready to burn.</p><p>\"If you are in West Gippsland, South Gippsland and even the Mornington Peninsula, we can see that those forested areas are what we call ready to carry fire if we get an ignition source,\" Hardman said.</p><p>\"Fire can move through those landscapes, and once you get some ignition and the wind behind it, it can become devastating very, very quickly.\"</p><p>Hardman said people heading away on holidays needed to stay abreast of conditions at their destination. He warned all Victorians to have multiple ways to access emergency services information in case power or mobile services went out and have fire plans ready to go.</p><p>\"If there is a fire in the area you are going to, don't go there.

A massive fire near the town of Dimboola has destroyed some popular tourist accommodation and a number of other buildings. Several areas of the nation are still enduring hot weather, with parts of Sydney hitting 40 degrees. Alison Xiao reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> In far western Victoria, flames raged overnight, turning the sky orange as strong winds took hold. It was a difficult time for Dimboola residents like Irina Bennewitz, who were told to evacuate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Irina Bennewitz:</emphasis> We took our four doggos and our cat and just left when we got the alert to go.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> She says the community she moved into just seven months ago has been taking care of each other.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Irina Bennewitz:</emphasis> Things picked up from about 6.30 on, we went holy moly something's going on and that's when everyone activated and the town just moved and people rang to see that everyone was living alone, was safe and all of that stuff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> Irina Bennewitz has come to Horsham, along with many other evacuees.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Irina Bennewitz:</emphasis> We're shaken up but we're okay and that's the main thing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> The out of control bushfires in the Little Desert National Park area have already burnt through more than 65,000 hectares. Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Rick Nugent says some structures have been lost.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rick Nugent:</emphasis> We do know unfortunately the Little Desert Nature Lodge has been destroyed by fire. We also believe that a farmhouse west of Dimboola on Coco Dam Road has been lost. We also believe a second farmhouse near the river west of Dimboola may also have been impacted.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> Euan Ritchie is a Professor of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at Deakin University. He's led research groups through the popular eco lodge that's been destroyed and says the loss of native wildlife is gut-wrenching.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Euan Ritchie:</emphasis> You can't underestimate just how special this place is and was to people. There's more than 230 species of bird that have been recorded there. There's lots of really wonderful mammals, different species of pygmy possum, lots of reptiles, really diverse animals and also the plants as well. So it is a really special place and I guess we're just hoping that most of those animals have managed to survive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> Local chef Cat Clarke opened her Dimboola Golf Club restaurant on the outskirts of Little Desert National Park a few months ago after securing a lease.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cat Clarke:</emphasis> It was pretty horrific. Sorry, just a little bit scattered. I haven't slept much. The wind was just atrocious, changing directions left, right and centre and you could see the smoke. Sorry. It's like it's just, it's a lot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> She evacuated to the nearby town of Warracknabeal last night but hadn't been back to assess the damage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cat Clarke:</emphasis> Like it's just in shock because at the end of the day the environment and we're on horticultural and it's just dry. It's the perfect conditions for an atrocious fire and even driving out and seeing the smoke is just, there's no stopping a force like that. I've just been sent a video through so the building itself is still standing but everything around it's gone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> An emergency warning for the fire near Dimboola was downgraded to watch and act level around lunchtime while 90 kilometres to the south, an emergency warning for a separate fire in the Grampians National Park was also downgraded. The Grampians area was hit hard by bushfires just last month which destroyed four homes and burnt through 76,000 hectares of national park and farmland. Authorities worry that the area will continue to burn, warning that the multiple blazes ignited by lightning strikes could merge into a significant fire and threaten nearby towns. Chris Hardman is Chief Fire Officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Hardman:</emphasis> The Grampians fire will be a real challenge for the coming days and potentially weeks. So the last fire was about 21 days, this will be a similar scenario.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> Local resident Ros McArthur lost fencing during the last Grampians fires and could see today's blaze from her art studio.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ros McArthur:</emphasis> It's a bit daunting again but I'm watching the range to the west, the Victoria range. It's alive, it's a lot of smoke.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> Both the Little Desert and Grampians National Parks are closed to visitors. Mark Sleeman, the CEO of Grampians Wimmera Mallee Tourism says the fires this summer and last summer have been devastating for tourism operators.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Sleeman:</emphasis> Parts of our region that are focused very heavily on tourism like Dunkeld and Halls Gap and Pomonal have all been significantly impacted by the last summer and it's certainly going to take a long time for those businesses to even consider recovering.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> As fires rage in Victoria, much of the rest of the country has been suffering through extreme heat. In Western Sydney, the temperature hit 41 degrees. Parts of South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory are also experiencing heatwave conditions. Senior Weather Bureau Forecaster Sarah Scully says Perth will likely see temperatures above 40 degrees from tomorrow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sarah Scully:</emphasis> The temperature in Perth today 37, tomorrow 41 and it's really going to be well above 35 degrees for the rest of the week.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alison Xiao:</emphasis> Authorities have been warning people to take extra care amid the heatwave, especially those at risk, including older people, pregnant and breastfeeding women and those with medical conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Samantha Donovan:</emphasis> Alison Xiao, and if you're in an area affected by the fires, tune in to your local ABC, your emergency broadcaster, for the latest updates.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCAM-104869208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F0N-54P3-RTK0-R091-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"957\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PM(ABC Transcript)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4050\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 28, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;

However, all fire districts - apart from East Gippsland - now have an extreme fire danger rating on Thursday.</p><p>\"The bush is dry,\" Heffernan said. \"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: it is ready to burn.\"</p><p>Heffernan said he was considering a statewide total fire ban on Boxing Day and would confirm his decision today.</p><p>State Control Centre spokesman Luke Heagarty said: \"This is the most significant fire danger that the state has seen - across the whole sections of the state that we're talking about - since Black Summer.\"</p><p>Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria, said more than 300 firefighters and about 18 aircraft were battling the Grampians bushfire yesterday. He said planned burns were preparing defences for nearby townships such as Pomonal and Moyston as conditions worsen on Thursday and Friday.</p><p>\"The communities around Dunkeld will very much be in the firing line again,\" he said.</p><p>Hardman said most bushfire fatalities happened when a dangerous wind change took hold, meaning firefighters were particularly concerned with reinforcing protections on the eastern flank of the Grampians fire. \"But when Mother Nature decides that she's going to push fire at a rapid rate, it becomes what we call beyond suppression limits. So ... occasionally it's not possible for [firefighters] to make a difference,\" he said.</p><p>In the Macedon Ranges, the 144-hectare Bullengarook fire near Gisborne remains out of control and could flare up in comings days.</p><p>North of Ballarat, a fire under control near Creswick could jump containment lines and threaten the regional city's northern suburbs, Hardman warned.</p><p>On the Bass Coast, crews were using bulldozers to create a perimeter around the smaller bushfire near The Gurdies. \"That fire has enormous potential to grow on Boxing Day,\" Hardman said.</p><p>Nugent said it would be far easier for new dangerous fires to start on Thursday and Friday. He said temperatures in Victoria's north would be about 38 to 42 degrees and would be accompanied by hot, gusty northerly wind. \"Later in the day, we expect a wind change to occur late afternoon and then the strong and gusty wind from the south-west and west. They could be up to 100km/h,\" he said.</p><p>Nugent said more than 100 extra firefighting resources had been called in from Tasmania, Queensland, NSW and the ACT. Eighty extra specialist firefighters would be deployed to the Grampians.</p><p>Seventy firefighting aircraft would be ready to support crews on the ground.</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Vicki Ward spoke to her federal counterpart, Jenny McAllister, at the weekend and was told the Commonwealth was preparing disaster relief payments.</p><p>The popular tourist town of Halls Gap was evacuated on Saturday. Emergency warnings have since been downgraded to watch-and-act alerts, but Halls Gap CFA said yesterday the road to the town remained closed.</p><p>Yesterday afternoon, watch-and-act alerts remained active for Pomonal, Mafeking, Moyston, Great Western, Bellfield, Bellfield Settlement, Flat Rock Crossing, Fyans Creek, Grampians Junction, Barton, Watgania, Lake Fyans, Bellellen, Black Range, Jallukar, Lake Fyans, Londonderry, Rhymney and Willaura North.

At times, there are more ducks than cars on the main road.</p><p>Stawell resident Harland Henderson, his son, Rick, and Rick's 14-year-old son, Riley, have set up their small caravan under a shady tree in the local caravan park, continuing a family tradition of three generations holidaying together in Halls Gap.</p><p>Harland raced down on Wednesday morning, when the town was reopened to the public, after being evacuated on December 20. He needn't have worried about missing a prime spot. Save for a solitary camper who has pitched his tent 100 metres away, they have the park to themselves.</p><p>\"I've been coming to Halls Gap for years, and I've never seen it like this.

The Country Fire Authority says it destroyed four homes in Moyston and Mafeking, 40 outbuildings, claimed 1285 beehives, killed 775 sheep, a horse and a beef cow. The toll on native flora and fauna is unknown.</p><p>It started in a remote and inaccessible part of the national park and eventually spread over a vast area of more than 440 kilometres, burning for three weeks before firefighters contained it. Halls Gap was reopened to the public on January 8.</p><p/><p>The Grampians (Gariwerd) National Park was officially reopened two days later on January 10, though much of its southern section remains off-limits as the fire continues to smoulder there. Falling trees burning from the inside out also present a hazard, and many of the walking trails have been damaged.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/a-grampians-town-s-remarkable-recovery-after-the-beast-burnt-through-20240502-p5fojj.html\">Where last February's fire ripped through the small town of Pomonal in a day</url>, this fire was more of a slow burn, what firefighters call a \"campaign fire\".</p><p>Halls Gap resident Jono Almond is an operations officer with Forest Fire Management Victoria, and was part of an army of hundreds of firefighters who worked to contain the fire over a 21-day campaign. The firefight took them within 200 metres of the closest homes in Bellfield, a tiny hamlet at the southern tip of the Halls Gap township.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.092%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/ee7dd52eb96443c0d2dbb99e1ab63b8b80fc2ba6\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>Almond said the dry vegetation and the steep terrain had helped the fire to spread quickly and made it difficult for firefighters to reach it. Bulldozers and even fixed-wing aircraft struggled to reach the fire. Helicopters had more success.</p><p>\"We had the weather on our side, but the fuel and terrain was against us,\" he says. \"Then we had a couple of - we call them blow-up days - significant weather days where the fire made major runs across our landscape, which then started to impact on private assets and critical infrastructure.\"</p><p>The Gariwerd landscape is 440 million years old. It has burnt before and will burn again. Fire is an essential part of its ecology. But fires are also happening with increasing frequency, Almond says.</p><p>\"South-eastern Australia is a fire-prone area, and we just need to understand that it's happening more often than what we remember in recorded fire history,\" he says. \"In the last 20 years here in Gariwerd, we've seen a definite increase in fire activity in this landscape.\"</p><p>Justine Hide has lived in Halls Gap for 10 years, runs a small tourism business and is deputy mayor of the Northern Grampians Shire.</p><p>She recalls getting the notice to evacuate at 10pm days before Christmas, as fire approached from the south, loading the car with \"two kids, two dogs, a cat, two guinea pigs\" and hitting the only road out of town.</p><p>\"We were driving out about 11pm and so was everybody else. It was like this mass exodus in the dark, in thick smoke, people that shouldn't be driving at night, elderly people, you could just tell they shouldn't be on the road, or people weren't coping. It was really scary, to be honest.\"</p><p>Later, Hide spoke with an elderly man who drove to Lake Fyans and slept in his car, facing the fire so he would wake up if it came in his direction.</p><p>\"Some people had nowhere to go,\" she says.</p><p>The Pomonal fire destroyed 45 homes and cost the local economy an estimated $202 million, Grampians Tourism chief executive Marc Sleeman says.</p><p>Though it is too soon to estimate the cost of this fire, Sleeman predicts it will be similarly harmful to the local economy, which relies heavily on tourism.</p><p/><p>\"In February, up to 2500 jobs were impacted; 460,000 visitors didn't come to our region because of the fires in February. The number is going to be up in the millions because of this fire, and the economic impact will be long-term.\"</p><p>Cherie Smith owns an ice-creamery and a gift shop in Halls Gap and says the town's closure coincided with the biggest trading period of the year.</p><p>\"Boxing Day is usually our huge day here for our ice-creamery. Just in one day, we probably lost over $10,000 in ice-creams,\" she says.</p><p>\"But we're here, that's the main thing. We can reopen, you've got to look at it in a positive way.\"</p><p>She hopes those who cancelled their summer bookings return on the Australia Day weekend or at Easter.</p><p>\"The accommodation places would be horrendously down,\" she says.</p><p>The community has also chipped in to help one of the area's biggest drawcards, the privately owned Halls Gap Zoo. The zoo faces heavy losses after being forced to close its doors during what should be its most profitable time of year.</p><p>\"January covers months like February when we actually lose money,\" zoo owner Mark Treweek says.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.092%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/05e77c5b0d3ece9e1c63d9c789aa7fc9a2a58c21\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>Treweek evacuated those animals that could be transported to Werribee Zoo and Ballarat Wildlife Park, took some home to his garage, then made daily visits to the zoo to feed and water the animals that remained for the evacuation period.</p><p>He also set up a GoFundMe page, which has received more than $90,000 in donations.</p><p>\"It's not something that I ever like doing or want to do, ask for money from donations,\" he says.</p><p>\"Personally, it's the only thing that's affected me during the whole fire. Bushfire, OK, I can't stop it. People being nice to you and donating $90,000, that's the only thing that's brought a tear to my eye.\"</p><p>The Allan government's new minister for small business, Natalie Suleyman, toured Halls Gap on the day the town reopened and met with affected business owners.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.12%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_6/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e3f3d67e632207960a21599398d33b03655ae33d\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>A government spokesperson said there were both Commonwealth and Victorian government-funded financial support services available, including up to 13 weeks of income support for workers and sole traders who had experienced loss of income.</p><p>But Hide criticises the support package, arguing it leaves most small business owners out in the cold.</p><p>She also says the government must reckon with the worsening affordability of insurance for a community that is experiencing fires more often due to climate change.</p><p>The cost of insurance for her own small business doubled after the Pomonal fire. She knows of another local business whose insurance bill rose from $1900 to $9500.</p><p>\"Insurance is out of control,\" she says. \"We're in a fire-prone area. No one can get fire coverage. If it burns down, you've lost your million-dollar house, or your $10 million business.\"</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.092%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/7cfa3be8956f0c3bab8a70fde3e28b7392f94051\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>It was an unceremonious moment when the national park, one of Victoria's natural wonders, was reopened on Friday.

In two days, he would begin his volunteer work, helping farmers to reconstruct hundreds of kilometres of damaged and destroyed fences.</p><p>Wheeler saw farmers in his own community in the upper Murray region who \"basically lost everything\" in the Black Summer fires of 2019-20 and says the volunteer movement of fence-builders provides powerful practical and moral support.</p><p/><p>\"People being nice to you and donating $90,000, that's the only thing that's brought a tear to my eye.\"</p><p/><p>Mark Treweek</p><p>\"It doesn't fix all of their problems by any means, but it just gives a start to an insurmountable problem and it also says there's some people on your team.\"</p><p>But first he planned to spend the day being a tourist, enjoying the environment and buying a meal and a coffee in Halls Gap.</p><p>\"I guess put some money into the town but also just let people here know they've been through a tough period.

The craggy peaks of the Grampians soar dramatically over either side of the town, their rugged slopes covered in dusky green eucalyptus forest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An abundance of kangaroos and emus graze in the grassy clearings between holiday houses and hotels. Screeching sulphur-crested cockatoos engage in turf wars with magpies in the trees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Maybe it's a bit too serene.</p><p/><p>It's a warm, sunny day in early January - the peak holiday season for this tourist town - and the place is eerily empty. At times, there are more ducks than cars on the main road.</p><p>Stawell resident Harland Henderson, his son, Rick, and Rick's 14-year-old son, Riley, have set up their small caravan under a shady tree in the local caravan park, continuing a family tradition of three generations holidaying together in Halls Gap.</p><p>Harland raced down on Wednesday morning, when the town was reopened to the public, after being evacuated on December 20. He needn't have worried about missing a prime spot. Save for a solitary camper who has pitched his tent 100 metres away, they have the park to themselves.</p><p>\"I've been coming to Halls Gap for years, and I've never seen it like this. It's the quietest I've ever seen it in my whole life,\" Harland says.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.252%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/52330a9b8efb4da7d95bf668416d1088b76721d0\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Justin McManus</p><p>Ordinarily, the park would be at or near capacity between Boxing Day and Australia Day, but the Grampians region has just endured its largest bushfire in almost 20 years, and its second major fire in less than 12 months.</p><p>Sparked by dry lightning, the fire burnt through more than 76,000 hectares of national park and farmland. The Country Fire Authority says it destroyed four homes in Moyston and Mafeking, 40 outbuildings, claimed 1285 beehives, killed 775 sheep, a horse and a beef cow. The toll on native flora and fauna is unknown.</p><p>It started in a remote and inaccessible part of the national park and eventually spread over a vast area of more than 440 kilometres, burning for three weeks before firefighters contained it. Halls Gap was reopened to the public on January 8.</p><p/><p>The Grampians (Gariwerd) National Park was officially reopened two days later on January 10, though much of its southern section remains off-limits as the fire continues to smoulder there. Falling trees burning from the inside out also present a hazard, and many of the walking trails have been damaged.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/a-grampians-town-s-remarkable-recovery-after-the-beast-burnt-through-20240502-p5fojj.html\">Where last February's fire ripped through the small town of Pomonal in a day</url>, this fire was more of a slow burn, what firefighters call a \"campaign fire\".</p><p>Halls Gap resident Jono Almond is an operations officer with Forest Fire Management Victoria, and was part of an army of hundreds of firefighters who worked to contain the fire over a 21-day campaign. The firefight took them within 200 metres of the closest homes in Bellfield, a tiny hamlet at the southern tip of the Halls Gap township.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.092%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/ee7dd52eb96443c0d2dbb99e1ab63b8b80fc2ba6\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>Almond said the dry vegetation and the steep terrain had helped the fire to spread quickly and made it difficult for firefighters to reach it. Bulldozers and even fixed-wing aircraft struggled to reach the fire. Helicopters had more success.</p><p>\"We had the weather on our side, but the fuel and terrain was against us,\" he says. \"Then we had a couple of - we call them blow-up days - significant weather days where the fire made major runs across our landscape, which then started to impact on private assets and critical infrastructure.\"</p><p>The Gariwerd landscape is 440 million years old. It has burnt before and will burn again. Fire is an essential part of its ecology. But fires are also happening with increasing frequency, Almond says.</p><p>\"South-eastern Australia is a fire-prone area, and we just need to understand that it's happening more often than what we remember in recorded fire history,\" he says. \"In the last 20 years here in Gariwerd, we've seen a definite increase in fire activity in this landscape.\"</p><p>Justine Hide has lived in Halls Gap for 10 years, runs a small tourism business and is deputy mayor of the Northern Grampians Shire.</p><p>She recalls getting the notice to evacuate at 10pm days before Christmas, as fire approached from the south, loading the car with \"two kids, two dogs, a cat, two guinea pigs\" and hitting the only road out of town.</p><p>\"We were driving out about 11pm and so was everybody else. It was like this mass exodus in the dark, in thick smoke, people that shouldn't be driving at night, elderly people, you could just tell they shouldn't be on the road, or people weren't coping. It was really scary, to be honest.\"</p><p>Later, Hide spoke with an elderly man who drove to Lake Fyans and slept in his car, facing the fire so he would wake up if it came in his direction.</p><p>\"Some people had nowhere to go,\" she says.</p><p>The Pomonal fire destroyed 45 homes and cost the local economy an estimated $202 million, Grampians Tourism chief executive Marc Sleeman says.</p><p>Though it is too soon to estimate the cost of this fire, Sleeman predicts it will be similarly harmful to the local economy, which relies heavily on tourism.</p><p/><p>\"In February, up to 2500 jobs were impacted; 460,000 visitors didn't come to our region because of the fires in February. The number is going to be up in the millions because of this fire, and the economic impact will be long-term.\"</p><p>Cherie Smith owns an ice-creamery and a gift shop in Halls Gap and says the town's closure coincided with the biggest trading period of the year.</p><p>\"Boxing Day is usually our huge day here for our ice-creamery. Just in one day, we probably lost over $10,000 in ice-creams,\" she says.</p><p>\"But we're here, that's the main thing. We can reopen, you've got to look at it in a positive way.\"</p><p>She hopes those who cancelled their summer bookings return on the Australia Day weekend or at Easter.</p><p>\"The accommodation places would be horrendously down,\" she says.</p><p>The community has also chipped in to help one of the area's biggest drawcards, the privately owned Halls Gap Zoo.

meet its own risk reduction target of 85 per cent in its vast metropolitan Melbourne district, the same level as it was in the leadup to Black Saturday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/victorias-bushfire-risk-management-report-2023-2024\">Victoria's bushfire risk management report 2023-2024</url>, which the government quietly released on December 17, shows the buildup of fuel loads in forests surrounding Whittlesea, St Andrews, Christmas Hills, Mount Dandenong and the Mornington Peninsula have now raised the residual risk to 92 per cent.</p><p>A 100 per cent residual risk assumes the most extreme loss of property from a fire, where the build-up of fuel loads has reached its maximum, due to no planned burning or major fires.</p><p>The late professor Kevin Tolhurst, who along with his colleague Derek Chong developed the Phoenix Rapid Fire computer model used to calculate residual risk, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/fuel-loads-soar-as-andrews-government-plays-with-numbers/news-story/10fec748cb3b8096b8999b2747bf9ba7\">repeatedly warned that even setting the risk level at 85 per cent was equivalent to \"accepting the same level of losses as Black Saturday</url>, when 2007 homes were destroyed and 173 Victorians died\".</p><p>Howitt Society member John Cameron said \"much of Victoria's forest carries 20 to 40 tonnes per hectare of dead leaves, twigs and bark, with the ability to burn as intensely as 7000 to 14,000 litres a hectare of petrol\". </p><p>\"Forest fuel is even more dangerous because burning bark shards create spot fires well ahead of the fire front,\" Mr Cameron said.</p><p>The government's Forest Fire Management Victoria crews have also struggled to keep fuel loads down in the Grampians' Midlands district, where the risk target was set at 70 per cent, but has now reached 77 per cent in the Wombat, Lerderderg and Creswick forests. </p><p>FFMVic crews have been frustrated by bureaucratic delays and even legal challenges from environment groups trying to stop them conducting fuel reduction burns and building fire breaks. </p><p>Seventeen former native timber harvest and haulage crews, who entered into Victorian Government contracts on July 1 last year to undertake forest and fire management works, were left sitting idle until November due to delays in departmental planning and survey work.</p><p>Mr Cameron said FFMVic also had \"too many suits and not enough boots\" on the ground when it came to meeting its on-ground targets\".</p><p>The latest risk management report states FFMVic spent just $36.6m of its $161.5m fuel management budget on building fire breaks, fuel reduction burns and clearing in 2023-24.</p><p>The bulk of the funds, $124.9m were spent on indirect fuel management costs relating to business and resource management, strategic planning, equipment, infrastructure and what it called \"capability\".</p><p>FFMVic also spent more than $1.5 million fighting federal court cases brought by the Warburton Environment Group, which has demanded a halt to clearing hollow-bearing trees along fuel breaks and the Save Our Strathbogie Forest group that tried to stop prescribed burns. </p><p>FFMVic plans to construct 500kms of fire breaks annually over the next five years, but must await the outcome of the Warburton Environment Group's case before it can build any in Victoria's Central Highlands.</p><p>In the Midlands FFMVic and the now defunct VicForests agency have<url

group</url>.</p><p>The latest management report warns the \"bushfire risk in Midlands District has been increasing due to the limited opportunities to carry out planned burning in the Wombat State Forest area due to weather patterns (consisting of long wet periods and a quick transition to dry weather) and the impacts of the 2021 windstorms.</p><p>\"Risk will continue to increase if current limitations on planned burning in the area persist.\"</p><p>FFMVic chief officer Chris Hardman said \"following the La Ni\u00f1a conditions of recent years, conditions are now more favourable for planned burning.</p><p>\"Over the past year we have taken advantage of these conditions and reduced fuel-driven bushfire risk across more than 138,000 hectares of public land through planned burns and mechanical fuel treatments statewide fuel-driven bushfire risk below target.\"</p><p>But the statewide target of 70 per cent is an average, which fails to account for regional risk rising to much higher levels.</p><p>The Royal Commission into the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires recommended \"the State fund and commit to implementing a long-term program of prescribed burning based on an annual rolling target of 5 per cent minimum of public land\", equal to 385,000ha.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

debt</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a major blow to Victorian households, Treasurer Tim Pallas has revealed that the state's fire services levy will be almost doubled and parking fees will increase across Melbourne's inner suburbs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new revenue grabs were unveiled in a mid-year budget update on Friday which shows the state's deficit had grown by $1.4bn for this financial year.</p><p>The deficit, originally forecast to be $2.2bn for 2024-25, has now grown to $3.6bn.</p><p>The government, however, is still forecasting to return to an operating surplus in 2025-26.</p><p>Net debt has dropped slightly, coming in at $155.2bn this financial year compared with $156.2bn forecast in the May budget. </p><p>It is now expected to reach $187.3bn in 2028, $500m less than previously forecast.</p><p>Pressed over why the government couldn't find cash in the pool of current funding, Mr Pallas said \"the state always cuts its cloth to meet the needs of the community\".</p><p>\"We need to have a greater capacity to... protect the Victorian people,\" he said.</p><p>The Fire Services Property Levy will be replaced by a new Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund (ESVF) from July 1, 2025.</p><p>On Friday, Emergency Services Minister Jaclyn Symes said the new levy would support more agencies including VICSES, Triple Zero Victoria, the State Control Centre, Emergency Management Victoria, Emergency Recovery Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria, in addition to the CFA and Fire Rescue Victoria.</p><p>Ms Symes said the overhaul of the levy would better support the state's emergency services as they faced more demand.</p><p>\"Whether its fire, floods, or weather due to climate change what we are seeing is more severe and more regular disasters and demand on our emergency services,\" she said.</p><p>\"Year-on-year we are seeing increases in relation to the emergency service incident we attends.\"</p><p>\"There has been more than 100 per cent increase in the amount of flood and storm activities that the SES has had to respond to in just 12 months alone.\"</p><p>In the May budget the fire services levy was predicted to rake in more than $4 billion.</p><p>The budget update revealed the new levy, which appears on homeowner's rates notices, will now rake in $6.27 billion over the next five years, including a whopping $1.8 billion in 2027/28.</p><p>Ms Symes admitted the new levy would require legislative change and would need to be rushed through the parliament early next year to be in place in time. </p><p>She encouraged the Greens and the Coalition to support the move.</p><p>The government said the new levy would also help fund a new $250 million package to support CFA and VICSES volunteers across the state.</p><p>This included $53 million in a modernised VicEmergency app and $30 million to deliver training and support programs.</p><p>Motorists will also be hit with higher parking fees in suburbs along the city fringe.</p><p>\"The congestion levy is effectively a levy for the use of commercial carparking, or indeed business provided staff carparking,\" he said. </p><p>\"There are carve outs under the under congested levy for street on street parking, private carparking lots.</p><p>\"The aim here is to recognise that congestion is going to cost the Victorian economy about ten billion a year by 2030 is the estimate.\"</p><p>Opposition Leader John Pesutto called the levy increase a \"massive tax grab\".</p><p>\"We can see from these papers that there is a massive tax grab, that the fire services levy tax will be increased to obtain more than $2 billion out of households, commercial operators, industrial operators and farmers,\" he said.

The fire has burned through more than 75,000 hectares of land, so far no homes are believed to have been lost. But as the state receives a welcome reprieve from elevated fire danger, parts of New South Wales are bracing for hot and windy conditions. Lexie Jeuniewic reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> Ripping through dense bushland, the blaze in the Grampians National Park in Victoria's west which started just over a week ago has grown to the size of a small country. Luke Hegarty is a spokesperson for the State Control Centre.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Luke Hegarty:</emphasis> To give people some idea, it was 6,000 this time last week, and so that's with a 364 kilometre perimeter. The magnitude of that is somewhere around the size of Singapore.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> Overnight, the enormous fire sparked eight emergency warnings after winds rose late in the day. It was an added challenge for fire crews who'd been battling conditions similar to those seen in the black summer bushfires. But today, firefighters are making the most of cooler, calmer conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Hardman:</emphasis> We've got a reasonable outlook from a weather point of view, but we did have lightning right across the state last night, and we could see new ignitions today. So it's high fire risk right across Victoria, except in the north central, so bushfires can still move, so people will still need to maintain that situational awareness, but it is so much better than it was yesterday.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> Chris Hardman is the Chief Fire Officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria. He says impact assessment teams are surveying the damage. We</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Hardman:</emphasis> certainly know that we've got some agricultural losses, sheep and beehives, for instance, but we also saw through our aviation assets that there were some sheds and other assets lost.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> The Grampians National Park blaze is expected to burn for weeks to come. Along with physical fatigue, those on the front lines say they're bracing for a tough mental challenge this summer. Elle Moyle is a volunteer with the Country Fire Authority.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elle Moyle:</emphasis> It's going to be a really long, long summer. I'm only a few minutes from the mountains here at Dunkeld, and there's smoke all day every day, and I've got friends who are at massive risk at the moment with the current winds. So yeah, every time there's a wind change, there's a new risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan says disaster relief payments are now available for impacted residents.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jacinta Allan:</emphasis> These hardship grants are available from today, and if people can ring the emergency, big emergency hotline or visit one of the relief centres, these payments will be made available.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> Speaking on ABC Radio Melbourne, she had an explicit warning for anyone thinking of ignoring advice from authorities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jacinta Allan:</emphasis> Follow the rules. Don't be, as I said, Justin a dickhead on total fire ban days because it can put people's lives at risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> As Victoria receives some reprieve from challenging conditions, the heat and wind is ramping up in New South Wales, prompting total fire bans in four districts, including the Greater Sydney and Greater Hunter regions. Inspector Ben Shepard is from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ben Shepherd:</emphasis> We are expecting to see temperatures move into the high 30s, maybe in some cases even low 40s. Some dry humidities though as well, sitting around about that 10, 12 per cent in most places and getting up as high as 20, 30 per cent. But it's coupled with these very strong west to north-westerly winds, we could see gusts upwards of 50 to even possibly 60 kilometres an hour. So that is going to prove problematic later on this afternoon as well. Primarily it's going to be in coastal areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lexie Jeuniewic:</emphasis> He warned New South Wales residents the dangerous conditions are likely to continue into the weekend before potentially easing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Isobel Roe:</emphasis> Lexie Jeuniewic with that report.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCINS-104765932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCWLD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DRS-SFH3-RSR1-K4R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473395</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The World Today (ABC transcript)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4086\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 27, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000A3C5</classCode><className>GREAT DIVIDING RANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He said forest fuel is even more dangerous because \"burning bark shards create spot fires well ahead of the fire front\".</p><p>The government's Forest Fire Management Victoria crews have also struggled to keep fuel loads down in the Grampians' Midlands district, \" Continued Page 4theweeklytimes.com.au \" Opinion, Page 16 \" Rule's View, Page 33 \" From Page 1 where the risk target was set at 70 per cent, but has now reached 77 per cent in the Wombat, Lerderderg and Cres-wick forests.</p><p>FFMVic crews have been frustrated by bureaucratic delays and even legal challenges from environment groups trying to stop them conducting fuel reduction burns and building fire breaks.</p><p>Seventeen former native timber harvest and haulage crews, who entered into Victorian Government contracts on July 1 last year to undertake forest and fire management works, were left sitting idle until November due to delays in departmental planning and survey work.</p><p>Mr Cameron said FFMVic also had \"too many suits and not enough boots\" on the ground when it came to meeting its on-ground targets\".</p><p>The latest risk management report states FFMVic spent just $36.6m of its $161.5m fuel management budget on building fire breaks, fuel reduction burns and clearing in 2023-24. The bulk of the funds, $124.9m, were spent on indirect fuel management costs relating to business and resource management, strategic planning, equipment, infrastructure and what it called \"capability\".</p><p>FFMVic also spent more than $1.5 million fighting federal court cases brought by the Warburton Environment Group, which has demanded a halt to clearing hollow-bearing trees along fuel breaks and the Save Our Strathbogie Forest group that tried to stop prescribed burns.</p><p>FFMVic plans to construct 500kms of fire breaks annually over the next five years, but must await the outcome of the Warburton Environment Group's case before it can build any in Victoria's Central Highlands.</p><p>In the Midlands FFMVic and the now defunct VicForests agency have also struggled to clear thousands of tonnes of trees left lying on the forest floor from storms of June 2021, due to bureaucratic hurdles and Supreme Court legal action by the Wombat Forestcare group.</p><p>The latest management report warns the \"bushfire risk in Midlands District has been increasing due to the limited opportunities to carry out planned burning in the Wombat State Forest area due to weather patterns (consisting of long wet periods and a quick transition to dry weather) and the impacts of the 2021 windstorms.</p><p>\"Risk will continue to increase if current limitations on planned burning in the area persist.\" FFMVic chief officer Chris Hardman said \"following the La Ni\u00c3\u00b1a conditions of recent years, conditions are now more favourable for planned burning.</p><p>\"Over the past year we have taken advantage of these conditions and reduced fuel-driven bushfire risk across more than 138,000 hectares of public land through planned burns and mechanical fuel treatments statewide fuel-driven bushfire risk below target.\" But the statewide target of 70 per cent is an average, which fails to account for regional risk rising to much higher levels.</p><p>The Royal Commission into the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires recommended \"the State fund and commit to implementing a long-term program of prescribed burning based on an annual rolling target of 5 per cent minimum of public land\", equal to 385,000ha.</p><p>OFF TARGET Fuel-driven bushfire risk 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2023-24 BUSHFIRE RISK IN THE PORT PHILLIP REGION TARGET 85% Port Phillip Region

Now is also the time to prepare yourself and your loved ones for the fire season. Here are some quick tips to help you get started.</p><p>1. Visit cfa.vic.gov.au to help you get started on a bushfire plan so you know what you will do in case of fire.</p><p>2. Download and get to know the VicEmergency app - then set up \"watch zones\" and turn on notifications to be kept up to date wherever you are.</p><p>3. Get to know the Australian Fire Danger Ratings System - and work out what fire danger rating will trigger your bushfire plan.</p><p>4. Plan your travel - head to exploreoutdoors.vic.gov.au to help you stay safe when visiting state forests.</p><p>5. Never leave a campfire unattended - if they are cool to touch, they are safe to leave.</p><p>Wishing everyone a safe and happy festive season.</p><p>Chris Hardman, Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-d7bf132ab5cf11efae90c89f0f4accb17e58a89887c6c28eccfcdd576f8dc5eb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DR4-8CX3-RRRW-D1MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 24, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSAS</classCode><className>DISINFORMATION &amp;

The budget deficit had increased by $1.4 billion since the $2.2 billion forecast in the May budget, the papers reveal.</p><p>Mr Pallas announced that the rate of the state's fire services levy - collected by councils for the state government to pay for the emergency service - would be doubled, increasing revenue from the tax by $2.14 billion over the next four years.</p><p>The median cost per household will rise from $191 to $254 but commercial properties will pay an extra $492, while the bill for farmers will jump from $621 to $1299, under the changes.</p><p>It would be renamed the emergency services and volunteers fund and retooled to provide money towards other emergency services, such as Triple Zero Victoria and Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>\"The state always cuts its cloth to meet the needs of the community. We have to accept we are living in a changing and more dangerous environment, and we have to make provisions for it,\" Mr Pallas said.</p><p>The government will also axe a $100 discount on registrations for EVs from January 2026, which is forecast to add $165 million to state revenue by 2028.</p><p>And Victoria's congestion levy, a parking tax in inner-city Melbourne, would be expanded and increased, bringing in an extra $300 million over four years.</p><p>Mr Pallas said he did not expect the cancellation of the EV rebate to discourage EV take-up - its original purpose was to encourage it - and that the government did not \"need to be out there proselytising that people should get onto EVs\".</p><p>Net debt to GSP is projected to climb from 24.2 per cent to 25 per cent in 2025 before peaking at 25.2 per cent in 2026 and dropping back to 25 per cent in 2027-28.</p><p>Pressure has been growing on Premier Jacinta Allan over Labor's management of the state economy, and escalated when independent economist Saul Eslake published a detailed critique in The Australian Financial Review last month.</p><p>Ms Allan has rejected the criticism, and this week announced a plan to try to revive business investment in the state.</p><p>Mr Eslake on Friday said the dire state of Victoria's finances appeared \"little changed\" in the latest update, adding: \"At least it hasn't got any worse.\"</p><p>But the government's revenue measures fell far short of what was needed to start reining in ballooning state debt and government spending.</p><p>\"There's been no material change in the government's fiscal strategy - no serious effort to rein in either operating or infrastructure spending,\" Mr Eslake said.</p><p>\"[There's] a little bit of additional revenue-raising, and as yet no credible path back to an overall cash surplus which would allow it to start paying down debt, as opposed to merely running it up at a slower pace.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, high-profile Liberal MP Sam Groth on Friday quit the opposition frontbench in what could be the first sign of a leadership move against embattled leader John Pesutto.</p><p>Mr Pesutto on Thursday was found to have defamed ousted Liberal MP Moira Deeming as a Nazi sympathiser and ordered to pay her $300,000, worsening an internal crisis in the party.</p><p>Mr Groth - a former professional tennis player who has made no secret of his ambition to be premier - said as \"a matter of conscience\" he could not stay on the frontbench following Mr Pesutto's refusal to step down after the verdict.</p><p>Upper house MP Bev McArthur on Friday urged Mr Pesutto to test his leadership by calling a party meeting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7yglc4x415k1iftm18he</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNH-J581-JD34-V4VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

This article is in response to <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/20/fire-severity-is-always-greater-in-areas-that-have-been-logged-david-lindenmayer-responds-to-robert-onfray/\">Fire severity is always greater in areas that have been logged: David Lindenmayer responds to Robert Onfray</url>. The entire series of articles and interchanges is listed below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David Lindenmayer's response to my rebuttal still fails to address the core points I raised <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/01/17/debunking-false-claims-about-bushfire-risk-and-native-forest-logging-in-australia/\">in my original blog</url> and overlooks the straightforward questions I posed in <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/18/logging-and-bushfire-risk-robert-onfray-responds-to-david-lindenmayer/\">my response to his critique</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is well understood that younger regrowth can experience more intense fires due to its size and dense structure compared to older forests. However, most regrowth results from past fires rather than logging. The fact that regrowth burns with greater intensity does not mean it drives the spread of large fires or makes forests more flammable overall. This is the core claim that Professor Lindenmayer is trying to prove, yet he has not provided empirical evidence to support it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Photo-of-Connors-Plain-2006-RO3.25.jpg\">This photo of Alpine Ash at Connors Plain where most mature and even old growth forest was killed during the December 2006 wildfires. The young post-harvest regrowth in the foreground is one of the few areas not to burn. Photo courtesy Michael Ryan.</url></p><p>Furthermore, as I demonstrated with data in my initial response, the scale of logging operations is so small that it cannot be considered a driver of large wildfires. If Professor Lindenmayer has empirical evidence proving otherwise, he should present it, as I previously challenged him to do.</p><p>Instead of addressing these key points, Professor Lindenmayer focuses on his study of fire severity. However, fire severity is a post-fire measurement, typically based on canopy scorch or mortality, while fire intensity is measured at the flame front. A fire burning at a specific intensity could cause varying levels of severity in dense regrowth compared to mature forests due to differences in tree size and height. Therefore, using severity as the sole measure of fire behaviour is misleading.</p><p>While definitions of fire severity can vary based on context, it typically refers to the extent of loss of vegetation or organic matter due to fire. This is often expressed in terms of scorch or defoliation extent. For a specific fuel or vegetation type, it relates to Byram\u2019s fire line intensity, but burn severity cannot be equated across different fuel types. For instance, the burn severity of a fire that completely defoliates a heathland may be described as the same as a fire that completely defoliates a forest. However, the intensities involved could be vastly different.</p><p>The photo below proves this point. It shows a fuel reduction burn in 2024 at Kinglake off the Kinglake-Whittlesea Road in the water catchment. Substantial eucalypt overstorey mortality from the 2009 fires caused the site to support a dense stand of 15-year-old regrowth. The photo highlights that the measured fire severity does not reflect fire intensity. In this case, a low-intensity fire scorched the 8-10 metre regrowth but did not scorch the mature trees.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Mike-Ryan-photo-RO3.25.jpg\">Photo courtesy Michael Ryan.</url></p><p>The proportional extent and distribution of logging regrowth should be parameters used to assess the impact of logging as a driver of significant bushfires, rather than relying on broad assumptions that fail to account for variations in forest structure, fire history, and land management practices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Examining the studies David Lindenmayer cites</emphasis></p><p>Professor Lindenmayer insists that \"plenty of evidence\" supports his hypothesis, yet a closer look at the studies he references in his latest response reveals significant weaknesses.</p><p>He relies significantly on <url normalizedValue=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/conl.12122\">Tayler et al. (2014)</url>, which he refers to as an \u201cempirical study\u201d following the 2009 Black Saturday fires. The study relies on data on fire severity mapped by the Department of Sustainability and Environment. <url normalizedValue=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12062\">Attiwill et al (2013)</url> conducted a similar analysis of the 2009 fires. The difference is that Attiwill et al (2013) used the entire area burnt by the two main fires, while Taylor et al (2014) focused on a subset.</p><p>Taylor et al (2014) utilised map-based analysis and statistical modelling to identify patterns but did not demonstrate that one factor directly causes another. The authors neither collected nor measured fire severity or intensity on-site nor did they perform controlled experiments to isolate the effects of logging on fire behaviour.</p><p>Taylor et al (2014) acknowledged that the dataset they relied on did not allow them to determine whether the stands in the 70-year age class were created by wildfire or past logging. To address this significant deficiency, the authors argued that since most unlogged forests contain multiple age cohorts, the existence of even-aged stands implied logging. However, this does not provide definitive proof that logging\u2014not wildfire\u2014was the cause of the regeneration of those stands. This uncertainty weakens their conclusion that logged forests burn more severely than unlogged forests.</p><p>While spatial analysis like this offers valuable insights, it does not identify the causes or demonstrate that logging is the primary driver of fire severity. When evaluating landscape-level fires, assessments of fire intensity are more critical, such as those conducted by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112712001223\">Cruz et al. (2012)</url>.</p><p>Professor Lindenmayer also references <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361884686_Disturbance_causes_variation_in_sub-canopy_fire_weather_conditions\">Wilson et al. (2022)</url> to support his position. However, this study does not measure actual fire behaviour\u2014such as fire intensity, flame height, or rate of spread\u2014between logged and unlogged forests. Instead, it calculates forest flammability indicators, like fuel moisture content and the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), based on weather data. While these indicators help in understanding microclimates, they serve as proxies for fire risk\u2014not as direct evidence of fire behaviour in logged forests. Additionally, their conclusion that logging increases fire risk is an inference, not an observation supported by real-world fire data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Does David Lindenmayer rely on literature reviews?</emphasis></p><p>Despite his claims, Professor Lindenmayer does rely on literature reviews. In his latest response, he references a paper he co-authored with Professor Zylstra (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376629457_Identifying_and_managing_disturbance-stimulated_flammability_in_woody_ecosystems\">Lindenmayer and Zylstra, 2024</url>), stating that \u201clogged forests almost always burn at greater severity than intact forests\u201d.</p><p>However, this paper is a literature review and theoretical discussion, not a study based on field data. While it speculates on how disturbances \u201cmay\u201d increase flammability, it does not provide new empirical evidence to support this statement. It does not constitute scientific proof that logging increases \u201cfire severity.\u201d</p><p>Similarly, his 2022 paper (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359965191_Logging_elevated_the_probability_of_high-severity_fire_in_the_2019-20_Australian_forest_fires\">Lindenmayer et al, 2022</url>) does not present new findings but rather synthesises other studies\u2014again, without offering additional empirical data to support his hypothesis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Studies that contradict David Lindenmayer\u2019s hypothesis</emphasis></p><p>Notably, Professor Lindenmayer still overlooks studies that contradict or challenge his position. In addition to those I outlined in my original blog, here are further examples:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00049158.2015.1079289?tab=permissions&amp;scroll=top&amp;role=tab\">Proctor and McCarthy (2015)</url> conducted a study based on field data collection instead of modelling or remote sensing. They demonstrated that thinning reduces fire severity by lowering elevated fine fuels, key drivers of fire spread and intensity. They found that fine fuels from slash decomposed within four years, and thinned forests exhibited a lower overall fuel hazard compared to adjacent unthinned forests. Contrary to Professor Lindenmayer's claim, thinning reduced the risk of crown fires, making suppression easier\u2014not harder.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112717306461?via%3Dihub\">Volkova et al (2017)</url> demonstrated that thinning reduced fire intensity by lowering surface and bark fuel loads. Fire simulations replicating the severe 2006/07 Great Divide Fires showed that thinned forests experienced nearly 30 per cent lower fire line intensity, a 20 per cent reduction in the rate of spread, and shorter spotting distances than unthinned forests.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374653311_Fuel_weight_and_understorey_hazard_dynamics_in_mature_karri_Eucalyptus_diversicolor_forests_in_southwest_Western_Australia\">Burrows et al (2023)</url> established transects in mature karri forests in Western Australia at 72 sites with varying fuel ages, measuring total fine, surface, near surface, and elevated fuels. This study shows that fuel loads and fire hazards increase over time in long-unburned forests, making them more susceptible to severe wildfires than logged forests. While more aerated fuels are present in younger stands, they constitute a small component of the total fuel load. This field-based, empirical study provides metrics and data-driven conclusions that professional land managers can confidently rely on when making field decisions.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>These studies, based on direct field measurements rather than modelling, regression analysis, or literature reviews, provide strong evidence that active forest management, including thinning, can reduce fire intensity, rather than increase fire intensity or \u201cseverity\u201d.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_6355-Alpine-Ash-Mountain-Ash-and-Shining-gum-thinned-regrowth-VIC-MFRyanRO3.25.jpg\">Thinned alpine ash that shows a well-managed stand and the reduction in bark hazard and elevated fuels.

He writes, \u201cWe can manage forests either by listening to forest industry lobbyists, or we can use evidence to guide good decisions. I prefer evidence\u201d.</p><p>For the record, I am retired, self-funded, and have no industry affiliations. I approach this issue as an independent professional with 33 years of fire management experience. I care about forests and travel widely, reporting on their mismanagement due to policies shaped by ideology rather than practicality and common sense.</p><p>I depend on real-world fire behaviour and field data, rather than assumptions based solely on theoretical models or literature reviews.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A challenge to David Lindenmayer</emphasis></p><p>After 33 years of practical experience in fire management\u2014both controlled burning and wildfire suppression\u2014I understand the responsibility of making decisions impacting forests, biodiversity, assets, and human lives. Fire managers cannot afford to rely solely on theoretical models and disputed assumptions. We engage with real fires, guided by on-the-ground knowledge and field-tested practices. Unlike academics, our decisions are immediately tested by reality, and we are accountable for the outcomes.</p><p>If Professor Lindenmayer believes his theories reflect reality, he should test them in the field. I invite him to design a controlled study in recently logged and unlogged areas\u2014such as the jarrah forests of Western Australia or any native forests in Victoria. After all, logging of native forests has ceased in those states. If his claim is correct, we should now observe less severe fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Final thoughts</emphasis></p><p>Professor Lindenmayer\u2019s statement that \u201cthe science is clear \u2013 ignoring it does not make it any less true\u201d is problematic because science is a method of inquiry, not a fixed body of knowledge. Scientific claims require rigorous testing, replication, and openness to contradiction.</p><p>Sound fire management decisions, informed by empirical research, are essential for reducing bushfire risks and protecting communities. His hypothesis remains contested, unreplicated, and unproven. Policymakers and the public should recognise it as such and ensure that empirical research, not theoretical assumptions, informs fire management decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Story series (in order of publication):</emphasis>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/01/17/debunking-false-claims-about-bushfire-risk-and-native-forest-logging-in-australia/\">Debunking false claims about bushfire risk and native logging in Australia</url>;\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/12/logging-does-indeed-increase-fire-risks-david-lindenmayer/\">Logging does indeed increase fire risks!: David Lindenmayer</url>;\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/14/an-alternative-perspective-to-david-lindenmayer-south-east-timber-association/\">An alternative perspective to David Lindenmayer: South East Timber Association</url>;\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/18/logging-and-bushfire-risk-robert-onfray-responds-to-david-lindenmayer/\">Logging and bushfire risk: Robert Onfray responds to David Lindenmayer</url>;<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/20/bushfire-risk-and-native-forest-logging-david-lindenmayer-responds-to-south-east-timber-association/\">Bushfire risk and native forest logging: David Lindenmayer responds to South East Timber Association</url>;<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/02/20/fire-severity-is-always-greater-in-areas-that-have-been-logged-david-lindenmayer-responds-to-robert-onfray/\">Fire severity is always greater in areas that have been logged: David Lindenmayer responds to Robert Onfray</url>;<url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/03/04/david-lindenmayer-ignores-core-points-and-key-questions-robert-onfrays-further-response/\">David Lindenmayer ignores core points and key questions: Robert Onfray's further response</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>This photo of Alpine Ash at Connors Plain where most mature and even old growth forest was killed during the December 2006 wildfires.
