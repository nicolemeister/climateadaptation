With spring displays ending, it is time to think about planting seedlings for early summer flowering. One of the first to go in should be asters because they must be brought to flower before the start of the wet season, which induces many fungus complaints. Asters have very attractive flowers with long stems and a delightful color range, which can include several shades of blue. Asters do not tolerate over-wet soils so garden beds must be free-draining. Because asters are a member of the daisy family, they should be grown in an exposed position with unrestricted sunlight. Red spider mites and aphids are the most troublesome insect pests, but systemic pesticides such as Lebaycid, Omethoate and Rogor will keep them under control if sprayed at three-weekly intervals. For people who do not want to use a pesticide, frequent use of garlic spray can be effective. Spray with Carbaryl if tiny caterpillars skeletonise the leaves and small grubs damage the flowers. Fungus diseases cause most damage to asters, especially when the weather is humid. Spray with the fungicide Mancozeb once a fortnight, starting in the early stages of growth. Celosia, with its warm colors, is a useful cut flower. It relishes hot weather and will move quickly now that the hours of daylight and temperature are increasing.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>I have learned from long experience that celosia seedlings transplant more readily when small with only two sets of leaves and no more than three. Leggy seedlings are inclinded to run straight to flower without any worthwhile growth. The red forest fire and golden triumph are pleasing varieties, but the tall-growing pampas plume mixture will provide a range of pastel colors seldom found in summer annuals. Celosia must be grown quickly or stems will not be long enough to cut. A side dressing of sulphate of ammonia about a month after planting will force growth. Another excellent cut flower is the African marigold, which produces flowers in yellow and orange shades. The jubilee mixture, with long stems and full double blooms, is ideal to cut. Discontinue overhead watering when flowering starts because the blooms are inclined to rot if they are continually soaked and the weight of water on the petals might cause the flowers to bend and break the stem. Despite their stiff appearance, several strains of zinnia are excellent for cutting and they have a long vase life. But only mature flowers must be picked and the petals must reach a papery state or the blooms will droop and break the stems just behind the flowers. Like most summer flowering annuals, zinnia should be grown 30cm apart in a sunny site and only in free-draining soil. Spray with Mancozeb in humid conditions because leaf spot fungus disease and mildew are likely to be troublesome in such an atmosphere. Zinnia is also best transplanted when small and the largest plants should be selected. The happy talk varieties are very suitable _ a mixture of the giant quilled petal strain with many pastel colors. Showman, a large dahlia flower mixture with strong colors, is bushy with flowers on vigorous stems. The small round-flowered pom pom mixture is very attractive with most of the blooms in soft colors. The stems are very long and the bushes very productive. Zinnia requires only a moderately-enriched soil. If the nutrient level is high the corp produces a lot of foliage to the detriment of the flowers. A few dahlias will produce abundant cut flowers. They can be grown in the foreground of a shrubbery or be given a bed of their own. Seedlings of bedding types such as hi dolly, which produces double and semi-double flowers in bright colors on long stems, are easily available. Also available in a popular seed packet range is the dwarf Cinderella, which is suitable for small vase arrangements. If you prefer pom pom and miniature cactus or decorative dahlias, buy packs of tubers to obtain plants with a recognised per- formance. A well-enriched soil is a must for dahlias and a supporting stake is necessary for the tall strains. Tie them with nylon stockings because they stretch as the stems expand. To prolong the life of cut flowers, place them in a bucket of water as soon as possible after they are picked. Dahlia stems should be dipped in hot water.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PIC OF SKETCH OF GARDEN</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML8809242021P138226</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49KJ-JVY0-01S8-G3VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"739\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>COURIER-MAIL</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1988 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"1988\"><dateText>September 24, 1988 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Federal Insecticide, Fungicide &amp; Rodenticide Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTVFNDRDNEZGQUUyNEFEN0IxNDgwRUIwNjdFMTcxMEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Federal Insecticide, Fungicide &amp; Rodenticide Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTVFNDRDNEZGQUUyNEFEN0IxNDgwRUIwNjdFMTcxMEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000773</classCode><className>GARDENING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001315</classCode><className>PESTICIDES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001315</classCode><className>PESTICIDES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's pretty scary, especially once it gets over the ridge.</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: [Press conference] You know we have a lot of fires all over the State of California - fires, fires, fires.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Fighting fire in the hills and mountains around Hollywood is a big, almost cinematic operation, and like any big budget production, an army of cast and crew are up before dawn taking their direction.</p><p>It's a daunting logistical exercise. They're trying to outsmart and eventually conquer a wildly unpredictable and extremely dangerous enemy. This is no special effects monster, this is the real deal, what we call a bush fire and what's known here as a wildfire or a forest fire. And this wildfire, like so many these days in California, is big.</p><p>PATRICK TITUS: [Holding map] We've anchored flanks. We've anchored in over here in a good safe place and we're bringing this line around so we're pinching that fire down.</p><p>BRIAN SAVAGE: [Division Supervisor] For 12 years I've been on teams but I've been doing fires for 25 and you know this fire for instance was pretty dynamic, but 4,000 people assigned to a single fire in the United States, you don't see that very much. I've never seen a fire with 4,000 people assigned.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: So far this year California has had more than five thousand forest fires close to towns and cities. This one, called the Station Fire, has morphed into a mega fire. From fire fighters and law enforcement officers, to caterers and cleaning staff, nearly 500 engines, 14 helicopters, 64 bulldozers and fixed wing planes - including two DC 10's and for the first time a 747 capable of dropping 70 thousand litres of retardant in one go. When it's closing in on homes and lives, the response to a mega fire is equal force and here there won't be much change out of 50 million dollars.</p><p>Like much of southeast Australia, California has been in drought now for many years. The fire season here used to be three to four months. It's now an almost year round state of alert and many here are starting to believe that the change could be permanent. So the question is, should we stop trying to assume we can contain fire, and rather find better ways to deal with this new reality?</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: Houses are still burning down. The place is flooded. We're spending tens of millions of dollars. We're flying Boeing 747's with retardant now in mountains. I mean this is how nutty this is getting. The fire guys don't have a choice. They're told you've got to take action. We need to show we're responding. That is simply a broken system. Well you know the situation about how we try to defend houses here is absurd. You know I could legally defend this place with an AK 47 and a bazooka if I chose, but apparently not with a garden hose, I'll be evacuated.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: In arid Arizona, far from the Station blaze, fire historian Stephen Pyne is sounding the alarm on America's fire-fighting strategy and the new peril of the suburban sprawl.</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: I regard a lot of these as our sub-prime landscapes. This is the environmental flip side to Wall Street's conflagration. We shouldn't have built it on a lot of funny money and fraud going into it. There's no reason to build these things there and they're burning down just as the economy melted down.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Stephen Pyne is one of the world's foremost authorities on the culture of fire. In California broadly, and Los Angeles specifically, unchecked development and bad fire management have collided with global warming and the result according to this expert, is very grim indeed.</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: The whole literature of Los Angeles is about Los Angeles in apocalyptic meltdown. I'm not sure for fire there's a lot they can do. I don't think they can go back to the fundamentals and rebuild it.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: It's hard to know where the sprawl of Los Angeles ends. It certainly appears seamless all the way here to this neighbourhood, but this is Orange County, south of L.A.</p><p>This summer, Orange County fire officers have been visiting homeowners on site and giving their houses fire safety ratings. Many of them fall badly short.</p><p>Many of the houses in this neighbourhood wouldn't last long if and probably when, a forest fire sweeps up out of the surrounding bushland. That's why the local strategy called 'Ready Set Go' is so important.</p><p>(CLIP FROM 'Ready Set Go' VIDEO)</p><p>'Ready Set Go' is modelled on Australia's 'Stay and Defend or Leave Early Policy' and was adapted here by this man, Mike Ferdigh.</p><p>Mike Ferdigh was working with Victorian Fire authorities when the Black Saturday infernos erupted and knows the Australian strategy has been heavily scrutinised ever since.</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: [Emergency Planning Co-Ordinator] I think it can work real well. I talked to several people and there was one lady in Marysville.... I'm probably going to insult her, I'm going to guess she was in her 70's.... and her house survived. So if a house is defendable I think it can work.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: But the reality of mega fires, makes it more difficult.</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: I think the hardest part which was obviously the same in Australia, and the same thing here, is how do you prepare a home owner when that fire comes.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: And how do you?</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: I don't think we can. I've been doing this for 30 years and I'm still amazed. So how can you take someone that goes to work every day, does a great job at their daily job, has air conditioning in their house and sits in a fairly nice environment and put them in a smoky environment where they can't see a foot and they want to throw up because of the smoke, and it's hot - I don't think there's any way you really can prepare someone for that.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: [Local TV reporter, describing fire] It was very, very dark. It was pitch black and I thought two things, I thought this is what living in war must be like or what hell must be like.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: Fireman and some neighbours kind of made a fire line and everybody was just passing these bottles of water.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: He's a senior attorney and she's a judge but when last year's so-called freeway fire stormed up to the Orange County home of Ed and Tam Schumann deciding to stay or go had them scratching their heads before it was almost too late.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: We thought we were pretty safe and we have a really nice buffer zone between us and any open land and either the wind shifted or the fire just found more fuel in our direction and it started coming up back over the hills, back here behind us and we got everybody out and took off.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: And when we fled the streets on either side were already aflame. The flames were just high and shooting and it was pitch black and embers were falling through.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: This is Tam's riding arena. Last year this would have all been completely cleared so there's nothing that would have burned on this whole hillside. So we felt safe you know? That should have been a really good buffer.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Their experience demonstrates why 'Ready Set Go' is such a difficult call. They thought they were insulated against fire and now as the Station fire blazes well out of range and north of them, the Schumann's are still very uncomfortable.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: We were really surprised at our reaction. Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome really, really exists. Both Ed and I were shocked at our reaction to that, to seeing this new batch of fires.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: Yeah it kind of makes you relive it again. You see the hillside burning and you kind of, you think God it can happen again.</p><p>PATRICK TITUS: [Battalion Chief] You know this is my 30-something years doing this. When I was younger, on the hand crews and the hotshots and stuff, a big fire was 15,000 acres and now it's so common that a fire is you know 100,000 plus acres. We had a fire in the Las Padres earlier that was 90 something thousand acres.... so you know it's not that those didn't happen when I was young but they were very, very rare. Now they've become very commonplace now.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The Station fire was an act of arson that within a day tore through 25,000 acres and doubled in size every day for the first four days. It's become the largest wildfire in Los Angeles' County history. And that's before the deadly seasonal winds have arrived, the dry desert Santa Anna's.</p><p>BRIAN SAVAGE: [Division supervisor] If we had a Santa Anna wind condition set up and we have a current fire burning like we do, we're going to get pounded. That fire is going to spread. It will go to the foothills and we will be fighting a fire fifty miles away and trying to save homes where we can.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The specialist crews in American fire fighting can sound like they've been named by a Hollywood producer. These are the hotshot crews and by day they're hard at it 'cutting line' forging defensive firebreaks along the ridgeline. It's tough, demanding work. With lumbering aircraft continuing to bomb the blaze, it can look like a war. In fact, the hotshot crews are modelled on small organised units from the World War II battlefield. And then there's the US fire fighting paratrooper, the smoke jumper.</p><p>JIM RAUDENBUSH: They started in about 1940 and it was just a way to get fire fighters to inaccessible fires and.... they decided to try parachuting, and that's when it got going. They've been around for almost sixty years now.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: These very specialised operators are based in Boise Idaho and from here they can be deployed at short notice anywhere across the country.</p><p>JIM RAUDENBUSH: We carry two days worth of food and water and if we need additional food and water we can be resupplied. You never know what you're doing from day to day. You can be sitting here in Boise one day and wake up in Alaska the next on a fire out in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Boise is fire-fighting central. At the national command centre enormous warehouses hold every piece of fire fighting kit imaginable. It can be rushed to fire crews as they call for it or as management at headquarters sees fit. At the Centre's coordinating bunker they can be dealing with dozens of fires across the country at any one time.</p><p>It's a supply and coordination centre but it's also gathering data and developing a clearer picture of the fire threat in the United States. From his national vantage point here, Rick Ochoa, one of the country's leading fire related weather specialists, is seeing a tinderbox getting drier.</p><p>RICK OCHOA: [Weather analyst] You know we have much drier fuels, much hotter temperatures and so on. So the weather and the climate and the fuels and fire is changing. Our jobs are also becoming more challenging in the fact that we have to look at more and more areas and events that in the past you know we had some wind, we had some humidity, we didn't think we'd see that much fire potential or fire behaviour, we're seeing a lot more of it now because the fuels are so much different.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: From computer screens in Idaho to fire fronts in California, the picture is the same. Global warming is proving to be an alarming accelerant.</p><p>RICK OCHOA: I think it's a permanent change. I think this is here to stay. We're seeing here in the States and Australia, longer fire seasons, hotter fire seasons, it's just because we're dealing with a much warmer globe.</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: I believe you're in a twelve year drought, we're in a four/five year drought so we're just starting the same path that you guys are maybe ten years ahead of us. So if the drought conditions, if you wanted to throw in global warming, what that's doing to the environment and the drought conditions we have here presently in Southern California, it has the potential to be another bad fire season.</p><p>NEWS REPORT: Arnold Schwarzenegger served the breakfast to fire-fighters today at the Lake View Terrace Command Post. He assured them that state money would be there to fight the fires. He told me there's enough in reserve to keep the money flowing to fire-fighters.</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: Public safety is the number one priority so yes you have to be frugal, yes you have to look at every dollar but we will have the dollars available to fight these fires and we will go all out.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The Californian economy was in freefall before the global financial crisis made things even worse. An increasingly demanding fire season, more and more mega fires, has a huge financial dimension and fire historian Stephen Pyne wonders if the state can in fact deal with its fiery future.</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: That cycle, spending more money, evacuating more people.... this can't continue. This is just insane and it doesn't solve the problem. The problem comes as with our financial system by taking a systemic view and reorganising it. We've made this mess and it's a big deep mess. It's going to take a long time to disentangle it, but we can begin. There are a number of things, we'll start small, we'll begin putting it together again.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Some of those small changes are being implemented in the big houses along San Diego's ridge tops. They're a long way from the subprime fuelled suburban expansion on the LA fringe but the fire danger here is just as alarming. Nearly 10,000 homes have been lost to wildfires here in the past 40 years.</p><p>CLIFF HUNTER: [Fire marshal] Our preferred method is to evacuate and evacuate early but there may be some time constraints depending on the fire and the wind conditions which stop you from doing that. It's very difficult once it gets to a certain point from a safety perspective, to get in and try to fight it.</p><p>We're in a community called the Cielo and it's a sheltered place community. It's one of six in the Rancho Santa Fe fire protection district and our goal is that if you live in a sheltered place community, you would not have to evacuate if a wild land fire came through. That means if a fire were to come through the community, you would be safer to stay in your home, close your windows, close your doors and try not to evacuate.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The houses here have all been designed to conform to the local Rancho Santa Fe Fire Protection code. It's a much stricter regulatory environment and certainly more expensive than elsewhere in California, but the man behind it all, local Fire Chief Cliff Hunter says the lessons learnt here can be used more widely.</p><p>CLIFF HUNTER: You can do this in a regular home owner situation. You can still look at the vents, you can still look at the roofs..... we can still look at landscaping and we would hopefully look at the infrastructure, which are the roadways and water supply and telephone and power and all those things. So yes I believe it is 100% achievable in another community.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: All over California regulators are slowly getting tough and homeowners are getting the message that if they want to live with nature, they must adapt.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: This is what's left. We sorted through the last of this today and found what we could.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Tam and Ed Schumann learnt the hard way. Their home was not fire safe. For them the cost of complying with tougher building regulations isn't even an issue if it means their new home will survive another fire.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: I was not going to let this fire get me down. I was going to.... it was almost like I was going to shake my fist and say, I am not getting driven out by this. I'm going to rebuild and my life is going to go on.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: We've had to compromise and make some changes but we are building the house we want. The city has changed a lot of the fire codes with the way things are rebuilt..... so personally I think we're pretty safe.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: How do you think you will feel when you move back to the new house when it's built? What are you going to do, anything special?</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: Throw a huge party.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: And don't call it a house warming. We've had the house warming party, now we're going to have the house cooling party.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: When the smoke clears from this fire, as happened in Australia after Victoria's Black Saturday tragedy, questions will be asked about building safer homes, about homeowner's responsibility and about the fire fighting efforts as well.</p><p>PATRICK TITUS: My crystal ball's worn out. I don't know. I don't know but things have changed and I think the fire service, not just in California but nationwide in the United States, I think we're changing with it a little bit. I think our leadership and a lot of leadership are really coming to terms with what a whole different way of thinking about how we approach the fires.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Controlling fire, living with it and adapting to a rapidly changing fire environment has become one of the big challenges of our time and it seems we all still have a lot to learn.</p><p>STEPHAN PYNE: There's a big disconnect and fire is being separated from the way we manage the land. We've forgotten what has been such a brilliant defining characteristic for us. I mean that's what we do. We're the fire creatures. You know other animals knock over trees and dig holes in the ground.... we do fire - and that has always been our unique signature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORCOR-1103224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORCOR2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJW-TXT1-JCM0-61VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">375495</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Foreign Correspondent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>October 13, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Fires:Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Grief</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Urban Development and Planning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Volunteers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Emergency Incidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Emergency Planning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

For all the headlines about their remarkable feats in controlling fires and assisting victims, they are just ordinary men and women who have downed tools at home or work and joined the fight.</p><p>A large part of their duties involves training and control measures. While two months of summer might provide the adrenalin rush for the firies, the rest of the year, more often than not, requires commitment and just plain hard work.</p><p>The waiting game is almost as nerve wracking as the action as I discovered at the SES headquarters in my northern country town this week. The summer stillness, excluding the constant drone of those summer sentinels, the cicadas, was disturbed only when a two-way radio crackled.</p><p>Reports of fires burning in the Hunter and further west in the Pilliga scrub were flowing in. Crews were being changed and the possibility of sourcing more firefighters from outside the area was being investigated.</p><p>Weather reports a little more detailed than we are accustomed to with the grass curing factor, wind speed and direction, humidity, fire danger and fire rating were pinned near a large wall map, overlaid with plastic with fire scenes coloured in</p><p>blue marker pen.</p><p>Fire control officer Graham Murrell, whose beat takes in 5100 square kms, points to a large fire burning behind control lines 130km away. Now 63, he's been fighting fires since he was a youngster down on the south coast and, while his time nowadays is spent administering fire fighting efforts, he says there is no such thing as `a quiet time'.</p><p>While there may be no major fire in his patch, he is concerned about the proximity of this large forest fire and plans for another two crews to join existing trucks this weekend.</p><p>He says the absence of fatalities among fire fighters and citizens this summer is a credit to the streamlined organisation, training and preparation of the Rural Fire Service. Backburning and control burning and vastly-improved weather forecasts have all contributed to the comparatively moderate loss of forest and property.</p><p>The contrast with fire fighting `techniques' of 20 years ago in rural areas tells the story. Farmers and willing (but not always able) volunteers would arrive at a fire scene ready to pitch in. Often inadequately clad and driving clapped out or unregistered vehicles, they usually brought a supply of wet bags and brimming enthusiasm.</p><p>But the `rabble response' often meant would-be firefighters didn't even know their brigade captain. As sons of the soil, they would think they knew best and conflict would inevitably rise among the ranks.</p><p>Nowadays, these well-meaning types are sent home from a fire scene. The attitude of `we'll just turn up' is no longer acceptable. Liability and insurance are influencing factors but efficient command and control have instead taken over.</p><p>Scenes of the fires which threatened Sydney's northern suburbs in recent days yielded plenty of `told yer so' comments in the bush.</p><p>Most country folk are ready to leap into the argument over controlled burning in our national parks they believe there simply isn't enough. The sight of Lane Cove National Park ablaze elicited plenty of comment about how it was a disaster waiting to happen. The same judgement went for those houses built on the urban bush fringe.</p><p>TV footage of one resident, dressed in shorts and T-shirt, on the roof of a house with a garden hose drew derision but it was the picture of a well-meaning Turramurra citizen waving the hose over bushes near the house that moved one firefighter to remark on the utter waste of water.</p><p>One diehard I know suggested that the best approach for city parks would be to introduce a drag line, a kind of ultra heavy duty chain used to clear virgin scrub, to make a 300-metre border around them all.</p><p>Control burning in the lead-up to summer is also fraught with problems, as evidenced by the tragedy in Sydney's northernmost reaches last year.</p><p>Fire control authorities also point to the national parks' lack of resources both financial and material to implement effective control measures. Before a prescribed hazard reduction burn can begin, volunteers must be marshalled along with equipment and suitable measurements of fuel, moisture, wind, temperature, and humidity.</p><p>In urban areas, smoke `lodging' (or where the smoke settles) is a major determinant in any proposed control burn. This is without the inevitable objections from elements of the environmental lobby who regard the exercise as `destructive'.</p><p>Fire control officers are required to observe a `scorch height' where flames should be no higher than 10 metres, depending on the amount of fuel on the forest floor. But there is always the risk that no firefighter can control that a burn might make it into the crowns of trees.</p><p>Amid the tedium and the obstacles, volunteer firefighters are a dedicated bunch. These normally forthright and confident people pause for thought when asked their motivation. Self esteem, satisfaction in helping others and doing a job quietly are some of the replies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>THANKS: The boys in orange and yellow to the rescue once again.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P0W-XC40-TXN5-T2B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NHLDAU-4yi6n0o70xg19i9aibv1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NHLDAU2002</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314240</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2011-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"956\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2002 Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newcastle Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>January 5, 2002 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Nsw</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime/Arson/Bushfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Get used to being looked at and judgment passed over you and your vehicle.</p><p>Hummer began with the US Army Humvee in the 1991 Gulf War, then gradually became gentrified as people like Arnold Schwarzenegger began buying the civilian H2.</p><p>The H3 is the smallest, most civilised and least confronting Hummer yet.</p><p>However, it is hardly on Gore's must-buy list with a weight of 2.2 tonnes, a petrol appetite of 13.7 litres every 100km and CO2 emissions of 327g every kilometre.</p><p>Over the two weeks and more than 600km I drove the base model manual, my carbon footprint was enormous. In emissions alone, the H3 spewed almost 200kg of CO2 into the atmosphere.</p><p>I now owe the planet one small eucalypt plantation.</p><p>Owners should be aware that about every 6000-7000km, it will generate its own weight in CO2. But the vehicle can't be written off for environmental reasons.</p><p>If you need a vehicle that will cover almost any terrain in comfort, then the H3 has a legitimate job to do and it does it well.</p><p>However, if you just want one to pose and/or to deliver the children to All Holiness Very Cross Snotty Nosed Convent, then hang your head in shame.</p><p>I have driven the H3 on two continents in all sorts of terrain over the past six months.</p><p>In the US I drove it in LA parking lots and on LA freeways (often one and the same), the high mountain passes of Yosemite National Park, the steep hills of San Francisco and the deserts around Las Vegas.</p><p>On the Australian launch in the hills surrounding the Yarra Valley wine district, it mastered deep-rutted red soil, overflowing bog holes, sloppy claypans, steep boulder-strewn hills and forest fire trails.</p><p>There remained two types of terrain to be conquered: Brisbane potholes and soft sand.</p><p>Well, I can tell you that the H3 feels stable and quiet on highways, wallows through corners with a fair amount of body roll and gets jiggly over Brisbane potholes with its off-road-oriented rear leaf springs.</p><p>However, plans to take it on to the beach were severely thwarted by the recent no-name cyclone. Instead, it ploughed through some wet sand tracks around Cooloola where it performed admirably.</p><p>Soft, dry sand should be no problem. After all, with the right tyre pressure and plenty of momentum most 4WDs run through sand.</p><p>Steering is typically American -- vague.</p><p>Also, typically American, there is wheel adjustment for height only, not reach, so with a high floor and low seat, it is almost impossible to get comfortable unless you are a Sumatran orangutan.</p><p>The American vehicle is built in right-hand drive in South Africa. However, the designers have not done a great job in the left-to-right conversion process.</p><p>The heavy rear door is still hinged on the left which means you have to venture out toward passing traffic to load the vehicle.</p><p>And the foot-operated parking brake in the American version is replaced by an ancient umbrella-stick handbrake in our RHD model.</p><p>These went out with Hawaiian shirts and it's easy to see why. They are impossible to release with a ham fist.</p><p>You have to learn the brake's mechanical subtleties then execute a precise series of movements -- pull the button, then turn the handle, release the brake about halfway then wiggle it a bit more to get it all the way in. Don't forget to hold your tongue in the right position, too. Rush it or try to muscle the handbrake and it just won't release.</p><p>Handbrake aside, the interior is slightly better than the US version with a classy brushed aluminium centre stack and quality trim.</p><p>Yet there are no audio controls on the steering wheel, no auxiliary input for an iPod and there is only one control stalk which services the blinkers, lights, cruise control and wiper/washers. It is cumbersome, but you get used to it.</p><p>While door dust-proofing looks underdone, it leaked little on dusty tracks.</p><p>The seats are comfortable and look far enough apart to easily fit five adults.</p><p>However, because of the high floor your feet sit out in front so there isn't as much room as you would think.</p><p>The rear middle seat also has a pull-out drinks container which makes the seat firm and uncomfortable for long stints.</p><p>And there is not much room in the back for cargo, again because of the high floor.</p><p>But that high floor means plenty of clearance and this is where the H3 excels as over rutted sand and dirt tracks there are no unnerving scraping sounds.</p><p>While the floor is high, the roof is low and the windows very narrow.</p><p>This creates a claustrophobic feeling in the back and horizontal tunnel vision in the front.</p><p>There is also almost no rear vision through the slitty back window with a full-size alloy spare wheel covering a portion of the view.</p><p>With no rear parking sensors, it is advisable to be vigilant of children and small animals when backing out of your garage.</p><p>Strangely, the flat-fronted Besser-block styling which the engineers admit has not been designed for aerodynamics has little wind or road noise at any speed.</p><p>Bodywork is a mixture of metal and plastic.</p><p>In silver and black, it looks fine, but in the hero yellow colour, it is easy to see which panels are metal and which are plastic (mainly the fenders) because the colours don't quite match.</p><p>The reason for the plastic panels is to keep weight down, reduce scratching from brushes with scrub such as lantana and they are cheaper to replace.</p><p>Under the bonnet is a raucous 3.7-litre five-cylinder Vortec petrol engine specially designed to fit the H3. It quietens down at highway speed, but it is a little underdone for the 2.2 tonne vehicle. More appropriate diesel and V8 models are coming in 2009.</p><p>It is mated to a five-speed manual which has a truck-like throw without being notchy or vague.</p><p>A four-speed auto is available for an extra $2000, but it is slow and hunts around, as well as being even less economical.</p><p>The H3 sits on 16 x 7.5 inch alloy wheels with 75 per cent high-profile tyres which are good for ride quality, noise and over rocky terrain, but not much chop for twisty tarmac.</p><p>Standard features in the H3 are cruise control, electro-chromatic rearview mirror with eight point compass, power windows, fog lights and halogen headlamps, remote entry with panic alarm, single in-dash CD, cloth seats and 60/40 split rear seats.</p><p>Hummer H3</p><p>$51,990</p><p>ENGINE * *</p><p>Raucous and not powerful enough for the vehicle's weight</p><p>HANDLING * * *</p><p>Quiet with a smooth ride, but jiggly over broken surfaces and wallows in corners.

At 85, she is still a busy, energetic figure, a legend of cinema who is not interested in resting on her formidable reputation. She is also a theatre performer, a feature and stage director, a writer and producer, who reels off a list of her projects for this year - films, stage shows and commitments at festivals and at a film school. There are plans, she tells me, to bring a theatre production to Australia next year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For more than half a century there has been something distinctive, enigmatic and forceful about her presence and her impact on screen. Patti Smith, in an ecstatic piece published in 1977, captured her mixture of introspection and sensuality, stating: \"If I turned out like Jeanne Moreau when I grow up, I couldn't ask for anything more. She's so self-contained. She could start a forest fire.\" In February, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image has a spotlight on Moreau, screening eight of her films from the 1950s and 1960s. The first, from 1958, is Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud (Elevator to the Gallows). The last, from 1968 - and the only one in colour - is Francois Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black.</p><p>There's an earthiness, an elegance and a fierce intelligence in these performances, a constant embrace of contradictions. The camera sometimes dwells on her back, her walk, the line of her body, but most of all it lingers on her singular, memorable face, somehow both expressive and impassive, her distinctive, down-turned mouth, her high forehead. In an interview about a recent film she made with director Francois Ozon, Moreau spoke of that play of oppositions, of being two people when she acted. \"There's the one monitoring the distance between me and the camera . . . And there is the one driven by this inner fire, this delicious fear.\"</p><p>Moreau was born in Paris in 1928. Her father was a restaurateur, her mother a dancer. Theirs was a tempestuous relationship, and it brought contrasting influences to bear on her. \"My mother was English - she was born in Blackpool - my grandmother was Irish and my father was from the centre of France. I grew up speaking both French and English,\" she says. \"My mother was very lonely. My father's family was very distant with her because she was a foreigner. So English was our language together, and my father hated it when we spoke English because he couldn't understand.\"</p><p>Growing up with two languages \"was very rich for me\", she says. \"It opened me to the world, to literature. To Asian writers, who were translated into English before they were translated into French - and, of course, to American literature.\" Literature has always been an important part of her life, and many of her closest friends have been writers.</p><p>As a child, she recalls, \"I loved to study, I had weak health and I read a lot. I wanted to be a ballet dancer, but I gave up that because of the books and plays I read.\" Wanting to be an actress grew out of a visit to the theatre with some close friends to see Jean Anouilh's modern version of the classic Greek tragedy Antigone, first performed in 1944.</p><p>The play's title character made a strong impression on her. \"When I heard that girl say 'no' to everything, I said, 'That's for me'.\"</p><p>Moreau studied theatre at the Paris Conservatoire. She spent four years with the Comedie Francaise, then went to the Theatre National Populaire. She had minor roles in several films, beginning in 1949, but it was on stage where she first made her name.</p><p>A much-acclaimed performance in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, directed by Peter Brook, had caught the attention of aspiring filmmaker Louis Malle. He offered Moreau a part in his first film, an adaptation of a crime novel. Her agent advised against it; she took the role and she and the agent parted ways.</p><p>Moreau was not typical of many of the actresses who inspired the directors of the new wave, which was about to break in French cinema and have an impact around the world. She was an experienced performer established in a more traditional context, on stage and screen. But she was remade, in a sense, at that time, becoming an incarnation of what Ginette Vincendeau, in her study of French cinema of the period, calls, \"the ideology of the new wave: authenticity, modernity and sensuality\".</p><p>Elevator to the Gallows is the story of a perfect murder that goes wrong in every imaginable way. It's a cool thriller; a mixture of tension and slow, inexorable build. Our first glimpse of Moreau is in a close-up as she speaks on the phone to her lover: it's a raw, yearning image. (Years later, a still would appear on a France Telecom phone card.)</p><p>For much of the film, Moreau is essentially alone, wandering the streets of Paris by night, illuminated only by the lights of the city, accompanied by a cool Miles Davis score, wondering what has happened to the plan she and her lover have hatched. It was considered risky, at the time, to be depicted without flattering lighting or obvious make-up, but it established the vividness, the vulnerability, the sheer impact of Moreau's face on screen.</p><p>Malle then cast her in Les Amants (The Lovers). She plays a well-heeled provincial wife and mother who leads a materially comfortable existence, at an emotional distance from her husband. She goes regularly to Paris to meet her lover, but she's bored and a little frustrated, even with this handsome, polo-playing suitor in her thrall. Then, suddenly, her life is turned around, disrupted by a new experience of desire.</p><p>The film was a box-office hit and the</p><p>subject of scandal, most of all for what was regarded as its daring depiction of female pleasure. Much of the controversy concerned a sex scene in which the camera focused on Moreau's ecstatic face.</p><p>Following Les Amants, Moreau took a break from the movies, briefly. She had thought, she says, she was simply acting, doing her job - she wasn't ready for what flowed from it. \"Now, everybody is a star, people from television, young boys or girls who are on a quiz - but at that time to be a star was something. After the huge success of Les Amants, it frightened me. Because I didn't expect that, when I saw my name all over the place, and I had become a star.\" To protect herself, she says, she went back to the theatre, but was drawn back to films by the quality of what she was being offered.</p><p>Moreau had met young aspiring director Francois Truffaut while at the Cannes film festival with Elevator to the Gallows. At the time, he was an influential, fearless critic who had not yet made his first feature. \"I gave him my phone number and we would meet regularly at the same restaurant every week to eat together, and he gave me a copy of Jules et Jim\", a screenplay he hoped to make with her.</p><p>Truffaut adapted Jules et Jim, his third feature, from a semi-autobiographical novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, about two men in love with the same woman, the perpetually elusive Catherine. She is reckless, impulsive, impossible to pin down, capable of assuming almost any role, female or male.</p><p>According to Truffaut, Moreau's \"qualities as an actress and a woman made Catherine real before our eyes, made her plausible, crazy, possessive, passionate but, above all, adorable, i.e. worthy of our adoration\".</p><p>Moreau recalls Jules et Jim as \"a very joyful shoot\", even though it was made on a shoestring. \"At one point we had no money,\" she says, \"but luckily I had made films before, so I became co-producer. And I gave money. There was none left. We did the film with no sound; the only time we had a sound technician was the day we did the song\", a famous scene in which she sings a simple, haunting number called Le Tourbillon de la Vie, which became a hit.</p><p>Alongside Luis Bunuel's Diary of a Chambermaid, Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte and Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black - an obvious inspiration, decades later, for Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill - the ACMI season includes several films that are less widely known.</p><p>There is Roger Vadim's slick, modern take on the 18th-century novel Dangerous Liaisons, set in Parisian salons and on alpine ski slopes. In this version, the figures of Valmont (Gerard Philipe) and Madame de Merteuil (Moreau) are already together as a couple, manipulative and knowing, scheming to amuse each other.</p><p>It was one of the last films made by Philipe, a star from an earlier generation of French actors, who died a few months later, of cancer, aged 37.</p><p>And there's Jacques Demy's second feature, Bay of Angels, a noirish, high-stakes romance of compulsion. Moreau, in Cardin and a cloud of platinum-blonde hair, plays a woman addicted to gambling. She attracts the attention of a sober young bank clerk, who has seen her thrown out of a casino in his home town; he runs into her later, in Nice, during his own cautious exploration of the world of chance.</p><p>She's a woman on the edge who, when she has run out of luck, knows how to live extravagantly, but it's gambling she really exists for and she is resigned to the inevitability of loss. It's an unnervingly poignant portrayal of obsession, of a woman who says matter-of-factly she has a young son, but feels that she has probably gambled him away.</p><p>Moreau talks about other films of the time that meant a lot to her: Joseph Losey's Eva, Tony Richardson's Mademoiselle - the film that inspired Patti Smith - and she speaks of the four movies she made with Orson Welles, who famously called her \"the greatest actress in the world\".</p><p>She has retained a commitment to working with auteurs, and with emerging directors. \"I'm doing another film with a young director, Sandrine Veysset, who will be in Cannes this year. It is called Jeanne dans Tous Ses Etats, and it's a series of stories where I am the main character meeting different people, [played by] Gerard Depardieu, Charles Aznavour and Isabelle Huppert, for example.\"</p><p>In March there is film called La Duchesse de Varsovie, directed by Joseph Morder, in which she plays a concentration camp survivor who has never spoken about her past, and Andy Gillet is the grandson with whom she exchanges secrets. Later in the year she will be at Angers Film Festival, where she has been going for years, and she has a film school at which she teaches every summer.</p><p>Recently, she worked on a theatre production dedicated to the playwright Jean Genet, who was a close friend. She is preparing another show about Genet, which will be at the Avignon festival in July, and there is a chance she will bring it to Australia next year.</p><p>Moreau is happy to talk about films from the '50s and '60s. It was a time, she says, \"when I met exceptional people - they were famous, but famous because of their craft\". Yet she's a person who always prefers to look forward, she says, because people learn through literature and through art, through working relationships and friendships. And people continue to learn throughout your life, she adds, describing a recent film, A Lady in Paris, in which she played an elderly Estonian. She was introduced to a culture she knew nothing of, but needed to understand in order to embody the character.</p><p>\"As I see it, is that at the beginning a young actress relies on her personal knowledge and her personal needs; but afterwards you discover other people, you discover the world.\"</p><p>\"Focus on Jeanne Moreau is at ACMI from February 14 to 26, acmi.net.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FOUR PHOTOS: Jeanne Moreau in 1968's The Bride Wore Black, directed by Francois Truffaut.

This called for an extraordinary meeting of NZFP shareholders, and independent valuations, before the finalising of the North BH share deal.</p><p>While the extraordinary meeting posed little threat to the agreed merger of NZFP and Elders Resources, legal action begun by Fletcher last week had the potential of disrupting NZFP's takeover of Elders Resources.</p><p>Fletcher has now agreed to sell its total holding in NZFP into a joint venture with Elders IXL, the details of which were still being worked out by lawyers over the weekend.</p><p>As a result, Fletcher takes a $32 million holding cost loss on selling its 89.7 million shares for $4.25. That is in addition to an earlier loss of $23 million through its purchase of NZFP shares from the AMP Society.</p><p>Mr Fletcher described it as an \"economic loss\", adding that funding details for the joint venture to buy the shares still had to be finalised.</p><p>Because the shares are already committed to the joint venture, it is doubtful whether Fletcher will be able to exercise its voting rights on the scrip at tomorrow's extraordinary meeting.</p><p>As compensation for its loss of leverage at NZFP, which Fletcher bid for earlier in 1987 but was blocked by the NZ Commerce Commission, NZFP has agreed to sell its Panelcorp business unit to Fletcher for $79 million and for the two companies to rationalise their forest holdings.</p><p>The net result of the deal, which involves 15 per cent of NZFP's total forestry estate, is a 20,000 ha gain in planted forestry to Fletcher, bringing its total freehold and leasehold areas up to 140,000 ha, and a transfer to NZFP of $144 million in \"financial assets\".</p><p>These assets apparently take the form of short-term debt securities which NZFP will be able to use.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elders is in effect carrying out a non-official receivership of Rada, untangling its debts and matching them against the somewhat diminished value of its investments, before drawing up a refinancing package.</p><p>It has been argued that Rada should have been suspended long ago when the extent of its financial difficulties first became known. The company is holding negative shareholders funds, which is why Elders found it easy to relieve Rada's larger shareholders of their stakes at nominal prices and under option agreements.</p><p>The problem is that Rada, having grown out of NZFP, has several thousand small shareholders in common with NZFP, all of whom have watched the value of their stake collapse since the sharemarket slide in October.</p><p>Elders still needs NZ Commerce Commission and Overseas Investment Commission approvals to officially take control of Rada. However, it would be a brave government authority which refused Elders, because the likelihood is that if it walked away there may be no-one else prepared to refinance the company, leaving thousands of shareholders-cum-voters unimpressed with the Government's performance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-4yhmfkq032wndks28yx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW1988</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5560-23C1-F0J6-J3GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1988 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

to start a desperate guerilla campaign Train hijackers Kevin Foley and Bernadette McKenna share a quiet drink near their home in the peaceful environment of Jackey's Marsh</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Flashback to last Monday, when green radicals held up a freight train</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By SIMON BEVILACQUA THE gaunt, almost waif-like figure of Kevin Foley crouched over a portable typewriter by a campfire in the Tasmanian scrub did not strike terror into the heart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sipping a home-brew, putting words to paper by his Jackey's Marsh campfire last week, Foley looked quite harmless, perhaps even timid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So did his neighbour, Bernadette McKenna as she shared one of his rich brown brews.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But these were the \"eco-terrorists\".</p><p>They were among the band of 35 radical conservationists who on Monday adopted guerilla tactics and jumped a log train on its way from Launceston to Bell Bay.</p><p>They held the 20-carriage TasRail train at ransom for four hours they demanded media attention and an end to the destruction of the state's forest.</p><p>They called the hold-up an \"action\".</p><p>More \"actions\" were in the pipeline, they threatened.</p><p>Others in the Tasmanian community saw it differently, they called the hold up \"terrorism\".</p><p>The militant greenies were trouble-makers who put forest workers', and their own, lives at risk by fooling with terrorism, it was said.</p><p>Some, including a federal MP, reckoned police should stop dilly-dallying and put a stop to them stamp out the forest fire before it blows out of control.</p><p>Foley and McKenna said they were prepared to be arrested if that meant jail, so be it.</p><p>The demands the renegade train-jumpers made the issues Foley and McKenna got together around the campfire last week to type out for interstate publication were nothing new.</p><p>The people of Tasmania were being told lies by businessmen and large companies, they said.</p><p>The state's forests were being ruined.</p><p>They would put up with it no longer.</p><p>They saw themselves as witnesses of an environmental rape only they were not the sort to stand back and watch as the forest industry did the dirty deed.</p><p>They would not turn their backs.</p><p>\"We butt in and do something about it,\" Foley said.</p><p>It sounded like the same story that divided the state back in the 1980s during the debate over hydro-electric dams.</p><p>For the past 2 years, with the Greens holding the balance of power in state politics, radical conservationists have kept fairly quiet.</p><p>But with the return of a Liberal government this month, and with former premier Robin Gray back as a minister, the radicals are seething.</p><p>Born and raised in south-east Queensland, Foley had already fought Robin Gray and the Liberals.</p><p>He first came to Tasmania before the Gordon-below-Franklin dam dispute and did his bit to help.</p><p>He had been involved in \"actions\" all over the nation.</p><p>About two years ago, he shifted to Jackey's Marsh, near the northern town of Deloraine, where he lives in a shack prone \"to let a little water in when it rains\".</p><p>\"I came here to live in a beautiful environment, clean air, clean water,\" he said.</p><p>\"But all I see is the carnage of dead animals on the road, all I see is the total destruction of the environment, \"And I, like some others, have decided to jump a train or two.\" Last alligned with a extremist band called the Nomadic Action Group, he now acts as a concerned individual.</p><p>So, said McKenna, did she.</p><p>A qualified teacher, born east of Melbourne, she too had lived at Jackey's Marsh for the past two years and had been involved

It yields to a brand new version in 2001.The deceptively modest Opera House - part of a centre that includes separate ballet and live drama theatres - has a seating capacity of 3015. Lined predominantly with timber, the auditorium's acoustics are superb.Top ticket prices averaged between $US90-$US100 ($120-$133) a seat for the four nights, slightly more for singles. The season's three cycles were virtually sold out. They are now given in German, copiously surtitled.Conductor Hermann Michael, presiding over an augmented 107-player-strong Seattle Symphony, revealed his mastery of the work's lyrical aspects. Indeed, on all musical levels this account of the Ring was most satisfying. But the production, directed by Francois Rochaix with sets and costumes by designer Robert Israel, caused much critical consternation and division.When Patrice Chereau revolutionised the Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1976 (possibly inspired by the George Bernard Shaw essays on Wagner), he had a central historical focus and locale in mind in his 19th-century updating.This Seattle updating didn't reveal any centrality at all despite copious program notes about it. A few examples. The three unwatery Rhine maidens looked like rejects from the back row of a Folies Bergere routine.</p><p>For their definitely last appearance (to drown Hagen at the end of Gotterdammerung) each trailed her personal length of blue cloth - her private stretch of the Rhine, I presume - to enmesh him.Their bum-freezer costumes, plus their horizontal striped stockings could have had some nautical symbolism that this fisherman's son of a critic failed to interpret. Siegfried, in his first entry of his namesake opera, sported the luxury of a live, genuine bear cub as his playmate.The fire-girt rock that Wotan conceded to Brunnhilde's plea at the end of Die Walkure Act III, by the time it was required for her awakening by Siegfried in the next opera, had grown into a handsome mausoleum, in which she later busied herself setting up a comfy honeymoon house for herself and her lover.Indeed, it made quite a different woman of her, too. Marilyn Zschau, so well known to Australian audiences, made a satisfactory, sometimes splendid Brunnhilde in Die Walkure and later in Gotterdammerung - more sheer voice than I remembered from her in Vienna and Sydney in other roles. For Act III of Siegfried, an even slenderer and vocally rapturous Nadie Secunde was awakened by Siegfried's kiss for the glorious duet that culminates the opera. The substitution worked well enough, but a whiff of \"just why?\" intruded and pervaded.The production let us down, too, at the end of Das Rheingold with the ascent of the gods into Valhalla. The Wotan entourage had to climb a huge ladder up into the surtitle zone, where they stood on a kind of forest fire look-out platform. It was an undignified ascent, particularly for his wife, Fricka, attired in some variant of Lady Bracknell's wardrobe.Where the Seattle Ring scored a major visual triumph was in having its Valkyrie maidens confidently airborne on life-size steeds, and not a single collision on their airy amble, if at a more cautious pace than the barbaric rhythm suggested by Wagner's music for the Ride! Another production mystery that the program promised us was the dragon. It turned out to look for all the world like a city council back-loader, with its frontal scoop full of genuine raging flames. Manned by three or four blackclad stage hands, it was effective enough but like so many other sets and props, once used, it left the stage cluttered up with a lot of irrelevant mess.Still, the final burn-up of practically everything - Brunnhilde, horse and Valhalla was a magnificent piece of theatre wizardry. Erda, the great Earth Mother, in her bedsit comfy chair, looked as though she was waiting for a \"telly\" to be turned on, instead of foretelling the end of the dynasty of the gods.The scene was redeemed from its deliberately prosaic staging by the thrilling mezzo of Nancy Maultby. She and Joyce Castle, the Waltraute, were the deserved recipients of prolonged applause for their awesome sound.Outstanding in the male casting were Monte Pederson, as Wotan, a bassbaritone equally capable of the authority of the role and the compassion required for the long farewell to Brunnhilde in Walkure Act III; Gordon Hawkins and particularly called on at short notice for the role of Siegfried - Wolfgang Fassler, a young tenor from Hamburg. Julian Patrick's Alberich is a fine study. (It should be. He has been in the 10 presentations of this Ring since it began in 1986.) Finally, for all this production's excitements and audacities, I am still left with the conviction that the more orthodox San Francisco cycle that I covered for The Australian five years ago caught more of Wagner's vision of the rise and fall of the dynasty of the gods.It will be interesting to see what the State Opera of South Australia comes up with in 1998.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9509080012160674</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49NV-F260-01S8-H4FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>September 8, 1995 Friday 0 Edition</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001254</classCode><className>OPERA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UGQ</classCode><className>THEATER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001720</classCode><className>TICKET SALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X5L</classCode><className>PERFORMING ARTS CENTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001720</classCode><className>TICKET SALES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But in vain. Through all the personas, even those who strayed into the more disturbing shadows of being human, runs a core of certitude about their place in the family's evolution.</p><p>By sheer contrast, genealogy can be inconsequential to the destiny of an individual. When the writer Albert Camus was killed in a car accident in 1960, an incomplete manuscript of his last novel was retrieved from the wreckage. Eventually published more than three decades later, it is a thinly disguised autobiography in which Camus describes the search for his father, killed during World War I when the writer was three months old. Anonymity threatened to engulf this component of his being, \"an impalpable memory the light ash of a butterfly wing incinerated in a forest fire\". Genealogy for the writer did not exist. It had no need.</p><p>Anonymity was not a problem for Niall in her beautifully constructed account. Set at its beginning against convicts, free settlers, fortune seekers and dislocated souls that make up the early, non-indigenous story of Australia, she did not, like Camus, have to confront absentia. Her difficulty was the opposite. She needed to prune a virile tree of eloquent achievers patriarchs, matriarchs, painters, potters, sculptor, architect, writers and musicians.</p><p>Still she had to create a structure that would not threaten to collapse under its own detail. She remembered a conversation with the distinguished American biographer Leon Edel during his visit to Australia in 1976. Edel was resolving an approach to his forthcoming study of the Bloomsbury group by building his themes around the Bloomsbury \"house\" itself. Given the ongoing importance with the Boyd family of attaching their collective identity to places and properties, Niall found her ideal solution. She travels with her text through a sequence of houses: from The Grange in Berwick to Yarra Glen outside Melbourne, climaxing with the Shoalhaven properties purchased by Arthur during the 1970s.</p><p>Interwoven with this structure are the descendants of four basic branches of the family from their earliest appearance in Australia. There is John Mills, a labourer from Gloucestershire who was convicted of larceny and transported to Van Diemen's Land in 1827, after which he prospered from property purchases in Melbourne and the establishment of its first brewery.</p><p>Then comes Sir William a Beckett, who arrived in Sydney with his family in 1837 and moved to Melbourne to become its first Chief Justice in 1851. The third is Dr Robert Martin, a medical practitioner and squatter who came to Melbourne with his family in 1839. And the fourth is Captain John Theodore Boyd, who arrived in Van Diemen's Land in 1845 on military duty supervising a consignment of convicts from London.</p><p>Descendants of these four families are linked through marriage and the houses in which they lived. From this warp and weft certain characters emerge with luminosity. Two of the most extraordinary were women without whose presence the integrity and combustion of the Boyd dynasty would have not existed.</p><p>John Mills's daughter Emma inherited her father's substantial wealth. She had witnessed tough times. Among privileged society she bore the stigma of a convict father; one who made his fortune as a brewer and hotelier. Yet she carefully deployed that fortune so that all in the family were taken care of. She was the guardian spirit who kept them together for half a century; a woman of fierce compassion towards the poor and needy.</p><p>The second was Emma's daughter, Emma Minnie, who married Arthur Merric Boyd. She inherited her mother's humanitarian concerns and intensified them through an alliance with Christian fundamentalism. This had not a little to do with the channelling of artistic energy in her children, in particular towards the moral thrust of her grandsons, Arthur and David, as they explored themes of love and death, violence and justice in their paintings</p><p>Both these women, mother and daughter, set in place in their descendants a hard-wired instinct to find strong, talented partners to look after the pragmatic side of the creative life, if not as active participants. Niall guides us through the splendid tapestry of triumphs and tragedies, places and characters, crisply, like a fine novelist from the urgency of young love, when in 1857 Captain Boyd eloped with Lucy Martin, to the obliteration of Penleigh in a car</p><p>accident in 1923 to the bizarre hospital death of beloved architect Robin at the age of 51. And Arthur's inspired presentation of Bundanon and Riversdale to the people of Australia in 1992.</p><p>Finally, she leaves us to dwell on the essence of the Boyd story symbolised by the full circle between Bundanon and The Grange, both constructed in 1866, concluding with a tribute to the driving conscience for generations to follow: \"The diaries are a reminder of Emma's legacies to her descendants: not just the convict fortune, which the years eroded, but the lasting inheritance of her love of Europe, her delight in creativity, her habit of giving, and her attachment to the Australian bush</p><p>where her first and best loved house was built.\"</p><p>Wealth and success in the Boyd family never guaranteed a life free of spiritual anxiety. Their great social legacy has been an indelible purpose of responsibility towards family, towards a consolidation of heritage and towards humanist ideals and community.</p><p>This has been paralleled, however, by a certain ambiguity of belonging which would seem to contradict the Boyd obsession with embracing family legacy within a singular sense of place. Most of the Boyds have felt that a part of them belonged elsewhere than Australia, dividing their time and hearts between hemispheres. Niall leaves this question for us to unravel. It is a tribute to her narrative skill, however, that all the personalities she has explored whatever their frailties and strengths, whatever their dreams, noble or misguided combine to elicit love and respect for a family whose like we shall never</p><p>see again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUS: Photo-illustration: Michael McGurk P</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yifeipoav82k5k6djo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P6W-1GD0-TXN5-R34M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2002 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>May 18, 2002 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004QO1</classCode><className>BLOOMSBURY GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS451211 BOOK STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC5942 BOOK STORES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000181</classCode><className>PROFILES &amp;

And an Australian forestry expert warned that past El Nin~o patterns showed that a second round of fires usually followed inadequate monsoon rains.</p><p>Mr Neil Byron, the deputy director of the Indonesia-based Centre for International Forestry Research, said a study of the past 200 years of forest fires and El Nin~o patterns in Indonesia indicated that a second, more severe phase preceded the ending</p><p>of the 12-month El Nin~o cycle.</p><p>Indonesia's Assistant Minister for the Environment, Mr Sugandhy Apandi, said: \"We can assume, from the meteorological information we are receiving, the drought is continuing. The source of the new fires is the negligence of people clearing land and we are afraid because of the El Nin~o effect we will face a new disaster.\"</p><p>Mr Sugandhy said that despite recent rains in Java, both Kalimantan and northern Sumatra - which lie above the equator - had received little rainfall, and the severe economic crisis might encourage the over-utilisation of natural resources and the use of fire as a cheap method of clearing land.</p><p>A new phase of the drought - the most severe to hit Indonesia in 50 years - would also have serious implications for food supplies because most agricultural crops are expected to be harvested late and in reduced volumes, while the economic crisis is</p><p>forcing millions of people out of work.</p><p>The massive fires which raged from July to November last year, spreading smoke haze as far south as Darwin and north to the Thai border, were mainly caused by land clearing for the expansion of palm oil and timber estates and the burning off of debris from logging concessions.</p><p>Mr Sugandhy said the new fires this week were deliberately lit for land clearing. Satellite images provided to the Indonesian Environment Ministry show 40 fires burning along a nine-kilometres front inside the Bukit Soeharto preservation area and several smaller fires near rural villages.</p><p>Mr Byron said: \"The next three to four months are an absolute time bomb. During the 1982-83 El Nin~o year, three-quarters of the fire damage was done between January and April, and these were the biggest fires ever recorded on Earth.\"</p><p>During 1982-83, fires destroyed 3.7 million hectares of forest on Kalimantan. The fires last year destroyed an estimated 1.2 million hectares of tropical forest.</p><p>\"Whenever there is an El Nin~o you get a dry period which extends into October, then you get some rain which is 30 to 40 per cent of normal falls and then the drought comes back between January and April,\" Mr Byron said. \"We know from Portuguese explorers' logs that there have been El Nin~os in this region for at least 500 years because there are references to haze from peat swamps, but the difference now is large-scale logging and plantation development.\"</p><p>He said land which had been damaged by logging was eight to 10 times more likely to burn than virgin tropical forest, and that fire was widely used for land clearing in Indonesia because it was about a quarter of the cost of any other method.</p><p>In the 1960s, 82 per cent of Indonesia's land cover was virgin tropical forest. Recent estimates put forest cover at 53 per cent, including plantations of timber, palm oil and rubber. Between 800,000 and 1.2 million hectares of forest is cleared annually in Indonesia, raising serious concerns about environmental damage as water-shed areas disappear and wet-season rains cause massive erosion of top soil in the run-off into rivers and the sea.</p><p>\"We are still traumatised by what happened several months ago and I am very worried about lung diseases caused by the smoke,\" said Wiwin, a teacher in Samarinda, near the new fire zone.</p><p>Another resident, Didi, a hotel employee, said: \"It hasn't rained in two months and I'm worried about the chance of the recurrence of the fires. I am still relaxed, but I have taken the oxygen mask out of the closet just in case.\"</p><p>The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the El Nin~o effect appeared to be declining over Australia, with increased rainfall in the north.</p><p>\"There are indications that the declining phase has commenced,\" said Mr Terry Hart, the acting head of the BOM's National Climate Change Centre. \"We saw a sharp drop in the Southern Oscillation Index from December to January, but looking back through the records it is apparent that such a drop is often followed by a rising trend in the following months.\"</p><p>Mr Byron said the impact of the next \"spike\" in the El Nin~o effect depended entirely on how people behaved on the ground and whether they heeded warnings not to burn to clear land. \"The Indonesian Government should be on red alert. What is making us very nervous is wheth-er or not the economic crisis will encourage people to try to expand land-clearing activities.\"</p><p>The item is empty.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUS: Smoky struggle . . . villagers in central Sumatra pour river water on the smouldering ground.

In other words, a system with fatal internal contradictions cannot endure. While this is not to suggest that South-East Asia is inherently evil, the financial and environmental crises that are overwhelming the region call for a critical examination of so-called \"Asian democracy\" that purportedly made economic success possible for the tigers in the first place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Asian democracy distinguishes itself from its Western counterpart because it accommodates values that are supposedly peculiar to the Asian character.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>Purportedly these include thrift, a strong work ethic, respect for authority as an extension of filial piety, emphasis on family cohesiveness, \"face-saving\" and the subordination of individual rights to communal welfare.</p><p> At first glance, it's hard to imagine how these values could become a recipe for economic disaster. After all, each of them has found expression in the West, albeit to varying degrees, and has contributed to economic success in North America and Europe. Why, then, have these values produced such different economic results in the Asian and Western democratic context?</p><p> The short answer is that the SouthEast Asian mix has given rise to a political system that is unable to efficiently allocate economic resources by stifling the self-adjusting mechanisms of their economies.</p><p> Take thrift and a strong work ethic, for example. The mobilisation of vast pools of cheap, unskilled labor combined with a high rate of saving in most of East Asia are generally identified as important factors in the region's economic success.</p><p>However, this cultural propensity to save was amplified by government-imposed forced saving. This involved a combination of high payroll taxes and an emphasis on producing goods for export rather than for domestic consumption.</p><p>An export-led strategy could work as long as demand in the advanced economies remained buoyant, but failed as sales in North America and Europe dropped and inter-regional demand was unable to pick up the slack.</p><p> Furthermore, most governments neglected to reinvest revenues into education so that workers with upgraded skills could produce more competitive, value-added products. Instead, SouthEast Asia's governments spent the money, in numerous instances, on various useless construction projects and, more recently, on futile interventions in the foreign currency markets.</p><p> As in South-East Asia, Western political institutions feature hierarchical structures that are designed to facilitate efficient decision-making. However, many Asian governments have deftly exploited their citizens' Confucian sense of filial piety into an unquestioning respect for authority.</p><p> Without a credible system of checks and balances, politicians and government bureaucrats become entrenched as they are not accountable for their actions until a crisis erupts. Even then, accountability may prove elusive. As every diplomat knows, saving face is a dignified way to correct an offender while avoiding confrontation. However, this same approach can be subverted into a political dodge for avoiding responsibility.</p><p>\u00a0 A\u00a0 PRIME example is the approach South-East Asia's leaders took toward Indonesia's ongoing forest fire emergency. Instead of pressuring President Suharto to mitigate pollution damage to the region, they circled the wagons and uttered hardly any criticism of their autocratic brother until it became clear that an overwhelming groundswell of popular outrage demanded a denunciation.</p><p> Both East and West see the maintenance of strong family and personal ties as a stabilising influence on society. The opposite is true when familial relations become nepotism and when personal connections, or guanxi, metastasise into graft and corruption.</p><p> Many East Asian policy-makers intervened in the development of domestic capital markets so as to favour local banks. Heavy regulation led to a stunted bond market. This allowed the regimes to direct lending towards preferred areas for development and facilitated the provision of privileged loan access to political supporters. Losses from bad debts have dealt a severe and lasting blow to most of South-East Asia's financial system.</p><p> Perhaps the most uniquely Asian value is giving priority to the welfare of the community over that of the individual. This altruistic notion of society above self was translated into \"prosperity first, rights later\" by regional leaders and used as a justification for restricting citizens' civil liberties.</p><p> This precluded the development of an institutional framework capable of supporting sustained economic growth.</p><p>Restrictions on political speech went hand-in-hand with a lack of financial transparency on the part of business and government, with predictably disastrous results for investors and voters alike.</p><p> Concentrating power in paternalistic autocrats may have seemed like an expeditious way to set and execute economic priorities, but this lack of separation between the executive and judicial branches of government stunted the development of a credible rule of law in many Asian democracies.</p><p> Will South-East Asia's tigers survive the financial crisis? The inherent resilience of the Asian character will see that they do. Will the Asian democratic model endure? Probably not, as long as it remains a euphemism for autocracy.</p><p>Based on the schizophrenic notion that markets can be free while politics is not, Asian democracy is destined to fail.</p><p> Co-written by attorney Teresa Wyszomierski.

They would focus on rebuilding the foreign exchange market and restoring economic confidence.</p><p>The IMF is expected to increase pressure for the scrapping of Indonesia's controversial national car project, which granted exclusively tax and tariff concessions to President Soeharto's son, Hutomo \"Tommy\" Mandela Putra, as well as the expensive national program to develop an Indonesian jet, controlled by the powerful Minister for Technology and close presidential ally, Dr Jusuf Habibe.</p><p>Monopolies on staple products such as rice and flour are also likely to be challenged and analysts said the overcrowded and under-performing banking sector must face a shake-out which will see closures and mergers.</p><p>Details of the IMF assistance effort have not yet been announced. It contributed $US3.9 billion ($A5.41 billion) to a $US17.2 billion international bail-out for Thailand and analysts in Singapore say a loan to Indonesia could be $US4 billion to $US6 billion. Construction sites across Jakarta have fallen silent this week as major developers, facing substantial short-term debts, have suspended work. Australian companies are reporting the non-payment of bills by many Indonesian customers.</p><p>According to the Central Bank, Indonesia's private sector had $US55 billion of outstanding foreign debt at the end of last year, almost two-thirds of which was short-term and due to be repayed within the next three months.</p><p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, said in Washington yesterday that Australian will give careful consideration to any formal request for assistance from Indonesia.</p><p>\"We do have confidence in the fundamental economic situation in South-East Asia,\" he said.</p><p>\"There are obviously some specific difficulties at the moment, but we do believe these will be overcome in time.\"</p><p>Figures for September show a 70 per cent decline in imports, dropping from the usual $2.5 billion to $750 million because of the plunge in the value of the rupiah, the official Antara news agency reported yesterday.</p><p>The agency quoted Amiruddin Saud, chairman of the All Indonesia Association of Importers, as saying the fall came about as many manufacturers cut back on purchases of raw materials and intermediate goods.</p><p>Although manufacturers had maintained stocks for present needs, prolonged weakness in the rupiah would hurt the manufacturing sector.</p><p>\"If the Government does not immediately overcome the monetary crisis, it will not be unlikely that in the long run it will threaten domestic industries, particularly textiles,\" he was quoted as saying.</p><p>Economists said the IMF's assistance was essential to avoid the disastrous social and political consequences of widespread lay-offs when Indonesia is facing crop reductions due to the drought, the continuing forest fire crisis, and heightened political volatility ahead of next year's presidential elections.</p><p>Growth forecasts have already been revised down and price increases have been mooted for politically sensitive food items, and for kerosene and petrol.</p><p>Both the stock and money markets reacted modestly to the IMF announcement with the rupiah moving from 3,640 to the US dollar to 3,565 and the stock market gaining just under 1 per cent as foreign and Indonesian players waited for more details.</p><p>The IMF managing director, Mr Michael Camdessus, said: \"The IMF strongly supports the approach that has been followed by Indonesia, which sees this as an occasion to strengthen its economic policies even if fundamentals are basically sound.\"</p><p>An economist, Mr Christianto Wibisono, said in Jakarta: \"Indonesia now has to be mentally ready to face the consequences and put itself on a strict diet. There's no use in pursuing nationalist policies like the car and the plane if they cost too much.</p><p>\"If the corporates go bankrupt lots of people will lose their jobs, there will be political turbulence and social riots. So our position is one of whether or not we want to survive. We have no choice.\"</p><p>Japan's Finance Minister, Mr Hiroshi Mitusuka, said yesterday that he was liaising closely with the IMF and the World Bank on any plan that may be drawn up, but so far Japan had not been asked to provide assistance.</p><p>Japan's banks have invested $US38 billion in Indonesia since 1967 and for more than a decade Japan has been Indonesia's biggest foreign aid donor, handing over around $US900 million a year.</p><p>The English-language Jakarta Post said in its editorial yesterday: \"The IMF could insist on thorough economic reforms that Indonesia has needed all along, but the Government has not been willing or able to implement. It may be a bitter pill, but if that is what is needed to cure our economic ills, then so be it.\"</p><p>An economist said Indonesia's new middle class would be hard hit by high interest rates which have pushed home mortgage rates to over 30 per cent, and would be likely to become increasingly critical of Government corruption and favouritism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhvq2ag4wocast57qz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P85-12R0-TXN5-R2X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"920\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 10, 1997 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Indonesia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy/Finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Company/International Monetary Fund</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Record</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000680</classCode><className>EXTERNAL DEBT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SR8</classCode><className>FAMILY COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000895</classCode><className>IMPORT TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9K</classCode><className>INDUSTRY ANALYSTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

This diversity is the result of many influences, including the progressive introduction of new species; the deletion of others that have proved to be less than desirable; maintenance costs; and the changing popularity of species, which, like fashions, waxes and wanes over time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A tree planted today with a useful life of 80 to 100 years may be in and out of favour with future generations. Belconnen is a good example. It was largely established to native eucalypts at a time of a major surge in public interest in native plants and the decline of many exotic trees following the drought of the late 1960s.</p><p>Barrie Smillie ('Elms and planes kinder than gums', Letters, 31 December) now suggests that these same eucalypts are filthy, ugly, incapable of producing useful shade and too expensive to maintain. Some residents like the attractive bark types and the irregular silhouettes of eucalypts as much as others appreciate the autumn colours of the exotic deciduous trees. Further, research at the ANU School of Resources, Environment and Society suggests that the cost of maintaining eucalypts and exotics may be the same over their 80-year life spans, although the timing of these costs will differ.</p><p>The people of Canberra have to plan the types of trees they want both now and for the 80 years of future forest they are committing themselves and their children to look at and maintain.</p><p>(Drs) JOHN BANKS and CRIS BRACK Forestry, School of Resources, Environment and Society, ANU<br/>\u00a0<br/>Maples better in case of fire</p><p>TONY BARTLETT, director of ACT Forests, says (Letters, 10 January) that the burnt pine trees near Yarramundi Reach must be cleared because the pines will die due to the fire damage. Doesn't it therefore make sense, in this area of national significance that is mostly useful for recreation rather than forestry, to plant trees that are not very susceptible to catching fire?</p><p>Deciduous trees are usually much less susceptible to fire due to moister leaves, less dead wood, and less oily sap. Fires hardest to control will occur in pine and eucalypt, especially forestry pine, with branches and remains of the last harvest still on the forest floor.</p><p>In America it is frequent to recommend planting such trees as maples as being much easier to defend against fire. While a maple can be damaged by fire it is much less likely to catch fire in the first place and such a fire is much easier to put out.</p><p>And what would be more attractive than a grove of Canadian red maples on the shore of the lake?</p><p>CHRIS BITMEAD Kambah<br/>\u00a0<br/>Experience in plantations vital</p><p>MR TONY BARTLETT, director of ACT Forests, waxes lyrical in satisfaction that the forestry fire-fighting workforce actually increased from 21 to 26 this year (CT, 10 January, p.1). Big deal; it is worth noting that this number is only half of what it was some 10 years. Forestry back then led the field in the ACT with bushfire management, experience and suppression capability.</p><p>Bushfire fighting in pine plantations is extremely hazardous, and experience, in particular a knowledge of the layout of the plantations and of pine-forest-fire behaviour, is essential; only those working full-time in the pine forests can achieve that expertise.</p><p>No matter how dedicated, trained and efficient firefighters may be (and our volunteers and urban brigade firefighters certainly are) we can never replace that plantation expertise so vital for safe and effective pine-forest wild-fire suppression.</p><p>VAL JEFFERY Tharwa<br/>\u00a0<br/>Unfair blaming is not productive</p><p>I AGREE with Mr Val Jeffery ('Best interests of community', Letters, 9 January)that the Conservation Council and all other representatives on the Bush Fire Council have always worked constructively, productively and with respect for all views expressed around the table. This was the case for the 1995 Task Force, which reviewed ACT bushfire-fuel management practices, on which both Mr Jeffery and the Conservation Council were represented. The Task Force rightly considered the protection of life and property and environmental and conservation issues.</p><p>After fiery debate, the Task Force made 24 recommendations about fuel management, resulting in the 1998 ACT Bushfire Fuel Management Plan, which was subject to community consultation.</p><p>Mr Jeffery knows that if he has concerns about a perceived lack of strategic fuel management, as required under the Fuel Management Plan, the ACT fuel-management committee would like to hear about it.</p><p>The Conservation Council becomes concerned when unsubstantiated accusations are made against 'greenies', government and bureaucrats for hindering or not undertaking fuel management. This is not consistent with Mr Jeffery's claim of 'a productive relationship of mutual respect', and it is certainly not in the 'best interests of the community' for community leaders like Mr Jeffery to randomly and unfairly point the bone at other sectors.</p><p>GEOFF BUTLER Conservation Council of the SE Region &amp; Canberra<br/>\u00a0<br/>NSW first to have a 'national park'</p><p>THE EXTENSIVE fires at the Royal National Park, the third big burn in just over a decade, raise concerns about 'a crisis in fire-management' (Simon Grose, CT, 9 January, p.11). Grose repeats a common misconception, that Yellowstone, in the United States, was the world's first national park, and Australia's Royal was the second. Yellowstone was not the first, even in the USA. Yosemite National Park was created eight years earlier, in 1864, but neither Yellowstone nor Yosemite used the term 'national park' in their legislation.</p><p>The world's first legislation for a national park was passed by NSW on 31 March 1879, dedicating the National Park at Sydney (made Royal in 1955). It is time to grab our history back. The Royal National Park is the world's oldest legislated park, and its complex fire ecology, aggravated by proximity to a major city, deserves sophisticated fire research that acknowledges and integrates understandings about both the people of Sydney and their park.</p><p>The 'separatist' national parks ideal of the 1970s is not what we need. Only a conservation biology that embraces the whole landscape will help us understand the regular and irregular patterns of fire through this heathland.</p><p>Let's not describe it as 'destroyed'. We know it is not, but if we want to maximise biodiversity we need to research its history, both national and local.</p><p>LIBBY ROBIN O'Connor Editor's note: Simon Grose's information came from World Book Encyclopaedia, which says Yosemite was established in 1894.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-4242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44X5-PJN0-0045-53PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"1154\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 The Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited</copyright><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>January 14, 2002 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ANU SCHOOL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CONSERVATION COUNCIL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ANU SCHOOL\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONSERVATION COUNCIL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>National Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTc0NDhFM0ZBMTBFNEQ4QzlERUMxNEJFRENDMDU0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSA1</classCode><className>URBAN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSA1</classCode><className>URBAN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They kill the adult orangutans and they take the babies for the pet trade. \"We confiscated one adult from some hunters that had a bullet lodged 2mm from her heart.\"Some of the orangutans have had their hands and arms cut off, or their heads smashed in.\"When you come across that sort of damage, when you have looked into the eyes of an orangutan and see the beam of intelligence there, just like human eyes - well, it's hard not to hate the guys who do these dreadful things.\"You struggle not to become a fanatic and to look at the bigger picture. It takes all your training as a scientist to stay objective because that's what you must do.</p><p>But, it's hard at times, very hard.\"Dr Smits politely asks if it is possible to \"remind people in Australia to check any products containing oil palm to see where it is grown\". Check margarine, shampoo, soaps and cosmetics, he says.\"Ring the companies and ask where they obtain the palm oil. They should not support the illegal clearing of orangutan habitat.\"After finding a badly burned orangutan in the wake of an illegal forest fire, Dr Smits, who was then working as a forest ecologist in Indonesia, founded the Borneo OrangutanSurvival Foundation (BOS) in 1991. With well-known primate scientist, Dr Jane Goodall as its patron, BOS has become the world's largest not-for-profit primate conservation organisation.Based in Indonesia, the organisation protects, rescues and rehabilitates orangutans,as well as training researchers and employing local families in its numerous conservation projects.\"It is not the local people who are behind the destruction of the forests and wildlife. It is the big guys, with big money from corruption usually backing them,\" Dr Smits says.While conservation has become a safely distanced policy game (with meetings, conferences, position papers) for many environment groups, Dr Smits is literally right at the front of one of the world's most intensely fought and highly dangerous conservation battles.In the fight to save orangutans from poachers, illegal logging, massive forest fires and the illegal pet trade, he is constantly risking his life.He has taken on corrupt officials in the Indonesian army and police forces, governmentbureaucrats prepared to bend rules for lucrative bribes, rich movie stars and influential members of Asia's business community.\"Yes, it can be dangerous. I have had hundreds of death threats and, recently, I had to move my family again,\" he says.\"You are dealing with people with guns who get very aggressive when you come to take the orangutan babies away from them. The situation can be very tense and ugly.\"He has received numerous international awards (and a knighthood from the Netherlands)for his conservation work and is currently pioneering the use of satellite technology to save orangutan habitat.\"We are able to monitor for illegal logging in Indonesia's forests. The old system of ground checks is too slow, and forest conservation management data is often exaggerated.\"In central Kalimantan, BOS manages 330,000ha of forest which is home to 3000 wild orangutans.\"We are also looking after 600 orangutan babies at our centre, but for me, this is not a mark of our success. That so many orphaned orangutans exist, is proof that we are failing in our fight to stop the illegal pet trade. More must be done.\" Borneo, home to the world's rapidly diminishing orangutan population, has lost 80 per cent of its rainforest in the past two decades. Less than 50,000 orangutans survive in the wild, but with an estimated annual mortality rate of over 6000 a year, some experts are predicting the orangutan will become extinct in the wild within the next 10 years.A typical example of illegal trade surfaced two months ago in Thailand. A raid on a Bangkok zoo and amusement park uncovered more than 100 orangutans, used for zoo displays and to stage Thai boxing matches for visitors.The zoo initially told police its orangutanshad been bred in captivity from 14 adults purchased before 1992, when the orangutan trade was banned.Scientists were called in to conduct DNA tests on hair and saliva, to determine if the orangutans were bred from zoo stock or smuggled in from Indonesia. The zoo subsequently admitted most the orangutans were illegally obtained.But, facing charges for breaching the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to which Thailand is a signatory, almost half the zoo's orangutans mysteriously went missing.Zoo officials claimed the animals had died, but police later discovered the missingorangutans hidden in the Safari World's quarantine quarters.\"People want orangutan babies as a status symbol or for amusement. It is a sick trade and one which is fed by corruption in high places. There are about $1 billion worth of animals smuggled out of Indonesia every year. That sort of money will tell you that it is not poor village people driving this trade,\" Dr Smits says.As well as running BOS, he lectures in forest ecology at Indonesian universities and established the Wanariset forestry research station on Borneo. The institute has developed reforestation techniques that have been adopted by the Indonesian government.He is currently working on a land management model - a \"debt for nature\" swap to acquire land to be used both as a nature refuge and for voluntary carbon offset agreements.\"When you look into the eyes of an orangutan, you can see emotion. They are so much like us, with so much of our DNA that it is scary.\"The young are dependent on their mothers for seven years, so when they are ripped away from the mothers you can imagine the fear, the panic and the loss,\" he says.\"This is not just an emotive appeal. If we lose the orangutan - if we let this happen through the fires, the illegal clearing for oil palm and the pet trade - we will also lose something of our humanity.\"Dr Smits is visiting Australia to promote International Orangutan Awareness Week and will give a free public lecture at ANU's School of Botany and Zoology at 1pm this Wednesday.

Add some hot weather and we face firefighters' greatest fear -- the megafire. DANNY BUTTLER reports</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MEGAFIRES -- they are bigger, hotter, faster and like nothing Australia has ever seen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the cusp of what could be the worst Victorian fire season in history, the megafire phenomenon is worrying even the most grizzled fire-fighting veterans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First identified in the US, these massive infernos scorched 3.6 million hectares during the American summer last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Continued Page 34</p><p>From Page 33</p><p>Megafires are a series of large wildfires that merge into a monstrous blaze authorities are helpless to control.</p><p>With global warming leaving our bushland in a similarly vulnerable position to the US, fire crews in Victoria are gearing up for the fight of their lives.</p><p>Conditions this season are even worse than before the Ash Wednesday inferno of 1983 -- up to five times worse.</p><p>Kevin O'Loughlin from the Bushfire Co-operative Research Centre says if Australia follows the US trend, we could experience Ash Wednesday-style fires or even worse on a regular basis.</p><p>''What the Americans are saying is that these really major fires seem to be happening more regularly,'' he says.</p><p>''Something like seven out of 10 of the worst fires in their history have happened in the last 10 years.</p><p>''What was regarded as the extreme is now the normal and we are going to have to adjust.''</p><p>And O'Loughlin is not alone in claiming a single spark could ignite a catastrophe in Victoria.</p><p>THE Department of Sustainability and Environment's chief fire officer, Ewan Waller, has been battling fires for 32 years, but he's never seen anything like the present conditions.</p><p>''We are really concerned -- we are probably coming into the worst season I have ever faced,'' he says.</p><p>''Because it's been 10 years (of drought) . . . even 1982-83 was a short burst of very dry weather, only one or two years, but the underlying dryness now is so much more severe.''</p><p>The Country Fire Authority's chief officer, Russell Rees, says climate change has made the days of a ''good'' fire season a thing of the past.</p><p>''For me, the notion of an easy year is basically a distant memory,'' he says.</p><p>Rees says the root of the problem can be found a few centimetres below the ground where soil moisture is at all-time lows.</p><p>''Over the last 10 years the cumulative deficit of moisture means the soil moisture is very low, therefore our fuel dries off very rapidly,'' he says.</p><p>''But it also means our heavier fuels -- branches, logs et cetera -- are all very dry. So you get two things happening -- our general fire fuels, like grass, leaves and twigs, are very dry, and secondly, the logs and branches are also dry so the fire intensity is increasing.</p><p>Continued Page 35</p><p>''So fires are becoming more intense and therefore more difficult to control.''</p><p>Climate change is being blamed for the unprecedented conditions both here and in the US.</p><p>Massive fires have also scorched Europe in recent times.</p><p>The CSIRO has predicted extreme forest fire conditions in Victoria could increase by up to 25 per cent over the next decade. By 2050, fire risk in southeast Australia could rise by up to 70 per cent.</p><p>This is on top of Victoria already ranking with California and southern Europe as the most bushfire-vulnerable areas in the world.</p><p>THE changing weather patterns not only make fires more intense, but prevent vital fuel reduction burns in autumn.</p><p>''There's definitely something that is making forest fires harder to control,'' the DSE's Ewan Waller says.</p><p>''What we are finding is, like last year, we didn't get the autumn break to dampen down the fuels so we could burn more safely.</p><p>''We only got about half the days we normally would,'' he says.</p><p>It's recipe for disaster.''</p><p>The changing conditions have forced a major rethink, as fire crews realise traditional firefighting techniques don't work on megafires.</p><p>Water tankers, aerial bombardment and backburning can be useless once these fires take hold.</p><p>Calling the CFA or even Elvis the huge water-bombing helicopter might not help. Praying for rain could be the best bet.</p><p>''Last year was one of (America's) worst years ever -- nine million acres -- a lot of those were megafires; once they get a roll on they are very hard to control,'' Waller says.</p><p>''It's like what happened in the alpine fires: we just have to pull back and protect homes and private assets until things die down and we have another go.''</p><p>The sight of blackened firefighters spraying water on a raging fire front will be seen less as fires become more intense.</p><p>''The way to attack those sort of fires is to come from behind. You flank them -- you can't get in front of them because it is too dangerous,'' he says.</p><p>''Until they abate for some reason -- the wind dies or you might get a shower of rain or the fuel type changes -- then you can get around in front of them.''</p><p>Eucalypt forests bursting with flammable oil and difficult wind conditions make our part of the world a dangerous place to live.</p><p>But the CFA reckons the call-out sirens would be a lot quieter if it wasn't for one factor -- people.</p><p>''I always say there are three main causes of fire -- men, women and children,'' the CFA's Russell Rees says.</p><p>''You can have extremely bad weather, extremely dry fuel and no ignitions -- so you don't have fires.</p><p>''So we plead with people to avoid the circumstances which cause fires in the first place.''</p><p>While firebugs continue to be a major cause of concern, most bushfires are lit by accident, carelessness or a combination of the two.</p><p>''A campfire, working with materials that generate heat, a spark from a grinder, a welder or even a trailer with overheated bearings,'' he says. ''You have someone mowing long, dry grass on a stinking hot day. Is that really essential?''</p><p>But people being people, not too many CFA volunteers will be expecting a smoke-free summer.</p><p>And adding to their woes is a growing concern in many areas about a lack of fire crews.</p><p>CHANGING demographics in the bush means there are far fewer people in many regions and other areas are being populated by older treechangers from the city.</p><p>''There are parts of the state where it is becoming hard to get volunteers,'' Rees says.</p><p>''Our pressure points for volunteers are in rural areas and where there is now significant treechangers and seachangers.</p><p>''People are retiring into those areas and availability is often from people in their 50s and beyond.</p><p>''The normal person who would be a community member and volunteer is being pushed out by affluent treechangers and seachangers who impact on the ability of a community to sustain an essential fire brigade.''</p><p>If the megafires do scorch Victoria, our already dire water shortage could hit crisis point.</p><p>Burning catchments are a disaster for water supplies, with fire residue polluting water on a massive scale.</p><p>''Imagine you had one of those fires in the water catchment of a major city,'' O'Louglin says.</p><p>''We know from the Canberra fires that the water supply there was ruined for about 18 months.</p><p>''If it burns through the catchment you have ash and dust and then if it rains it washes ash and mud into the reservoirs.</p><p>''That was the experience of the 1939 fires; it affected the water supply for decades.''</p><p>Despite the doomsday talk, fire authorities are anxious not to cause panic among the people they are charged with keeping safe.</p><p>O'Loughlin says widespread controlled burns are the best alternative to letting nature run its course.</p><p>''The option of doing nothing is not an option,'' he says.</p><p>''We're not talking about things that are 30 years away . . . and the potential consequences for our natural resource management could be catastrophic.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4M3T-05S0-TX52-J26S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-DHS0610141033143215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUNLTD</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1274\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>October 14, 2006 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

And we meet once more those ancient Greeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week the Prime Minister visited Indonesia, and one topic he may have discussed behind closed doors is fire, because Indonesia is burning, catastrophically, and this is once more choking neighbouring countries. Brendan May chairs Robertsbridge, which works extensively on deforestation in our region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brendan May:</emphasis>Indonesia's forest fires are a catastrophe, not just regionally but globally. Over 8,000 square miles of forest and peatland have been burnt to a crisp. That's an area 12 times bigger than Sydney and 30 times bigger than Indonesia's smog suffering neighbour Singapore. And with the losses of forest and peat come other calamities; a devastating wipe-out of habitat and already endangered wildlife, a humanitarian disaster with half a million people suffering from respiratory complaints and 19 dead, and a simply staggering increase in greenhouse gas emissions, rivalling the annual total emissions of many industrialised countries.</p><p>And right now the world is focused on the COP21 climate talks in Paris, designed for the first time to deliver legally binding limits, country by country, on emissions in order to avoid global average temperatures rising more than a further two degrees. Arguably, recent events in Indonesia have already made a significant contribution to disabling this process. It is INDC's (a clumsy UN acronym for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) call for a 26% emissions reduction by 2020 and a conditional 41% by 2030, assuming international support. This is all using 2010 as a business-as-usual baseline.</p><p>Forestry, including fires, has contributed 60% of the country's total emissions over the last decade. Indonesia is also rich in coal and is developing new coal-fired power stations to meet increasing energy demand, and much of that coal of course lies beneath forest cover. And the most readily available source of biofuel feedstock (another growth area) is from, guess where, forestry. So whichever way you look at it, forestry is the elephant in the room.</p><p>But we need to look very carefully at the causes of these devastating fires and the resulting pollution. Unique to Indonesia is the fact that much of the country's forest sits on colossally deep peatland which, when it's cleared and drained, burns for a very, very long time if ignited. Once alight, peat emits all the CO2 it has stored over the millennia that it took to create.</p><p>That peatland has been drained in the first place does lie at the door of the big forestry businesses in Indonesia, largely palm oil and pulp plantation concession owners. But some of the biggest players have undergone a radical transformation and imposed zero deforestation policies across huge swathes of the landscape, and they've stopped developing on peatland. That has been one of the most positive news stories to come out of the environment movement in recent years.</p><p>The most sophisticated measures being taken by companies in Indonesia include the retirement of plantations on peat, complex management regimes to secure the forested and peatland landscapes, and to restore and conserve sufficient areas to address their legacies of destruction. All this is unprecedented progress. These companies now rely entirely on the plantations that already exist, so it's clearly not in their interests to set fire to their own raw material supply. Blaming fires on very large companies may be headline grabbing, but it's missing the point and it's wildly inaccurate. In fact the companies themselves are deploying thousands of firefighters to protect their assets.</p><p>The causal truth is very complex. It starts with the uncomfortable fact that there is very little clear definition over who actually owns what land. Commercial concessions in Indonesia often overlap with each other, and indigenous communities claim (often but not always legitimately) that they have a historic right to the use of traditionally held lands. Corruption and lawbreaking are endemic, policing is weak, and illegal encroachment is widespread.</p><p>Forest fire is an organised criminal industry. Much has been written and spoken about this. Fingers have been pointed, accusations hurled around the ether. But what the world needs to do now is to focus not simply on the cause and effect of forest fire but the cure. My own feeling is that this cure has three core elements. First, and most obviously, political. The current President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, or Jokowi as he is popularly known, is the first President not to emerge from the country's ruling elite or military, and as such he heads a government with a populist leaning agenda. But he also has to wrestle with a legacy of deeply entrenched self-interest, widespread corruption, particularly at regional and local level, and a historically unhealthy link between business and politics. His is an extremely difficult balancing act. And to be fair, he has taken some action, not least returning early from a visit to America to deal with the crisis. The President has ordered a moratorium on new licences to develop peatland, and he has ordered officials to prosecute those who clear land by burning.</p><p>But his own populism can work against him too. He is considering an electoral promise to redistribute some 9 million hectares of land to farmers, raising their average landholding from 0.8 to 2 hectares. Coupled with that, not all forest fires are started illegally. Whilst enforcement may be feeble and it's illegal for companies to start fires for clearance, there are instances where small holders can do so. It is the cheapest way of clearing land. Put the two together and you can guess the result.</p><p>What Jokowi needs is not sanctimonious words from the rest of the world's political leadership, he needs help. First he needs the Paris climate talks to deliver tangible solutions that could be translated into practical policy back home, so that Indonesia can carry back the legitimacy to enact a legal framework that enables compliance with the agreements coming out of Paris. Permanent and well policed bans on any natural forest and peatland clearance of any sort by anyone, for example.</p><p>Second, he needs the support of politically derived institutions, US aid for example. And in particular the Norwegians who through their gigantic sovereign wealth finance can fund many of the compensatory initiatives that are needed to enable smallholder farmers to earn a living without burning forests, and which can also help in the hugely complex and expensive task of blocking canals, rewetting peatlands and reforestation. And of course countries like Australia, which sadly has had much experience of forest fires of its own.</p><p>The second part of the cure is commercial, and I should declare an interest here, I have worked with very large Indonesian businesses on zero deforestation initiatives for some years, and I know what challenges they face. And by the way, none of them are perfect. But I also know that with will and investment and leadership, it can be done. So the outside world of business needs to sit up and take more notice of those companies that can genuinely prove they have eliminated deforestation in their supply chains and have taken real steps to dealing with their legacy through conservation and restoration and who are making the right investments in communities across their concessions that help them avoid the need to clear land to make a living.</p><p>And this outside world of business needs also to move faster and further in making its own supply chain fully responsible. There are some shining lights here, ones you might not even expect, like Nestl\u00e9 and Ferrero chocolate. But there are some real laggards. Why is PepsiCo being coy about deforestation? Why is Kraft Heinz equally flaccid on the subject? What kind of message does this timid approach from some consumer goods companies send?</p><p>The third cure lies in the hands of the environmental campaigning NGOs. With some notable exception, it seems to me that they are remarkably dysfunctional. Many of them have fallen into the trap of thinking that if they lose the object of their protest, then they have no raison d'\u00eatre, so they continue to protest, even if the evidence is clear that they have won, and they should be supporting companies who are progressive and trying to change. There will always be other targets.</p><p>In the end of course the fires will go out, and at last some rain has arrived, but too often, once the haze clears, attention drifts elsewhere too. This time perhaps it will be different because of the sheer scale of the disaster. We must hope so, for Indonesia's sake and the world's future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Brendan May chairs Robertsbridge, based in England. And as you heard, it does lots of work in Indonesia.</p><p>Here's a strange question; would mega-fauna help with fire?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> So we are at Oxford's famous Natural History Museum, and we're looking at a number of old skeletons of animals that are arranged going from small animals to large animals, and this is interesting because this is more or less the distribution of animals that used to exist on the planet, and it no longer exists because we've lost most of the large animals. So right now we can see...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> The common pig.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> The common pig, that's right, and that's pretty much one of the biggest animals, so the biggest animal in the South American is the tapir. It's probably about twice the size of a common pig, about 300 kilograms is the upper limit, and that's actually the biggest endemic herbivore in South America. But if you go back 10,000 years ago, when humans first arrived in South America there would have been about 15 animals that were greater than 1,000 kilograms, and so that must of had an impact on forests, ecosystem services, not just South America but everywhere, Australia, North America. Those three places were probably hit the hardest by this extinction event that happened 10,000 years ago.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> All those huge animals eating so much, trampling so much, and then they weren't there anymore. Have you been able to study what the consequence was of that change?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> Yes, we can go about this a couple of ways, we can look at the fossil record, but we could also look at what do big animals do in places like Africa where they still exist. So Africa is the one place that didn't experience this big extinction event, so you could basically take elephants and all other big animals out of these ecosystems. And immediately the first consequence is you always see a big increase in tree growth. Then we could look at continental comparisons. So if we could for instance compare South America, that used to have all these big animals, what we can predict that savannas in South America probably had a lot more tree cover in savanna areas than Africa. You get about 26% less tree cover in the savannas.</p><p>However, it's interesting, in the forest ecosystems it's almost the opposite effect. In Africa you see much bigger trees than in equivalent tropical jungle in the Amazon. And we think it possibly may be because forest elephants are basically removing a lot of the understory, and that gives more nutrients and water for the big trees to grow bigger. So one of the big questions is if you put all these big animals back in the ecosystems, would there be more carbon stored in the biosphere or less?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Tell me, do you know how much...this is a ridiculous question isn't it...how much does an elephant eat? How much does a giraffe eat?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> I don't know but I could predict that much, in fact I could predict how much an extinct animal that is the equivalent size to a giraffe and elephant would eat. So right now we are looking at basically all these skeletons that go from small to big, and I could predict more or less just if I know the weight how much all of these would eat. So the other prediction we make is that with big animals you get much better distribution of nutrients.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Big animals help you mean?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> That's right, big animals help a lot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I suppose big animals crap more.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> Exactly, but it's not just that, they move more. So the important thing for big animals is they can take a mouthful of grass that has lots of nutrients, and it's going to stay in their body for a much longer time, and because they are big animals they move much further.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> We just happen to be, by some amazing coincidence, not just looking at these huge skeletons but we are next to a display called Mammals of Australia, and they are all quite small. We used to have diprotodons, those vast rhinoceros or hippopotamus-sized creatures, chomping their way across the landscape. But we've only got, as you can see, the little ones, the wallabies, and there's the koala and there's the echidna and there's the wombat. Fairly small stuff!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> That's right, yes, so Australia also had an extremely severe extinction event. But it's interesting that Australia never really had the big creatures. And elephants and their relatives seemed to really play a role, they are really ecosystem engineers. They are kind of the dominant ones when it comes to how they control the amount of trees and savannas. So elephants are really important from that standpoint. You see a big impact on vegetation coverage, you see a big change in the amount of fire...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> That's right, in fact somebody suggested we import elephants, let them loose in various parts of the Australian landscape, that would reduce the understory and the extremely flammable material that we've got. The big season coming up is going to be a huge worry. Nothing has happened just yet to bring in elephants. Would you like to see it happen in Australia?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> I'd like, on an experimental basis, to see what effect they might have. But a lot of people are talking about this. We're talking about trying to put elephants back in other places, back in South America where they were until 10,000 years ago, how would this affect these ecosystems? So Australia is a bit of a different case, but it's tricky, I can see why people would have difficulty with that.</p><p>The other side of it, let's take South America as an example again, a lot of our favourite fruits, like avocado, chocolate, there are some that theorise that they actually coevolved with these mega-fauna, with the gomphotheres, which is an elephant-like animal that had lived in these areas in the past. There is still debate about that. The other side of this question is now that these animals went extinct, who is moving the seeds of these trees that formally coevolved with them?</p><p>So if you think about the size of a seed of an avocado, that's a very big seed. And seeds want to be eaten by animals, so they want to be dispersed, so most trees, the fruit is basically an enticing element to get an animal to swallow the seed and move it far away from the parent. And so when you think about an avocado, what animal could possibly swallow a seed that big? Avocado evolved around Mexico area, in the Americas, and there's no animals that could currently swallow that...well, there's a horse, but horses actually evolved in North America and were killed off 10,000 years ago and then they came back with Europeans later on. Of course avocado and chocolate are different because now we are their dispersers. And we can basically thank these extinct mega-fauna for those.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> It's lucky that we don't have to swallow the entire avocado and then eliminate the seed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Doughty:</emphasis> That's right, no, I wouldn't want to swallow an avocado seed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Chris Doughty is at Oriel College in Oxford and the department of geography there.</p><p>And it was David Bowman who came up with the idea of bringing elephants to Australia, a charming idea, I would have thought. David is Professor of Environmental Change Biology at the University of Tasmania, but I found him at the Royal Society in London.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Bowman:</emphasis> I was being provocative, but what we're trying to get people to think about is if we are going to stabilise the fire problems we've got globally and in particular Australia where we've disrupted ecological systems, introduced new grasses, introduced new animals, shut down traditions of Indigenous landscape burning, what we've effectively done is we've pulled apart a food web that created particular fire regimes, particular ways of burning landscape and particular patterns of burning. And one way of re-stabilising these systems is to reimagine the problem not as a series of parts, a problem of feral animals, a problem of weeds, a problem of fire, but to see them as all integrated, and so that we would be using the management of animals to manage fire.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, is this what you've been telling the people at this august establishment, the Royal Society in London?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Bowman:</emphasis> Yes, absolutely. What I was doing was saying, well, we can imagine landscape fire in a food web, and in a sense we are elevating fire. So it's not saying that fire is a living thing, but it's acknowledging that fire has properties of living things, it interacts with living things, and think of the words we use about fire, we talk about fire having a behaviour, we talk about feeding fires, we talk about the way fire can move, it has an ecological niche. So in a sense you just put all of those things together of people talking about fire as a global herbivore, why don't we imagine fire in a food web as an integral part of an ecological system.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> But that means you can't do terribly much about it. Fire is so destructive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Bowman:</emphasis> Yes, but you see this is where the fresh thinking comes in, that in a place like Hobart it would be possible if we could get over the idea of manipulating landscapes, to switch areas, say around Hobart where I live, from being very flammable eucalyptus forest, you could actually have little glades in those eucalypt forests which are maintained by marsupials. Marsupials create lawns, it's a common feature of a lot of herbivorous animals, that they can affect the herbaceous ground layer and they can create actual lawns. That's what a lawn is, it's ultimately something that animals created. We use lawnmowers but you can get animals to create lawns, and lawns are relatively inflammable. So you could create mosaics, you can change the way landscapes work, and I think that the idea of total war on fire, more and more kit attacking fire isn't going to work. The Americans are quietly going broke, we are talking billions now being spent in fire seasons. As climate change is biting, the fire seasons are getting epic. And we have to completely reimagine this. And I think that the outcome is going to be reimagining fire in a food web.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> How many years ago was it when that huge fire consumed Hobart and almost brought the city to a standstill?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Bowman:</emphasis> Yes, 1967, and it's a real worry that there have been a couple of generations...we now have politicians in Tasmania who really have no understanding...children are not even born for 1967. We know those ecosystems are pent up. I like to imagine Mount Wellington as an organic volcano. It's pent-up. And when you get the correct fire weather, these rogue days, like Dunalley, which just come really hard and they can drive fires and extreme fire behaviour in a couple of hours, incredible destruction, what we have to do is create fireproof communities. We have total war on drugs, total war on things, well, often it ends up that it's making peace with this thing, and what we've got to do with fire is it's a rapprochement, we've got to understand fire as being inside a food web in an ecosystem and get into some sort of reciprocity. We will give fire certain things, and in return fire will give us certain things.</p><p>But if we just want to quell fire, attack fire, what will end up happening, as we are seeing particularly in the US is you just get these things called mega-fires which shut everything down. There are not enough bombers, there are not enough people to put these things out, they become utterly uncontrollable. So we are going to be reimagining our landscapes, like it or not. And I'm hoping that we do it in an artistic and creative way, a landscape design way, because of the anger, which will go with the destruction and the loss of life, people will break out the chainsaws and the bulldozers and we will have great big raw firebreaks and there will be a real horrible ecological apartheid.</p><p>And of course what I'm really saying in the end, if you pull it down to the bare essentials, is that we are becoming more like Aborigines, we are going to be using fire in a more creative way to create a habitat that works for us, exactly what Aboriginal people did. Aboriginal people created these amazing landscapes which were biodiverse, productive in terms of food, but also safe.</p><p>When the Europeans turned up, they weren't running on the beach saying 'get us out of here, this is a dangerous place', they were completely comfortable about living in one of the most flammable environments on Earth because they had mastered it, they had worked out how to make a peace with fire, they were accommodating this ecological force, and that's what I think is really a mind shift, that it's not something that we can take fire away, it's actually learning to live with fire in an ecological way with some reciprocities and some give and take.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> The ever provocative David Bowman at the Royal Society in London. He is professor at the University of Tasmania in Hobart.</p><p>Finally on fire, a device being perfected at the department of engineering, Edith Cowen University in Perth.</p><p>I'm looking at something that could come out of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Doctor Who</emphasis>. It's got a plate of silicon chips, it looks like, solar sensitive cells in the middle, and four arms coming up, almost like tentacles. What is it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> This model we have chemical sensors and also infrared sensors, and also we have a solar panel to make it energy efficient. And inside the box we have microcontroller-based communication systems. It uses radio waves for communicating to other nodes or to the gateway.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And it's looking to see whether there is a fire in the vicinity. What is it picking up from the fire? The chemicals or what?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> Yes, if there is a fire certainly there will be some chemicals which will go up. So once it crosses the threshold, the system detects this and then it generates an alarm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I imagine you've put this somewhere in the bush or somewhere near a farm, and then when it detects something it sends you a signal. How?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> It uses radio frequency. So it can talk to another node or it can talk to the gateway and the gateway can upload the data to the cloud or it can send a text message to a mobile phone or any web server.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So having detected the fire it sends you the message that somewhere in Western Australia you've got a fire beginning. What do you do about that next?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> Let's say if you are in a farmland and it's unoccupied, if there is an alarm then you know what's happening at your property so you can take actions. We also can feed this device with other automated systems which can turn on the sprinklers...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Just like in the household.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> That's correct, so it has enormous potential.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And what's its range? If it's out there in the bush, of course the bush is pretty big, especially in Western Australia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> Well, the radio range is quite large. We have tested in bushland and it can cover easily up to 1.5 kilometres. And if it is line of sight, that means there is no bush or no tree around, it can cover up to 10 kilometres.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And if you're making lots of these, they cost about $100, so fairly cheap?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> That's correct. So if we go for large-scale manufacturing the cost can be brought below $100 each.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Where do you imagine these might be put out, in what kind of terrain?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> Well, at this stage we are thinking that they can be put in areas like for critical infrastructure or close to the suburbs so that if there is a fire, so all the people in that neighbourhood get a text SMS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Where the town is beginning to turn into countryside or somewhere where you've got a very valuable facility that needs protection.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> That's correct. Given that Australia is very large, if we tried to cover every inch of bushland, that would be very expensive. So initially we are looking at putting them in areas of interest where we have critical infrastructure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I suppose it would be suitable for places like California as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iftekhar Ahmad:</emphasis> Well, absolutely, that would be the next stage of our enterprise. There is certainly some interest around. We are currently negotiating with them on how to commercialise it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Iftekhar Ahmad is senior lecturer in the department of engineering, Edith Cowan University in Perth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> on RN.</p><p>And this week the Science Unit said goodbye to Judy Lawson who worked with us for over 30 years behind the scenes. She died on Sunday last.</p><p>Our PhD talk this week is from Noushin Nasiri at the ANU in Canberra, and it's dedicated to Judy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Noushin Nasiri:</emphasis> Last year a friend of mine passed away from lung cancer. She went through four rounds of chemotherapy but without success. It was too late for her, too late. If it had been detected at stage 1, the chance of survival would have been more than 75%. But at stage 4, her chance was only 6%. It's not only my friend. Do you know how many people in Australia died this year from lung cancer? Just lung cancer? 9,000 Australians, just in 2015.</p><p>But what if you could detect the disease at a very early stage when the chance of recovery is much higher? In my PhD I am doing this by looking at your breath. It might seem invisible but your breath tells a story. Your breath is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and only 1% of other gases. That 1% includes thousands of organic compounds which can help me to detect diseases such as diabetes, breast cancer, kidney failure and lung cancer.</p><p>But there is one big challenge here; concentration. The biomarkers concentration difference between healthy people and patients is only parts per billion. How small is that? It's like finding one drop of blood in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Is it really detectable? Yes. Dogs and bees have the ability to detect parts per trillion, 1,000 times less concentrated. Now the question is how we can make something that is sufficiently sensitive to detect this tiny concentration. The answer involves a fingertip-sized sensor made by billions of the nanoparticles, each of them has a diameter of a few atoms, 1,000 times smaller than the tip of your hair.</p><p>If you blow into my sensor it can detect any tiny possibility of having a disease in your body. It's 100 times more accurate than what we need and it's small enough to fit in your phone and help you to keep your health in check every day. My research into creating this technology can empower us with more knowledge about our health, our body and can help us to save many, many lives in the near future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> She is really determined, isn't she? Noushin is here from Iran, trying to save lives, Noushin Nasiri at the ANU in Canberra.</p><p>This year, Greece has meant politics and debts and international confrontation. But 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, Greece meant the foundation of our thinking in philosophy and science, and the flowering of everything from theatre to great architecture. But why? Why there, why then? One of my books of the year is titled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Introducing the Ancient Greeks</emphasis>, and it's by Edith Hall, professor of classics at King's College in London.</p><p>My first question is why did it happen in ancient Greece? Okay, lots of other people created stuff, as you say in the intro to the book, but really the flowering of both philosophy and natural history and God knows what else was down there, what, 2,000, 3,000 years ago. How come there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> The ancient Greeks were the most diaspora people of antiquity by far. They really lived more than 25 miles from the sea, so they lined the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea worlds. There were two major results of this. One was they developed seafaring and everything that has to do with seafaring, like navigation and carpentry and woodwork and understanding of the winds and the natural elements better than anybody else did, including the Venetians who were their great seafaring rivals. But most importantly they were in contact with far more other ethnic groups than anybody else in antiquity. They had to talk to them wherever they went, they intermarried wherever they went, and they appropriated and adapted ideas from every single other ancient culture. So they are the consummation of the combined wisdom of the entire late Bronze Age world of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And if you look at the map you can see all these islands, and if you look at the terrain it's very mountainous, so that you are kind of separated. You could have a city-state but it can't be huge, and so you had a big enough to foment these ideas but to get difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> Well, I actually think that the very scattered nature of the ancient Greeks, the difficulty they had actually meeting each other physically by land was what drove them to develop a much stronger ethnic identity, and that was glued together wherever they went through their language. They did not lose their language, which was amazing if you actually think how far they spread. So they also met together at international festivals like the ancient Olympic Games and the ancient games at Delphi. They had annual games like that. And they all came to it, they were usually in the summer because that was when they could sail.</p><p>So they kept this very, very strong identity, but they were facing completely different types of environment and physical challenge depending on whether they are colonising the Ukrainian coast, which meant all kinds of different things, they couldn't even grow vines there, or whether they had gone to Libya and they were actually living cheek by jowl and intermarrying with desert nomads. So they had to be far more inventive then everybody else. Necessity is the mother of invention. I also think that they were rather sceptical about traditional religion, while loving everything that went with ritual, I don't think they were particularly spiritual people. So I think that their inclination to try and find out the natural causes of things was actually inherit in their national character.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So they had plenty of gods but the gods were there for a bit of a laugh, a bit of a story.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> Well, I think 'a bit of a laugh' is a little bit harsh, but they never had a sense of the authoritative god kings that you get in ancient Persia, ancient Egypt, ancient Assyria, Babylon, this idea of feudal structure with an eternal powerful god king on top who can never be questioned or challenged. I think that was one aspect that was actually part of their theology, that even their gods like their top gods...Zeus had actually kicked out his dad who had kicked out his dad, there wasn't this idea of a one permanent eternal God, there was always a chance to get in and have a coup.</p><p>But more importantly I think they were very, very poor. As you said, they could never actually make...because of the terrain in the mountains and they didn't have good pasture, they didn't develop very rich city-states, at least until after Alexander the Great's conquests. So they were driven on by poverty and famine. They were often very, very hungry. People who are hungry are not politically tolerant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And indeed you say, and this is interesting, they are egalitarian, so you are open to your neighbour's ideas rather than just being full of your own.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> I think they are inherently egalitarian actually amongst their own communities, I think that's to do partly with being a colonising people, that they are not staying at home and building up feudal structures. It's a bit like everybody turning up in Australia or New Zealand or Canada who are not in general likely to erect the class structures that they had left behind in Europe. I do think that is part of the colonial mentality, it breeds an egalitarian spirit. Women tend to have more power and be more equal in those kinds of communities. They've got to be, it's all hands to the pump.</p><p>But I also think they were extremely open to other ethnic groups. The very fact that they had no idea of biological racism...they despised people who couldn't speak Greek and read philosophy but they didn't have biological racism, and they always intermarried with the local women. A typical colonising group is younger brothers with nothing to inherit, nothing to stay for in their own local village in Greece except hunger, so they go off, found a new colony, get a woman in Libya or the Ukraine, have mixed race children but they all learn Greek. And that is the typical profile, and that tended to breed actual democratic constitutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, you mentioned Alexander, of course his tutor was Aristotle. Aristotle wrote so much, unbelievable amounts, some of it...well, frankly unacceptable in modern scientific terms. A lot of it a very interesting. But did he go out like Archimedes, did he go out like Galen, for that matter, who was very practical, and experiment or investigate, or did he sit on a hillside in a toga and make it up?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> Now, Aristotle is crucial, it doesn't matter if some of his hypotheses have been disproven because he invented the idea of the hypothesis. So he invented a science that is based on an idea that you postulate and then open up the challenge to other people to disprove it. That is science. Science is not facts, it's a series of hypotheses waiting to be disproven. He theorised that, and nobody had theorised that before. He actually thought through the practice.</p><p>But what I think is most interesting about Aristotle is that his actual travels...he's brought up in northern Greece as a doctor's son, which means that he learned far more about...first descriptions of the physical bodies are all in the early Hippocratic doctors, and he learned a lot about botany if your father is a doctor because most of the cures were from plants. So he's brought up there.</p><p>Then he sent off to the academy in Athens to learn what we would call cerebral philosophy at the feet of Plato no less, spent 20 years with Plato learning how to argue. Then he goes off to Lesbos, the island of Lesbos, and Issos, which is just opposite on what is now the Turkish coast, and for three years did nothing but write about all the fauna that he found. And he did that in conjunction with his best friend, also a student at the academy called Theophrastus who at the same time invented botany.</p><p>And you can tell from the descriptions of all the marine life in Aristotle's generation of animals and parts of animals and history of animals, that he is actually dissecting sea creatures all the time. So it's absolutely grounded in empirical description and analysis, and it was only when he'd got a very large amount of data did he started to draw inferences of a more general client about how biological living organisms work.</p><p>So this is a man who combines intense theoretical training and argumentation with practice on the ground. He for example invented statistical analysis. We know this because he actually wrote down things he found out about a number of volcanoes, would you believe. It's volcanoes through which he invented statistical analysis. And you could never have had Ptolemy a couple of generations later doing all that empirical data on stars and eclipses, which is absolutely the foundation of all modern astronomy, even now. Even Newton and Copernicus still had to read Ptolemy, they really did. They wouldn't have done that, he couldn't have done that without Aristotle and in the 4th century BC. He invented empirical science.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, impressive. We'll come to Ptolemy and a couple of the others in a minute. But one thing that puzzled me about Aristotle is that when he was writing about the meaning of life and the pursuit of it was supposed to be that made it real, he talked about you're supposed to attain happiness, meanwhile his student Alexander the Great was...talk about rape and pillage and torture in the most heartless away. We haven't actually mentioned that an awful lot of slaves where there amongst the egalitarian Greeks as well. But there is this disjunction between what you did in terms of happiness and well-being and friendliness, and on the other hand this cruelty that was so clear and apparent, all the way to Afghanistan Alexander went.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> It's very difficult trying to accommodate some of the clear virtues of ancient Greek ethics with how the ancient Greeks themselves often behaved. They do seem to have been able to draw this extraordinary binary distinction between the free human and the slave human, which is very baffling to us, though actually as someone born when there was still apartheid in South Africa it shouldn't be so baffling. We've seen people able to convince themselves that whole groups of people are completely inferior to others in our lifetimes. But they did, and I think that this was actually a necessary though lamentable spinoff of the economic system. The sheer amount of labour required to build those cities, maintain them and so on meant that you had to have I think about nine out of ten people bound to work.</p><p>And Aristotle is very clear that there's going to be a leisured class that can think and can devote its entire time to cerebral activity but it can only be supported by captive labour. And this is extremely depressing though, again, I actually think if you look in the Industrial Revolution in Britain, if you read Charles Dickens you find that a similar proportion, nine out of ten people are working 14 hours a day down the mines or in the factories. They may not actually be in a legal sense slaves, but to all intents and purposes they don't have any leisure or education. So I think it's quite easy to see the Greeks and the Romans as exceptional from that point of view. I don't think they were, I think they were like everybody until about 1914.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Indeed. The thing I found most disheartening about some of the slaves was they couldn't become too fit because if they were fit and looked as if they might become some sort of threat they killed them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> Well, in Sparta they did, they certainly did in Sparta. But having said that, Aristotle is very clear that Greeks shouldn't enslave other Greeks. He thinks that anybody who is educated enough to be a free living person in a Greek city-state, and that includes the women and children, has already rendered themselves unsuitable for slavery, they are already too superior for slavery if they know Greek. So Aristotle says to Alexander quite clearly, this is reflected in his book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Politics</emphasis>; go conquer East, go get the slaves, they will then allow the Greeks to become the freest, greatest, most intelligent people who ever lived. Which is pretty much what happened.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> We mentioned Ptolemy, the thing that is slightly confusing, there were so many Ptolemys, king after king, and a different Ptolemy who was actually an astronomer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> Claudius Ptolemy, let's call him Claudius Ptolemy, Claudius Ptolemy wrote an awful lot of treatises in which he included all his observations of the natural movements of the stars, the planets, the satellites, comets, all that kind of thing, which he wrote down for 35 years which allowed him to predict things like eclipses which convinced everybody he was actually right and not some kind of magician, that he'd done this by scientific prediction.</p><p>So he's an Egyptian Greek, he's almost certainly got Egyptian blood, living in Alexandria where Ptolemy I, who was Alexander the Great's best lieutenant, who'd the minute Alexander the Great died went and grabbed Egypt and said, 'This is my fiefdom, I'm going to stay here.' And he founded a seven-generation dynasty of Ptolemys, the last of whom was Cleopatra. So that went on for several hundred years. But his great achievement was to build the library of Alexandria.</p><p>The library of Alexandria changed everything about intellectual life in antiquity. It shifted everything in terms of science and literature from Athens to Alexandria. It's like people colonising America and then building Harvard or something and buying in the greatest minds from Oxford and Cambridge and Paris and Berlin. So he sets up this great library, and two or three generations later along comes Ptolemy and he is able to build on pre-existing astronomical works, including by Aristotle, but many, and Babylonian wisdom because the Babylonians had had their own way of recording movements of the stars, and ancient Egyptian text, and then sit down and crucially do his own empirical data gathering. And it's that wonderful combination of inherited hypotheses which are then tested against heavyweight hard-core collections of data amassed over many, many years allowed him to disapprove previous hypotheses and set his own in place. And he managed to predict the circumference of the world to within a few hundred metres apparently. So he was the real genius when it comes to understanding the nature of cosmology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Such a list of names. I want to talk about Galen because Galen wrote so much and demonstrated so much, and if you had any doubts about his anatomy he would take a monkey or something and open its chest and perform...not simply demonstrate the organs inside but sever the veins or the arteries and then stitch them up. It was most extraordinary. Well, he was a workaholic and he did this so much, his reputation became celebrated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> Absolutely. Galen is from north-western Turkey from Pergamon which actually...under the Roman Empire, this is, this is the second century AD, so he stands at the head of 1,000 years of Greek medical practice. And we know that he is brought up in North West Asia Minor, Turkey, Anatolia. Hates his mother. Clearly rather a disturbed family but they are fantastically rich.</p><p>So his father packs him off too, guess where, Alexandria, where he reads every medical book in the library. He is just voracious, he is unstoppable. Yes, he is a workaholic, he seems to have never had any kind of private life. And he knew that he could turn medicine into an art as well as a science and actually a form of entertainment. He did put on medical shows. We hear about these in the 19th century, you had quack doctors who toured with tents and used to do miraculous operations and so on. Well, Galen certainly did do that but he clearly had a diagnostic talent that was really remarkable. And so he was able to both as a very good doctor have an almost supernatural instinct for what was wrong with people, maybe a lot of psychology, but then he had got all that intellectual equipment from all those books he had read.</p><p>He also, back at home...he went back to Pergamon for a while, and he had a very good job if you were a doctor which was looking after the royal gladiators of the local bigwig, the local petty king under the Roman Empire. So he got guys with really interesting injuries and indeed corpses all the time, and then he treated them. So if you've got a very regular supply of extremely badly damaged, strong humans, you're going to learn an awful lot very quickly about how bodies work. And indeed training them, regimens for good health. So he took all that lore off to Rome where he became the greatest celebrity.</p><p>What baffles me is how he had the time to write all this down because he actually...if you add up all the things we've got in pagan ancient Greek, which is I would say 1,000 volumes perhaps we've got of ancient Greek pagan texts, half of them are by this one man Galen. He wanted to write it all down.</p><p>He was then translated into Arabic as well as into modern European languages and had a huge impact on Arabic medicine as well as on Western medicine, and very many of his techniques actually are still in one form or another in use. He really was one who pioneered, for example, the pulse as a diagnostic test.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And did he really do a sort of open heart surgery, taking the sternum off and looking inside?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> Well, he tells us he did, so we have no particular reason to disbelieve it. We know that people were doing full cadaver biopsies by the 3rd century BC. He's quite a lot later than that. I fear that there was a large stock of criminal bodies from the amphitheatres, people who had been killed, to do so, but he was very good at using animals as well, which we would find upsetting, those of us who can't bear vivisection, but I don't suppose your average Roman would bat an eyelid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> No, but doing it on a human being who actually lived, unbelievable.</p><p>Hippocrates of course was the big daddy, we can't leave him out, and we know about the oath and we know about 'do no harm', but there is much, much more, isn't there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> There is. Hippocrates did exist. He was a Greek who lived, again, off the coast of Turkey. The islands around the southwest corner of Turkey, like Cos, are where we know there were actual medical schools. They grew out of temple cults of the medical gods like Apollo, who is the god of healing, and Asclepius, but at some point stopped being so religious, and the combined medical lore...you know, originally doctors were priests of Apollo or his son Asclepius, but they turned into real medical schools.</p><p>And if you read the early Hippocratic treaties, and there are some from as early as the 5th century BC, the use of nonreligious explanations for what's going on in the body is a clear and loud sign that rational science is going on. If you compare that with Egyptian medicine, for example, we've got Egyptian papyri from even earlier than that, they sometimes use very rational explanations for wounds healing up. What they never do is produce a rational explanation for an internal organic problem. That is always still a god doing something. The Hippocratic school just got beyond that. And actually the more I read of the early treatises, which include some on gynaecology...now, a lot of the ideas are completely batty about gynaecology, they had some very odd ideas...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Still are.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> No, but for example they thought that the uterus wasn't a muscle, it was more like a shell and the foetus had to peck its way out of the shell, and that was what caused the pain of labour, rather than the woman having the strongest muscle in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo sapiens</emphasis> and doing the pushing. They got lots wrong but the hypotheses were rational and based on inference. And because of that they developed very good treatments and they knew when to intervene and try and get the baby out, not by Caesarean but vaginally. They knew when a woman was in trouble, even if they had the wrong image for what was going wrong, and they knew how to get the baby out and we have these treatises, they are incredible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> What I also found incredible was that...we can't give every example because the book needs to be read, it's got wonderful stories in it, as you can imagine, and names...oh gosh, we can keep on mentioning the names, but atoms are there, the idea that there is a planetary solar system is there, rejection of the Earth-centred universe is there, the fact that they found most things way in advance is simply staggering, and the names continue. Has all this been forgotten? People don't necessarily study classics anymore as much as they used to. What would you like to see happen so we rediscover some of these wonderful things?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edith Hall:</emphasis> I would like to see some compulsory school education in ancient Mediterranean history, but cultural history, intellectual history, the 10 best ideas that the Greeks had. They had lots of bad ideas, like slavery, but they had got so many things right. And what frustrates me is that this is the biggest privilege, the biggest asset in a way that the world has got. These people had an incredibly advanced civilisation with philosophical thinking and scientific thinking of a sophistication that is still jaw-dropping compared with the average education of citizens even in advanced western countries. But they failed, they stopped, their whole system of ideas stopped. In about 391, Theodosius, the Christian emperor, shut down all the temples, the universities all got shut down soon after that, and it took 1,500 years before we had a Renaissance of these ideas.</p><p>So we have this parallel universe I see it as, not as long dead and gone, but people exactly like us who faced all the same challenges like us who got incredibly good ideas about very many things, and I think we agree today with them about an awful lot of things like, for example, recreational sex is okay, which we couldn't believe in until after Freud, and we don't consult them. Why wouldn't we talk to our ancestors who were so wise and who failed. No other culture in the world...I've read the ancient Chinese texts, I've read the ancient Indian texts, they all have a continuity rather than this actually incredibly fruitful rupture.</p><p>So in my own head whatever it is I'm doing I think, now, what would have Aristotle have said about that? Half the time I really disagree with him, especially when he's saying that women are inferior intellectually, but half the time I think you're absolutely right and that's how I should do it, or that's how we should put the question, and I would like to share that with every...I think about 16...you mustn't have them too young because they are quite intellectually advanced, but the pursuit of happiness is an incredibly good goal to have in life.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson had read Aristotle, but it is an Aristotelian conception that all humans have the right to pursue happiness and how should we best do that, and Aristotle's answer is through partnerships and communities, you cannot have it on your own, no man can be happy as an island. He is the first person to theorise all that. So that's just one example. But I would like to get my hands on every 16-year-old in the world actually for about 10 weeks, one hour, I could do it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> A book recommended by Jim Spigelman, chairman of the ABC, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Introducing the Ancient Greeks: From Bronze Age Seafarers to Navigators of the Western Mind</emphasis>, written by Edith Hall, professor of classics at King's College in London.

Rao, Asia forestry chief for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p><p>\"We have to put a stop to the destruction caused by human greed. We have done it in the case of wildlife. Now we must do it with trees.</p><p>\"We must get over to people that buying furniture made of these woods is just not on - that it must become as unacceptable as wearing coats made from the skins or fur of endangered animals.\"</p><p>Dr Rao's comments may sound alarmist, even ludicrous to those of us who bask in the praise dinner guests lavish on our rosewood dining suites. (Guilty, Your Honour, I bought one ridiculously cheaply in Hong Kong four years ago, then told two million Sun-Herald readers how they could do the same.)</p><p>Facing disaster</p><p>But Dr Rao is no ultra-militant greenie. Top UN bureaucrats are invariably cautious and conservative. That's how they keep their jobs.</p><p>Rather, his warning is based on chilling official figures about the destruction of Asia's great tropical forests.</p><p>Jungle and forest areas in some Asian countries have been more than halved in less than 30 years. Between 1976 and 1980, Asia's total closed forest area was slashed by nine million hectares to 333 million.</p><p>Even then facing disaster, many countries and pressure groups stepped up their efforts to save what was left.</p><p>But still the situation worsens. In 1980, experts predicted the annual deforestation rate would level off. In fact, it has increased.</p><p>Now, it is estimated that between 1985 and the turn of the century, Asia will lose another 30 million hectares - another 10 per cent of its forest cover. At that rate, within our children's lifetimes, the vast majority will be gone.</p><p>The worst destruction is taking place on Australia's doorstep.</p><p>Get-away elephants</p><p>Indonesia is losing 500,000ha a year, more than any other country in the region.</p><p>This has been caused largely by its policy of \"transmigration\", moving vast numbers of people from the overpopulated main island of Java to form jungle clearing settlements in densely forested Irian Jaya and Kalimantan.</p><p>In Thailand in 1960, more than half the country was swathed in jungle. Today the conservative figure is 29 per cent. Deforestation continues to gallop along at the rate of 400,000ha a year due in part to timber poachers using highly-trained get-away elephants to escape with the booty.</p><p>Malaysia is the world's leading tropical hardwood exporter, with timber bringing in foreign earnings of almost $3 billion a year.</p><p>Forest cover is being reduced by 230,000ha annually.</p><p>In India, where 150,000ha of forest are being lost every year, firewood is now so expensive that many poor Indians can no longer afford to cremate properly relatives' bodies according to Hindu tradition.</p><p>Consequently, only partially charred corpses are being thrown into the river and to combat the health hazard authorities are being forced to breed carnivorous turtles to devour what should have been burnt.</p><p>Communist Indochina has not escaped deforestation, either. Areas of Vietnam's jungle which survived Agent Orange and other American defoliants are now being chopped down at the rate of 65,000ha a year. Its ally, Laos, is losing forest at twice that rate.</p><p>The civil war in Burma is a major reason why 100,000ha of jungle is disappearing each year. Minority armies are partly funding their revolutions by log poaching.</p><p>Loss of forest cover is causing the notorious so-called \"greenhouse effect\", which is raising temperatures world-wide.</p><p>The situation is not all gloom. China has made great strides in tree planting. But last year a forest fire destroyed more than 600,000ha.</p><p>Most countries continue to increase their awareness of the deforestation dangers.</p><p>But many Asian nations are deeply impoverished and desperately need their share of the $11 billion a year tropical hardwood industry.</p><p>An 11th-hour rescue operation, says the UN's Dr Rao, must involve Australians and other wealthy westerners changing their taste in furniture. Instead of solid wood, buy furniture made of reconstituted wood such as particle board, veneered or laminated, he urges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Cartoon: by Coopes</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhluojhcgw16al3a7js</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1988</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7G-YFF0-TXN5-R2J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1988 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"1988\"><dateText>March 6, 1988 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FOOD &amp; AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000613</classCode><className>ENDANGERED SPECIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC303</classCode><className>HONG KONG, CHINA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC305</classCode><className>INDONESIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC313</classCode><className>THAILAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We survived, though it was hell, the death of Bambi's Mum. Never mind Psycho or Silence of the Lambs, the forest fire in Bambi was utterly terrifying, and we came through. We can take the tough stuff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But we like to be left with a few illusions to help us through the two-hanky bits. The news that there wasn't one Babe but more than 40 different porkers cumulatively assembling the lovable character of the wannabe sheepdog is tough to take. Babe was one of the few creatures left worthy of our trust and affection.</p><p>With a Federal election looming, we need something we can believe in, and Babe looked like it. Now, the porcine charmer turns out to be the animal world's Michael Jackson - an assemblage of lots of disparate bits stuck together. Why have we been told this? It's like the recipe for haggis. It's better not to know.</p><p>In the '70s I did a story in LA about the making of a Lassie movie. Same thing. They not only used 20 or so collies, but half of them were blokes. Why didn't I realise as a kid that those barks sounded a bit baritone for a sensitive and loving female?</p><p>The movie-makers said they weren't worried about the collie-gender issue. They fixed the shots in the editing so any inconvenient bits of gear wouldn't show. But what if they were careless? What if it were to dawn on juvenile movie audiences that Lassie was not necessarily one of the earliest champions of the women's movement, but a gender conglomerate, a freak?</p><p>I accused them of tampering, perhaps irreparably, with the psyches of generations the world over. They thought I was joking. One of the many troubles with Hollywood is that it's the homeland of the Wicked Witch, where magic is made artfully but heartlessly.</p><p>For all I know, the disparate Babes were blokes and sheilas. I'm determined not to know. Because George Miller, director Chris Noonan and the special effects people have done so brilliantly with Babe, because they've pushed people worldwide into the rent-a-kid business (\"Oh, we'll take little Nick and Nicola out for a treat. We'll go to see Babe\"), because they've even managed to get unaccompanied adults shamelessly drinking up their fable, I intend to be grand and forgive them for the composite.</p><p>I intend to see Babe twice, and for the second viewing manufacture a pedigree and provenance for the cuddly porker. Then a single pig will be snugly settled in the mind. I've taken expert advice on the matter.</p><p>Remember, the Babes were Aussie pigs. So since the movies are illusion, customers, too, can be illusionists. Let's decree there's one Babe, not 40, and go on from there.</p><p>As I understand it, the cognoscenti of the pig world incline to the view that Babe is (more accurately, are) at least principally a Large White, perhaps with a bit of Berkshire in the background. The Berkshire is black with a white face and four white feet. It was very popular a couple of decades ago, and even with modern genetic ideas and new breeds has remained a very strong influence.</p><p>One or two pig-fanciers, perhaps wishfully, have read into Babe's background a tiny bit of Tamworth (golden red), though it's hard to discern.</p><p>Both mixes with the Large White are said to produce a pig featuring lightly developed forequarters, a long body and welldeveloped hams. There are lots of us who would want these characteristics ourselves. Oh, and the mixes are said also to produce pigs with lots of personality.</p><p>And a sense of humour. Ridiculous? Pig people are adamant that your porker is a creature of character and charm, with dogs and cats running a distant second and third.</p><p>So, for our second viewing we abolish all thoughts of spare parts porcine assembly. Our invented single-pig Babe has bits of Berkshire and Tamworth because we say so, so there. Very multicultural.</p><p>But there is a flaw. One seminal line can be ruled out. You will be wondering, as I was, why the Babe producers didn't plump for a collection of at least a cross of Wessex Saddlebacks (black with a narrow white saddle over the top of the shoulder and down each front leg). You'll be wondering this because the Wessex Saddleback is the only major lop-eared breed and if Babe could have been made any cuter, lop-ears might have done it. Ah, well, maybe in the sequel.</p><p>Also, maybe in the sequel there can be some sort of resurrection of the lost breeds, the superbly named Gloucester Old Spot, Poland China and Duroc Jersey, which fell from favour with Australian breeders decades ago.

Whatever our problems we have to remain quiet and get together.</p><p>\"When you start saying this and that it makes it very difficult for the team. It should be a unified thing. You do what you have to do and move on.\" Richardson spelt out his deeply held belief that the game is bigger than individual players and deserves respect.</p><p>\"Cricket will always be here,\" he said. \"We have just got to play it hard, enjoy it and move on. The players move on but the game will always be here.\" Richardson, who spent almost a year out of international cricket with chronic fatigue problems and who appears a slightly more fragile character since his return, can empathise with the stress which has engulfed Lara.</p><p>Lara has been quoted as saying \"cricket is ruining my life\" which is an extraordinary statement about a game which has given him three cars, one of the best homes in Trinidad and more than $3 million in career earnings in a land where many residents cannot afford a meal.</p><p>\"It can be really tough,\" Richardson said. \"People expect you to do well and you don't have much time to focus on what you have got to do.</p><p>\"Sometimes you just want to be in your room but everyone wants you to do this or do that. Everyone wants a piece of you.</p><p>\"It gets on top of you after a while. It is unfortunate that Brian is going through that at the moment. It's life. But there are ways of dealing with it. Sometimes you just have to cut yourself off from people.\" The West Indies face Sri Lanka at the Adelaide Oval today in what is something of a face-saving exercise after this week's humiliation by Rod Marsh's Australian Institute of Sport squad who skittled the tourists for a shameful 92.</p><p>Richardson is adamant his side has the talent to snap the chains of internal dissent and again be a winning unit.</p><p>But the side the West Indies have brought to Australia looks as vulnerable as any Caribbean touring outfit for two decades.</p><p>\"People were very disappointed at home but we have done our country proud,\" Richardson said. \"There will be times when things do not go so well but we are just having a lull at the moment. With hard work we will be back where we were 10 years ago. We have won before and we can win again.</p><p>\"One of our problems is back home people are asking things in the press all the time. I can't afford to think about what is happening because I can't change it. The most important thing to think about is doing well in the World Series.\" West Indian coach Andy Roberts laments that the font that once produced so many great players is starting to dry up due to the ever-present influence of basketball on West Indian culture.</p><p>\"The game has changed,\" Roberts said. \"The young people today are different to when I was growing up. Basketball is on the television every day _ cricket is not. Our youngsters watch basketball every night.\" Richardson agreed, saying that West Indian children found it easier to afford basketball because all it required was a pair of shoes compared to the more extensive garb needed for cricket.</p><p>When asked whether any youth development program had been floated in the West Indies, Roberts said: \"It has been talked about for a long time but I don't think anything is under construction as yet. We are hoping that in a year or so we can start moving in that direction. But our cricket has never been built on that.</p><p>\"It has been built on kids growing up and picking up a bat and starting to play. The love for the game was there in the 60s, 70s and early 80s. I don't know if that love of the game is there now.\" WEST INDIES: Stuart Williams, Sherwin Campbell, Phil Simmons, Carl Hooper, Richie Richardson, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Roger Harper, Courtney Browne, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Ian Bishop.</p><p>SRI LANKA: Roshan Mahanama, Chandika Hathurusingha, Asanka Gurusinghe, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga, Hashan Tillakaratne, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Kumara Dharmasena, Chaminda Vaas, Pramodya Wickramasinghe, Muttiah Muralidharan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Richie Richardson faces up to the media at Adelaide airport yesterday.The West Indies captain leads a touring party which looks asvulnerable as any from the Caribbean in the past two decades.ELECTRONIC LIBRARYNEWS</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOBARTMERCURYLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49NV-BKY0-01S8-C414-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"832\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>December 15, 1995 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>WEST INDIES METAL PRODUCTS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES GLASS CO LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES OIL CO LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES NUTRITIONAL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES CANDY CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES SYNTHETICS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES PULP &amp; PAPER LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES PUBLISHING LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000428</classCode><className>CRICKET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX018</classCode><className>ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC562</classCode><className>TRINIDAD &amp; TOBAGO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The temperature was already 32C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In all her 60 years on NSW's scenic south coast, packed with summer holiday-makers, she had never seen the bush so dry, the wind so blistering or the heat as intense as it was on Tuesday morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">``It just felt like a disaster waiting to happen,'' she tells Inquirer. ``I thought, `This is a totally unknown quantity. We're in for it today.' ''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sense of foreboding was widely shared. Australia had been roasting for days and now it was burning, from the bottom up.</p><p>On Tasmania's Tasman Peninsula, the hamlets of Dunalley and Boomer Bay lay in blackened ruins after being engulfed by wildfires that destroyed 126 homes.</p><p>People were preparing to flee the town of Drik Drik in southwest Victoria as firefighters in that state struggled to keep a lid on the growing emergency. Most of South Australia was under fire bans.</p><p>And in Queensland's thickly populated southeast corner, emergency services went on high alert to cope with the extreme conditions coming their way.</p><p>Something had to give, and with Sydney forecast to bake in 40C+ temperatures, the area of maximum vulnerability was southeastern NSW in general and the Shoalhaven in particular.</p><p>Yet here we are at the end of this week of high anxiety and drama, after NSW faced what Premier Barry O'Farrell described as its worst day of bushfire danger on record and most of the nation sweltered in record heat, and not a single life has been lost to the flames. Not anywhere. There is a lot of summer to come -- but so far, so good.</p><p>Sussex Inlet, the waterfront town in the Shoalhaven most threatened, is still standing, though it was touch and go for a while on Tuesday.</p><p>By 2pm, the mercury had hit 43C and the fire burning in the nearby Jerrawangala State Forest was out of control. Fanned by the fierce winds, it jumped the Princess Highway.</p><p>Gash, the 68-year-old local mayor and outgoing federal Liberal MP, thought the conditions were worse than those of January 2, 2002, when a dozen homes were lost in Sussex Inlet.</p><p>``It was just so hot, and the winds were so strong,'' she says.</p><p>Then the southerly change arrived earlier than forecast. It may be that this was the piece of luck that spared Sussex Inlet, just as lives were unquestionably saved on the Tasman Peninsula by the proximity of the devastated communities to the sea, providing those caught by the fires with a last-minute way out that was not open to the 173 Victorians who perished on February 7, 2009.</p><p>Yet could it be, as Gash argues, that there is more to it than that. She says state and local authorities in the Shoalhaven absorbed the lessons of 2002, of the Canberra bushfires a year later, of Black Saturday and the royal commission it spawned, and put a plan into effect that made a decisive difference.</p><p>``People were very much on the ball, which has not happened before,'' she says. ``The temptation, I suppose, is for people to go, `Oh, this is overkill'. But I don't believe in that. I think our preparedness, how the fire and emergency services worked with the community, was the key factor on the day. And I would rather be accused of overkill than of killing someone.''</p><p>FOR now, the only casualty at Sussex Inlet is a single, burned-out packing shed in an orchard well outside the town precinct. Far more remarkable was the absence of deaths or even a case of serious injury in the firestorm that engulfed the Tasman Peninsula late last week. But as the NSW Rural Fire Service's commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons noted drily: ``We're not out of the woods yet.'' Temperatures are rising again, with Brisbane heading for the mid-30s today, Sydney forecast to top 39C and Canberra facing 37C, and there is no end in sight to the continent-wide heatwave at the seat of the emergency.</p><p>Bushfire management is an intensely complicated business. The priorities often compete. The interests of a fire service in reducing vegetative fuel loads don't necessarily accord with those of a national parks or state forestry agency managing public land.</p><p>On private property, the long-recognised need to establish cleared buffers between homes and forests in fire-prone areas was also a key recommendation of the royal commission into Black Saturday, but experts say the implementation is patchy at best.</p><p>Compounding this is what the Stretton inquiry into Victoria's 1939 Black Friday disaster described as the ``hand of man'' that helped kill 71: more people living in areas more vulnerable to bushfire, with more opportunity for conflagrations to erupt.</p><p>Then there is climate change. If the scientific modelling is borne out, hotter, drier summers in southern Australia will increase the general risk of bushfire and frequency of the catastrophic conditions that attended Black Saturday nearly four years ago.</p><p>Still, the choice for people caught in the path of bushfire remains primordial in essence: fight or flight. Prior to 2009, the policy was officially termed, in Victoria at least, as ``Prepare, stay and defend or leave early''. ``Stay or go'' was much catchier, and caught on.</p><p>While the Black Saturday royal commission found the central tenets of the policy remained sound, this week demonstrated the notion that anyone could or should defend property against a direct hit from bushfire in extreme conditions had been abandoned by fire services.</p><p>``We don't even refer to `stay or go','' says Stuart Ellis, a former chief executive of the Country Fire Service in South Australia who now heads the peak Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council. ``The focus is very much on the primacy of life and having that as the fundamental message. Clearly the easiest and most guaranteed approach is not to be there in the first place.''</p><p>Fitzsimmons made no bones about what he thought people should do in the lead-up to Tuesday in the NSW danger zone. ``Leaving early under catastrophic conditions is your safest option,'' he said.</p><p>Philip Gibbons, a land management expert with the Australian National University, was struck by the shift in emphasis. ``The conventional wisdom used to be that you had a good chance of saving your property if you stayed and defended -- provided you were prepared and up to doing it,'' he tells Inquirer.</p><p>``Black Saturday was a game changer in that area and the message has now softened somewhat. It is far more cautionary.''</p><p>As Gibbons points out, the 2009 fires outside Melbourne set a grim new benchmark not only in terms of the death toll: 2133 houses were destroyed on Black Saturday, representing the highest ratio of fatalities to homes lost in a bushfire disaster, he says.</p><p>John Handmer, a disaster expert with RMIT University, analysed how ``stay or go'' played out. More than two thirds of the victims died in or immediately outside their homes, he found in research for the Victorian bushfires royal commission.</p><p>In a paper last year, Handmer and the University of Melbourne's Saffron O'Neill reported that at least 44 per cent of those who died on Black Saturday had limited physical capacity to fight a fire: they were too young or too old -- aged under 12 or over 70 -- or were disabled, ill or affected by alcohol.</p><p>Handmer says the disaster brutally exposed how the emergency services and the people they were supposed to protect were, in the main, ``ill adapted'' to such complex and fast-moving circumstances. The historic certainty that homes could be defended from a ``normal'' fire melted away when the conflagration tipped over into extreme or catastrophic levels. Less than half of the Black Saturday victims had a clear fire plan -- even though this was central to the ``stay or go'' ethos.</p><p>Fire plans that did exist were of ``variable'' quality. Some contained a fatal flaw, such as directing household members to shelter in a bathroom, from which there was no escape, and most had no back-up option if the preferred plan of action fell through. ``Agency decision-making on the day did not adapt to deal with the changed risk,'' he concludes in his study with O'Neill.</p><p>Handmer says the Tasmania Fire Service, in particular, took those lessons on board and maybe -- just maybe -- it worked on the Tasman Peninsula. ``The change means that when conditions are exceptionally severe, as they were when the big fires occurred that destroyed Dunalley (on the Tasman Peninsula), the fire service would . . . just focus on people's lives and key assets, because in the past there would have been a big rush to extinguish the fire, which is impossible in those conditions,'' he explains.</p><p>``This is a system that is only just coming in and I think it's too early to assess it. But I guess you could argue that it has had some success . . . so maybe we are seeing an early pay-off. I'd like to think so.''</p><p>In the Shoalhaven, ``we let the fire come to us'', Gash says. All available tankers and crews -- about 300-strong, mainly volunteers from the NSW Rural Fire Service -- were deployed in defensive positions to protect Sussex Inlet and vulnerable properties.</p><p>National parks were cleared 24 hours in advance. As in Tasmania, one of the main concerns was the number of tourists in the red zone, and Gash estimates there would have been more than 300,000 holidaying in the NSW south coast district, on top of its 100,000-odd residents.</p><p>Anyone foolish enough to question the order to leave a campsite or vulnerable area was brusquely told they would be marched out if they did not go voluntarily.</p><p>In Sussex Inlet, evacuation centres were set up at the local RSL and the bowling club. As the hour of reckoning approached on Tuesday, more than 600 people sought refuge. Text alerts were sent to those still in the danger area.</p><p>By now, the message from the fire service had shifted. For people in the immediate path of the fire, it was too late to leave. Come what may, they would be safer in their homes than on the road, fire chief Fitzsimmons said.</p><p>Ellis says it's a good example of how fire services have altered their approach. ``They are now in the business of providing information and warnings as well as emergency response,'' he says.</p><p>``The mantra here is putting out the information is as important as putting out the fire. The emphasis on the day may be as much as</p><p>Continued on Page 12</p><p>Continued from Page 11</p><p>50 per cent on the information and 50 per cent on the operational response.</p><p>Gary Morgan, chief executive of the Bushfire Co-operative Research Centre, points out that people don't always respond to bushfire warnings as intended. Ahead of Black Saturday, there was no lack of information about the gravity of the threat. Then Victorian premier John Brumby employed language that was echoed by O'Farrell this week, in speaking of the state entering ``uncharted territory''.</p><p>Yet, in all too many cases, the message didn't sink in.</p><p>ELLIS wonders whether a degree of bushfire fatigue will set in with the public as the heat and the alerts continue to come.</p><p>The messaging this week was clear, effective and worked particularly well in NSW, he says. But ``if that was to occur next week and the week after and in February, are we going to get the same response from the communities? I guess that's quite a challenging question that is really unanswered.''</p><p>NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Bob Rogers says Black Saturday hammered home the need for agencies to be more direct in their language. The adoption of the new warning of ``catastrophic'' to denote Black Saturday-like conditions is a case in point. This adds a new, unambiguously ominous dimension to the threat level based on the Forest Fire Danger Index, which was introduced on a scale of 1-100 to rate fire risks such as heat, humidity and wind.</p><p>The conditions on Black Saturday were off the chart, up to 190 points under the FFDI. Like the weather bureau, which has increased the scope of its temperature tables to accommodate 50C+ heat, the bushfire warning system has been adjusted, with the catastrophic level kicking in at 150 points. Roughly, that would generally involve heat of more than 40C, single-digit humidity and winds gusting well above 35km/h, Ellis says. Tellingly, however, a fire risk rated as extreme -- that is, 50 points or above -- is the point at which the services now acknowledge that any outbreak may be beyond their control.</p><p>Andrew Sullivan, team leader of the CSIRO's Bushfire Dynamics and Applications Group, says the window of opportunity to contain a blaze is brutally tight in catastrophic conditions -- as little as 15 minutes for a grassfire and two hours in the forest.</p><p>Encouragingly, his research suggests the fire services are getting better at their job, partly because they are more realistic about what can be done.</p><p>Another weapon is prescribed burning to reduce fuel loads.

Richardson is an eternal diplomat but even his placid nature is being strained by the forest fire of controversy raging at home in the West Indies following Brian Lara's withdrawal from the tour of Australia. The West Indies today face Sri Lanka in the World Series opener at Adelaide Oval in what is something of a face-saving exercise after this week's humiliation by Rod Marsh's cricket academy squad who skittled the tourists for a shameful 92. But seeing will be believing. The side the West Indies have brought to Australia looks as vulnerable as any Caribbean touring outfit for two decades. Tension between the West Indies and local media heightened yesterday when team management ordered a security guard not to admit media inside the Adelaide Oval nets when the players were practising. Television crews were forced to film from above a fence behind the nets. The West Indian hierarchy is chronically embarrassed by the leaking of tour reports from England revealing that Richardson described Lara as \"egotistical\" and feared Lara wanted his job as captain. The report said Richardson was \"left in shock\" at the way Lara had treated respected manager Wes Hall, an icon of West Indian cricket. A board meeting in the West Indies today will discuss Lara's future. \"I've not been reading the papers but have heard Brian and the Board have been making statements,\" Richardson said yesterday.</p><p>\"All these comments are being made and I don't think it is really good. Whatever our problems we have to remain quiet and get together. \"When you start saying this and that it makes it very difficult for the team. It should be a unified thing. You do what you have to do and move on.\" Richardson spelt out his deeply held belief that the game is bigger than individual players and deserves full respect. \"Cricket will always be here. We have just got to play it hard, enjoy it and move on,\" he said. \"The players move on but the game will always be here.\" Richardson, who spent almost a year out of international cricket with chronic fatigue problems and who appears a slightly more fragile character since his return, can empathise with the stress which has engulfed Lara. Lara has been quoted as saying \"cricket is ruining my life\" which is an extraordinary statement about a game which has given him three cars, one of the best homes in Trinidad and more than $3 million in career earnings in a land where many residents cannot afford a meal. \"It can be really tough,\" Richardson said. \"People expect you to do well and you don't have much time to focus on what you have got to do. Sometimes you just want to be in your room but everyone wants you to do this or do that. Everyone wants a piece of you. \"It gets on top of you after a while. It is unfortunate that Brian is going through that at the moment. It's life. But there are ways of dealing with it. Sometimes you just have to cut yourself off from people.\" Richardson is adamant his side has the talent to snap the chains of internal dissent and again be a winning unit. \"People are very disappointed at home but we have done our country proud,\" Richardson said. \"There will be times when things do not go so well but we are just having a lull at the moment. With hard work we will be back where we were 10 years ago. \"We have won before and we can win again. \"One of our problems is that back home people are asking things in the press all the time. \"I can't afford to think about what is happening because I can't change it. The most important thing to think about is doing well in the World Series.\" West Indies coach Andy Roberts laments that the font that once produced so many great players is starting to dry up due to the ever-present influence of basketball on West Indian culture. \"The game has changed,\" Roberts said. \"The young people today are different to when I was growing up. Basketball is on the television every day cricket is not. Our youngsters watch basketball every night.\" Richardson agreed, saying that West Indian children found it easier to afford basketball because all it required was a pair of shoes compared with the more extensive garb needed for cricket. When asked whether any youth development program had been floated in the West Indies, Roberts said: \"It has been talked about for a long time but I don't think anything is under construction as yet. \"We are hoping that in a year or so we can start moving in that direction. But our cricket has never been built on that. \"It's been built on kids growing up and picking up a bat and starting to play. \"The love for the game was there in the '60s, '70s and early '80s. I don't know if that love of the game is there now. \"People forget we have lost four great players all at one time Viv Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon and Malcolm Marshall. It's difficult to lose them because we have never had replacements for them.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>2 photos (color): carl hooper, roland holder, richierichardson; robert craddock; photo: viv richards; WINDIES WOES \u2026 Subdued West Indian trio Carl Hooper,Roland Holder and captain Richie Richardson at practiceyesterday.; Titus, Ray</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV951215202995215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEADVERTISERLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49NY-KPR0-01S8-81DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Advertiser</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>December 15, 1995 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>WEST INDIES METAL PRODUCTS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES GLASS CO LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES OIL CO LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES NUTRITIONAL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES CANDY CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES SYNTHETICS LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES PUBLISHING LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0WEST INDIES PULP &amp; PAPER LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000428</classCode><className>CRICKET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX018</classCode><className>ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GR114</classCode><className>CARIBBEAN ISLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC562</classCode><className>TRINIDAD &amp; TOBAGO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Among the consequences:</p><p>Australia has been forced to cancel a visit to Vanuatu by Vice-Admiral Peter Sinclair, the RAN Fleet Commander.</p><p>Australia will almost certainly be obliged to cancel the planned visit of an Australian warship to Vanuatu next week.</p><p>Australia has suspended flights out of Vanuatu by long-range Orion maritime patrol aircraft.</p><p>Despite the row, there has been no ill-will shown to Australian tourists or residents in Vila.</p><p>It is understood that Vanuatu has given no indication that it would refuse to accept an Australian-made naval patrol boat later this year, despite some Australian press reports to this effect.</p><p>Referring to reports that some countries might raise the issue of Vanuatu's links with Libya at this month's South Pacific Forum meeting in Apia, father Lini said the forum had no mandate to interfere in domestic policies of its member states. He said if this were allowed to happen it could signal the end of the forum.</p><p>The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Paias Wingti, will host a pre-Forum summit meeting of the three Melanesian leaders next week to discuss Libya's growing interest in the region.</p><p>\"We cannot allow the question of Libya's interest in the region to divide members of the South Pacific Forum,\" Mr Wingti said today.</p><p>He is expected to voice PNG concern about Libya's involvement in the Pacific when he meets the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Mr Ezekiel Alebua, and Father Lini in Rabaul.</p><p>In Port Moresby, a spokesman for OPM rebels opposed to Indonesian rule in Irian Jaya said they were receiving guerilla training in Libya.</p><p>He refused to give details of the training or recruitment or to say whether Libyan trained rebels were operating inside Irian Jaya.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Foreign relations</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhlgvct8joibbv065q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1987</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7G-YGD0-TXN5-R2DC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1987 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"1987\"><dateText>May 12, 1987 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

IMAGINE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE bushfires were up to three times more likely to destroy the escarpment and Royal National Park. A world where a 100-year flood happened every year and Wollongong commuters who work in Sydney have to find alternative transport as 50km of rail-line in the Illawarra and Shoalhaven is inundated by water. Also say goodbye to the southern brown bandicoot, the green and golden bell frog and 67 other endangered species that reside in the region's bush and wetlands. Warmer weather will put all living things under stress, including people. </p><p>Pile on top of that severe droughts interspersed with frequent flash flooding. That's the future our grandchildren will face if they choose to live in Wollongong and we do nothing this decade about global warming, says Climate Commissioner Professor Will Steffen. What it will take to halt or slow the process is a reduction in carbon pollution from burning coal, oil and gas and an investment in cleaner forms of energy. Prof Steffen, a renowned climate scientist, has prepared an impact statement on climate change in the Illawarra and Shoalhaven to be released at the Transforming Australia conference to be held on Monday and Tuesday in Wollongong. The report is a future snapshot of what life will be like in the region with a warmer world and rising sea levels. While much of the impact can be stopped or slowed, some of the changes, like an increase in bushfires, have already begun. \"We've already seen that bushfires have risen 10 to 40 per cent in south-eastern Australia because of the higher temperatures and humidity levels,\" Steffen says. \"This is not something for the future, it's already occurring.\" Not only will bushfires be bigger, they'll also be more intense. Statistics from the Forest Fire Danger Index show that in Nowra, for example, between now and 2050 the number of extreme fire danger days will increase depending on the climate scenario. \"Instead of one extreme fire danger day a season Nowra will get two to three days,\" says Steffen. \"That figure will be the same for the Illawarra and the Royal National Park.\" Unlike other regions along the east coast it's harder to predict what will happen to the Illawarra's rainfall, which is already high due to the position of the escarpment. \"The Illawarra doesn't fit into the modelling for the rest of the east coast,\" he says. \"So we're a lot less certain as to what's going to happen in regards to rainfall in the area. We have seen a drying trend in the last 40 years in the Illawarra, but there's no consistency. \"Some (experts) say it'll get wetter, while others say it will get drier. The fact that the Illawarra has naturally high rainfall variability makes it hard to pick.\" When droughts occur he says they will be more severe and will have a greater impact on all plants and animals. \"I think that it's likely there will be more severe droughts punctuated by more extreme heavy rainfall on the escarpment with flash flooding downstream caused by a rise in sea level,\" Steffen says. \"A fair bit of the Illawarra will be at risk of inundation depending on how high the sea levels continue to rise.\" Sea levels have increased by 20cm since the 1880s and will continue to rise, with predictions of an increase of 50cm by 2100. \"Rising sea levels is something we will all have to live with,\" he says. \"It's already in the pipeline because of big thermal inertia in the ocean. Even a modest rise of 50cm, although we may not notice the difference, will lead to a much larger increase in flooding events than you would expect.\" Many parts of the coastline, including the Illawarra, will see a one in 100 year flood event every year depending on the topography of the area and how high sea levels rise. Such extreme sea level events, or flash flooding, will occur with a combination of a high tide and a deep east coast low. Steffen says the risk is greater in any coastal area that has an escarpment. \"When you couple that with an extreme rainfall event on the escarpment you have a double whammy event,\" he says. \"A storm surge plus heavy rainfall could be bad for the Illawarra.\" Steffen says rising sea levels threaten infrastructure, property and buildings - particularly those built on sand dunes. \"Wollongong is second to Newcastle in terms of the length of rail lines at risk of being inundated by rising seal levels,\" he says. \"An estimated 50km of rail in the Illawarra and Shoalhaven will be subject to more frequent flooding by a sea level approaching a metre.\" A sea-level rise of 1.1m, which Steffen predicts will probably occur next century, will threaten hundreds of buildings in the Wollongong and Shoalhaven areas. Since the 1940s flooding events have already increased three-fold in some areas of Australia. \"That's consistent with the 20cm rise in sea levels that we've already seen,\" he says. \"So we're starting to see things happen which are consistent with a warming climate. I think there is little doubt which direction this is going.\" Even if the world manages to constrain climate change future generations will still have to deal with the fallout of global warming. \"We need to mitigate climate change and cap the temperature rise by two degrees,\" he says. \"If we can do that we'll really be making a big difference to the world that our children and grandchildren will have to live in. There will still be some impact, but the severity of a lot of things will be affected on what we do now. Our grandchildren will be the recipients of the actions we take or don't take in this decade.\" It's also thought that low-lying areas around Lake Illawarra and Windang will be badly affected as the lake, which is a ponding area for several streams, floods. Chief Climate Commissioner Professor Tim Flannery, a keynote speaker at the conference, says it's not so much about bringing down global temperatures, but preventing the Earth from heating up further. Even after all carbon emissions are stopped the planet will continue to warm for some time. \"A carbon price for polluters is a necessary measure,\" he says. \"Other countries have done it and now Australia has joined them.\" Flannery refuses to comment further on the Federal Government's climate change policy. \"We've given away the power to comment on that,\" he says. \"The Climate Commission wants to be respected by people as an independent source of information. We take a longer term view based on the science.\" He says it's not too late to avoid the most dangerous implications of climate change but warns a carbon price alone won't be enough. \"It's an important step but doesn't do everything that's required,\" he says. \"Countries overseas have a mix of policies which also include subsidies and regulation.\" Other measures are using energy more efficiently and investing and researching in cleaner forms of energy. Australia has a bipartisan agreement to increase renewable energy and reduce carbon pollution by 5 per cent by 2020, with the aim of living in a decarbonised economy in 40 years. \"It's a big job,\" he says. \"But it's achievable if we take action this decade. This is a critically important time in history. A defining moment. \"Early action is relatively inexpensive action, if we leave it beyond this decade it gets more expensive. There are choices our generation needs to make.\" He's urged ordinary Australians to become better informed on the issues by listening to the peer-reviewed science which says that there's a 95 per cent chance that global warming is caused by human pollution. \"Peer-reviewed science is a bit like a set of audited accounts in business, it's credible. It's been certified by the experts,\" he says. \"If scientists choose to step outside peer review science what they're really giving is just their opinion. Some of the science will be alarming to some people. But I think once people are well informed they can make their own decisions.\" Flannery says a lot of money needs to be invested to research and develop sustainable energy. \"I don't think we will need nuclear power stations in Australia because we have an abundance of renewable energy,\" he says. \"I think in the end we will rely on a mix of things. Wind is now coming into its own as an industry and I think if we invest in a super grid, a high-voltage connector across Australia, we won't lose a lot of electricity.\" South Coast Labour Council Council Secretary Arthur Rorris says renewable energy industries have the potential to create hundreds of Illawarra jobs. He says the region is best placed to tap into the government's $10 billion sustainable investment package because it already has a Green Jobs Illawarra Action Plan which was launched in 2009. \"There are 20 recommendations in that plan on how the region can create green jobs,\" he says. \"What was missing before was a vehicle for investment and now, with this package, we have it. The Illawarra should be a winner from this. It should secure green jobs for our region. Some of the recommendations include research and development, a Green Street to showcase the available sustainable technologies at West Dapto, upskilling and retooling the manufacturing sector so they can play a bigger role in renewable energy, a community windfarm project and a $1 billion co-generation plant at Port Kembla to be built by BlueScope Steel which would create 2000 construction jobs and stop one million tonnes of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere each year. One Illawarra company, David Brown Gear is already reaping the benefits of renewable energy technology attracting $300,000 in work to repair transmissions in wind turbines and tower inspections for wind farms. It's estimated that wind turbine work will make up 10 per cent of the company's business over the next decade. \"David Brown Gear makes gearing systems for the coal mining industry,\" Rorris says. \"What the company does is transform these gears for use in wind turbines. So in a way it's a fairy tale solution about transforming local industry.\" He says other job opportunities may exist in the manufacturing of clean energy. \"We need to make sure that our region remains competitive and I think we should look at the steel industry as our strength,\" he says. \"While it's a big producer of carbon emissions because that's the nature of steel making, we also need to make steel to manufacture and harness renewable energy. For example it takes 150 tonnes of steel to build each wind turbine.\" \" The Transforming Australia conference will be held at the Novotel Northbeach on Monday and Tuesday. A Smart Living Expo at the Town Hall tomorrow, showcasing sustainable products and businesses, will kick-start the conference.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>South Coast Labour Council Council Secretary Arthur Rorris and David Brown gear general manager Ian Chew with one of the wind turbine gears the company makes.

Surely not. There's no rationality to it, at least to a mind not steeped in arcane religious practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, there's no rationality either to a belief that makes an Islamic woman cover up in public to the extent of having to open a flap over her mouth each time she wants to spoon in food.</p><p>Nor does there seem to be much sense to the medieval papal dictate that condemns Christian priests to lives of celibacy.</p><p>No doubt those of deep religious conviction can explain and rationalise these mysterious shibboleths, but why ask the rest of the community to not only accept them but, in the case of the eruv, have it imposed?</p><p>Which all goes to show that freedom to practice the religion of one's choice in Australia is fine as long as the peculiar bits are not imposed on the rest of us.</p><p>Alexander Johnson</p><p>St Ives</p><p>Transport a tangle</p><p>THE online Ku-ring-gai Integrated Transport Strategy Report is an intention to try to minimise traffic by convincing residents to abandon their motor vehicles in favour of public transport, bicycles or even walking.</p><p>These three options, initially, seem quite feasible until the problems of each are considered.</p><p>Weather conditions combined with the individual's physical capabilities would be major considerations to the outcome of these options. Even if 1 per cent of all company employees cycled to work, would there be mandatory showering facilities awaiting? Would a family shopper be expected to cycle home from the supermarket laden with a week's supply for a family of four?</p><p>Public transport is a continually flogged option but no matter how efficient Ku-ring-gai's system may become, as long as the car is an option, that's how most will travel.</p><p>We have been told that the saturation of high rise has been built close to stations to entice people on to trains, but again as long as people can drive they will.</p><p>The council's Sustainability Vision Summary Report 2008-2033 states: ``Ku-ring-gai will be a creative, healthy and liveable place where people respect each other, conserve the magnificent environment and society for the children and for the grandchildren of the future''.</p><p>Believe it or not, Ku-ring-gai is achieving this already but the immoral destruction of the existing character being replaced with heartless concrete slabs will create a less personal atmosphere alienating people from each other resulting in more social problems.</p><p>Although it was terrific to see the demise in March of the previous state government it seems Ku -ring-gai will now suffer the commitment of a premier who is determined to enforce the cap of 10,000 units by 2031 as mutually agreed to by the previous government and our own local council, but it was never agreed to by the community.</p><p>I call on Premier Barry O'Farrell to come clean with Ku-ring-gai and tell us what his ultimate plan and/or vision is for our once unique municipality.</p><p>Finally, as a community we should consider that bad things happen if good people do nothing.</p><p>Jeremy Lowther</p><p>Turramurra</p><p>Village people</p><p>THESE smaller, village-type shopping strips dotted throughout Ku-ring-gai municipality fulfill a need and have a real potential to serving the needs of the local community (``Princes St upgrade to start, at long last,'' Times, May 6.)</p><p>They are convenient, easily accessed and divert their clients away from more congested areas like central Wahroonga and Turramurra.</p><p>They should be supported so they offer an alternative to these more congested places.</p><p>The support should include ways to make them more visually appealing and provide an atmosphere which will aid in adding more opportunities and $ turnover to these local centres.</p><p>Mark White</p><p>online comment</p><p>Planning powers</p><p>WHILE I thank Premier Barry O'Farrell, MP Jonathan O'Dea and Planning Minister Brad Hazzard for honouring part of their election promises to Ku-ring-gai citizens in abolishing Labor's appalling Ku-ring-gai Planning Panel there is still a way to go in honouring their promise to hand back planning and decision-making to local communities.</p><p>The new Liberal Government has left the Sydney West Regional Planning Panel (SWRPP) and other similar panels in place in NSW.</p><p>The developments these panels are determining on the whole, is not state significant development. The SWRPP removes decision-making from the local community and Ku-ring-gai Council.</p><p>Until the SWRPP (and all regional planning panels across NSW) is abolished we will continue to see the majority of Ku-ring-gai's high-rise unit developments being determined by an appointed government panel instead of the elected council.</p><p>I urge the Premier and his Government to honour his written election promise to return powers to local communities without any further delay.</p><p>Kathy Cowley</p><p>Lindfield</p><p>Thanks to hospital</p><p>ON the New Year long weekend I took my sick husband to Royal North Shore Hospital emergency department.</p><p>My husband had a serious heart problem and had not been coping well in the weeks leading up to New Year.</p><p>From the moment we arrived at the emergency department, where he was treated immediately, we were treated with respect and with the utmost consideration.</p><p>When all one reads in the newspapers these days is how hopeless our systems are it takes away our confidence in their ability to give proper care and attention.</p><p>Our treatment was tremendous and my everlasting gratitude goes to those noble people.</p><p>My husband died, however, not one member of my family felt that any more could have been done to save him. This is a great comfort to us all.</p><p>Amber Edwards</p><p>Roseville</p><p>Help for helpers</p><p>I WRITE on behalf of The Salvation Army to ask readers for their help with this year's Red Shield Appeal.</p><p>To be frank, after all the challenges we've faced in recent months, including helping the victims of floods and Cyclone Yasi resources, are severely stretched.</p><p>It has already been a year of unprecedented natural disasters. Australians have joined together to respond with typical generosity. And many Australians are facing personal disasters such as homelessness, financial hardship, violence in the home, suicide bereavement and unemployment.</p><p>We need to raise $79 million by the end of June to continue our vital work of assisting vulnerable Australians. It's remarkable to think that every 12 months the Salvos help around 1 million people. All donations help us to change lives.</p><p>To help, you can either call 13 SALVOS (13 72 58) or visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salvos.org.au\">www.salvos.org.au</url>.</p><p>The Red Shield Appeal doorknock is on the weekend of May 28/29 and the need for support is simply enormous.</p><p>Major Peter Sutcliffe</p><p>The Salvation Army</p><p>Don't rubbish the charity bins</p><p>A COUPLE of years ago you reported on the appalling amount of rubbish left outside charity bins in the car park at Koola Ave, East Killara.</p><p>For a while there was some improvement but now, once again, thoughtless people are dumping an enormous amount of rubbish in the car park.</p><p>So much of it could be easily disposed of by Ku-ring-gai Council's excellent waste disposal services. For example, cardboard boxes can be flattened and put out in the regular paper recycling bin.</p><p>Charities will collect good, useable household items or you can take them to the various charity shops nearby.</p><p>Even broken furniture, crockery, useless electrical appliances and toys can all be taken away legitimately, at no cost, by the council's monthly pick-up service. All it takes is a call to Ku-ring-gai Council requesting the service.</p><p>As I was waiting in the car park yesterday I saw a man adding yet more rubbish to the pile already in front of the bins. I very politely asked him if he realised it was illegal to dump rubbish, pointing out the Council's notice prohibiting such behaviour, and advised him of the services available. He replied casually he would ``let them know about it''.</p><p>Perhaps it would help if Ku-ring-gai Council enclosed with their rate notices, an advice in different languages, regarding their services and warning of the fine for disposing of their rubbish so thoughtlessly.</p><p>Audrey Howard, Killara</p><p>to the point</p><p>May 13</p><p>* YOU may like to make your own assessment of the voting intentions of the two St Ives councillors, Tony Hall and Carolyne Hardwick. I am led to believe that they will both vote in favour of the proposal to proceed with the installation of the eruv, against the wishes of the majority of their constituents. I guess the residents will have a chance at the next elections to express their disapproval or otherwise.</p><p>Ian Cameron</p><p>St Ives</p><p>* I WOULD like to express a huge thank-you to the Forestville-Frenchs Forest Fire and Rescue officers and Frenchs Forest policemen who attended my grandson's house on Saturday morning. My two-year-old grandson, Ben, got his finger stuck in the bath plughole. He was very upset and distressed but the caring, compassionate way the officers responded to my grandson was very professional and much appreciated. Great job, fellas. Well done.</p><p>Dennis Gilmour</p><p>Forestville</p><p>* SCULPTURAL and decorative as the new seats are at Chowder Bay, they are hopeless as viewing seats for people, especially the elderly. They seem to be used for standing or lying upon. I'm sure I'm not alone in voicing the need for a few proper park benches with backs to enjoy this marvellous view of the harbour. Perhaps on the nearby grass area.</p><p>A Crawford</p><p>Mosman</p><p>* I WOULD like to compliment the staff at the Oaks for presenting the hotel so beautifully on Mother's Day. The mauve and pink balloons, along with a chrysanthemum on each table, were truly lovely touches. In a day when most restaurants make little or no effort on Mother's Day, the whole atmosphere could only make all mums feel very special.</p><p>Sharon Glasson</p><p>Mosman</p><p>FOR THE RECORD</p><p>The North Shore Times is committed to publishing news and information accurately.

Where is the other $5600? Not all in increases in incoming cartons, I think.</p><p>Now this is, of course, all voodoo economics but even if I am out by a factor of five, that still does not explain 67 per cent of the increase.</p><p>It would certainly seem that Minister Truss's comments that only one or two cents is justified are correct.</p><p>Are we being milked?</p><p>G. A. Watts</p><p>Claremont</p><p>Objectivity</p><p>In Commentary (October 3) Greg Barns, under the headline \"Donnelly gets an F for objectivity\", gives us some fascinating reading.</p><p>Since all state governments at the moment are Labor, it's hard to see how Donnelly can be accused of bias when he ranks Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia first in various disciplines.</p><p>When Barns refers to \"ideological fetishists like Mr Donnelly\" and \"the barrow-pushing Mr Donnelly\", he does not exactly qualify to be graded A for objectivity!</p><p>John Solomon</p><p>Taroona</p><p>Professionalism</p><p>Greg Barns' commentary \"Donnelly gets an F for objectivity\" (The Mercury, October 3) is informative for those who seek balance in the debate about the worth of educational reforms in Tasmania.</p><p>To the same audience, I suggest that none of the recent media flurry about our Essential Learnings has disproved the following assertions:</p><p>Tasmanian students deserve a curriculum that prepares them for an uncertain, hard to predict and rapidly-changing world.</p><p>Els integrates traditional subjects and child-centred approaches to teaching within a values framework in a way that is intended to help our students to adapt and prosper as lifelong learners and Tasmanian citizens.</p><p>Debate and anxiety are corollaries of reform. They will diminish once parents understand ELs and teachers adapt to teaching them.</p><p>Teachers will not say they are ready to report students' progress against the ELs until they are satisfied that their reporting will be accurate and meaningful.</p><p>The professionalism of our teachers will ensure that the first phase of ELs will be implemented and reported by the end of this year.</p><p>Those who misrepresent uncertainties about ELs as showing failure in our system of education should reflect on our teachers' fine work in effecting such important improvements for our students before undermining their efforts.</p><p>David Billing</p><p>President</p><p>Tasmanian Principals Association</p><p>Hobart College</p><p>Toy Run</p><p>As a participant in the annual Toy Run in recent years it is regrettable that this year's charity event is under threat.</p><p>It should be remembered that the run provides not only toys but donations, food, goods and other items to the Salvation Army which distributes those donations throughout the entire state to the many needy and less fortunate in our community.</p><p>It is estimated that such donations have a monetary value above $20,000, all of which has been provided by participants in the run.</p><p>It is also clear that the run brings pleasure to the thousands of people who line the route from the Derwent Entertainment Centre to the waterfront, which in turn sets the scene for the forthcoming festive season.</p><p>I hope the funds are available for this worthwhile tradition to continue with the ultimate benefit to the less fortunate in our community.</p><p>Fabian B. Dixon</p><p>Liberal candidate for Denison</p><p>Hobart</p><p>Young hopefuls</p><p>Why do multinational companies keep employing young staff?</p><p>These multinational companies employ eager 15 to 16-year-olds, many in their last year at high school.</p><p>When first employed they enjoy quite a few hours each week.</p><p>Then it starts to dwindle to one shift (of three to five hours) a week, then one shift a fortnight.</p><p>By law they have to give them one shift every three weeks.</p><p>Why do the shifts start to dwindle? Because they have just employed another batch of young hopefuls.</p><p>You wonder why the kids start to get disheartened.</p><p>Jenny Elkin</p><p>Moonah</p><p>Imagine!</p><p>Did anyone notice that our sister Commonwealth country Canada appointed a new governor-general recently?</p><p>The new governor-general is a woman under 50 years of age. This is wonderful news for Canada.</p><p>But wait. She is also black. Now wait again. She is a migrant.</p><p>Can we try to imagine Australia with a female GG and then from say Iraq, Vietnam, the Sudan or even our own Aboriginal population. No I can't. Not while the likes of John Howard are voted in.</p><p>David Rowe</p><p>Battery Point</p><p>HOT TOPIC AVIAN FLU</p><p> I respond to the article (The Mercury, September 30), \"Deadly flu plan call.\"</p><p>I note that the Federal Government has a stockpile of antiviral medication.</p><p>I would like it to be publicly known that this \"is in reserve\", not for the public necessarily but \"essential services\".</p><p>These include politicians, all defence force, fire, police and emergency aid services (ambulance, for example) and hospital administrators.</p><p>Interestingly, these essential services do not include medical staff of hospitals, nurses or the medical staff serving the general community -- GPs.</p><p>It's odd really, isn't it. Who's going to look after the sick people?</p><p>Maybe the politicians will be manning these infectious community centres?</p><p>Dr Jane Chapman</p><p>Bellerive</p><p> With the spread of deadly bird flu and concerns that it could mutate from birds to humans, isn't it time the Australian Government took a long, hard look at battery farms and broiler chickens?</p><p>All these birds are kept in overcrowded, filthy conditions which are an open invitation for viruses to spread like wildfire once they take hold.</p><p>Could avian flu become the next mad cow disease? Could the public pay the ultimate price due to producers putting profits above the welfare of customers?</p><p>During the 14th century humans lived in overcrowded, unhygienic slums which then became a breeding ground for plague which killed many thousands of people.</p><p>Are these conditions not being replaced now in battery farms and any place where battery and intensive farming is practised?</p><p>Factory farming is an environmental disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>Chickens in battery and broiler farms are providing the perfect environment for the spread of avian flu. Australia has around 10.5 million battery hens living in huge sheds which can hold up to 60,000 birds each.</p><p>To save space and pack in as many birds as possible the cages (holding up to five birds each) are stacked one on top of the other, often six to eight tiers high.</p><p>When the top birds poop, it falls through to the bottom cages where it hardens, pulverises and turns into dust which is then inhaled by the birds.</p><p>Most workers in the sheds wear masks but the birds are not protected at all. Litter is never changed during the birds' short, miserable lives, meaning that the stench, dirt and dust in the sheds is indescribable.</p><p>One infected bird could cause this whole tinderbox to ignite.</p><p>Disease would spread through the chickens with the same speed as a forest fire.</p><p>The Government should act now to close down these sheds, put people before profits and realise that the threat of avian flu is as great if not greater than that of terrorism to Australia and its people.</p><p>Elizabeth Hardy</p><p>Railton</p><p> Images of bird flu in Asian countries shown on our TVs depict affected birds living in profoundly cruel, miserable, cramped unhygienic conditions.</p><p>Our authorities seem to deliberately avoid making any criticism or reference to these practices, the reason for this being no doubt that almost all \"farmed\" birds in this country are kept in similar conditions.</p><p>Nature abhors such aberrations.</p><p>Pam Clarke</p><p>Kingston Beach</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-MER0510051020511717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOBARTMERCURYLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4H87-5X50-015H-90V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1345\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>October 5, 2005 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>TASMANIAN PRINCIPALS ASSOCIATION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000044</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD5</classCode><className>ENERGY PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097WX</classCode><className>FOOD PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp;

For proud tradition look no further than Redfern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- PETER HEDGES,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bulli.</p><p>Sex ideas a failure</p><p>IN response to the article titled \"Sex earlier, more often, says survey\" (Mercury, April 9).</p><p>Having \"sexperts\" advising our children on the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is like having arsonists in charge of the fire department!</p><p>Sex education has been going for about three decades and the evidence shows it is a total failure with more unplanned pregnancies, STDs and an increase in sterility as a result of the diseases.</p><p>So what is the agenda? Explicit, naturalistic, class-based sex education destroys God's holy laws on life, marriage and family, purity and faith, and undermines potential authority over our children.</p><p>This kind of explicit sex training stains our children's innocence and their sense of modesty, self-control and maturity, which can only lead to an even deeper social crisis than we are currently experiencing.</p><p>- ADRIAN DEVLIN,</p><p>Corrimal.</p><p>How to find peace</p><p>I FIND it amazing that with modern technology the way it is, the whole world can watch a war live on TV.</p><p>Radio reports continually update events as they happen and newspaper headlines daily present the allied progress and associated facts.</p><p>The Middle East is again the centre of world attention. Men, women and children are dying for the cause of peace and freedom. Or is that just a dream?</p><p>I wonder what the headlines would have said at Easter time 2000 years ago, when Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace was illegally tried and found guilty of blasphemy. The penalty was death by crucifixion.</p><p>In reality, his only \"crime\" was his love for a lost and helpless world heading for destruction. He came to be a substitute for all of mankind, and paid the penalty for our crimes against God and our fellow man.</p><p>After three days he rose from the dead, and now waits for all people everywhere to turn to him to find the peace and freedom they are looking for. Nothing in the world will ever have the power or authority to do that.</p><p>Peace, freedom, forgiveness and a future home in Heaven can only be received as a gift from God.</p><p>- FRAN FRAGAR,</p><p>Lansdowne.</p><p>Mature want work</p><p>RECENTLY I attended a workshop for the \"mature unemployed seeking work\".</p><p>This was an interesting experience and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) sent a representative to hear our concerns, which was all well and good, but whether the Government will do anything about seriously helping us - instead of making things more difficult - remains to be seen.</p><p>What really needs to be done is for employers to come forward and offer us a chance. There needs to be another forum for those of us who are in the higher range of 40-plus and prospective employers, where the employers are asked: why are you so hesitant in employing us? It's the employers who need to answer age discrimination or any other factors which stop them from hiring mature workers.</p><p>There are \"job expos\" for the young school leavers and there is a myriad of peer support for our youngsters, but it has come to light that there is not nearly adequate peer support for those of us who are older, wiser, more experienced, and facing this huge battle of searching for work. Just look around in the agencies and you will see what I am talking about.</p><p>We were told to look for part-time or casual work, but as everyone knows, it can be more disadvantageous when you are in receipt of benefits and even then, who is the preferred choice for part-time employment?</p><p>Would the Illawarra Business Chamber be interested in helping the 40-plus with a forum consisting of the unemployed and prospective employers? Or would this once again be fobbed off to the government departments? Why not have our local government do something like this for its constituents?</p><p>Take the results far up the ladder if it is a fruitful exercise and, who knows, it may be an example to other local government areas to follow.</p><p>Surely there must be a way to address this problem in the Illawarra and other areas?</p><p>It is easy to sit there and tell yourself that you are OK, since you have a job, but what if it were you having to search? I bet the attitude would change real quick.</p><p>- SONJA OUDHOFF,</p><p>West Wollongong.</p><p>Thank the soldiers</p><p>IT is the soldier, not the reporter, who has given us the freedom of peace.</p><p>It is the soldier, not the poet who has given us the freedom of speech.</p><p>It is the soldier, not the campus organiser, who has given us the freedom to demonstrate.</p><p>It is the soldier,</p><p>who salutes the flag,</p><p>who serves beneath the flag,</p><p>and whose coffin is draped by the flag,</p><p>who allows the protester to burn the flag.</p><p>- RB STORM,</p><p>Corrimal.</p><p>Grow right trees</p><p>NOT one person has given some thought for our wildlife, birds and animals that have had so much of their habitat wiped out by the bushfires and also by man.</p><p>Where the fires have destroyed so many of the old trees that were breeding grounds for so many species and the trees that have weathered the fires have had the sustenance knocked back, meaning that it will be quite a few years for them to recover.</p><p>Also some thought must be given to replacing some of the breeding grounds, by placing boxes on the trees, as a substitute for the loss of the old hollow trees.</p><p>The idea of greening Australia is right, but more thought should be given as to the type of trees that should be planted, trees that in time will benefit all.

When released, its full findings will reveal what lessons can be learnt from those extraordinary fires. Everything from improved warning mechanisms and communications to better building standards have been considered but perhaps the most controversial issue has been over whether residents should stay and defend their property or leave early and leave it to the fire fighters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These same issues are hot topics around the world as countries from Spain to Greece and most recently America face similar mega fires. Everyone wants to know why these fires are becoming more ferocious and more frequent - and what we can do to stop them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently, North America correspondent Michael Brissenden travelled to California to report from the fire frontline as wildfires raged around Los Angeles.</p><p>Here they've met mega fire with a mega response - hot shot crews, smoke jumpers, even 747s loaded with retardant. It's a $50 million dollar extravaganza - but it's $50 million dollars this cash strapped state doesn't have, despite the big talking ways of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p>Even with this arsenal of manpower and equipment the fires continued to burn unchecked for days and it's got people, even the fire fighters themselves asking if there is a better way. One solution would be for homeowners to take more individual responsibility. If people continue to build on the urban fringe there is a need for them to be better prepared.</p><p>The push is now on for safer and stricter building regulations to be implemented, and there is a great deal of discussion over the role the residents can play in defending their homes themselves.</p><p>\"The situation about how we try to defend houses here is absurd. You know I could legally defend this place with an AK47 and a bazooka if I choose - but apparently not with a garden hose - I'll be evacuated.\" Stephen Pyne, Fire Historian</p><p>Until recently most American communities forced the evacuation of their residents in the face of fires - leaving the task of fire fighting to the professionals. Homeowners have been actively deterred from staying to defend their property. Now authorities are looking at aspects of the Australian policy of \"stay and defend, or leave early\" as one possible answer.</p><p>As the climate changes and urban encroachment continues, experts predict fire seasons are going to get hotter, more frequent and more devastating. We need to learn lessons from each other around the world to better adapt to these environmental challenges - and to learn how we can live with and control this natural threat. </p><h>Transcript</h><p>NEWS REPORT: The fire started near here where Air 7HD first spotted the fire at Five Acres.</p><p>FIRE CHIEF: Today what happened is what I call the perfect storm of fuels, weather and topography coming together.</p><p>WOMAN: [press conference] The Station fire was the result of an act of arson.</p><p>CIVILIAN WOMAN: It took a turn, it took a huge turn and it's time to go.</p><p>CIVILIAN MAN: It's not good [looking at burning hills behind him]. It's pretty scary, especially once it gets over the ridge.</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: [Press conference] You know we have a lot of fires all over the State of California - fires, fires, fires.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Fighting fire in the hills and mountains around Hollywood is a big, almost cinematic operation, and like any big budget production, an army of cast and crew are up before dawn taking their direction.</p><p>It's a daunting logistical exercise. They're trying to outsmart and eventually conquer a wildly unpredictable and extremely dangerous enemy. This is no special effects monster, this is the real deal, what we call a bush fire and what's known here as a wildfire or a forest fire. And this wildfire, like so many these days in California, is big.</p><p>PATRICK TITUS: [Holding map] We've anchored flanks. We've anchored in over here in a good safe place and we're bringing this line around so we're pinching that fire down.</p><p>BRIAN SAVAGE: [Division Supervisor] For 12 years I've been on teams but I've been doing fires for 25 and you know this fire for instance was pretty dynamic, but 4,000 people assigned to a single fire in the United States, you don't see that very much. I've never seen a fire with 4,000 people assigned.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: So far this year California has had more than five thousand forest fires close to towns and cities. This one, called the Station Fire, has morphed into a mega fire. From fire fighters and law enforcement officers, to caterers and cleaning staff, nearly 500 engines, 14 helicopters, 64 bulldozers and fixed wing planes - including two DC 10's and for the first time a 747 capable of dropping 70 thousand litres of retardant in one go. When it's closing in on homes and lives, the response to a mega fire is equal force and here there won't be much change out of 50 million dollars.</p><p>Like much of southeast Australia, California has been in drought now for many years. The fire season here used to be three to four months. It's now an almost year round state of alert and many here are starting to believe that the change could be permanent. So the question is, should we stop trying to assume we can contain fire, and rather find better ways to deal with this new reality?</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: Houses are still burning down. The place is flooded. We're spending tens of millions of dollars. We're flying Boeing 747's with retardant now in mountains. I mean this is how nutty this is getting. The fire guys don't have a choice. They're told you've got to take action. We need to show we're responding. That is simply a broken system. Well you know the situation about how we try to defend houses here is absurd. You know I could legally defend this place with an AK 47 and a bazooka if I chose, but apparently not with a garden hose, I'll be evacuated.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: In arid Arizona, far from the Station blaze, fire historian Stephen Pyne is sounding the alarm on America's fire-fighting strategy and the new peril of the suburban sprawl.</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: I regard a lot of these as our sub-prime landscapes. This is the environmental flip side to Wall Street's conflagration. We shouldn't have built it on a lot of funny money and fraud going into it. There's no reason to build these things there and they're burning down just as the economy melted down.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Stephen Pyne is one of the world's foremost authorities on the culture of fire. In California broadly, and Los Angeles specifically, unchecked development and bad fire management have collided with global warming and the result according to this expert, is very grim indeed.</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: The whole literature of Los Angeles is about Los Angeles in apocalyptic meltdown. I'm not sure for fire there's a lot they can do. I don't think they can go back to the fundamentals and rebuild it.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: It's hard to know where the sprawl of Los Angeles ends. It certainly appears seamless all the way here to this neighbourhood, but this is Orange County, south of L.A.</p><p>This summer, Orange County fire officers have been visiting homeowners on site and giving their houses fire safety ratings. Many of them fall badly short. Many of the houses in this neighbourhood wouldn't last long if and probably when, a forest fire sweeps up out of the surrounding bushland. That's why the local strategy called 'Ready Set Go' is so important.</p><p>(CLIP FROM 'Ready Set Go' VIDEO)'Ready Set Go' is modelled on Australia's 'Stay and Defend or Leave Early Policy' and was adapted here by this man, Mike Ferdigh. Mike Ferdigh was working with Victorian Fire authorities when the Black Saturday infernos erupted and knows the Australian strategy has been heavily scrutinised ever since.</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: [Emergency Planning Co-Ordinator] I think it can work real well. I talked to several people and there was one lady in Marysville.... I'm probably going to insult her, I'm going to guess she was in her 70's.... and her house survived. So if a house is defendable I think it can work.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: But the reality of mega fires, makes it more difficult.</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: I think the hardest part which was obviously the same in Australia, and the same thing here, is how do you prepare a home owner when that fire comes.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: And how do you?</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: I don't think we can. I've been doing this for 30 years and I'm still amazed. So how can you take someone that goes to work every day, does a great job at their daily job, has air conditioning in their house and sits in a fairly nice environment and put them in a smoky environment where they can't see a foot and they want to throw up because of the smoke, and it's hot - I don't think there's any way you really can prepare someone for that.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: [Local TV reporter, describing fire] It was very, very dark. It was pitch black and I thought two things, I thought this is what living in war must be like or what hell must be like.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: Fireman and some neighbours kind of made a fire line and everybody was just passing these bottles of water.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: He's a senior attorney and she's a judge but when last year's so-called freeway fire stormed up to the Orange County home of Ed and Tam Schumann deciding to stay or go had them scratching their heads before it was almost too late.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: We thought we were pretty safe and we have a really nice buffer zone between us and any open land and either the wind shifted or the fire just found more fuel in our direction and it started coming up back over the hills, back here behind us and we got everybody out and took off.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: And when we fled the streets on either side were already aflame. The flames were just high and shooting and it was pitch black and embers were falling through.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: This is Tam's riding arena. Last year this would have all been completely cleared so there's nothing that would have burned on this whole hillside. So we felt safe you know? That should have been a really good buffer.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Their experience demonstrates why 'Ready Set Go' is such a difficult call. They thought they were insulated against fire and now as the Station fire blazes well out of range and north of them, the Schumann's are still very uncomfortable.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: We were really surprised at our reaction. Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome really, really exists. Both Ed and I were shocked at our reaction to that, to seeing this new batch of fires.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: Yeah it kind of makes you relive it again. You see the hillside burning and you kind of, you think God it can happen again.</p><p>PATRICK TITUS: [Battalion Chief] You know this is my 30-something years doing this. When I was younger, on the hand crews and the hotshots and stuff, a big fire was 15,000 acres and now it's so common that a fire is you know 100,000 plus acres. We had a fire in the Las Padres earlier that was 90 something thousand acres.... so you know it's not that those didn't happen when I was young but they were very, very rare. Now they've become very commonplace now.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The Station fire was an act of arson that within a day tore through 25,000 acres and doubled in size every day for the first four days. It's become the largest wildfire in Los Angeles' County history. And that's before the deadly seasonal winds have arrived, the dry desert Santa Anna's.</p><p>BRIAN SAVAGE: [Division supervisor] If we had a Santa Anna wind condition set up and we have a current fire burning like we do, we're going to get pounded. That fire is going to spread. It will go to the foothills and we will be fighting a fire fifty miles away and trying to save homes where we can.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The specialist crews in American fire fighting can sound like they've been named by a Hollywood producer. These are the hotshot crews and by day they're hard at it 'cutting line' forging defensive firebreaks along the ridgeline. It's tough, demanding work. With lumbering aircraft continuing to bomb the blaze, it can look like a war. In fact, the hotshot crews are modelled on small organised units from the World War II battlefield. And then there's the US fire fighting paratrooper, the smoke jumper.</p><p>JIM RAUDENBUSH: They started in about 1940 and it was just a way to get fire fighters to inaccessible fires and.... they decided to try parachuting, and that's when it got going. They've been around for almost sixty years now.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: These very specialised operators are based in Boise Idaho and from here they can be deployed at short notice anywhere across the country.</p><p>JIM RAUDENBUSH: We carry two days worth of food and water and if we need additional food and water we can be resupplied. You never know what you're doing from day to day. You can be sitting here in Boise one day and wake up in Alaska the next on a fire out in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Boise is fire-fighting central. At the national command centre enormous warehouses hold every piece of fire fighting kit imaginable. It can be rushed to fire crews as they call for it or as management at headquarters sees fit. At the Centre's coordinating bunker they can be dealing with dozens of fires across the country at any one time.</p><p>It's a supply and coordination centre but it's also gathering data and developing a clearer picture of the fire threat in the United States. From his national vantage point here, Rick Ochoa, one of the country's leading fire related weather specialists, is seeing a tinderbox getting drier.</p><p>RICK OCHOA: [Weather analyst] You know we have much drier fuels, much hotter temperatures and so on. So the weather and the climate and the fuels and fire is changing. Our jobs are also becoming more challenging in the fact that we have to look at more and more areas and events that in the past you know we had some wind, we had some humidity, we didn't think we'd see that much fire potential or fire behaviour, we're seeing a lot more of it now because the fuels are so much different.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: From computer screens in Idaho to fire fronts in California, the picture is the same. Global warming is proving to be an alarming accelerant.</p><p>RICK OCHOA: I think it's a permanent change. I think this is here to stay. We're seeing here in the States and Australia, longer fire seasons, hotter fire seasons, it's just because we're dealing with a much warmer globe.</p><p>MIKE FERDIGH: I believe you're in a twelve year drought, we're in a four/five year drought so we're just starting the same path that you guys are maybe ten years ahead of us. So if the drought conditions, if you wanted to throw in global warming, what that's doing to the environment and the drought conditions we have here presently in Southern California, it has the potential to be another bad fire season.</p><p>NEWS REPORT: Arnold Schwarzenegger served the breakfast to fire-fighters today at the Lake View Terrace Command Post. He assured them that state money would be there to fight the fires. He told me there's enough in reserve to keep the money flowing to fire-fighters.</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: Public safety is the number one priority so yes you have to be frugal, yes you have to look at every dollar but we will have the dollars available to fight these fires and we will go all out.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The Californian economy was in freefall before the global financial crisis made things even worse. An increasingly demanding fire season, more and more mega fires, has a huge financial dimension and fire historian Stephen Pyne wonders if the state can in fact deal with its fiery future.</p><p>STEPHEN PYNE: That cycle, spending more money, evacuating more people.... this can't continue. This is just insane and it doesn't solve the problem. The problem comes as with our financial system by taking a systemic view and reorganising it. We've made this mess and it's a big deep mess. It's going to take a long time to disentangle it, but we can begin. There are a number of things, we'll start small, we'll begin putting it together again.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Some of those small changes are being implemented in the big houses along San Diego's ridge tops. They're a long way from the subprime fuelled suburban expansion on the LA fringe but the fire danger here is just as alarming. Nearly 10,000 homes have been lost to wildfires here in the past 40 years.</p><p>CLIFF HUNTER: [Fire marshal] Our preferred method is to evacuate and evacuate early but there may be some time constraints depending on the fire and the wind conditions which stop you from doing that. It's very difficult once it gets to a certain point from a safety perspective, to get in and try to fight it.</p><p>We're in a community called the Cielo and it's a sheltered place community. It's one of six in the Rancho Santa Fe fire protection district and our goal is that if you live in a sheltered place community, you would not have to evacuate if a wild land fire came through. That means if a fire were to come through the community, you would be safer to stay in your home, close your windows, close your doors and try not to evacuate.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: The houses here have all been designed to conform to the local Rancho Santa Fe Fire Protection code. It's a much stricter regulatory environment and certainly more expensive than elsewhere in California, but the man behind it all, local Fire Chief Cliff Hunter says the lessons learnt here can be used more widely.</p><p>CLIFF HUNTER: You can do this in a regular home owner situation. You can still look at the vents, you can still look at the roofs..... we can still look at landscaping and we would hopefully look at the infrastructure, which are the roadways and water supply and telephone and power and all those things. So yes I believe it is 100% achievable in another community.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: All over California regulators are slowly getting tough and homeowners are getting the message that if they want to live with nature, they must adapt.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: This is what's left. We sorted through the last of this today and found what we could.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Tam and Ed Schumann learnt the hard way. Their home was not fire safe. For them the cost of complying with tougher building regulations isn't even an issue if it means their new home will survive another fire.</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: I was not going to let this fire get me down. I was going to.... it was almost like I was going to shake my fist and say, I am not getting driven out by this. I'm going to rebuild and my life is going to go on.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: We've had to compromise and make some changes but we are building the house we want. The city has changed a lot of the fire codes with the way things are rebuilt..... so personally I think we're pretty safe.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: How do you think you will feel when you move back to the new house when it's built? What are you going to do, anything special?</p><p>TAM SCHUMANN: Throw a huge party.</p><p>ED SCHUMANN: And don't call it a house warming. We've had the house warming party, now we're going to have the house cooling party.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: When the smoke clears from this fire, as happened in Australia after Victoria's Black Saturday tragedy, questions will be asked about building safer homes, about homeowner's responsibility and about the fire fighting efforts as well.</p><p>PATRICK TITUS: My crystal ball's worn out. I don't know. I don't know but things have changed and I think the fire service, not just in California but nationwide in the United States, I think we're changing with it a little bit. I think our leadership and a lot of leadership are really coming to terms with what a whole different way of thinking about how we approach the fires.</p><p>BRISSENDEN: Controlling fire, living with it and adapting to a rapidly changing fire environment has become one of the big challenges of our time and it seems we all still have a lot to learn.</p><p>STEPHAN PYNE: There's a big disconnect and fire is being separated from the way we manage the land. We've forgotten what has been such a brilliant defining characteristic for us. I mean that's what we do. We're the fire creatures. You know other animals knock over trees and dig holes in the ground.... we do fire - and that has always been our unique signature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORCOR-2713149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORCOR2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51XJ-3CY1-F031-X3MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">375495</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3380\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Foreign Correspondent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>October 13, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Grief</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Urban Development and Planning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Emergency Incidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Emergency Planning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Volunteers</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

His humour is more wry than jovial and many of his songs are</p><p>about drinking, preaching, cars, 'real people' (usually in blue collars or</p><p>overalls), trains, being short of a quid and/or romance on the skids.</p><p>'Money doesn't make you happy,' he says.</p><p>'I've had a really normal career ...

His father, a 'very religious man' who went bankrupt twice, took the</p><p>family to Christian Reformed church</p><p>services five times a week.</p><p>'I like to put preachers in my songs because I was raised with preachers,' he</p><p>says. 'I went to church twice on Sunday and three times during the week plus I</p><p>went to (a Christian) school. I should be saved by rote.'</p><p>To corrupt a line from Hank Williams, Eaglesmith saw a different light about</p><p>a decade ago and become a Buddhist.</p><p>'I'm a lousy Buddhist but I'm a Buddhist.'</p><p>Eaglesmith believes 'true riches' rest in personal fulfilment rather than</p><p>material possessions.</p><p>'The poorest people usually have the most answers,' he says.</p><p>Plenty of punters tell Eaglesmith that they have found deep meaning in his</p><p>'alternative country' music. Some even refer to his live performances as</p><p>'getting religion'.</p><p>'I'm always astonished when people say that they revere you or one of your</p><p>songs,' he says.</p><p>'I look at the lyrics and it's a song about how I like trains or something.</p><p>'There's no new-age revelations.

It is barely surviving in a few isolated populations in southern Spain and Portugal and unless numbers can be boosted and habitat destruction halted, it could become extinct within the next five years. If this happens, the Iberian lynx will be the first big cat to become extinct since the sabre-toothed tiger died out around 10,000 years ago. The plight -and some wildlife biologists would add, the neglect -of one of the world's oldest wild cat species has become Europe's most controversial conservation issue. Wildlife biologists say the lynx is \"in an extinction vortex\". It is the first cat to be classified as being in \"critical danger of extinction\", with only two surviving wild breeding populations. There are 8000 surviving tigers in the wild and 10,000 cheetahs, but there are only about 100 wild lynx left in Spain and Portugal. Early last century, there were 100,000 Iberian lynx, and their range extended through Spain and Portugal, into southern France. But although they posed no threat to humans or livestock, hundreds were killed in government-sanctioned \"vermin drives\". They were also shot by boar and deer hunters. By 1960, there were only 3000 left, and by 1988, numbers had crashed to 1200. In 2001, there were 300 lynx left in the wild, but numbers have plummeted further. Scientists are worried that disease, a diminishing gene pool and a natural disaster such as a forest fire could wipe out remaining populations.</p><p>\"It is the most threatened cat species on the planet,\" Dr Luis Castro, a wildlife biologist with Portugal's Institute for the Conservation of Nature, said in a recent interview. \"The decline of the lynx has been a problem for many decades. Currently we are in an emergency situation and the problem is that, for the species to survive, it needs large areas, positive action and political and technical motivation.\" Dr Caroline Lucas, a Green Party member of the European Parliament, has called for the European Union to take a more active role in halting the lynx's rapid demise. \"The European Union's contribution to lynx conservation to date is dwarfed by the subsidies which have been given to forestry and intensive agriculture projects, that have turned natural ecosystems into virtual deserts and native vegetation into exotic plantations,\" she said, in a recent report on the status of the Iberian lynx. \"The EU has to accept its responsibility, duty and potential to address the current situation, and recognise that it is an emergency, not just for the lynx, but also for the reputation of the EU's environment and conservation policies.\" Wildlife biologists were first alerted to the plight of the Iberian lynx after the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Cat Specialist Group published a global survey of wild cat species. Sobering results had been anticipated for several species -tigers, cheetahs and snow leopards -but the results for the Iberian lynx were unexpected and profoundly shocking. Only a few hundred animals remained, scattered over 50 small, isolated populations. \"Eight years later, what has changed? The answer is not the one you might expect,\" writes Eduardo Goncalves, a Portuguese journalist who is also president of SOS Lynx, a non-profit conservation group dedicated to saving the Iberian lynx. \"The situation has got worse. Much worse. Of the 48 breeding populations in Spain that had earlier been found clinging grimly to survival, only two remain. \"Of the five found in Portugal, none remained.\" For the lynx, it has been a \"death of a thousand cuts\" -habitat loss for agriculture, forestry and holiday homes; loss of its main food source; loss of breeding sites; road kill as bigger roads and faster traffic encroach on its habitat; tuberculosis from contact with domestic cattle and illegal hunting. Lynx habitat has been cleared for pine and eucalypt plantations, which lack an under-storey to support rabbit populations -the lynx's main prey. The loss of cork forests, which are being replaced by intensive strawberry agriculture, has also taken a heavy toll on lynx numbers. Cork forests are used by female lynxes to rear their young. Recent studies showed the majority of den sites were found at the base of old, hollow cork oak trees. The kittens stay in the natal den for the first 20 days, with the mother subsequently moving them to as many as 12 other den sites as a protection against predators. The trend toward plastic champagne corks and screw-tops for wine has led farmers to cut down cork plantations as demand for wine corks declines. Cork forests have been a major industry for southern and central Spain, producing 15 billion corks annually from sustainably harvested tree bark. But hunting remains the main cause of high mortality rates, despite the lynx being declared a protected species in both Spain and Portugal in the mid-1970s. Deaths from hunting and game-keeping activities accounted for more than 50 per cent of all lynx deaths in Spain's Donana national park in the 1980s. \"The majority of lynx territories remain unprotected,\" writes Goncalves. \"Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of kilometres of highways are being built in the heart of lynx country. By contrast, the total amount spent on lynx conservation to date would barely be enough for 1km of new road. \"Whilst European leaders lecture so-called Third World politicians on the need to preserve the habitats of tigers, elephants and black rhinos, one of the world's oldest feline species is being allowed to die out on our own doorstep.\" But Australian science has unwittingly played a role in the lynx's demise. Its diet chiefly consists of wild rabbits (other prey includes ducks and partridge) and, when rabbit numbers are low, the survival and breeding rates of the lynx show a corresponding decline. \"In the 1950s, a French doctor lost patience with rabbits that had been attacking his vegetable garden, and imported from Australia a disease called myxomatosis with catastrophic results,\" wrote Goncalves in a column for The Ecologist magazine. \"Entire rabbit populations were wiped out and many lynxes starved or failed to reproduce. Then, a few decades later, just as rabbit populations began to develop immunity, disaster struck again. \"A new virus virtually eradicated rabbits from the Iberian Peninsula in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Today, rabbit populations are thought to number just 5 per cent of 1960s levels. \"There can be few more shocking spectacles than that of a starving, emaciated lynx barely able to walk.\" European governments and conservation authorities have been slow to respond to the plight of the lynx. A recent report, commissioned by Lucas, on \"the Iberian Lynx emergency\" says \"the lynx conservation effort has developed late and slowly, is still new and not very extensive and has yet to demonstrate a significant impact on the lynx\". The report has called for rabbit vaccines, a revision of land use and habitat protection, more financial incentives for nature protection on private land and a new political commission to focus on lynx conservation. The recent birth of three Iberian lynx kittens at a special breeding program at Donana national park in southern Spain has raised hopes that the species can be saved. Last century, the French writer Colette once found an exhausted young lynx cowering in her garden in rural southern France. The animal was on the run from a nearby hunting party, and Colette -always a formidable woman -stalked out to confront them. Recalling the incident when writing about the treatment of wild animals in later years, she angrily asked: \"Can we not leave these creatures, dispossessed of everything else, at least one refuge?\" For more information visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.soslynx.org\">www.soslynx.org</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-3602372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FX8-G4M0-0045-5234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"1298\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited</copyright><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>April 11, 2005 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>EUROPEAN UNION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>EUROPEAN UNION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000264</classCode><className>WILD CATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000613</classCode><className>ENDANGERED SPECIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp;

One of his drawings on view at Michael Nagy shows two men climbing up lampshades. The caption, which is presented upside down, reads: \"Life in Canberra carried on as usual.\" Too true.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There are other Australian allusions in this exhibition. A man with a televisionset head and wearing a safari suit is captioned: \"I well remember the arrival of the first portable television set in Brisbane,\" while a drawing of a woman bashing some flattish object on an anvil is labelled: \"It was not too long before Mrs Trundle's omelette became the talk of the Hunter Valley.\"\u00a0 Before the population of Queensland and rural NSW lodges formal complaints about regional vilification by visiting Poms, it should be pointed out that these works are part of a long tradition of Baxter giving real place names to absurd images.</p><p>Baxter has made several visits to Australia since he first came out for the 1992 Adelaide Festival, and there is a cult following for his work here. It is therefore a compliment to be included in his personal geography.</p><p> His mock autobiography, Glen Baxter his life: the years of struggle, manages to produce the most absurd jokes about Yorkshire and Englishness since Monty Python. One of the many pleasures of Baxter's art is that he translates the sensibility of Pythonesque humour into works of art that are worth more than one quick look.</p><p> His manipulated images pay a gentle tribute to the archaic tradition of English juvenile pulp fiction as he appropriates the drawing style of that utterly strange culture of midnight feasts, boy scout camps, Fifth Form at St Dominic's and Deeds that Won the Empire. There are twisted narratives of noble heroes who overcome bullies, win cricket matches, shoot the enemy and generally behave with the utmost propriety despite all odds.</p><p> The illustrations to these one-dimensional stories are likewise simplified and repetitive, the hero figures being almost interchangeable. What Baxter has done to both the narrative and the illustrations is add an extra dimension, a twist of bile and whimsy. Nevertheless, these are affectionate images of a world that lacks any purpose except a belief in itself.</p><p> One of his running gags is the awfulness of school days and adolescence: \"I was beginning to realise the other boys and I were just not getting along\" shows a passive schoolboy being torched by two others. \"It looked like being another long, hot, awkward summer\", combines both the stilted imagery of the schoolboy illustration genre with a fun, horror-story fantasy as one man sprouts a fox's tail.</p><p> My small children are currently addicted to R. L. Stine's Goosebumps stories, where adolescent boys discover their true selves as werewolves, so perhaps animal transformations are a part of a universal juvenile fantasy.</p><p> One of the reasons for the success of his work is the whole unreality of the culture he appropriates. The archaic children's fiction on which he relies is based on a world of boarding schools that was never a mainstream experience, although its values dominated popular illustrated magazines aimed at children.</p><p> It was as much a fantasy land as the same comics based on adventures in the colonies or the wild west. So Baxter mixes familiar geographic names with his unreal images, and absurd visual images are placed next to banal captions.</p><p> He uses the same deadpan drawing style as his beloved source materials in creating his drawings and prints. The figures stand or sit in standard poses and make stilted gestures as to form static tableaux. Then Baxter carefully mimics the crudities of cheap, coloured printing processes in his carefully planned draw ings. The total effect is to give them a sense of belonging in a time past. It is a world of total nostalgia for a past that could have been, a bit like the ever popular Tintin comics, which also have boys in knickerbockers, a self-conscious archaic landscape and men with guns.</p><p> \"The news from Sydney is not good\" a consignment of new Baxter drawings has just arrived!</p><p>Roared Brenda illustrates three white hunters by their tent.</p><p>The same figures could be rearranged into other narratives, they are all so gloriously stereotypical. Sexual identity is another of Baxter's jokes and Brenda has been a recurring character since the early 1980s.</p><p> Another recurring favourite is the small boy quietly arranging the destruction of a relative as he cooks with concrete and iron filings. It is an image of infantile experimentation, lifted out of the banal by its deadpan caption: \"I was determined to ensure that Uncle Frank's birthday cake would not be forgotten in a hurry.\" This is the same boy character who appears in Baxter's earlier work. Systematically poisoning plants, and using a saw and trestle to cut his mother's homemade bread.</p><p> Then there is sex. One of the funniest prints shows a tree with an extended arm, and just past it a hiker wearing a blissful expression: \"As a first sexual experience it had not been a total disappointment.\" How to have sex is a strangely empty yellow drawing with a ladder, an anteater and legs. It is most instructive.</p><p> IN BRIEF: American Colour, photographs by Constantine Manos at Byron Mapp give the strident reds and pinks and blues of a trashy glitzy society. This is a vision of the strange juxtapositions of everyday life - of a woman contemptuously flashing her breasts to counter the asceticism of chanting Hare Krishnas, or the ravages of a forest fire behind a wiredoff swimming pool.</p><p> When the camera lingers on flesh in this world it is to look at absurdities, not beauty. Even the shot of young girls in bikinis on a summer's day is made to look harsh and banal, and beauty queens yawn on their float as they wait for the big parade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9603010016116556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:457Y-8JH0-0197-50GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>March 1, 1996, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL68</classCode><className>DRAWING &amp; ILLUSTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000672</classCode><className>EXHIBITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009U6V</classCode><className>BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000181</classCode><className>PROFILES &amp; BIOGRAPHIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001871</classCode><className>YOUTH CLUBS &amp; ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000428</classCode><className>CRICKET</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL68</classCode><className>DRAWING &amp; ILLUSTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000672</classCode><className>EXHIBITIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GX018</classCode><className>ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Cool, eh?</p><p>So, what would you name your dinosaur if you discovered one? Hmm, we reckon \"Factorxosaurus\" has a nice ring to it, what do you think?</p><p>Check out these wackybutreal dinosaur names!</p><p>BAMBIRAPTOR</p><p>\"Bambi\" hardly sounds scary, but \"raptor\" sounds very scary.</p><p>So, was the Bambiraptor (also known as Bambi) scary or not? You decide: the Bambiraptor was a small, fast, meat-eating dinosaur with a deadly, sickle-shaped toe claw on the second toe of its foot.</p><p>(Oooh, we say scary!) The Bambiraptor lived in the late Cretaceous period (about 75 million years ago) and was named in 2000.</p><p>AFROVENATOR</p><p>Was this dinosaur named after Guy Sebastian or Jimi Hendrix? No, but you'd be forgiven for thinking so! Afrovenator actually means \"African Hunter\".</p><p>The Afrovenator was a 9m-long, meat-eating, three-fingered, stiff-tailed predator from Africa during the Cretaceous period (about 130 million years ago).</p><p>It was found in 1993 and named in 1994.</p><p>QANTASSAURUS</p><p>Qantassaurus sounds like it was named for the Australian airline, Qantas, right? Yep, and that's exactly what happened after the airline helped transport the precious fossil after finding it in Victoria.</p><p>This plant-eater was the size of a small kangaroo and had large eyes and a long tail.</p><p>It dates from about 110 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period, and was named in 1997.</p><p>GIRAFFATITAN</p><p>It sounds more like a giant giraffe than a dinosaur, doesn't it? Well, that's actually not such a bad description.The Giraffatitan was a huge, 30m-long, lightly-built, long-necked, whip-tailed, plant-eating dinosaur from the late Jurassic period (about 150 million years ago).</p><p>It was a brachiosaurid sauropod from Tanzania in Africa.</p><p>Giraffatitan means \"gigantic giraffe\" and was named in 1988.</p><p>STRUTHIOSAURUS</p><p>Nope, the Struthiosaurus was not named after the first word uttered by an Aussie fossilfinder.</p><p>Not even close!</p><p>Struthiosaurus actually means \"ostrich lizard\".The Struthiosaurus was a small, 2m long, armoured, plant-eating dinosaur.</p><p>It lived during the very late Cretaceous period (about 65 million years ago) and was named back in 1870.</p><p>JURASSOSAURUS</p><p>The full name of this dinosaur is Jurassosaurus nedegoapeferima.</p><p>Jurassosaurus means \"Jurassic lizard\"; nedegoapeferima is fragments of the names of cast members of the movie Jurassic Park, Sam NEill, Laura DErn, Jeff GOldblum, Richard Attenborough, Bob PEck, Martin FErrero, Ariana RIchards and Joseph MAzzello.</p><p>Steven Spielberg, the director of the movie, donated money for Chinese dinosaur research, so he was allowed to suggest its name.</p><p>The Jurassosaurus was an armoured, plant-eating dinosaur that was about 3m long.Not surprisingly, it lived during the mid Jurassic period (about 175 million years ago).</p><p>ELVISAURUS</p><p>Could this dinosaur have anything to do with rock legend Elvis Presley? Yes, actually!</p><p>The Elvisaurus, which means \"Elvis (Presley) lizard\", was named as such due to its crest's likeness to Elvis Presley's hairdo. How funny!</p><p>The Elvisaurus was a meat-eating dinosaur about 6m long and had a horn-like, upward pointing, Elvis-style crest above its eyes.The Elvisaurus lived in what is now Antarctica during the early Jurassic period (about 190 million years ago).</p><p>DELTASAURUS</p><p>No, this dinosaur wasn't named after Australia's popular piano-playing songstress Delta Goodrem, but Deltasaurus fossils have been found in Australia. Deltasaurus actually means \"river delta lizard\" and was named in 1965.This carnivore had very good hearing in the air, (but we doubt it could play the piano!)</p><p>Why did dinosaurs eat raw meat?</p><p>Because they didn't know how to cook!</p><p>What do you get when two dinosaurs crash their cars?</p><p>Tyrannosaurus wrecks!</p><p>What do you call a fossil that doesn't ever want to work?</p><p>Lazy bones!</p><p>What do you call a dinosaur with no eyes?</p><p>Doyathinkysaurus!</p><p>What do you call a dinosaur that never gives up?</p><p>Try-Try-Try-ceratops!</p><p>NQWEBASAURUS</p><p>Oh my goodness, what on earth were the palaeontologists thinking when they named the Nqwebasaurus (pronounced n-KWE-bah-SAWR-us) in 2000?! It's quite a mouthful to pronounce, isn't it!</p><p>The Nqwebasaurus is actually the first dinosaurwith a click sound in its name. To correctly pronounce Nqwebasaurus, pull your tongue off the roof of your mouth to produce a click on the \"q\".</p><p>Nqwebasaurus means \"Nqweba lizard\".</p><p>(Nqweba is an African language similar to Zulu.)</p><p>TECHNOSAURUS</p><p>Perhaps the Technosaurus would have preferred to live in today's technologically-advanced society.</p><p>Perhaps not! Either way, the Technosaurus was a small, plant-eating dinosaur that was about 1.2m long and weighed about 11kg. Pretty small, eh? It lived during the late Triassic period (about 230 million years ago) and was named in 1984.</p><p>PAWPAWSAURUS</p><p>Pawpawsaurus doesn't quite sound as menacing as Tyrannosaurus Rex, does it? Nevertheless, the Pawpawsaurus (which means \"paw-paw formation lizard\") was a pretty tough character.</p><p>It had bony eyelids and armour over most of its body.</p><p>The Pawpawsaurus was pretty similar to the Ankylosaurus, actually, except it didn't have one of those cool clubs at the end of its tail. The Pawpawsaurus lived from the mid Cretaceous period (about 97 million years ago) and was named in 1996.</p><p>SUPERSAURUS</p><p>Could the Supersaurus be the dinosaur version of Superman? Who knows! What we do know is that the Supersaurus was one ofthe longest dinosaurs, at around 42m in length (that's about four buses long!).</p><p>This sauropod was a Jurassic long-necked, long-tailed plant-eater with a small head.</p><p>OZRAPTOR</p><p>Could the Ozraptor have been a fierce Aussie dinosaur? Pretty much, yeah! The Ozraptor (which means \"Australian plunderer\") was a 3m-long, meat-eater from the mid Jurassic period (about 175 million years ago).</p><p>It was an advanced dinosaur that had threefingered hands, long legs and a stiff tail.The Ozraptor wasnamed in 1998 and is known from a part of a tibia (shin bone) found right here in Australia.</p><p>DISCOSAURISCUS</p><p>A groovy disco-dancing dino? Hmm, perhaps! The Discosauriscus walked on four short, sprawling legs, had a long tail and hadsharp teeth in wide jaws.</p><p>It lived during the early Permian period (almost 300 million years ago) and was named in 1876.</p><p>Hundreds of Discosauriscus fossils have been found in Central and Western Europe.</p><p>PYRORAPTOR</p><p>Hmm, could this be a fierce dinosaur that loved to start fires?</p><p>No, but Pyroraptor does mean \"fire thief \" - it was given this name because it was found (in France) after a forest fire.</p><p>The Pyroraptor was a meat-eating dinosaur that lived during the late Cretaceous period (about 80 million years ago) and was namedin 2000.</p><p>GARGOYLEOSAURUS</p><p>Well, judging by its name, the Gargoyleosaurus must have been an ugly and mean-looking dinosaur.Yep, Gargoyleosaurus means \"gargoyle lizard\" and was named as such because its wide, triangular skull resembles that of a gargoyle. It was a short, armoured plant-eater that lived during the late Jurassic period (about 150 million years ago). The Gargoyleosaurus was named in 1998.</p><p>What does a Triceratops sit on?</p><p>Its Tricera-bottom!</p><p>Mark: I wish I had enough money to buy a dinosaur.</p><p>John: What would you do with a dinosaur?</p><p>Mark: Who wants a dinosaur? I just want the money!</p><p>Why are there old dinosaur bones in the museum?</p><p>Because they can't afford new ones!</p><p>Why did the Archaeopteryx catch the worm?</p><p>Because it was an early bird!</p><p>When can three giant dinosaurs get under an umbrella and not get wet?</p><p>When it's not raining!</p><p>Information courtesy of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/\">www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-SML040905K106011224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYMAIL(QLD)LTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4D7S-R230-015G-Y4V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1336\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>September 5, 2004 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DD7B</classCode><className>PALEONTOLOGY &amp; PALEOBIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL67</classCode><className>PREHISTORIC LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC383</classCode><className>TANZANIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Even now, feelings of distrust remain, writes Deborah Sontag in the central town of Mirebalais.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jean Salgadeau Pelette, handsome when medicated and groomed, often roamed this central Haitian town in a dishevelled state, wild-eyed and naked. He was a familiar figure here, the scion of a prominent family who suffered from a mental illness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On October 16, 2010, Pelette, 38, woke at dawn in his solitary room behind a bric-a-brac shop off the town square. As was his habit, he loped down the hill to the Latem River for his bath, passing the beauty shop, the pharmacy and the funeral home where his body would soon be prepared for burial.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The river would have been busy that morning, with bathers, laundresses and schoolchildren brushing their teeth. Nobody thought of its waters, downstream from a United Nations peacekeeping base, as toxic.</p><p>When Pelette was found lying by the bank a few hours later, he was so weak from a sudden, violent stomach illness that he had to be carried back to his room. It did not immediately occur to his relatives to rush him to the hospital.</p><p>\"At that time, the word 'cholera' didn't yet exist,\" said one of his brothers, Malherbe. \"We didn't know he was in mortal danger. But by four that afternoon, my brother was dead. He was the first victim, or so they say.\"</p><p>In the 17 months since Pelette was buried, cholera has killed more than 7050 Haitians and sickened more than 531,000, or 5 per cent of the population. Lightning fast and virulent, it spread from here through every Haitian state, erupting into the world's largest cholera epidemic despite a huge international mobilisation still dealing with the effects of the January 2010 earthquake.</p><p>The world rallied to confront cholera, too, but the mission was muddled by the United Nations' apparent role in igniting the epidemic and its unwillingness to acknowledge it. Epidemiologic and microbiologic evidence strongly suggests UN peacekeeping troops from Nepal imported cholera to Haiti, contaminated the river tributary next to their base through a faulty sanitation system and caused a second disaster.</p><p>\"It was like throwing a lighted match into a gasoline-filled room,\" said Dr Paul Keim, a microbial geneticist whose laboratory determined that the Haitian and Nepalese cholera strains were virtually identical.</p><p>And, as the deaths and continuing caseload indicate, the world's response to this preventable, treatable scourge has proved inadequate. Cholera, never before recorded in Haiti, stayed one step ahead of the authorities as they shifted gears from the earthquake recovery. While eventually effective in reducing the fatality rate, the response was slow to get fully under way, conservative and insufficiently sustained.</p><p>While the world has dedicated $US230 million ($223.7 million) so far to combating the unexpected epidemic, the United Nations is now pleading for an additional $US53.9 million just to get the vulnerable displaced population through the rainy months ahead.</p><p>At the same time, Haitian cholera victims are seeking compensation from the United Nations, pressing it to accept responsibility. Early on, protests against the United Nations hindered the construction of treatment centres and the delivery of lifesaving supplies. Now distrust of some cholera programs lingers, and the issue has strained the peacekeepers' relationship with the Haitians they are protecting in an eight-year-old mission to stabilise the politically volatile nation. So, too, have unrelated allegations that they engaged in criminally abusive behaviour.</p><p>\"In telling the truth, the UN could have gained the trust of the population and facilitated the fight against cholera,\" said Dr Renaud Piarroux, who led an early investigation into the outbreak. \"But that was bungled.\"</p><p>The United Nations maintains an independent panel of experts determined the evidence implicating its troops to be inconclusive. Questioned for this article, those same experts said Keim's work, conducted after their own, provides \"irrefutable molecular evidence\" that Haiti's cholera came from Nepal, in the words of G. Balakrish Nair, an Indian microbiologist. Even so, Anthony Banbury, a UN Assistant Secretary-General, said last week, \"We don't think the cholera outbreak is attributable to any single factor.\"</p><p>Many health officials consider the cholera response \"pretty remarkable,\" as John Vertefeuille, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's director in Haiti, said.</p><p>A sky-high initial fatality rate of over 9 per cent has declined to 1.3 per cent (less than 1 per cent is considered a well-managed epidemic). And the most recent statistics show new cases dropping to 120 daily.</p><p>Others, though, believe the bar for success was set too low and more lives could have been saved. Some critics bemoan weak disease surveillance and case-tracking, others inadequate water distribution and latrine building, and still others what they see as a penny-pinching reluctance to use antibiotics and the cholera vaccine.</p><p>Also, some think cholera could have been stymied last winter during the dry season after the first wave. Instead, it flared with the rains even as aid groups shut down or reduced operations. And now health authorities fear a reprise.</p><p>\"I think it's going to be another bad year for cholera,\" said Dr. John Carroll, an Illinois doctor who works in Haiti.</p><p>Inside City Hall, the deputy mayor described how he personally buried 27 bodies for fear that workers would not take precautions, how he nearly lost two of his children to cholera and how he seethed every time Nepalese troops entered his offices.</p><p>\"They were in my face every day, and the feeling inside me got stronger and stronger,\" said Ocxama Moise, the deputy mayor. \"A few months ago, I even considered killing a soldier or two to see what would happen. I shared the idea with some friends and they said, 'Don't. You're an official.' But it's only a matter of time before the population finds a way to get justice.\"</p><p>Haiti had escaped the cholera that raged through Latin America in the 1990s, and even the cholera that struck the Caribbean in the 19th century. It appeared \"extremely unlikely\" that cholera would present itself, a CDC post-earthquake brief said. Seven months later, that assumption would be challenged.</p><p>On October 8, 2010, hundreds of Nepalese troops began arriving in Haiti after a cholera outbreak in their homeland, where cholera is endemic; the country weathers outbreaks well, with that one causing nine deaths. Cholera also affects individuals differently; many infected develop no symptoms or only mild diarrhoea.</p><p>Falling violently ill in October 2010, Pelette was not one of the lucky ones. Severe cholera causes profuse watery diarrhoea, often accompanied by vomiting. Treatment is straightforward: replacing lost fluids and electrolytes, orally or intravenously. But those like Pelette who get no treatment can become so dehydrated they go into shock and swiftly die.</p><p>Enter the epidemic</p><p>A couple of hours after Pelette died from what the family priest proclaimed to be a poison of some sort, Rosemond Laurime, 21, a \"small-businessman\" in his family's description, got sick in nearby Meille.</p><p>From Meille, the epidemic coursed through the Artibonite River valley, landing with a thump 75 kilometres north-west, and downstream, in the coastal Saint-Marc area. On October 19, three children died in rapid succession in a classroom in the rice fields. On October 20, the St. Nicholas Hospital was overrun.</p><p>Patients sprawled on every surface, doubled and tripled up on beds, in the halls, in the courtyard and even on the pavement outside. By nightfall, there were 404. Forty-four died.</p><p>\"At that moment, I felt like I didn't want to live any longer myself,\" said Dr Yfto Mayette, the hospital director. \"It was so sudden and so brutal.\"</p><p>On October 21, as a brass band accompanied Pelette's white coffin to the cemetery, the US national laboratory completed its analysis of the bacteria. It was cholera.</p><p>In Port-au-Prince, Jocelyne Pierre-Louis, a senior Haitian health official, had steeled herself. \"We were in a way waiting for the other shoe to drop,\" she said. \"We had barely picked ourselves up after the earthquake when the cholera fell on us.\"</p><p>The 'blame game'</p><p>Within a week of the outbreak, officials in Mirebalais were pointing fingers at the UN base, and UN officials were trying to stifle what they portrayed as rumours. The struggle began between those who thought determining the epidemic's origin was important and those who lamented \"the blame game\".</p><p>At first, the United Nations said the base's handling of its waste met international standards - that it used sealed septic tanks, which were regularly emptied by a Haitian contractor, with the waste buried in a proper landfill.</p><p>But on October 27, Al-Jazeera filmed peacekeepers with shovels \"working furiously to contain what looks like a sewage spill\". Latrines appeared to be emptying black liquid directly into the river, a reporter said, and the air smelled foul with excrement.</p><p>That same day, the Associated Press observed an overflowing septic tank at the base and discovered the landfill to be open pits in a residential area uphill from the community's bathing stream.</p><p>Even four months later, the United Nations' own experts, examining the base's supposedly improved sanitation, discovered haphazard piping with \"significant potential for cross-contamination\" between toilets and showers.</p><p>Before long, hundreds of Haitians were marching on the base, with demonstrations spreading to Port-au-Prince and riots developing in Cap Haitien. Edmond Mulet, then head of the UN stabilisation mission, complained that it was \"really unfair to accuse the UN for bringing cholera into Haiti\". UN officials believed agitators were taking advantage of the issue to sow unrest before November elections. But many Haitians were genuinely incensed - and fearful. Some wanted an explanation, others a scapegoat.</p><p>In early November, the CDC said Haitian cholera samples matched strains commonly found in South Asia.</p><p>Delay and disbelief</p><p>In February 2011, nearly four months after the outbreak, the United Nations' independent experts arrived in Haiti.</p><p>The Secretary-General's office wanted them to move quickly but not too quickly; it did not want the findings released until the Nepalese contingent had concluded its six-month rotation, Daniele Lantagne, an American engineer, said.</p><p>When the experts revealed their findings in May, the Secretary-General's staff members were surprised, Lantagne said. Early theories had proposed environmental explanations for the outbreak.</p><p>\"I believe they fully expected our results to be that there was no possibility cholera was imported into Haiti,\" she said.</p><p>Instead, the panel said not only that the cholera had come from South Asia but that it originated in the tributary behind the Nepalese base.</p><p>Yet the UN experts noted \"the introduction of this cholera strain as a result of environmental contamination with faeces could not have been the source of such an outbreak without simultaneous water and sanitation and health care system deficiencies\". And they diplomatically concluded that the epidemic was \"not the fault of, or deliberate action of, a group or individual\".</p><p>It is tempting now when reported cholera cases are at a low for Haitians to relax their guard and for health officials to take a breather.</p><p>\"We are no longer 24/7 cholera,\" said Pierre-Louis, the senior Haitian health official. The same thing happened last year. Then the rains hit and Port-au-Prince, like other places, experienced more cases - 24,000 - during a 42-day period than at the epidemic's start. It was a scramble to deal with the surge; many grants had expired, emergency workers had gone home and treatment centres were closed.</p><p>Vertefeuille of the CDC also said cholera was likely to persist in Haiti, without the development of water and sanitation systems. A singular achievement was the opening of Haiti's first wastewater treatment site last year.</p><p>However, many express keen frustration that the dry season is not being used for aggressive case tracking - chasing the disease into pockets where it flares, investigating and chlorinating the water source and mobilising the community.</p><p>\"You can't wait with your arms crossed until the rain falls again,\" Piarroux said. \"You have to go after these areas like firemen trying to extinguish every last burning ember of a forest fire.\"</p><p>In Meille, the walled gate at the UN base is freshly painted now with the insignia of Uruguayan peacekeepers. The Nepalese are gone. The mission itself is reducing its forces nationwide. Nepal's troop strength is being cut by two-thirds, more than any other country's. UN officials said that this was unrelated to tensions over cholera.</p><p>But people here think otherwise: \"If they hadn't left, we would have burned it down,\" Moise, the deputy mayor, said of the base.</p><p>Behind the base, the stream where the epidemic began bustles with life now as it did before the outbreak; many who live and work beside it have no other access to free water.</p><p>Recently, just behind the base's barbed-wire periphery, Dieula Senechal squatted with her skirt hiked up, scrubbing clothes while a naked 6-year-old girl, Magalie Louis, defecated by the bank and splashed into the water to brush her teeth.</p><p>Approaching with a machete on his way to hack some cane, her gap-toothed father, Legenord Louis, said Magalie had contracted cholera late last year but after four days of \"special IVs\" was restored to health. He knew the river water was probably not safe, he said, but, while they brushed their teeth in it, they did not swallow.</p><p>For drinking water, Louis said, his family relies on a local well. But he lives from hand to mouth and cannot afford water purification tablets. So he gambles.</p><p>\"If you make it to the hospital,\" he said, \"you survive the cholera\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS, ONE ILLUSTRATION: Risky ... a child and a woman at the river tributary in Meille.

The idea was to shift timber operations to regrowth areas and dramatically expanded plantations, while drawing up careful, detailed assessment plans before logging proceeded in any native forest area.</p><p>At present, NSW forest and plantations provide little more than half the sawn wood requirements of the State, with the remainder imported. The goal for 2015 is to meet 90% of the State's own needs.</p><p>But not at the expense of the environment.</p><p>At present, there is no new logging proceeding outside plantations or regrowth areas. Logging quotas have been cut to about 50% of 1995 levels.</p><p>New parks and wilderness areas have been declared, including a substantial increase to the Barrington wilderness area.</p><p>But these moves have caused a great deal of pain for traditional timber companies and the communities like Gloucester, Bulahdelah and Stroud which have relied on them.</p><p>One prediction is that half of NSW sawmills will close. Since reform began, Boral Timber has closed seven NSW operations, including a December 11 announcement of the closure of Gloucester's sawmill in March, putting 30 employees out of work.</p><p>Industry estimates have cited 350 of 1200 jobs at risk across the Hunter.</p><p>WE lay the blame fair and square on Mr Carr for locking up timber resources in wilderness areas and ignoring the social consequences,' Gloucester council's general manager, Mr Norm McLeod, said.</p><p>Environmentalists, however, have long been concerned about overharvesting native forests, pointing to soil erosion, water pollution, loss of habitat, ecosystem destruction and contributing to the greenhouse effect. Regrowth forests are a sad replacement, they say.</p><p>Armed with opinion polls that consistently show a majority of Australians opposed to woodchipping of State forests, the Newcastle Wilderness Society barraged Newcastle City Council in September with 1000 letters, pushing unsuccessfully for a boycott of Boral Timber products.</p><p>Mr Cooper said the bottom line was that the forests belong to the people.</p><p>`And we've got the important and responsible role of managing them for the people,' he said, adding people have the power to make their wishes known through voting and through soon-to-be-established public Harvest Advisory Boards.</p><p>`Management must become adaptive to community expectation and the process has to be transparent. People can't just huddle in an office and make decisions.'</p><p>But, make no mistake this is big business and it's supposed to be run as such.</p><p>Mr Cooper, 52, manages a budget of $5million, oversees 240,000ha of forests 60 employees and is expected to return dividends to the Government in exchange for the taxpayer investment.</p><p>The department is expected to be increasingly innovative in its ways to make money, but a full 75% of its income comes from the sale of timber.</p><p>And Mr Cooper is a great proponent of increasing the use of timber.</p><p>`One thing that concerns me is that people don't realise what a valuable renewable resource timber is,' he said.</p><p>`Coal and oil will run out, they won't be there forever. Iron ore and aluminum supplies won't go on forever either: these are non-renewable resources and it takes a lot of energy to extract them and a lot of pollutants are created in the process.</p><p>`When you look at timber, it is a renewable resource and there are less energy inputs into your product. Timber needs water, carbon dioxide . . . and it needs sunlight. And if sunlight runs out, I suggest we're in deep trouble already.'</p><p>Environmentally, that makes timber a more viable option than steel. And Mr Cooper said we were all large consumers of timber whether we liked it or not.</p><p>`There has been a huge increase in the pulp and paper industry from things like faxes and photocopiers,' he said. `The days of having one circular and passing it around are over. Instead, we run off a copy for everyone.'</p><p>In his long forestry career, Mr Cooper has done almost everything related to trees.</p><p>`We develop as multi-skilled people. When you're a forester, you're there as a firefighter, a forest industry engineer, a silviculturalist (tree planter), a school tour guide, a land-use manager, a harvester you're there to run the whole business.' *</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Branching out: The new Hunter Regional manager of State Forests, with staff in the new King St, Newcastle, office.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P89-SVT0-TXN5-T2FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NHLDAU-4yi01g7en2c17jpbblrc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NHLDAU1998</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314240</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1998 Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newcastle Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>January 10, 1998 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Hunter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Nature/Environment/Conservation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places Locations/Forests</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

There's something Darwinian happening here: we either evolve, or various businesses and our way of life will die out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After all, the Earth does not belong to us, we belong to it, so it's our responsibility to manage climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for the Environment, should do something for our environment and insist that Prime Minister John Howard ratify the Kyoto Protocol before it's too late.</p><p>Dixie Coulton</p><p>Elizabeth Bay</p><p/><p>Cut the claptrap</p><p>The CSIRO did not make a scientific announcement yesterday. It made a political one. It did not quote any recent studies, but rehashed disproven old theories.</p><p>Climate change is occurring, but it requires a lot more than emotional scare-mongering to combat it. Controlling carbon emissions is like using a wet bag to fight a forest fire. Models can't predict future climate because the data used in them is inadequate. When some real scientific data is put into this debate instead of the emotional claptrap -- ''Will someone think of the children?'' -- the better equipped we will be to do something real about climate change.</p><p>Charlie Kenny</p><p>Penrith</p><p/><p>More out of Africa</p><p>Kevin Andrews' move to cease accepting any more refugees from Africa until next year is inhumane ('African refugee scheme is closed,' The Daily Telegraph, October 3).</p><p>It is hardly surprising that some refugees have had problems. Many of them have lived through horrors that most of us can only imagine. This is the nature of being a refugee: it is not a cosy fireside choice made by the comfortably-off.</p><p>To say that we have reached our quota is unacceptable to those with a sense of justice.</p><p>Janet McNeill</p><p>Redfern</p><p/><p>Some home truths</p><p>We are running out of water, and don't forget that water is life. Our infrastructure -- roads, schools, hospitals, etc -- can't cope with the increase of the population. Everything we need to maintain our prosperity is in disarray in spite of a stong economy. The main priority should be to fix all these problems, then we can start talking about immigration.</p><p>In a democratic society the people should decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. Is it hard to have a referendum on this issue because I'm sure that would seal many lips.</p><p>Rick</p><p>Sydney, online comment</p><p/><p>Steer hoons straight</p><p>I believe that hoons are an everyday fact of life ('Safety lessons or prison for hoons,' The Daily Telegraph, October 3). Why? Because there have always been hoons, and there will always be people who want to push the boundaries of man and machine.</p><p>How do you combat people doing this on public roads? Give them more readily available access to secure areas where they can test their mettle. After they scare the wits out of themselves, they will be less inclined to show how fast and furious they are on the street.</p><p>I also believe the key to avoiding idiots behind the wheel has a twofold solution. First, educate young drivers early, in schools, not with some driving instructor out to make a buck passing on bad habits.</p><p>Secondly, harsh fines and immediate loss of licence for anyone not on full open licence if they are caught doing anything wrong. If you actually enforced this law, all those fools would be too scared to do anything in public.</p><p>John</p><p>Townsville</p><p/><p>Scare the idiots</p><p>These hoons are not thinking of anyone else, just the excitement of the speed and the race. So the police, ambulance drivers and a visit to the spinal unit, burns unit and emergency should enlighten them. Hopefully they will make better choices in future and be better safer drivers. Good luck with the program.</p><p>Diane Magaric</p><p>Mt Kuring-gai</p><p/><p>Stop horse-trading</p><p>The Premier of NSW has short arms and long pockets ('Backflip over EI cash for low paid', The Daily Telegraph, October 3). His rescue package for the payment of workers in the racing industry is long overdue.</p><p>The state Government is always happy to take its swag of money from the industry, but are reluctant to hand anything back, especially when the whole industry has its back to the wall.</p><p>This state Government only shows how much out of touch it is with Australian life.</p><p>Dick Filmer</p><p>Manly Vale</p><p/><p>HOT TOPIC</p><p>Blog on ...</p><p>Austin Healey is a halfwit. He has a very high opinion of himself that never really translated to on-field talent.</p><p>Rugby Boy</p><p>Sydney</p><p/><p>I think he has us confused with New Zealand. How can a Pommie have a go at us? They can't play cricket, tennis, rugby, football, they whinge and they don't wash. They are going to get a hiding on Saturday.</p><p>The Rodster</p><p>Sydney</p><p/><p>Surely this brain-dead Pom is kidding. So he doesn't like our way of life -- who cares. If one were to go back over the centuries, one could find a lot not to like about the English. We out here are proud of all our sporting teams, as they have served us well over the years. I hope the Wallabies make you eat your despicable words.</p><p>Dawn Hall</p><p>Acacia Gardens</p><p/><p>Waltzing Matilda, we bloody killed her. Go Ole England and reduce Australia to tears like we did so easily in 2003 in their own backyard. Australia to choke again -- Aussie whingers.</p><p>Poms</p><p>England</p><p/><p>You have to take Austin Healey's words with a touch of spice -- surely we know that by now. However, give him credit, since he was spot-on calling Justin Harrison a ''plank''.</p><p>Rowley Aird</p><p>Hong Kong</p><p/><p>We will see on Saturday if lil' Johnny can stand the heat the loose forwards will put on him. After watching their last game, his boys can't protect him from ours.</p><p>Mark</p><p>Sydney</p><p/><p>Anyone would think this is a two-horse race. Who do you think the all-time champs are? You'll remember when the All Blacks raise the cup.</p><p>Terry Flinders</p><p>Bondi</p><p/><p>SHORT &amp; SHARP</p><p>Why doesn't Christine Anu put the shoe on the other foot ('Anu shows gay support after run-in,' The Daily Telegraph, October 3). The reality is that a 13-year-old with dark skin running around with a gun, real or not, in that area is not something that would surprise many readers. Now she's going to make some complaint about the police for doing their job, wasting time and money to investigate her friend's hurt feelings. And as for being branded a lesbian, she was only asked a question.</p><p>D. Farrelly</p><p>Paddington</p><p/><p>I don't know why so much money is being spent on Diana's inquest ('How did Diana really die,' The Daily Telegraph, October 3). It seems like a pretty elaborate scheme. If they really wanted to get rid of her, a staged suicide would have been the way to go. She had attempted it before and few would have asked questions if she had done it again</p><p>Robert Thompson</p><p>Wyong</p><p/><p>In reply to Brett McMillan ('Your Say,' October 2), the Grants Commission and the States worked out a share of the GST to each State. Bob Carr, as then-NSW Premier, would have taken part in the discussions.</p><p>Pat Hutchinson</p><p>Narromine</p><p/><p>The new Commissioner of Police, Andrew Scipione, has stated he intends to make his mark on the force with his leadership. Does this include excusing officers when they remove identification badges because they ''may be used as weapons against officers''? We saw this under the Premiership of Bob Askin, and it wasn't any better then than now. That's a step back, Mr Scipione.</p><p>David Jerome</p><p>Berry</p><p/><p>What a pack of hypocrites the Labor Party is ('Labor pulls rates ad,' The Daily Telegraph, October 3). During the bad old days of the Keating era, when interest rates were at 17 per cent plus, my daughter lost the house she was buying. To put the icing on the cake, Keating introduced capital gains tax. They couldn't manage a piggy bank.</p><p>J. M. Samios</p><p>Davistown</p><p/><p>As a Pom living in Australia for the past six months, it has really surprised me the one-way criticism, loathing and narrow-mindedness of a majority of Aussies who think England care what the Australians think of them ('Friendly rivalry?

While others, in my opinion, book months too early, I usually attempt to book weeks too late.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the other hand, my mismanagements have sometimes turned out luckily.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indeed, that is how I first discovered my favourite holiday destination in Europe, the large Mediterranean island of Corsica.</p><p>Officially Corsica is part of France. As such, it can claim the highest number of hours of sunshine of any French department, not least because it lies further to the south than anywhere else in France.</p><p>Yet, because much of the island is high above sea level, the climate is seldom excessively hot, even in high summer. Soft winds blow much of the year round off the surrounding sea.</p><p>Although the island is only 200km in length, it boasts a higher mountain than anything in Australia. Monte Cinto, which is situated in the northwest of the island, is some 500m higher than Mount Kosciuszko.</p><p>Much of the inland of Corsica, which is known sometimes as the Granite Isle, is mountainous and primitive. Roads to some areas are certainly not for the faint-hearted yet generally reward visitors with breathtaking views or with a personal discovery of some village that has remained virtually unchanged since the 18th century.</p><p>My first experience of Corsica arose through my failure to book a cabin for the 24-hour sea crossing which links Britain with northern Spain. Understandably, my female friend declined to spend that length of time sitting on deck.</p><p>So what else could my regular travel agent suggest at very short notice in the peak period of the European holiday season? He did have one villa which was always difficult to let. That was because access to it was up a precipitous, twisting, slippery track with a sharp drop to one side lying in wait for the inebriated or unskilful.</p><p>\"I'll take it,\" I cried in relief.</p><p>However, after my first hair-raising ascent of the track to the villa near Propriano, in the southwest of Corsica, I wondered how often I would venture out again during the next fortnight.</p><p>Yet what glories awaited us.</p><p>At 500m, the villa I rented was the last evidence of development on the hillside. Beyond the garden, le maquis began: the thick carpet of aromatic vegetation which covers all but the highest peaks of the island. The odours of myrtle, arbutus, rosemary and thyme mingle with those of ever-present pine trees to create a heady, almost intoxicating scent.</p><p>The great Napoleon, who was Corsica's most famous son, always claimed that he could smell myrtle the moment he approached the isle of his birth by ship.</p><p>The fine house of Napoleon's family is only one of the many attractions of the large seaport of Ajaccio. Ajaccio with a population of 60,000 and Bastia with 40,000 are the only large towns on a generally under-populated island.</p><p>In the 19th century, when the total population of Corsica stood at about 100,000, that figure was depleted annually to the tune of 1000 men by the depredations of the vendetta, the name given to the murderous family feuds which were once central to Corsican codes of honour. Those fascinated by the history of such feuds can let their imaginations run free in the ancient and gloomy southern town of Sartene where for years members of feuding families hardly dared to leave their houses.</p><p>A vendetta could begin with something as trivial as a donkey wandering on to someone else's land or a too admiring glance aimed at someone else's sister.</p><p> Indeed, the tradition of the vendetta may well have accounted for the longevity of one of the world's more amazing archaeological secrets.</p><p>Fifty odd years ago English author Dorothy Carrington was chatting with a local farmer in Corsica's southwest. The conversation ran roughly like this:</p><p>Carrington: \"Have you heard about the amazing carved menhir (standing stone) someone's just found?\" Farmer: \"What's so surprising about that? I've got plenty of them on my property.\"</p><p>Broadly speaking, this was how Filitosa was discovered -- a kind of Corsican Stonehenge. The stone warriors of Filitosa are 4000 years old yet represent only one of the wonderful megalithic sites found on Corsica.</p><p>As I have mentioned, people did not wander across other people's land in the old days of the vendetta. That was why Filitosa's secret was preserved.</p><p>Happily, landowners are mostly less touchy these days. I managed to track down another extraordinary site myself after a long trek across fields.</p><p>When I got there, several cows were my sole companions as they scratched their backs on a double line of some 70 historic stones.</p><p>Modern Corsica is French-speaking and generally offers homelier versions of French cuisine. On the other hand, wonderful local seafood, including lobsters, are available at most beachside cafes and restaurants. These are usually washed down with a local dry rose.</p><p>Superb beaches abound, on the western, rockier side of the island especially.</p><p>For those swimming near Propriano, however, a particular hazard exists. This comes in the form of bright yellow, twin-engined firefighting aircraft which swoop down on to the sea's surface to fill their water-tanks. At least one snorkeller has been said to have been swept up and deposited rather unwillingly on a forest fire.</p><p>Although distances are not great in Corsica, travel by car tends to be slow owing to narrow, twisting roads. If you want to explore the island thoroughly, allow two or three weeks at least. In high summer, the narrow roads can also be crowded with coaches and buses. So here is a good tip.</p><p>IF YOU do not especially like being the motorist permanently exposed to huge, unsecured drops, circumnavigate the coast of Corsica clockwise (the French drive on the right). This advice applies particularly to Cap Corse which sticks up like a finger at the top of the island.</p><p>When is the best time of the year to visit Corsica?</p><p>My choice would be late May, June or late September.</p><p>I have flown there from London but also travelled there on a giant car ferry from the French port of Toulon. This ferry is 12 decks in height and about 170m long. Standing on the top deck in the harbour of Toulon you probably have the best vantage-point in town.</p><p>Corsica offers beautiful historic towns, untamed countryside, lovely beaches and an agreeable climate. Remarkable butterflies, moths and other insects abound, as do handsome wildflowers in the aromatic maquis. Le maquis also gives its name to the island's best hotel which is situated just south of Ajaccio.</p><p>If you like top-class food, a private beach and floodlit tennis court, sea views and a restaurant by the pool, Le Maquis could be your kind of place. It is certainly mine although I could never really quite afford it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML0108181T05832421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIERMAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44DT-WDV0-015G-Y0MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1130\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Courier Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>August 18, 2001, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp; OBSERVANCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WVI</classCode><className>DESTINATIONS &amp; ATTRACTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GS0008X1U</classCode><className>CORSE, FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3C5</classCode><className>GREAT DIVIDING RANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3D5</classCode><className>MOUNT KOSCIUSZKO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And much of the media's attention has broadly been on the fact that things just aren't as they used to be.</p><p>But to be objective, and identify a few of the trees amongst a forest on fire, reveals a couple of valid reasons for the run of outs, and probably a more familiar scenario for the weeks to come.</p><p>Sure, the Magpies have had a lean month, just like all good sides do from time to time. Like the Eagles, for example. But as a general principle it's not an all bad thing to be ironing out flaws and functioning at less than peak performance in the month of May.</p><p>Consider for a moment the losses Port is having to cover. Where analysts tend to give other struggling clubs the benefit of the doubt by focusing on their player losses, how many times have you heard about the Magpies' difficulty in replacing valued stock? More than that - it has to be reluctantly conceded - how many times have you heard Port itself bleat about the loss of personnel? The answer to both questions is rarely, if ever.</p><p>Surely they could be forgiven for being tempted, because a quick summary reveals some critical departures in the past two years.</p><p>Greg Phillips, Mark Williams, Nathan Buckley, Braden Lyle, Che Cockatoo-Collins, Shane Wakelin, Bruce Abernethy, Danny Hughes, Troy and Shane Bond have all moved on. And long-term injuries to David Hutton, Paul Northeast, Adrian Settre, Daryl Borlase, Paul Rigoni, Tony Malakellis and Richard Foster complete a list that is in itself the backbone of a team.</p><p>A list that understandbly dictates a need for re-organising and re-stabilising. It's not unique to Port by any means, but it is a definite factor.</p><p>In itself, the volume of new and young faces means a little more fragility, and less of an established commitment to the mystique of the only remaining lace-up jumper.</p><p>It also remains that despite the protestations of the Magpie administration and team leaders that the very emotive and public AFL bid has no bearing on the teams performance, it is impossible for that not to be the case. It must be a distraction at some level, at some time.</p><p>Whether it is a direct thought process in a player's mind concerning the possibilities of his personal future; or the constant barrage that would surely be confronted in everyday life from an inquisitive public</p><p>- it's no doubt a diversion from the ideal preparation.</p><p>But it is conceivably less likely to be a factor when the finals series looms in three months time, and the focus switches to a certain participation in the major round.</p><p>The Magpies still represent a very powerful side, and one which is bound to recover from its woes.</p><p>A side that boasts the experience of Tim Ginever, Roger Delaney, Stephen Williams, Darren Smith and George Fiacchi; and is complemented by the exuberance and dash of youngsters like Damien Angove, Troy Olsen and Stephen Carter will bounce back. Especially when one considers the added riches available in front of goal.</p><p>Jack Cahill has declared that his own worth should be questioned if Port does not make the five this year. And though this has fuelled the forest fire for those with suspicious minds who believe Jack may already know what he's doing next year, it is more likely based on the huff and puff that has been the cornerstone of the Magpies' long-term success.</p><p>There is also an element of confidence for the coach in the knowledge that the quality of personnel is there. With some work and greater urgency it will come together because the bottom line is that Port is a good side, going through a difficult patch. So if your fingers are crossed for a continuation of Magpie misery, you might be disappointed, even though tomorrow's match has seceded No. 1 billing.</p><p>Certainly the Redlegs themselves have not pulled their weight in creating that top billing for the game by displaying such erratic and generally poor form. And against a Port side which invariably plays better at home, it is a daunting task for Norwood.</p><p>The match-of-the-day status accorded to the EAGLES and CENTRAL DISTRICT is essentially because of the Bulldogs' wonderfully committed performances over the season, and more particularly in recent weeks.</p><p>Extraordinarily, over the past two months the 'Dogs have won their games by an astounding average of 75 points, and had their daylight outings upset only by North Adelaide.</p><p>But the Eagles, having endured their own mini-slump until last week's extraordinary second-half revival, look to have a little too much scoring power. Though based on the night final a couple of weeks ago, it promises to be a defensively tough and absorbing bout.</p><p>GLENELG should be able to bounce back and roll a rejuvenated SOUTH at Adelaide Oval, and WEST will enjoy hosting NORTH for the second time this season by also scoring a win.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>2 photos: john cahill; roger delaney; John Cahill: Has declared his own worth should bequestioned if Port doesn't make five.

Adam Morton reports. NEVILLE Nicholls is a climate scientist. He has long believed his role was research, not advocacy. But when he woke on the morning following Black Saturday, turned on his TV and caught his breath after witnessing the shocking aerial footage of what was once Marysville, he instinctively blamed himself. </p><p>\"My initial thought was: is this my fault? Has this happened because I haven't been out there saying that this stuff is going to have catastrophic consequences for us?\" he recalls. \"It is the first time I have ever been shaken from my belief that I shouldn't be an advocate on climate change.\" Nicholls - an Australian Research Council professorial fellow at Monash University and an author and reviewer with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - resolved to take more responsibility to be a public voice; not to lobby for a particular political response, but to explain and defend the science that is his life's work. He wasn't alone. Increasingly, as the first decade of the century unfolded, Australia's most decorated scientists in climate fields were concerned that published evidence in their areas of expertise was being misused or ignored. Believing they faced a misinformation campaign driven by fossil-fuel interests and an intransigent political system, they formed Climate Scientists Australia as a means to improve the quality of public information and decision-making. For some members, the challenge they faced was underscored in July when the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission released its four-volume final report and made little reference to climate change. It has been said so often that it should be well known by now: no extreme event can be definitively blamed on the surge in atmospheric greenhouse gases since industrialisation. But when events closely replicate what dozens of climate models have predicted will come, neither can they and climate change be divorced. The 13 members of Climate Scientists Australia believe February 7, 2009, was such a case: 46.4 degrees in Melbourne - not just the city's hottest day on record, but more than 3 degrees warmer than February's previous maximum. Coinciding with turbulent winds and coming after a record 12 years of below-average rains, it added to an unprecedented score of 172 on the Forest Fire Danger Index, according to a report to the royal commission by Melbourne University fire ecologist Dr Kevin Tolhurst. Ash Wednesday in 1983 - the second-worst day for dangerous fire conditions - rated just 120, the devastating 1939 inferno 100. In the October edition of the Bulletin of the Australian Meteorological &amp; Oceanographic Society, Nicholls summarised: \"A quantitative analysis leaves no doubt that the combination of weather conditions leading up to Black Saturday, and on the day, had not been observed previously in the 150 years of Melbourne instrumental weather data.\" The commission, though, found neither the day nor the fires were unprecedented, accepting oral evidence from land and fuel management experts that the Black Saturday fires were not a shift from what had come before. Nicholls, one of several scientists to lodge a submission with the commission linking the fires with human-induced climate change, was surprised. \"I think a focus on the fact that we had not previously seen such extreme fire weather and climate conditions is important,\" he says. \"If we simply note that Black Saturday was just another instance of serious fires occurring in association with hot, dry, windy conditions, then we could lose sight of how extraordinary the weather conditions were, and we may not consider changes in strategy that could help us cope with even more extreme fires in the future.\" The public debate over climate change has yielded its share of controversies, confected and otherwise, but in the eyes of leading scientists the royal commission's response is emblematic of the biggest of the past 10 years: the failure to convince policymakers and shapers to take the warnings of the world's most reputable scientific agencies seriously enough to respond effectively. The global public's awareness of climate change grew significantly over the decade, but by this year, according to some polls, its acceptance of the science had diminished. The decline was particularly marked in Britain and the US. Britain was home to the so-called \"Climategate\" affair, in which senior scientists were accused of manipulating data after ambiguous emails were leaked from the University of East Anglia. The scientists were exonerated of the most serious claims of dishonesty by a series of inquiries, but the damage was done - the findings clearing their names received only a fraction of the press coverage of the initial allegations. A separate investigation by the InterAcademy Council recommended changes to the IPCC, including greater care and transparency, but found its work synthesising published climate science was mostly successful. In the US, there was a concerted attack from the resurgent Republican Party and influential parts of the media claiming climate science was a hoax and conspiracy. A University of Maryland study published this month found Fox News viewers were 30 percentage points more likely to incorrectly believe that most scientists do not agree that climate change is occurring, or that views are split. The public mood was not helped by the debacle of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009, which left people with the not unreasonable perception that the world's leaders had no idea how to tackle the problem. The recent follow-up meeting in Cancun managed to glue the pieces of the broken talks back together, but left the most challenging issues in forging a new treaty to build on the Kyoto Protocol - which covers little more than a quarter of global emissions - to a later date. Meanwhile, the claims made on climate change's behalf continued to mount. Delegates in Cancun were handed a report by aid agency Oxfam, quoting insurance agency Munich Re, which had linked 21,000 deaths in the first nine months of 2010 to climate change. It was twice the number of casualties caused by extreme weather in all of 2009. The mid-year floods that soaked a fifth of Pakistan alone killed about 2000 people and affected the lives of 20 million. The same weather system caused extraordinary summer heat in near-Arctic Russia that wiped out crops, caused rampant wildfires and doubled the usual summer death rate for Moscow. It rang alarm bells for those familiar with the IPCC's projection, based on more than 20 climate models that to date had proved remarkably accurate, that a significant temperature rise above pre-industrial levels would increase the likelihood of floods in southern Asia and the risk of heat waves and wildfires in Europe. The New York Times - a journal of influence not known for running hard on the science of climate change - responded by running front-page pictures of the Pakistani and Russian disasters alongside a shot of storms pummelling Chicago under the headline \"In weather chaos, a case for global warming\". \"The climate is changing,\" the National Climatic Data Centre's Jay Lawrimore told the paper. \"Extreme events are occurring with greater frequency, and in many cases with greater intensity.\" Munich Re reported that its database of natural catastrophes showed the number of extreme weather events such as windstorms and floods had tripled since 1980 \"and the trend is expected to persist\". Not everyone working in the area is comfortable with linking the current shift in extreme events with greenhouse gases. There is disagreement in the scientific literature over whether extreme weather disasters have started to worsen. According to one view, there is little to no change in the proportions of people affected once population growth is factored in. What does not remain a contested area in the scientific literature is that the planet is getting hotter. Analysing the data from the world's three temperature datasets, the World Meteorological Organisation last month reported that the past decade was the warmest since instrumental measurement began in 1850, and 2010 was on track to be the hottest year, and certainly in the top three, regardless of the extraordinary snow dumps clogging European and US cities over Christmas. (There is significant evidence to suggest that global warming is responsible for the extreme northern winters of the past two years. An increase in air pressure in the Arctic atmosphere caused by warmer heat coming off a relatively ice-free ocean is pushing cold air south.) Eighteen countries broke their records for the hottest day ever this year. Only one year in the 20th century - 1998 - was warmer than any so far in the 21st. The noughties was the decade of the killer heatwave. Western Europe was hit in August 2003, when extreme heat was estimated to have contributed to the deaths of 46,000. About a third of the deaths were in France. Usually home to mild summers, it was unprepared for the impact on the weak and elderly of a week's worth of days hotter than 40 degrees. There were widespread crop failures and forest fires, particularly in southern Europe. About a tenth of Portugal's forests burned. In Australia, Victoria had never had three consecutive days above 42 degrees until January last year, when there were three above 43 degrees. The horrendous bushfire death toll in early February was dwarfed by the \"invisible disaster\" of the January heatwave, which is estimated to have killed 500 people in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Perhaps the biggest step-change came in Russia this past northern summer, when at least five days in Moscow topped 100 degrees fahrenheit (37.78 degrees celsius) - a barrier that had never been crossed. An estimated 15,000 people died and the country's massive grain harvest was devastated by wildfire. According to Russian state weather service chief Alexander Frolov, it was the country's worst heatwave in a millennium. \"Nothing like it can be seen in the archives,\" he said. Nicholls says there are clear similarities between the three disasters, and others in Pakistan, Greece and California: \"They have all been unprecedented, they all killed a lot of people and destroyed a lot of infrastructure.\" Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. Earlier this month the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii showed that atmospheric carbon dioxide had reached 390 parts per million - a 40 per cent increase on pre-industrial levels. All of this is in line with the IPCC's most recent assessment report, published in 2007, which found that there was at least 90 per cent certainty that most of the increase in the globe's temperature since mid-last century was due to the rise in industrial greenhouse gases. Even the world's most prominent climate sceptic, Lord Christopher Monckton, whose arguments have been shown by mechanical engineering professor John Abraham to repeatedly misrepresent the science he claims to be quoting, has acknowledged there is a greenhouse effect warming the planet, though he disputes its extent. There is, of course, still significant uncertainty about the future impact of climate change. But the fundamentals predicted by climate models - marked declines in Arctic sea ice in summer, rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and glacier melt and increases in temperature - are being matched by observations. That's the science. The response, the politics and economics, remain thornier still. The preferred model under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol is carbon trading, under which emissions are capped and pollution permits exchanged so that the cheapest way to meet the target can be found. This method has been adopted haphazardly across Europe, New Zealand and a band of US states, with more countries including Australia and China looking at signing up. There is near-universal agreement among economists that a carbon price is the most efficient way to reduce emissions, but carbon trading faces criticism that, while nice in theory, it is ineffective in the real world when it includes poorly policed offset schemes. For separate reasons, the US Congress has rejected a national trading scheme; Japan and South Korea have postponed a decision on theirs. What are the hopes of a global solution to this diabolical problem? A recent prognosis by the Paris-based International Energy Agency found the national targets submitted under last year's loose Copenhagen Accord would put the world on a path of 3.5 degrees of warming by the end of the century. Even if you assume that countries introduce policies to back their international promises - Australia and the US, to name just two, currently have no way of meeting their targets - few scientists or policymakers expect the temperature rise to be kept within 2 degrees, the goal agreed under the UN process. In Australia, next year will see a concerted effort from Labor, the Greens and significant parts of the business community to introduce a carbon price - most likely a tax that could evolve into carbon trading. If they succeed, attention is likely to turn to the challenge that has just begun to enter the public debate but will increasingly arise over the next decade: adapting to unavoidable change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>SIX PHOTOS: CLOCKWISE FROM TOP: Smoke in Moscow from the August fires; Black Saturday 2009; blizzards this week in New York; Hurricane Katrina in 2005 prompted more discussion about storm strengths and global warming; the July floods in Pakistan (and cover image).

John Borthwick kicks back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WITH 2073 bends in the tortuous road between the northern Thailand towns of Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son, it is little wonder that many travellers leap off the bus at Pai, roughly halfway along the 248-kilometre route.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I stopped here for a day - three weeks ago.\" It's not unusual to overhear comments like this in the cafes of Pai, a once snoozy hill village that has blossomed into Backpacker Central for young travellers from everywhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pai (pronounced \"Bye\"), is where Thai meets tie-dyed. Where sheeshas, reiki, reggae, dreadlocks and downloads are now more common than rice noodles and som tam salad.</p><p>Gladly putting the 137 kilometres of snakes-and-ladders curves from Chiang Mai behind me, I slip into the hot mineral water tub on the deck at Thapai Hotspring Resort. I'm overlooking a river and the wild baize of rice fields beyond it, and when I extract myself at last from this soporific soaking there will be fresh river fish and cold beer waiting in the restaurant. A very agreeable slice of Pai.</p><p>In 1991 Pai had seven guesthouses and three restaurants. Now there are about 150 places of accommodation, from backpacker dorms to unpretentious spa retreats, and a similar number of cafes and restaurants. As a quiet market village, Pai was home to mostly Shan people, originally from nearby Burma. And then \"the dream catchers\" started to drift in - creative wanderers, Thai and farang (foreign), drawn by Pai's cool, 600-metre altitude, its hot springs, pretty river and the exotica of the surrounding Karen, Hmong and Lisu hill tribes.</p><p>\"The longer you stay here, the deeper you go,\" muses Jenny, an English backpacker sitting in a Mac-powered internet shop that's called, yes, Apple Pai. She's staying near the Buddhist temple, Wat Klang, at a guesthouse named Pai in the Sky.</p><p>It's easy to see why travellers and Thailand's version of bohemians become so comfortably immersed in the life of Pai. \"A major activity in Pai, well-practised by both locals and tourists, is simply doing nothing,\" says my guidebook. I go in search of this nothing but the options are exhausting. I must choose between learning Thai cooking, the Thai language or Thai massage, or watching Everton play Wigan or numerous other round-ball games live on satellite TV.</p><p>I might buy any amount of hill-tribe tat and embroidery from brightly garbed women of the Acrylic Tribe, get a tattoo, hire a motorcycle, go rafting or try extreme elephant trekking (\"No seat and swim with elephant\").</p><p>Taking the line of least resistance, I opt for a traditional massage where my choice is simply a one- or two-hour session. A languid German lad flops onto the adjacent mattress. \"How long are you doing?\" I ask. \"One month so far,\" he replies.</p><p>Pai is an ambling town, where the folk on the main drag include Muslim women in full burqas, toga-clad Viking sadhus and flamboyantly garbed Thai teens; where every second cafe declares \"WiFi here\" or \"Laptop friendly\"; and where the B-Bop Club or the Sabai Reggae Bar can keep you up all hours. It's like Bangkok's Khao San Road gone bush.</p><p>\"Pai is the kind of place I'd be inclined to despise if there wasn't so much that I liked here,\" one blogger noted. It might not be \"Thailand\", but it is huge fun, and friendly. Having morphed from Buddhism to Buddha Bar, from Shan to Shakira and from opium to cappuccino in the space of one generation, Pai - now with a population of about 10,000 - is riding a wave of prosperity.</p><p>It is also at the point where the hardheads meet the airheads, with the former, the investors, reaping very good financial returns, to the point that earlier visitors now look back with nostalgia at the snoozy, misty Shan village that once was. But that was yesterday. Today everyone wants their piece of Pai.</p><p>First you hear them, then you see them. As our raft bounces down the watery stairs of a rapid on the Nam Khong River, west of Pai, and a stained-glass ceiling of jungle closes over us, the next raft comes round the bend and into sight, shrieking with delight. Noi, Cherry and a group of their Bangkok office pals are on the river, hooting all the way, it would seem, to Mae Hong Son.</p><p>The 45-kilometre river run will take us a day and a half. After a brief demo on how to paddle, we stroke clumsily away, six passengers to a rubber raft, plus a Thai boatman at the stern. Our flotilla of five rafts holds a mixture of Westerners and Thais.</p><p>We drift down a burbling water alley colonnaded by arching stands of giant bamboo and teak. Silence is a concept much admired in the abstract by the Buddhist Thais, but in practice it is nowhere near as much \"sanuk\" (fun) as making noise. So we stroke and scream our way through alternating rapids and calm reaches. There's a sapphire sky overhead and the water is clear and warm. Warm is good because surprise attack water fights are a part of any rafting trip.</p><p>Post-drenching, we drip-dry in the sun, only to get doused again, either by slamming through the moderate rapids or catching another watery broadside from a passing raft. For the Thais the thrill is amplified by the fact that few of them can swim well.</p><p>Late afternoon we stop to swim at a broad, low waterfall before paddling to the jungle camp where we will pass the night deep in the Lumnampai National Park. A long, sheltered sleeping platform with bedding and mosquito nets accommodates us all comfortably. Saucepans, food and beers emerge. Cooking stoves are lit and soon there's a feast to tuck into. With a million stars snagged in the trees above and a thousand frogs burping in the blackness, we share that bush-time pleasure of sitting around the camp fire, yarning with new-found friends.</p><p>Next morning, after a chilly night, we're back into the boats, stroking in a moreco-ordinated manner through the mists. Other than a few brilliant blue kingfishers, there is little apparent wildlife, but paddling amid the park's tall stands of teak, mango and myriad other species is like running a gauntlet of green gods.</p><p>\"There's a hot spring just here. Pull the boat in,\" says our guide, Pu. We hop ashore and dig a trough in the sands, catching the piping hot water that bubbles up. Soon we are wallowing, happy as pigs, and slowly turning into a tom yum farang soup. \"Time to go,\" says Pu, and we stroke on, coming to the confluence of the Nam Khong and Pai rivers. From here the rapids double in size, to about 1.5-metre waves. So too does the squealing volume of the Bangkok ladies' boat. It's like Beatlemania come to the jungle.</p><p>If Pai is a Thai-farang fusion tourist town, then Mae Hong Son, where our whitewater adventure ends, is a living, working Thai town. A place of teak and woodsmoke, of monks and lakes, shophouses and hill folk. And that is the beauty of this north-western border town close to Myanmar's Shan State. Yes, I can find a good cappuccino at the Crossroads Cafe - better than any in hip-hopping Pai - and there is a night market for clothes and hill-tribe crafts, but the majority of shoppers here are Thais, not foreigners.</p><p>For sunset I hoof it up a thousand steps or so to the Doi Kong Mu temple that overlooks the town. Mae Hong Son is known as \"the City of Three Mists\", thanks to its fogs in winter, forest fire haze in summer and rainy mists in wet season. Tonight I can see none, but the next day I find a fourth kind of vapour - the steams rising off the mineral mud baths at Phuklon Mud Spa.</p><p>Two attendants paint me from head to toe in black mud (not a pretty sight), the starting point in an hour-long ritual that involves being scrubbed with tamarind paste, immersed in mineral springs and anointed with lanolin. By then I feel like a million bucks but it has cost me only $25.</p><p>I don't want to leave lovely Mae Hong Son but when I must, it is by air. The lofty pleasure of leap-frogging those 2073 bends back to Chiang Mai in 25 painless minutes is considerable.</p><p>TRIP NOTES</p><p>\u00b7 Thai Airways, Qantas, Emirates and British Airways fly direct to Bangkok from Sydney.
