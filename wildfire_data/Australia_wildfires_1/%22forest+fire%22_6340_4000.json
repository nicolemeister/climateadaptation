In a desperate attempt at survival, the firefighters unfurled their foil-lined emergency shelters, but those offer only limited protection when in the direct path of a fire.</p><p>The lone survivor was serving as a lookout and relaying key information to his colleagues, officials said.</p><p>Mr McDonough notified the others that the weather was changing rapidly and that the fire had switched direction because of the wind. He told them he was leaving and to contact him on the radio if they needed anything, said Wade Ward, a Prescott Fire Department spokesman.</p><p>He said Mr McDonough ``did exactly what he was supposed to''.</p><p>Mr McDonough ``has no desire to speak to anybody at this point,'' he added.</p><p>The US Government overhauled its safety procedures following the deaths of 14 firefighters in Colorado in 1994. ``There are so many striking parallels between this tragedy and what happened on Storm King in 1994, it's almost haunting,'' said Lloyd Burton, professor of environmental law and policy at the University of Colorado.</p><p>Changes included policies under which no firefighters should be deployed unless they had a safe place to retreat. They must also be continuously informed of changing weather.</p><p>The Hotshot team entered the smoky wilderness over the weekend with backpacks, chainsaws and other heavy gear to remove brush and trees and deprive the flames of fuel. But the blaze grew from 80ha to about 800ha in hours.</p><p>More than 400 firefighters are now working on the blaze after the wildfire quadrupled from 800 hectares to more than 3200ha.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML-20130704-1-024-201819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58T8-8CS1-JD3N-540N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - First with the news Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 4, 2013 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

I'm learning to operate plant machinery to prevent fires spreading. I have always been part of the ground firefighter crew, training and remaining on standby to respond to fires. I work with a rake hoe crew felling dangerous trees and driving a 4WD with many litres of water, and am part of the crew on a fire tanker. I am involved with care and maintenance of recreation walking tracks, campsites and historical and environmental areas of significance.</p><p>How I got here: I studied natural resource management at TAFE. During work placement in state parks, I met forest-fire crews and decided to build a career. I began as a seasonal project firefighter then moved into managing project firefighters and fire recovery program contracts and on to what I do now.</p><p>My typical week: Each unique week involves keeping fit, forest patrols, training, maintenance of fuel breaks, roads/tracks and fire equipment. From chainsawing after a wind storm or flying in a helicopter over rugged bush terrain to work on controlling lightning strike damage, my work is very diverse. I also maintain fire pumps or climb fire towers as a fire spotter.</p><p>The good bits: I like being able to work in the great Australian outdoors. I enjoy the variety in my role as each day is different. The team I work with is great and we have a strong sense of camaraderie.</p><p>Work stress: There's plenty of paperwork, which can be painstaking and stressful to complete, but it has to be done. Obtaining all the facts and information is imperative. Generally, I tend not to let things stress me out at work.</p><p>How I relax: During the week, I enjoy going jogging after work with my dog or listening to my iPod. On weekends, I like seeing a live band with mates and unwinding with a drink.</p><p>The next step: I plan to continue operating machinery and training. I look forward to gaining more experience, mentoring crew members and managing larger-scale incidents.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MOVWKY-637xck2n52g5ilor95i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MOVWKY2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54X8-W3G1-JD34-V335-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385831</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Moonee Valley Weekly</publicationName><edition>FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>January 24, 2012 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

There's nothing quite like it. The stinging in the eyes, the burning in the throat, the headaches and coughing. Days that would be clear and bright if the whole city wasn't suffocating under a thick layer of forest fire smoke.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Smoke so thick that the Brindabellas are obscured, and even the Telstra Tower is cloaked in haze for days on end. All the result of fires deliberately lit by the agencies that are supposed to be protecting the population, and instead ensure we are subjected to poisonous pollution for weeks on end, year after year.</p><p>What is the point of taking action to limit our carbon emissions, if our own government agencies simply dump all the carbon stored in bush vegetation back into the atmosphere every autumn?</p><p>Why do we bother phasing out wood-burning heaters, if autumn back-burning ignites 10 times the amount of wood all the wood stoves in Canberra could possibly consume? Why invest in zero-emissions cars, if the government agencies undertake maximum-emissions burns in the forests?</p><p>Why clean up a few hundred asbestos-contaminated houses if we then contaminate the air in every single house with poisonous smoke? Canberra used to pride itself on how clean our drinking water was, what does it matter if every lungful of air is thick with toxins?</p><p>Maybe these activities reduce the chance of material losses once in 50 or 100 years, but they definitely expose the entire population of the city to serious health risks - every single year.</p><p>It's incredible that the autumn burn-offs are allowed to continue.</p><p>Jon Smillie, Duffy</p><p>Ease burden on needy</p><p>The delay in passing the government's \"flagship\" tax package provides the opportunity to pause and reflect (\"Coalition forced to pull flagship tax bill\", March 28, p1).</p><p>The government can now consider lowering the tax cut to big companies and allocate the increased revenue available to areas of greater need. The boost to the economy will be much the same, as will the trickle-down effect, which is usually less than the government estimates anyway. Part of the increased revenue can be used to lessen the effects of the Welfare \"Reform\" Act and to increase the level of unemployment benefits.</p><p>The increase of 50\u00a2 a week provided to single people, for example, is scandalous (\"Sympathy's owing to truly poor\", March 26, p39).</p><p>Herman van de Brug, Kaleen</p><p>Musts for unit dwellers</p><p>Since the ACT government is keen for many more Canberrans to make apartments their principal place of residence, it needs to act to recognise the problems that have been reported for years and restore the community's faith in its ability to manage the future development of our city (\"Developer settles dispute over defects in Braddon apartment complex\", canberratimes.com.au April 23).</p><p>Many wishing to downsize, for example, will be loath to make any moves until they can be assured of being able to reside in a high-quality, stress-free environment.</p><p>The ACT government could recognise growing community concern and the need for up-to-date information about building quality by:</p><p>1. giving the 2019 Canberra Citizen of the Year Award to the body corporate and residents' committee of the Lagani Apartments in Braddon for their outstanding service to the community in revealing the worrying issues and impacts concerning their decade-long battle through the courts to achieve funding for the rectification of major building deficiencies in their complex.</p><p>2. reimbursing all government rates and fees paid by owners of deficient buildings, including both houses and apartments, calculated from date of occupation to the satisfactory rectification of defects.</p><p>3. establishing a publicly accessible list of all future building developments and those that have been constructed over the past 20 years or so, containing key developer and builder details, any subsequent changes of name or liquidations of companies involved in construction, and links to the means of discovering whether action is being taken to rectify major defects.</p><p>Sue Dyer, Downer</p><p>Light rail justified ...</p><p>Max Flint (Letters, May 17) made several unfortunate claims and smears against UnionsACT and our affiliates.</p><p>Mr Flint has spent several years heading up the \"Can the Tram\" group.</p><p>He now goes under a new badge, but has not stopped his light-rail bashing or his union bashing.</p><p>The truth is that UnionsACT does not have a veto over ACT government contracts.</p><p>This is a fever-dream imagined by Michaelia Cash and the Canberra Liberals.</p><p>UnionsACT supports light rail because it creates secure local jobs, improves public transport services, and stimulates the local economy.

Seedlings can also be uprooted in this process.</p><p>During research in the central highlands of Victoria following the Black Saturday fires, Leonard and colleagues noticed that areas that had been heavily worked over by lyrebirds were less likely to be burnt.</p><p>\"We kept seeing the fire had stopped at the margins of gullies where there was obviously lots of lyrebird activity,\" he says.</p><p>\"So we started wondering whether they were affecting the fire behaviour.\"</p><h>Open forest floor</h><p>In a study reported recently in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wildlife Research</emphasis>, Leonard and colleagues found that lyrebirds are more common in unburnt areas.</p><p>The study, led by Daniel Nugent, found the birds prefer an open forest floor with a layer of shrubs at two metres, says Leonard.</p><p>\"It makes it easy for them to get around and forage,\" he says.</p><p>By contrast, the severely burnt forest areas in the study had a very thick undergrowth with thousands of eucalypt seedlings which would make it harder for the birds to forage, says Leonard.</p><p>\"When you have a high intensity fire lyrebirds get killed ... and then you have this mass regeneration of vegetation,\" he says.</p><p>\"The lyrebirds can't forage as effectively, which means you end up with more fuel so the area is more prone to burning.</p><p>\"You have this feedback loop between high severity fire and low abundance of lyrebirds.\"</p><h>Fuel loads</h><p>Leonard and colleagues fenced off areas in the forest to exclude the lyrebirds for a period of nine months. They then measured the fuel load in these areas and compared it to the load in areas next door where lyrebirds were active.</p><p>They found the areas with lyrebirds had on average 25 per cent lower fuel loads, equating to 1.6 tonnes per hectare less fuel.</p><p>The maximum difference was 7.5 tonnes per hectares over the nine months, adds Leonard.</p><p>The researchers plugged the fuel load figures into a Forest Fire Danger Index model to predict the intensity of fire that could occur under different weather conditions.</p><p>They found that in the unfenced plots there was a significant reduction in predicted flame height.</p><p>\"The lyrebirds were essentially reducing fuel loads to the extent that it was very unlikely that a fire would be possible,\" says Leonard.</p><p>In the future, the researchers hope to test their hypothesis that lyrebirds reduce fire risk in a controlled burn.</p><p>Meanwhile, they are also studying malleefowl, which could also perform a similar function in the bush, says Leonard.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCIONL-4111718</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCIONL2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DNS-6W01-JCM0-62PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">369587</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Science Online (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2393\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 24, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Science and Technology/Ecology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Science and Technology/Animals/Birds</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp;

I'm learning to operate plant machinery to prevent fires spreading. I have always been part of the ground firefighter crew, training and remaining on standby to respond to fires. I work with a rake hoe crew felling dangerous trees and driving a 4WD with many litres of water, and am part of the crew on a fire tanker. I am involved with care and maintenance of recreation walking tracks, campsites and historical and environmental areas of significance.</p><p>How I got here: I studied natural resource management at TAFE. During work placement in state parks, I met forest-fire crews and decided to build a career. I began as a seasonal project firefighter then moved into managing project firefighters and fire recovery program contracts and on to what I do now.</p><p>My typical week: Each unique week involves keeping fit, forest patrols, training, maintenance of fuel breaks, roads/tracks and fire equipment. From chainsawing after a wind storm or flying in a helicopter over rugged bush terrain to work on controlling lightning strike damage, my work is very diverse. I also maintain fire pumps or climb fire towers as a fire spotter.</p><p>The good bits: I like being able to work in the great Australian outdoors. I enjoy the variety in my role as each day is different. The team I work with is great and we have a strong sense of camaraderie.</p><p>Work stress: There's plenty of paperwork, which can be painstaking and stressful to complete, but it has to be done. Obtaining all the facts and information is imperative. Generally, I tend not to let things stress me out at work.</p><p>How I relax: During the week, I enjoy going jogging after work with my dog or listening to my iPod. On weekends, I like seeing a live band with mates and unwinding with a drink.</p><p>The next step: I plan to continue operating machinery and training. I look forward to gaining more experience, mentoring crew members and managing larger-scale incidents.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MLTWKY-62nut6pgfco11mmfd95i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLTWKY2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54X8-W3G1-JD34-V1N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385828</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Melton Weekly</publicationName><edition>FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>December 13, 2011 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

I'm learning to operate plant machinery to prevent fires spreading. I have always been part of the ground firefighter crew, training and remaining on standby to respond to fires. I work with a rake hoe crew felling dangerous trees and driving a 4WD with many litres of water, and am part of the crew on a fire tanker. I am involved with care and maintenance of recreation walking tracks, campsites and historical and environmental areas of significance.</p><p>How I got here: I studied natural resource management at TAFE. During work placement in state parks, I met forest-fire crews and decided to build a career. I began as a seasonal project firefighter then moved into managing project firefighters and fire recovery program contracts and on to what I do now.</p><p>My typical week: Each unique week involves keeping fit, forest patrols, training, maintenance of fuel breaks, roads/tracks and fire equipment. From chainsawing after a wind storm or flying in a helicopter over rugged bush terrain to work on controlling lightning strike damage, my work is very diverse. I also maintain fire pumps or climb fire towers as a fire spotter.</p><p>The good bits: I like being able to work in the great Australian outdoors. I enjoy the variety in my role as each day is different. The team I work with is great and we have a strong sense of camaraderie.</p><p>Work stress: There's plenty of paperwork, which can be painstaking and stressful to complete, but it has to be done. Obtaining all the facts and information is imperative. Generally, I tend not to let things stress me out at work.</p><p>How I relax: During the week, I enjoy going jogging after work with my dog or listening to my iPod. On weekends, I like seeing a live band with mates and unwinding with a drink.</p><p>The next step: I plan to continue operating machinery and training. I look forward to gaining more experience, mentoring crew members and managing larger-scale incidents.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WYNWEE-62oee9kxcx0fof4v95i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WYNWEE2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54X8-W3G1-JD34-V23H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wyndham Weekly</publicationName><edition>FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>December 14, 2011 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

CFA protection plans that will be delivered to homes from today rate the danger for Wodonga as high to very high. While those in the valleys face the threat from the heavily timbered national parks, it suggests grass fires and bushfires on the urban fringe pose the greatest danger to the city. </p><p>Maps of Wodonga also show the potential for green belts to carry fires into the heart of the city's residential areas. The hard-hitting message from the CFA warns that not every home can be protected. Baranduda is highlighted as being at high risk from both grass and forest fires. The CFA protection plan also said the residential area is exposed to ember attacks during a bushfire. The plan also shows five of the high-risk towns have no sanctuary for people whose own bushfire plan has failed. Glenrowan and Mitta are the only North East towns rated as extreme fire risks. The speed of a forest fire is said to be the greatest threat to Mitta, while the Warby-Ovens National Park poses the greatest danger to Glenrowan and the nearby Wangaratta suburb of Hamilton Park. CFA Hume regional manager Alan Davies said the plans had been developed in consultation with local communities, councils, brigades and various government agencies for people who are in areas most at risk of bushfire or grass fire this summer. \"Township protection plans will help locals and visitors identify important community assets, primary roads to exit the area, where to go, survival options and important emergency contact information,\" he said. Mr Davies said the plans will be going out to every home in the target communities as part of a mail-out to 400,000 addresses across Victoria. \"Bushfire and grass fire are an ever-present danger in these townships and all are classified as having a bushfire risk of very high or extreme,\" he said. \"Now is the time to start preparing. \"The township protection plan is one piece of paper that every family in a high risk area should have up on their fridge.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRDRML-62nfs0eut6c7m5ej95i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRDRML2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54FS-9H01-JD67-12WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386165</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"347\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Border Mail</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>December 12, 2011 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I'm learning to operate plant machinery to prevent fires spreading. I have always been part of the ground firefighter crew, training and remaining on standby to respond to fires. I work with a rake hoe crew felling dangerous trees and driving a 4WD with many litres of water, and am part of the crew on a fire tanker. I am involved with care and maintenance of recreation walking tracks, campsites and historical and environmental areas of significance.</p><p>How I got here: I studied natural resource management at TAFE. During work placement in state parks, I met forest-fire crews and decided to build a career. I began as a seasonal project firefighter then moved into managing project firefighters and fire recovery program contracts and on to what I do now.</p><p>My typical week: Each unique week involves keeping fit, forest patrols, training, maintenance of fuel breaks, roads/tracks and fire equipment. From chainsawing after a wind storm or flying in a helicopter over rugged bush terrain to work on controlling lightning strike damage, my work is very diverse. I also maintain fire pumps or climb fire towers as a fire spotter.</p><p>The good bits: I like being able to work in the great Australian outdoors. I enjoy the variety in my role as each day is different. The team I work with is great and we have a strong sense of camaraderie.</p><p>Work stress: There's plenty of paperwork, which can be painstaking and stressful to complete, but it has to be done. Obtaining all the facts and information is imperative. Generally, I tend not to let things stress me out at work.</p><p>How I relax: During the week, I enjoy going jogging after work with my dog or listening to my iPod. On weekends, I like seeing a live band with mates and unwinding with a drink.</p><p>The next step: I plan to continue operating machinery and training. I look forward to gaining more experience, mentoring crew members and managing larger-scale incidents.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRKLY-62mdwdfaroor9t1e95i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRKLY2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54X8-W3G1-JD34-V1XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385853</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Brimbank Weekly</publicationName><edition>FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>December 13, 2011 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

Brendan May chairs Robertsbridge, which works extensively on deforestation in our region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brendan May:</emphasis>Indonesia's forest fires are a catastrophe, not just regionally but globally. Over 8,000 square miles of forest and peatland have been burnt to a crisp. That's an area 12 times bigger than Sydney and 30 times bigger than Indonesia's smog suffering neighbour Singapore. And with the losses of forest and peat come other calamities; a devastating wipe-out of habitat and already endangered wildlife, a humanitarian disaster with half a million people suffering from respiratory complaints and 19 dead, and a simply staggering increase in greenhouse gas emissions, rivalling the annual total emissions of many industrialised countries.</p><p>And right now the world is focused on the COP21 climate talks in Paris, designed for the first time to deliver legally binding limits, country by country, on emissions in order to avoid global average temperatures rising more than a further two degrees. Arguably, recent events in Indonesia have already made a significant contribution to disabling this process. It is INDC's (a clumsy UN acronym for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) call for a 26% emissions reduction by 2020 and a conditional 41% by 2030, assuming international support. This is all using 2010 as a business-as-usual baseline.</p><p>Forestry, including fires, has contributed 60% of the country's total emissions over the last decade. Indonesia is also rich in coal and is developing new coal-fired power stations to meet increasing energy demand, and much of that coal of course lies beneath forest cover. And the most readily available source of biofuel feedstock (another growth area) is from, guess where, forestry. So whichever way you look at it, forestry is the elephant in the room.</p><p>But we need to look very carefully at the causes of these devastating fires and the resulting pollution. Unique to Indonesia is the fact that much of the country's forest sits on colossally deep peatland which, when it's cleared and drained, burns for a very, very long time if ignited. Once alight, peat emits all the CO2 it has stored over the millennia that it took to create.</p><p>That peatland has been drained in the first place does lie at the door of the big forestry businesses in Indonesia, largely palm oil and pulp plantation concession owners. But some of the biggest players have undergone a radical transformation and imposed zero deforestation policies across huge swathes of the landscape, and they've stopped developing on peatland. That has been one of the most positive news stories to come out of the environment movement in recent years.</p><p>The most sophisticated measures being taken by companies in Indonesia include the retirement of plantations on peat, complex management regimes to secure the forested and peatland landscapes, and to restore and conserve sufficient areas to address their legacies of destruction. All this is unprecedented progress. These companies now rely entirely on the plantations that already exist, so it's clearly not in their interests to set fire to their own raw material supply. Blaming fires on very large companies may be headline grabbing, but it's missing the point and it's wildly inaccurate. In fact the companies themselves are deploying thousands of firefighters to protect their assets.</p><p>The causal truth is very complex. It starts with the uncomfortable fact that there is very little clear definition over who actually owns what land. Commercial concessions in Indonesia often overlap with each other, and indigenous communities claim (often but not always legitimately) that they have a historic right to the use of traditionally held lands. Corruption and lawbreaking are endemic, policing is weak, and illegal encroachment is widespread.</p><p>Forest fire is an organised criminal industry. Much has been written and spoken about this. Fingers have been pointed, accusations hurled around the ether. But what the world needs to do now is to focus not simply on the cause and effect of forest fire but the cure. My own feeling is that this cure has three core elements. First, and most obviously, political. The current President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, or Jokowi as he is popularly known, is the first President not to emerge from the country's ruling elite or military, and as such he heads a government with a populist leaning agenda. But he also has to wrestle with a legacy of deeply entrenched self-interest, widespread corruption, particularly at regional and local level, and a historically unhealthy link between business and politics. His is an extremely difficult balancing act. And to be fair, he has taken some action, not least returning early from a visit to America to deal with the crisis. The President has ordered a moratorium on new licences to develop peatland, and he has ordered officials to prosecute those who clear land by burning.</p><p>But his own populism can work against him too. He is considering an electoral promise to redistribute some 9 million hectares of land to farmers, raising their average landholding from 0.8 to 2 hectares. Coupled with that, not all forest fires are started illegally. Whilst enforcement may be feeble and it's illegal for companies to start fires for clearance, there are instances where small holders can do so. It is the cheapest way of clearing land. Put the two together and you can guess the result.</p><p>What Jokowi needs is not sanctimonious words from the rest of the world's political leadership, he needs help. First he needs the Paris climate talks to deliver tangible solutions that could be translated into practical policy back home, so that Indonesia can carry back the legitimacy to enact a legal framework that enables compliance with the agreements coming out of Paris. Permanent and well policed bans on any natural forest and peatland clearance of any sort by anyone, for example.</p><p>Second, he needs the support of politically derived institutions, US aid for example. And in particular the Norwegians who through their gigantic sovereign wealth finance can fund many of the compensatory initiatives that are needed to enable smallholder farmers to earn a living without burning forests, and which can also help in the hugely complex and expensive task of blocking canals, rewetting peatlands and reforestation. And of course countries like Australia, which sadly has had much experience of forest fires of its own.</p><p>The second part of the cure is commercial, and I should declare an interest here, I have worked with very large Indonesian businesses on zero deforestation initiatives for some years, and I know what challenges they face. And by the way, none of them are perfect. But I also know that with will and investment and leadership, it can be done. So the outside world of business needs to sit up and take more notice of those companies that can genuinely prove they have eliminated deforestation in their supply chains and have taken real steps to dealing with their legacy through conservation and restoration and who are making the right investments in communities across their concessions that help them avoid the need to clear land to make a living.</p><p>And this outside world of business needs also to move faster and further in making its own supply chain fully responsible. There are some shining lights here, ones you might not even expect, like Nestl\u00e9 and Ferrero chocolate. But there are some real laggards. Why is PepsiCo being coy about deforestation? Why is Kraft Heinz equally flaccid on the subject? What kind of message does this timid approach from some consumer goods companies send?</p><p>The third cure lies in the hands of the environmental campaigning NGOs. With some notable exception, it seems to me that they are remarkably dysfunctional. Many of them have fallen into the trap of thinking that if they lose the object of their protest, then they have no raison d'\u00eatre, so they continue to protest, even if the evidence is clear that they have won, and they should be supporting companies who are progressive and trying to change. There will always be other targets.</p><p>In the end of course the fires will go out, and at last some rain has arrived, but too often, once the haze clears, attention drifts elsewhere too. This time perhaps it will be different because of the sheer scale of the disaster. We must hope so, for Indonesia's sake and the world's future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams: </emphasis>Brendan May chairs Robertsbridge, based in England.

I'm learning to operate plant machinery to prevent fires spreading. I have always been part of the ground firefighter crew, training and remaining on standby to respond to fires. </p><p>I work with a rake hoe crew felling dangerous trees and driving a 4WD with many litres of water, and am part of the crew on a fire tanker. I am involved with care and maintenance of recreation walking tracks, campsites and historical and environmental areas of significance. How I got here: I studied natural resource management at TAFE. During work placement in state parks, I met forest-fire crews and decided to build a career. I began as a seasonal project firefighter then moved into managing project firefighters and fire recovery program contracts and on to what I do now. My typical week: Each unique week involves keeping fit, forest patrols, training, maintenance of fuel breaks, roads/tracks and fire equipment. From chainsawing after a wind storm or flying in a helicopter over rugged bush terrain to work on controlling lightning strike damage, my work is very diverse. I also maintain fire pumps or climb fire towers as a fire spotter. The good bits: I like being able to work in the great Australian outdoors. I enjoy the variety in my role as each day is different. The team I work with is great and we have a strong sense of camaraderie. Work stress: There's plenty of paperwork, which can be painstaking and stressful to complete, but it has to be done. Obtaining all the facts and information is imperative. Generally, I tend not to let things stress me out at work. How I relax: During the week, I enjoy going jogging after work with my dog or listening to my iPod. On weekends, I like seeing a live band with mates and unwinding with a drink. The next step: I plan to continue operating machinery and training. I look forward to gaining more experience, mentoring crew members and managing larger-scale incidents.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MARIWE-62dm8zah4mslzfp7h0k</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MARIWE2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54VK-58K1-F0J6-J2MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385858</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"356\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Maribyrnong Weekly</publicationName><edition>FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>November 23, 2011 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

He said after years of drought, residents might not be familiar with the pace at which grassland fires could spread.</p><p>Contributing to the region's fire risk, Bureau of Meteorology acting regional director Ted Williams said the seasonal outlook for December to February indicated below average rainfall in the southwest of Victoria.</p><p>Temperatures across the state are also expected to be warmer than average.</p><p>CFA Barwon South West commander John Mealia said all residents had a responsibility to prepare a survival plan in advance, while the onus was also on the region's landowners to ensure their properties didn't contain heavy fuel loads.</p><p>Mr Mealia said as well as encouraging residents to beware of fire risks, informing tourists also posed a challenge for the region's emergency services.</p><p>``I've purposely travelled the Great Ocean Road on a Code Red day in the morning and it's absolutely chock-a-block,'' he said.</p><p>``There's those leaving Ocean Road, which is people leaving early, and all the tourists going in.</p><p>``There's an enormous misunderstanding of risk by the tourists.''</p><p>While the region's police and other emergency services have developed bushfire evacuation procedures including a drill to be held today in the Otways at Lavers Hill Mr Mealia said evacuations were unlikely to be used in a grassfire situation, due to the pace of the fire.</p><p>Mr Mealia also said in the event of an evacuation, residents would be notified through alert systems and emergency broadcasters.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:victoria.macdonald@geelongadvertiser.com.au\">victoria.macdonald@geelongadvertiser.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-GAT201111181016923116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:548S-1F51-F0JP-W541-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - First Edition Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>November 18, 2011 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

That's what draws tourists. That's what people want to know.</p><p>\"We need to say why it is important and the facilities need to reflect the beauty of the place.\"</p><p>Ms Moodie said since the City of Ballarat handed the responsibility of the lake to the state, \"the management has been shocking\".</p><p>\"There have been three management plans, the first in 1986. None have been implemented,\" she said.</p><p>\"Ballarat ceded its responsibility, its bylaws and oversight to the state. The decline in services has been unfortunate for visitors and the ecology of this reserve.\"</p><p>The problems at the lake were brought to stark realisation when anti-social behaviour at the campgrounds over the Australia Day long weekend turned a number of locals and campers away from the site.</p><p>Incidents including hooning, public drunkenness, extreme littering, and a dog attack all occurred in the space of a few days at the lake's campgrounds.</p><p>A camper who spoke to The Courier after the weekend said dangerous behaviour and fighting ruined the trip.</p><p>\"We went to bed at about 10pm and the at about 2am a car, don't know how fast, flew along the dirt road and then there were two more cars possibly chasing it,\" she said.</p><p>\"There were kids asleep in tents and swags everywhere and I was really worried.\"</p><p>She said she could hear people fighting all night and spent her night worried for her family's safety.</p><p>\"It was feral, there was a speed boat out on the water at 2am and I thought someone would get killed; I thought it was crazy,\" she said.</p><p>Project officer for the Wathaurung Aboriginal Corporation Tammy Gilson said the entire site was \"incredibly significant\" for the Wathaurung people.</p><p>\"There needs to be resources put into educating people and it should be done in a consultative approach between all parties,\" Ms Gilson said.</p><p>\"One of the biggest issues we face is the fact four wheel drives can essentially go where they like. I'd love to see areas that can not be accessed or out of bounds to protect the native vegetation.</p><p>\"When it's not respected, the cultural values are taken away.\"</p><p>Ms Gilson said in the past, management plans had not gone anywhere.</p><p>\"We're always about having a relationship with all bodies involved,\" she said.</p><p>\"But it is such a big area, it's not something that can be monitored every day.</p><p>\"You look at something like Lake Beaufort, which isn't nearly as big and it's got signage throughout. Here there's no signage, there's no education.

(\"Veteran appointed as new director of the Australian War Memorial\", canberratimes.com.au, December 14.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite his public service record I notice he has no qualifications or experience as a curator of any museums anywhere in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It would make more sense to appoint someone with extensive experience in museum management and planning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Someone with these qualifications would know it is not necessary to spend half a billion dollars on the extension and could work within the framework of the present building.</p><p>Tourists do not come to the Australian War Memorial to visit a fun park. They come to pay their respects to service personnel.</p><p>I cannot imagine Charles Bean would be impressed by the proposed development. It is, after all a war memorial, and does a wonderful job in its' present format.</p><p>Robyn Lewis, Raglan, NSW APS arrogance I find Michael White's letter concerning DFRB/DFRDB pensions deeply offensive (Letters, December 14).</p><p>This is particularly so with regard to his final paragraph (suggesting Mr Stone \"could find a better way of assisting worthy veterans than by raising false hopes based on some perceived injustice that was never there\").</p><p>Mr White's arrogance epitomises the attitude of many APS staff who deal with conditions of service for military personnel. Generally they resent any such conditions that equal or excel their own and work tirelessly to reduce such entitlements.</p><p>The introduction of the DFRDB scheme in 1972 was primarily to correct the abysmal conditions relating to entitlements under the existing Worker's Compensation legislation in the event of death or injury, not on active service, as well as to create an entitlement to commutation.</p><p>I do not believe that the Government Retirement Benefits Office have ever \"suggested or inferred to any retiring member of the Defence Force\" anything concerning entitlements ever. It is not within their remit.</p><p>Twice a year they advise all pensioners under the current schemes what their pension will be.</p><p>It is up to the personnel services of each of the services to advise existing and exiting service persons of their entitlements.</p><p>The individual retiree is left to fend for him or herself against both his old service, the GRBO and the DVA.</p><p>What is certain is that the RAAF system advised all personnel who were compulsorily transferred to the DFRDB scheme in 1972 that they had a right to commute their pension and if they did the reduced pension was calculated to have paid back the lump sum when they reached the age of 72.6 years when the full pension entitlement would be resumed.</p><p>Mr White and his fellow workers would undoubtedly have been in contact and advised the APS experts embedded within the individual services personnel systems as to the interpretation of the new DFRDB scheme.</p><p>Thus it is these people who fabricated the erroneous concepts that we service persons were briefed on. But why would they?</p><p>J Trinder, Karabar, NSW Prejudice apparent The fact Jennifer Killen (Letters, December 12) refers to \"Israel's theft of Palestinian land\" in the context of the disputed land on the West Bank (of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, as it was) demonstrates that she has pre-judged the issue that UN resolutions and the Oslo Accords, amongst others, said should be negotiated.</p><p>This attitude is part of the problem, as it encourages Palestinian intransigence; it is not part of the solution.</p><p>In any case, as Lee mentioned in his article, the Israeli offer included land in compensation for any West Bank land retained by Israel.</p><p>Sadly, the Palestinian leadership refused point blank, without even a counter-offer. At least Killen acknowledges that the settlements do only cover 1.1 per cent of the West Bank, in contrast to the ridiculous claims advanced by other advocates for the Palestinians.</p><p>Hopefully the Palestinian elections scheduled for next year will, if they go ahead, result in a leadership that actually cares more about the welfare of their people than \"the cause\", and will therefore be prepared to accept Israel's existence and negotiate in good faith.</p><p>Bill Arnold, Chifley Fire war footing On November 26 the Tallaganda Forest fire, started by a lightning strike, was only a few metres across. It quickly grew to encompass 40,000 hectares of death, destruction and trauma.</p><p>Here is a chance to make fuller use of the nation's defence investments. The government is purchasing General Atomics MQ-9B 'Sky Guardians', big uncrewed surveillance and attack drones.</p><p>If these $1.3 billion worth of weapons can put a missile through an ISIS commander's window then they can orbit our forests after lightning storms, detect nascent fires with FLIR and call in precision water drops.</p><p>Could the PM please call the chief of air force and instruct him that the planes must be outfitted to combat the truly terrifying threat of mega fires .</p><p>P Marshall, Braidwood, NSW Pipeline concerns The headline of the otherwise thorough report \"Pipeline to boost water supply runs dry\", (December 16, p4) is somewhat misleading.</p><p>Although our current water storage level appears worryingly low, at about 50 per cent capacity, it's on a base that includes the massive new Cotter Dam. It was built, essentially by the private sector, to monopolise the system.</p><p>That clearly oversized dam obviously caused the shutting down of the well-conceived, pre-existing $140 million Murrumbidgee River to Googong Dam pipeline (the subject of the report), very soon after the pipeline's completion, and years before the current drought.</p><p>Jack Kershaw, Kambah Atheists gospel I can't claim to speak for any atheists, but I expect that they are too broad a non-church to have a single unified agenda, other than that all religious claims and rights should be subject to examination and based only on evidence.</p><p>As for abortion, contraception, homosexuality, euthanasia or even smashed avo on toast, I'm not aware of Jesus spending a lot of his time outlining his views on these topics.</p><p>He did however have a bit to say about overly judgemental attitudes towards your fellow man, including the kind frequently put forward by some cranky old male self-appointed and monopolistic interpreters of the teachings of Jesus.</p><p>I'm sure that the divine spirit can find more inspired spokespersons than these; perhaps even women?</p><p>I think I will continue to prefer Jesus's more direct words, calling for a community of love, compassion and forgiveness, I'm happy to leave the smiting bits to the old testament.</p><p>Wishing you well in all things, I've got a birthday party to go to.</p><p>Garry P Dalrymple, Earlwood, NSW Let Greta be Mark Sproat (Letters, December 16) joins a long line of bitter old men who, irrationally, can't stand the thought of a 16-year-old girl having the courage to speak out for her future.</p><p>I'm probably older than Mark, yet I find it easy to enthusiastically applaud Greta and her generation who fear the consequences of the world's inaction on climate change.</p><p>It is people like Mark, led by the orange haired old man in the White House who ought to go back to school.</p><p>They need to learn the science and, critically, get over childishly sniping at Greta.</p><p>Eric Hunter, Cook Peak stupidity The UK election and collapse of the Madrid climate talks confirm my belief that during 2019 we passed peak stupidity.</p><p>Hopefully the influence of various prophets of doom, rent seekers, political opportunists, do-gooders and other instruments of darkness is now on the wane.</p><p>Here, the anti-coal factions have lost ALP support. In Germany the renewables industry is collapsing and in other places nuclear power is making a comeback with smaller, safer, more practical modular reactors and super-efficient, new-generation large plants.</p><p>China is buying huge quantities of Russian gas to keep world fossil fuel consumption at record highs and to demonstrate that while they pay lip service to the climate change hoax Chinese actions tell a different story.</p><p>Nowhere was this more obvious than at Madrid where the long-standing nonsense of transferring money from wealthy nations to poor ones under the pretext of reparations has been blocked, with China leading the pack.</p><p>The inevitable result of decades of exaggerations, failed predictions, guilt peddling and outright lies has been coming for a long time.</p><p>It has finally arrived.</p><p>With luck the momentum will continue, and having passed speak stupid in 2019, in 2020 we will enjoy the clarity of vision these figures have always represented.</p><p>Doug Hurst, Canberra TO THE POINT WASTE NOT, WANT NOT How seriously do some Federal government departments and large corporations take our dwindling water supply?</p><p>As I walk to work in the early hours of the morning I am witness to the ritual hosing down of hundreds of square metres of hard surfaces outside various buildings in the CBD. I'm sure there is a good reason.</p><p>Peter Duck, Kippax HEED THE EXPERTS If Albo wanted to develop an election winning manifesto, all he needs to do is pinch some ideas and advice from the letters page.</p><p>James Mahoney, McKellar RACE HAS NO PLACE I entirely agree with Greg Pinder's letter (December 16) hoping that any decision of the High Court in the case of the two Indigenous Australians facing deportation will not be decided on race.</p><p>By the same token, I hope any decision in regard to a special Indigenous voice in Parliament will not be decided on the basis of race either.</p><p>Bill Deane, Chapman AIR QUALITY CONCERN On December 15 it was reported that Canberra's air quality index had peaked at 650, the worst result since the 2003 fires.</p><p>But how long did the poor quality last in 2003? There has been smoke haze over Canberra this time at least since the night of Saturday, December 7.</p><p>That's seven days long and continuing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week according to the Bureau of Meteorology.</p><p>Rod Holesgrove, Crace THE PIT NICKER A number of recent letters have been described as \"nit-picking\". When Mr. Morrison brought a lump of coal into the House of Representatives, could that be described as \"pit-nicking\"?</p><p>Peter Baskett, Murrumbateman, NSW SAINT GRETA... Greta Thunberg can be officially proclaimed a saint now that she has been canonised by Time Magazine. And so the farce continues.</p><p>P Wilson, Miami, Qld LACK OF SMARTS Those who refuse to believe in the reality of climate change should be subjected to an intelligence test.</p><p>Glenys Hammer, Narrabundah THE THREE STOOGES When I was a young we used to laugh our heads at the Three Stooges.</p><p>They are back. As the bossy Moe we have Trump, as the baby faced clown Curly we have Boris and as the easygoing simpleton Larry we have Scomo.</p><p>Even the old Larry would be hard pressed to come up with a skit involving carrying around a lump of coal as a raging inferno approaches, burning everything in its path.</p><p>John Holland, Dickson PRODIGIOUS PM Scott Morrison has made the biblical \"Loaves and fishes\" seem rather mangy when you look at his notice giving an additional $11 million to the fire effort.</p><p>D Fraser, Currumbin, Qld GET WARMING DONE The leading losers at the climate conference in Madrid were Australia, Brazil and the US.

That's what draws tourists. That's what people want to know.</p><p>\"We need to say why it is important and the facilities need to reflect the beauty of the place.\"</p><p>Ms Moodie said since the City of Ballarat handed the responsibility of the lake to the state, \"the management has been shocking\".</p><p>\"There have been three management plans, the first in 1986. None have been implemented,\" she said.</p><p>\"Ballarat ceded its responsibility, its bylaws and oversight to the state. The decline in services has been unfortunate for visitors and the ecology of this reserve.\"</p><p>The problems at the lake were brought to stark realisation when anti-social behaviour at the campgrounds over the Australia Day long weekend turned a number of locals and campers away from the site.</p><p>Incidents including hooning, public drunkenness, extreme littering, and a dog attack all occurred in the space of a few days at the lake's campgrounds.</p><p>A camper who spoke to The Courier after the weekend said dangerous behaviour and fighting ruined the trip.</p><p>\"We went to bed at about 10pm and the at about 2am a car, don't know how fast, flew along the dirt road and then there were two more cars possibly chasing it,\" she said.</p><p>\"There were kids asleep in tents and swags everywhere and I was really worried.\"</p><p>She said she could hear people fighting all night and spent her night worried for her family's safety.</p><p>\"It was feral, there was a speed boat out on the water at 2am and I thought someone would get killed; I thought it was crazy,\" she said.</p><p>Project officer for the Wathaurung Aboriginal Corporation Tammy Gilson said the entire site was \"incredibly significant\" for the Wathaurung people.</p><p>\"There needs to be resources put into educating people and it should be done in a consultative approach between all parties,\" Ms Gilson said.</p><p>\"One of the biggest issues we face is the fact four wheel drives can essentially go where they like. I'd love to see areas that can not be accessed or out of bounds to protect the native vegetation.</p><p>\"When it's not respected, the cultural values are taken away.\"</p><p>Ms Gilson said in the past, management plans had not gone anywhere.</p><p>\"We're always about having a relationship with all bodies involved,\" she said.</p><p>\"But it is such a big area, it's not something that can be monitored every day.</p><p>\"You look at something like Lake Beaufort, which isn't nearly as big and it's got signage throughout. Here there's no signage, there's no education.

Most Israeli commentators were savagely critical of the country's lack of firefighting preparedness, forcing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu onto the defensive. Writing in the leading daily newspaper Haaretz, commentator Amir Oren said the fires were \"Netanyahu's Katrina\", a reference to US president George Bush's much-criticised handling of the hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005. \"The politicians passed themselves off as purposeful responders to 3am phone calls. </p><p>In reality they didn't have a clue as to what to do when the phone rang at 3pm,\" Oren wrote. Speaking after a special cabinet meeting on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said \"massive forest fires are fundamentally different from routine fires\". He said Israel was unashamed at having to request international assistance to fight the blaze, as had other countries, including Russia, the Ukraine and the United States, when faced with forest fires. \"The issue of closing the gaps in the conventional, ground-based, not aerial, firefighting network is an important issue,\" Mr Netanyahu said. \"The government has begun to deal with this issue, which has demanded a solution for 62 years.\" In the mass circulation daily Yedioth Ahronoth, analyst Alex Fishman said the fire undermined Israel's national security. Rabbi Ovadia Yossef, spiritual leader of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, said it was punishment for Israelis who did not observe the Sabbath. In his weekly sermon, Rabbi Yossef quoted a section of the Talmud that proclaimed \"the fire only exists in a place where the Sabbath is desecrated\". The blaze, which destroyed nearly 5000 hectares of pine forest in Israel's north, was extinguished late on Sunday. Two brothers, aged 14 and 15, from the Druze village of Isfiya were arrested on suspicion of causing the fire through negligence after a family picnic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">5xdc20y85ow19lm9x14v</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51MV-1GW1-JCVT-J532-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2013-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>December 7, 2010 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Israel</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Defence/Wars/Israeli/Arab Conflict</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Population Groups/Ethnic Groups Nationalities/Jews</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accidents and Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000309</classCode><className>CLERGY &amp;

In deliberately simple language, Suzuki covers a range of topics; the Great Depression, its forgotten lessons, the post-war birth of relentless consumerism and planned obsolescence; the current state of the world reeling from being constantly used as a resource, citing \"fracking\" as one of the great insanities of the age; ageing, the cult of youth, atheism and the inevitability of death. In this letter he invokes the tale of the South American hummingbird that carries drops of water to a forest fire one at a time much to the amusement of its fellow creatures, responding to their laughter with the words \"I'm doing the best I can\". More than the marketplace wolves can say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After Perfect</p><p>CHRISTINA McDOWELL</p><p>BANTAM, $34.99</p><p>The film The Wolf of Wall Street is one of those Fieldingesque tales featuring picaresque rogues that, to many, is emblematic of the crass excess of the 1990s. Intended as a cautionary tale, to McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis (a business associate of the real wolf, Jordan Belfort, who went to jail for fraud), the film romanticised the con-men it depicted. This is the tale from the daughter's point of view. No loveable rogues, just duplicitous cheats who cause tremendous damage to their families and society. McDowell, who changed her name, charts her family's fall from grace, and her own from privilege to working in seedy bars, homelessness, bit acting, drink and drugs. It's a record of the personal cost of those years, but also documents her forgiveness of her father and her gritty determination to go forward.</p><p>Good Muslim Boy</p><p>OSAMAH SAMI</p><p>HARDIE GRANT, $32.95</p><p>There are times when this memoir is reminiscent of migrant tales such as They're a Weird Mob, when we see our culture, rituals and colloquialisms through an uncomprehending outsider's eyes. The unfortunately named Osamah, a writer, actor and film-maker, weaves comedy and family tragedy together. In 2013 he went to Iran with his father, a leading Melbourne Shiite cleric, who suddenly died of a heart attack. One of two stories running through the book is about his struggle to get the body back to Australia before his visa expires. The other describes life in Iran during the Iran/Iraq war, before the family's arrival in Australia as refugees, landing in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, supporting the Essendon Bombers, negotiating the language.

The area is about 225 kilometres north-east of San Francisco. It is costing $US5 million a day to fight.</p><p>The out-of-control fire threatens more than 2000 homes in the Eldorado National Forest east of Sacramento after ballooning overnight from 11,300 hectares to nearly 27,900 hectares. Another 1500 buildings are threatened by the blaze, which was just 5 per cent contained on Thursday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. More than 3300 firefighters have been assigned to the blaze.</p><p>Meanwhile, the state's largest fire continues to be the Happy Camp Complex fire in Klamath National Forest. The fire, which began August 12 and has burned more than 50,000 hectares, is 68 per cent contained, the US Forest Service reported.</p><p>That blaze is made up of 15 fires, all of which were sparked by lightning.</p><p>The fires prompted California Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday to declare a state of emergency for El Dorado County.</p><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted a corresponding request for aid that can cover up to 75 per cent of the state's costs to fight the fire, one of several active wildfires burning in California.</p><p>The most destructive in terms of damage to property has been the Boles fire, which erupted late Monday and quickly tore through the logging town of Weed, just west of Mount Shasta. The fire damaged or destroyed more than 150 structures, including churches, a library and the town's sawmill.</p><p>In Madera County, the 130-hectare Courtney fire has destroyed 30 homes, 19 outbuildings and 13 vehicles. It was 70 per cent contained as of Wednesday evening.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS: More than 3000 firefighters face a daunting task to stop a raging forest fire north-east of San Francisco that suddenly tripled in size.

In deliberately simple language, Suzuki covers a range of topics; the Great Depression, its forgotten lessons, the post-war birth of relentless consumerism and planned obsolescence; the current state of the world reeling from being constantly used as a resource, citing \"fracking\" as one of the great insanities of the age; ageing, the cult of youth, atheism and the inevitability of death. In this letter he invokes the tale of the South American hummingbird that carries drops of water to a forest fire one at a time much to the amusement of its fellow creatures, responding to their laughter with the words \"I'm doing the best I can\". More than the marketplace wolves can say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After Perfect</p><p>CHRISTINA McDOWELL</p><p>BANTAM, $34.99</p><p>The film The Wolf of Wall Street is one of those Fieldingesque tales featuring picaresque rogues that, to many, is emblematic of the crass excess of the 1990s. Intended as a cautionary tale, to McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis (a business associate of the real wolf, Jordan Belfort, who went to jail for fraud), the film romanticised the conmen it depicted. This is the tale from the daughter's point of view. No loveable rogues, just duplicitous cheats who cause tremendous damage to their families and society. McDowell, who changed her name, charts her family's fall from grace, and her own from privilege to working in seedy bars, homelessness, bit acting, drink and drugs. It's a record of the personal cost of those years, but also documents her forgiveness of her father and her gritty determination to go forward.</p><p>Good Muslim Boy</p><p>OSAMAH SAMI</p><p>HARDIE GRANT, $32.95</p><p>There are times when this memoir is reminiscent of migrant tales such as They're a Weird Mob, when we see our culture, rituals and colloquialisms through an uncomprehending outsider's eyes. The unfortunately named Osamah, a writer, actor and filmmaker, weaves comedy and family tragedy together. In 2013 he went to Iran with his father, a leading Melbourne Shiite cleric, who suddenly died of a heart attack. One of two stories running through the book is about his struggle to get the body back to Australia before his visa expires. The other describes life in Iran during the Iran/Iraq war, before the family's arrival in Australia as refugees, landing in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, supporting the Essendon Bombers, negotiating the language. A funny, perceptive, distinctive voice.</p><p>Darjeeling</p><p>JEFF KOEHLER</p><p>BLOOMSBURY, $49.99</p><p>If market price is anything to go by Darjeeling is the champagne of teas, Koehler maintains in this readable history of the plant. It's an embracing study of a small leaf that goes back 2500 years to China, then on to key turning-points such as the establishment of the East India Company in 1600 and the importation of tea to Europe, especially England. At first it was the drink of aristocrats, then of the wealthy, then of the whole country. And, all the time, Darjeeling was the most expensive, the choice of connoisseurs. Koehler knows his brew and writes about it with great enthusiasm.

But they were not in a developed Western country.</p><p>It is a sad reality that global news puts far less focus on poor places than rich ones.</p><p>Houston is a big, bustling, wealthy city, supported by one of the biggest ports in the US and large chemical and research industries. That made Harvey very big news.</p><p>Nearly all of Houston's Fortune 500 companies (it has more of them than any US city, except New York) are involved in some way with oil and gas. Needless to say, they have so far had nothing to say about whether their industry might have contributed to the storm that wrecked the city.</p><p>It is true, as many people are keen to point out, that human-induced climate change and weather events are different phenomena, and that rain events have always happened and will continue to do so regardless of what we put into the atmosphere.</p><p>In 2005 Al Gore pointed out that a warmer world breeds stronger storms, believing that the drowning of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina might alert his country to dangerous climate change.</p><p>He thought the same of ex-Hurricane Sandy when it smashed into New York in 2012. However, the only lesson learned from these events seems to be that people and governments do not like to dwell on bad memories.</p><p>Many senior politicians, including Texas Governor Greg Abbott, have claimed that big wind and rain events have no connection with climate change, man-made or otherwise.</p><p>Recent events like Typhoon Haiyan, which killed over 6000 people in 2013, and our own Cyclones Yasi (2011) and Monica (2015) had an apocalyptic feel to them. But while not always reliable, old records have turned up a few storms in the distant past that seemed comparable in size.</p><p>Commentators like me have learned to be wary of attributing big weather events to changing climate.</p><p>I have found it useful to avoid such discussion while focusing on the bleeding obvious - higher average temperatures, melting polar ice sheets and the like.</p><p>The social and political tensions in play during storm events inhibit talk about attribution.</p><p>Raising the topic of man-made climate change when homes have been inundated and people drowned (or when wildfires have incinerated homes and people) is, as they say, playing with fire.</p><p>But scientific method finds a way around inhibitions. Since Hurricane Sandy, various studies have identified extended polar jet streams as a major reason for storm systems staying stalled for long periods, allowing them time to take up more water from the sea and to dump more of it over land.</p><p>Add to that very warm, energising Gulf waters along with warm air above (warm air can hold more moisture) and you have a recipe for Houston's third \"500-year flood\" in three years, and by far its most damaging wind-and-rain event on record.</p><p>A 2015 US-Korean study found that while warmer ocean water inhibited formation of tropical cyclones overall, leading to fewer storms, it also increased the intensity of those that did form. In the same year a European study found a 12 per cent rise since 1980 in record-breaking rain events.</p><p>Across the continental divide in southern California at the weekend a crisis of an entirely different kind was playing out - the biggest forest fire in memory besieging the city of Los Angeles. It was the opposite face of the same stalled weather systems that caused the Houston floods.</p><p>Unlike devastated parts of south Asia, Houston is a rich city in a rich country. But with nearly 200,000 homes damaged or destroyed, 80 per cent of which lack flood insurance, the damage bill may be as high as $150 billion, far ahead of any past natural disaster in the US.</p><p>Add to that the economic cost of closing 10 Gulf coast refineries accounting for about 17 per cent of US refining capacity, and it's unsurprising that governor Abbott is calling for more national help.</p><p>In the past, Abbott has taken out law suits against federal climate regulations, and when campaigning to be governor in 2014 he railed about \"political demagogues using climate change as an excuse to remake the American economy\".</p><p>Harvey, which is having a fair shot on its own at remaking the economy, ought to change Abbott's mind about climate change, but that's unlikely given the powerful resistance across southern US states to identifying underlying causes of extreme weather events.</p><p>\"I don't believe Hurricane Harvey is God's punishment for Houston electing a lesbian mayor,\" said widelysyndicated conservative commentator Ann Coulter on Twitter last week. \"But that is more credible than 'climate change'.\" She offered no basis for her bald assertion. I suggest it's based on faith alone bolstered by 1.7 million Twitter followers, and with numbers like that behind you, who needs facts?</p><p>Peter Boyer began his journalism career at the Mercury in the 1960s. He specialises in the science and politics of climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-HobartMercury20170905Hobart14000323658826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PD9-JXG1-JD3N-52J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Hobart Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 5, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLVE</classCode><className>HURRICANE HARVEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSL3</classCode><className>DROWNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F7U</classCode><className>HURRICANES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

That beat the previous record winter in 2009 by 0.3 degrees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One influence driving the abnormally mild condition was the band of high pressures that sat further south than normal over the continent, keeping cold fronts at bay. Climate change was also a factor.</p><p>\"You have the underlying long-term warming trend,\" Blair Trewin, senior climatologist at the bureau, said. \"Consistent with that, 19 of the last 20 winters have had above-average maximum temperatures.\"</p><p>Nationally, August was less extreme than June and July, with temperature anomalies less pronounced and better rains across south-eastern Australia helping to ease rainfall deficits in many areas.</p><p>Forest fire index levels, though, remain high, particularly for inland NSW, as authorities prepare for an early bushfire season.</p><p>For Sydney, the city had its driest winter since 2009. The 211.4-millimetre tally for the three months was about a third below average. July and August alone, though, were the driest in 22 years, Weatherzone said.</p><p>Sydney had its seventh-warmest winter for daytime temperatures, in line with last year.</p><p>The season also included the city's warmest July day on record, with 26.5 degrees on July 30 beating a record that had stood since 1990, the bureau said. </p><p>(See bureau chart below of average maximum temperatures.)</p><h>Brief burst of spring</h><p>Similarly warm conditions should return for the first weekend of spring, encouraging many to venture outdoors amid a \"temporary heat spike\", Graeme Brittain, a meteorologist from Weatherzone, said.</p><p>For those heading to the beach, \"sheltered, south-facing beaches will be the place to go\", particularly on Sunday when northwesterly winds pick up.</p><p>On current forecasts, Sydney is tipped to reach 22 degrees on Saturday and 28 degrees for a clear if windy Sunday. </p><p>Warmer conditions are on the way, at least for this weekend.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: Nick Moir </emphasis></p><p>Spring's volatile weather will be on display, with large and powerful surf predicted for Saturday. Winds will also gradually strengthen on Sunday, reaching 50km/h as a cold front moves through, Mr Brittain said.</p><p>\"It's a very cold air mass,\" he said, adding that it will knock daytime temperatures below the September average of 20 degrees for much of next week before conditions warm again by next weekend.</p><p>The cold front is also a dry one, as is the next one, meaning there is unlikely to be much rain relief soon for Sydney's threadbare playing fields.</p><p>\"There's no really significant rain forecast for the next 14 days,\" Mr Brittain said.</p><h>Dry times</h><p>Those dry conditions also extend across much of the country after the driest winter since 2002.</p><p>Rainfall was about 43 per cent below the norm, the bureau said. (See chart below.)</p><p>NSW was notably dry, with about half the typical rain, or 58.8 millimetres. It was also the state's driest winter in 15 years.</p><p>Good rains in June meant only a small pocket of the state's north-east enjoyed above-average rain for the season.</p><p>For Sydney, rain fell on 22 days during winter, down from the average of 34 days. Just five of them had more than 10 millimetres, compared with eight such days in a typical winter.</p><p>With fewer rain clouds around, the city enjoyed sunnier-than-usual conditions, particularly in July and August.</p><h>Cool nights</h><p>One consequence of limited cloud cover, though, were cool nights, particularly for inland areas.</p><p>Sydney's nights remained milder above average for the city, but dropped below the winter average in western suburbs.

More snow is expected in the coming weeks, Dr Trewin said. The bureau's forecasts for spring, updated on Thursday, point to a switch in coming months towards more typical rainfall levels.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers used optogenetics, a method that uses light to control brain cells to stimulate cell activity within the tumour site. Surprisingly, it worked.&lt;nl/&gt; \"We don't think about bile production promoting liver cancer growth, or breathing promoting the growth of lung cancer,\" Monje was quoted as saying by Medical Express[2]. \"But we've shown that brain function is driving these brain cancers.\"&lt;nl/&gt; \"Our new findings indicate that this metaphorical forest fire has been difficult to extinguish because there is something akin to gasoline seeping up from the soil.\"&lt;nl/&gt; The results point to further research on the other causes of brain cancer and how to stop its growth. The cause of glioma is still unknown. The origins of glioblastoma, one type of rare glioma arising from astrocytes, is also yet to be uncovered, according to the American Brain Tumor Association. Glioblastoma accounts for 52 percent of all glioma cases worldwide.&lt;nl/&gt; About 50 percent of patients diagnosed with the disease die within a year, while 90 percent of patients die within three years of diagnosis. In Australia, 1,000 people are diagnosed with brain cancer annually, a report on The Courier Mail revealed[3]. Forty percent of patients die within 14 months of diagnosis due to recurrence, while only three to five percent of patients live beyond five years.&lt;nl/&gt; The Courier Mail also noted that a series of trials using clinical drug KB004[4] will be launched this year, 2015, in Brisbane for subjects suffering from recurring glioblastoma. The clinical trials will be held at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and the Austin Hospital in Melbourne. It will be conducted by QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute and will involve 20 participants.&lt;nl/&gt; US-based company Nascent Biotech[5] (OTC:NBIO[6]) is also working on developing a similar therapy that can be used to treat brain cancer. Based on human immunoglobulin antibody, the therapy, Pritumumab, has been granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration recently.&lt;nl/&gt; Pritumumab was derived from the B-cell of a tumour-draining lymph node of a patient suffering from cervical cancer, the company's website[7] revealed. It targets ecto-domain vimentin, a novel target and protein expressed on the cell surface of malignant tumors. The target has not been pursued by any other biotechs in the company's niche. Pritumumab has an overall response rate of 25 to 30 percent among patients.&lt;nl/&gt; To contact the writer, email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:v.hernandez@ibtimes.com.au\">v.hernandez@ibtimes.com.au</email>;&lt;nl/&gt;

The system brings a substantial<br/><br/>improvement in forecast skill, especially for El Nio/La Nia events. Forecasts<br/><br/>are also more detailed thanks to much greater horizontal resolution. An<br/><br/>immediate application is the use of SEAS5 by the Global Flood Awareness System<br/><br/>(GloFAS) to create the first ever operational global long-range river-flow<br/><br/>forecasting system. This could mean much earlier awareness of floods and<br/><br/>droughts than has previously been possible.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Logo: </pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600366/ECMWF_Logo.jpg\">http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600366/ECMWF_Logo.jpg</url> )<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Photo:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600380/ECMWF_Weather_Forecasts.jpg\">http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600380/ECMWF_Weather_Forecasts.jpg</url> )<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Photo:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600398/SEAS5_System.jpg\">http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600398/SEAS5_System.jpg</url> )<br/><br/><br/><br/>Seasonal forecasts help to give an idea of large-scale weather patterns up to<br/><br/>seven months in advance at the moment. ECMWF's strategic goal is to extend this<br/><br/>to a year by 2025. The forecasts can support decision-making for users ranging<br/><br/>from governments and aid agencies to businesses, in areas such as water and<br/><br/>energy management, health, agriculture and financial services.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ECMWF has been providing seasonal forecasts for 20 years. The forecasts are<br/><br/>best known for successful predictions of El Nio and La Nia events. These<br/><br/>periods of anomalous warming or cooling in the tropical eastern Pacific have a<br/><br/>strong impact on the weather locally, but also influence global weather<br/><br/>patterns. SEAS5 brings noticeable improvements in forecast skill for El Nio/La<br/><br/>Nia and for the tropics more generally. Predictions of Arctic sea ice and<br/><br/>near-surface temperature in the northern hemisphere are also improved, notably<br/><br/>as a result of including an interactive sea-ice model in SEAS5.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Horizontal resolution has more than doubled both in the ocean model (from 1<br/><br/>degree to 0.25 degrees) and in the atmospheric model (from 80 km to 36 km),<br/><br/>enabling much more detailed forecasts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ECMWF project lead Tim Stockdale said: \"SEAS5 uses a version of ECMWF's<br/><br/>state-of-the-art Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) and represents six years<br/><br/>of model development. The resolution upgrade is a huge step forward,<br/><br/>particularly in the accuracy of representing the global ocean. The influences<br/><br/>of the land surface are also better represented. For the future, a major goal<br/><br/>is to improve predictions for the stratosphere to make the maximum use of all<br/><br/>sources of predictability.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>SEAS5 represents an important step towards ECMWF's goal of seamless forecasting<br/><br/>across all time ranges. The model and initialisation methods are almost<br/><br/>identical to those used for ECMWF's medium- and extended-range ensemble<br/><br/>forecasts (ENS). This greatly facilitates model development and maintenance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ECMWF Member States and licensed users can access SEAS5 forecasts on the 5th<br/><br/>day of each month. The forecasts are made available more widely on the ECMWF<br/><br/>website (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ecmwf.int\">http://www.ecmwf.int</url>) on the 10th of each month. The forecasts can<br/><br/>also be accessed on the 10th of each month through the EU-funded, ECMWF-run<br/><br/>Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://climate.copernicus.eu/\">http://climate.copernicus.eu/</url>). C3S is<br/><br/>developing a seasonal forecast service which also includes forecasts from other<br/><br/>centres and multi-system forecasts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) is co-developed by ECMWF and the<br/><br/>Joint Research Centre of the European Commission as part of the Copernicus<br/><br/>Emergency Management Service (EMS). The new seasonal GloFAS model, developed in<br/><br/>collaboration with researchers from the University of Reading, takes long-range<br/><br/>forecasts from SEAS5 and runs a hydrological model to simulate how the<br/><br/>predicted conditions will impact river flow across the globe up to four months<br/><br/>in advance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Initial pre-implementation tests indicate that the new model has the potential<br/><br/>to save lives by allowing authorities and aid agencies around the world to plan<br/><br/>and prepare flood relief efforts earlier than ever before. Other potential uses<br/><br/>include water resource management, agriculture and disaster risk reduction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Project lead Rebecca Emerton, a flood forecasting PhD researcher at the<br/><br/>University of Reading and visiting scientist at ECMWF, said: \"This new model<br/><br/>could be a game-changer in that it provides hydrologically relevant forecasts<br/><br/>out to several months for the whole globe - something that has never been<br/><br/>possible before. It has the potential to provide earlier indications of both<br/><br/>floods and droughts, which could be invaluable for disaster risk reduction<br/><br/>efforts around the world, helping vulnerable communities become more resilient<br/><br/>to the threat of flooding.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>The forecasts will be publicly available via the existing GLoFAS interface<br/><br/>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.globalfloods.eu\">http://www.globalfloods.eu</url>).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Notes to editors<br/><br/><br/><br/>The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an<br/><br/>independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 34 states. ECMWF is<br/><br/>both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and<br/><br/>disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member and Co-operating<br/><br/>States as well as licensed users. The organisation was established in 1975 and<br/><br/>now employs around 350 staff from more than 30 countries. ECMWF is based in<br/><br/>Reading, UK.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Copernicus is a European Union Programme aimed at developing European<br/><br/>information services based on satellite Earth observation and in situ<br/><br/>(non-space) data. The Programme is coordinated and managed by the European<br/><br/>Commission. ECMWF operates two of the six Copernicus services on behalf of the<br/><br/>EU: the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the Copernicus Atmosphere<br/><br/>Monitoring Service (CAMS). ECMWF is also the computational centre for European<br/><br/>flood awareness and forest fire information systems which are part of the<br/><br/>Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS).<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), jointly developed by the Joint<br/><br/>Research Centre of the European Commission and ECMWF, is independent of<br/><br/>administrative and political boundaries. It couples state-of-the-art weather<br/><br/>forecasts with a hydrological model and with its continental-scale setup it<br/><br/>provides downstream countries with information on upstream river conditions as<br/><br/>well as providing continental and global overviews.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hilda Carr - Head of Communications<br/><br/>+44-0118-949-9000<br/><br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pressoffice@ecmwf.int\">pressoffice@ecmwf.int</email><br/><br/><br/><br/>SOURCE: The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MPRW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MPRW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXG-NN91-JC0X-K2NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">293804</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1045\"/><timeReceived>11:16 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Australian Associated Press Pty.

Yet they're learning much from the burning</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You need to know what happened at Wytaliba to understand why this bushfire season is so different and extraordinarily dangerous.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Parts of the country are burning that have never burned before: rainforests are going up and -communities attuned to dealing with floods and cyclones are being confronted by walls of flame, hurling them into a whole new world of hurt and heartache.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those who prepared painstakingly, as the 100-odd residents of Wytaliba did, discovered nothing could stand in the way of the firestorm that hit on Friday afternoon. In 15 terrifying minutes, a hot, hazy day on the NSW Northern Tablelands turned into a test of survival when the township was engulfed. Two died and at latest count 45 houses were destroyed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most people in Wytaliba had trained to fight fires. Founded as an alternative-lifestyle commune, the cluster of family homes carved out of a tangled eucalyptus forest, crisscrossed by earthen paths, had its own brigade. No matter.</p><p>\"The intensity is what you can't handle,\" says Tony Keating, a resident of 35 years and member of the fire crew. \"We've had a fire every second year for as long as I've been here and we've always been able to deal with it. But this time it was impossibl-e \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It came up like a bullet out of a gun.\"</p><p>Scorched green land Step back and consider the big pictur-e. Southeast of Wytaliba, the picturesque rainforest at Terania Creek in Nightcap National Park is aflame near Lismore; behind Coffs Harbour, the towering, moss-lined Antarctic beech forests at Wauchope are burning; the rolling dairy country of the Clarence Valley has gone from emerald green to a scorched ebony in -places, having received less than a tenth of its average annual rainfall; beloved Binna Burra Lodge in the Gold Coast hinterland was razed in September, something no visit-or to that usually lush retreat backing on to World Heritage-listed Gondwana rainforest could have come at; suburbs back from the beach on the Sunshine Coast have been evacuated five times this year and counting, with homes lost to the advancing fire fronts.</p><p>\"If you had told me that Binna Burra was going to burn down and that was just the pipe opener to the fire season, I would have said you were nuts,\" says David Bowman, the professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the University of Tasmania. \"But now we are seeing all these other iconic places like Wauchope (and) Nightcap Range burning and it's so un-believable. These are wet, subtropical or warm-temperate rainforests \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I am trying to remain on an even keel. It's so serious.\" More than one million hectares have been blackened in NSW - 21/2 times the area affected on Black Saturday 2009 in Victoria - and Queensland has had more homes destroyed in the past 12 months than the accumulated losses from all past bushfire -seasons. If scientists are agog, imagin-e the shock for the local communities and emergency services-, which have been stretched to breaking point this week, as the fire conditions in NSW touched catastrophic levels on Tuesday and continue to deterior-ate north of the border.</p><p>Parched soil While the debate over who or what's to blame rumbles on - green-minded councils and -national park managers for failing to back-burn overgrown forests or federal and state governments for not acting on climate change - the focus on the ground is to preserve life and property. The undeniable fact is that years of drought, higher-than-average spring temp-eratures and low rainfall have turned vast tracts of country into a powder keg, waiting for the strike of a match or lightning to ignite.</p><p>As Ross Bradstock, director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong, -explains: \"What we are seeing in northern NSW and Queensland is exceptional dry-nes-s-, compounded by rainfall defic-it, temperature anomalies, continuous fuel loads across the landscape, winds and low humid-ity. Those are the fundamentals of major bushfires. What's different is that the conditions have extende-d into areas that haven't traditionally burned to the extent they now are.\" The seasonal bushfire outlook issued in August by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre quantified the problem. Drawing on the expertise- of emergency services and agencies and top scientists, it found soil moisture in Queensland was in the lowest 1 per cent on record- for areas from Rockhampton on the state's central coast southward to the NSW border.</p><p>Much of central and northern NSW had experienced below-avera-ge winter rain, with some districts- historically dry. \"Wide-spread significant soil moisture deficit\" had resulted in an early start to the fire season there.</p><p>Queensland had a taste of what was to come in November last year, when the state was ravaged by 140 bushfires that burned out more than a million hectares of countryside. Fifteen homes and 60 sheds were lost, prompting the Audit Office to review- the emergency response.</p><p>The report, itself a follow-up to a highly critical 2014 review by the watchdog agency, makes uncomfortable reading in light of the drama now unfolding in central Queensland, on the Sunshine Coast and to the south and west of Brisbane.</p><p>Though it found that Queensland Fire and Emergency Services had improved its \"visibility and oversight\" of bushfire risk, including establishing the Office of Bush-fire Mitigation and area fire management groups, QFES had missed deadlines to improve readiness for this taxing season. Further, it had not fully implemented any of the recommend-ations from the 2014 report, despite committing to do so within 12 months, and more work was needed to ensure communities were not exposed to higher levels of risk \"than they need to be\".</p><p>Criticising QFES's collaboration with other key stakeholders, the Queensland Audit Office said: \"In particular, it should continue to engage with land managers and local governments to better identify bushfire risks and priorities mitigation activities.\"</p><p>Tongues of 50m flames No one is questioning the effort of the volunteer and full-time profes-s-ional firefighters on the ground. The wonder in both Queensland and NSW is that more lives haven't been lost, given the size and intensity of the fires.</p><p>Both victims in Wytaliba, grandmother Vivian Chaplain, 69, and fellow community elder George- Nole, aged in his 80s, died trying to defend their homes. The resurgent Kangawalla fire to the west of the township, spotted as a plume of smoke about 3pm on Friday-, came on so quickly that others barely had time to grab children and pets before fleeing.</p><p>The howling wind felt like it would \"rip your head off\", one -survivor recounted. At the height of the emergency, people found refuge on a cricket pitch, eyes water-ing in the heat and dense smoke as 50m tongues of flames licked at the outfield.</p><p>\"It shows you \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what a fine edge the environment is on,\" says Keating. \"A few degrees lift in temperature, a shift in weather patterns and, bang, we're in trouble.\" The third victim, Julie Fletcher, 63, also died at her bushland home, in Johns River outside Taree on the NSW mid-north coast.</p><p>At the Scenic Rim, southwest of Brisbane, where new-built sub-divisions around Boonah and rural homesteads are under ferocious threat, mayor Greg Christensen has never seen anything like it. \"We've had fires run across the ground like it was a pool of kerosene,\" he says. The strain is telling on weary fire crews, who barely had time to catch their breath when the severe fire conditions at the weekend relented, only to ramp up again on Wednesday.</p><p>Reinforcements from Tasman-ia, the Northern Territory and New Zealand have been welcomed- with open arms: more hot and blustery days are forecast.</p><p>The question is: How long can the thin, red line hold?</p><p>Typically, the fire season in Queensland is over by December, but this year's onslaught not only began sooner than ever but also threatens to extend into next year. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says relieving rain isn't on the hori-zon before January at the earliest.</p><p>Danger signs By then, Victoria will be in the frame if the east-coast drought persists, its wet eucalyptus forests drying out to unleash some of the world's most potent fire fuel loads. Bowman is seeing danger signs in Tasmania, where destroyed rainforest accounts for an estimated 3.2 per cent of losses this year. In 2016, the famed pencil pines burned in the rainforest-like Gondwana reserves around Lake Mackenzie on the state's Central Plateau, an ominous omen.</p><p>The author of a book on Aust-ralia's rainforest estate, Bowman has ventured into what should be some of the state's wettest forests to gauge the fire risk. \"It's a worry,\" he says. \"You put your hand on a log that should be slimy, and it's dry and powdery \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 ready to burn.\" He is deeply \"discombobulated\" by what is happening in northern NSW and Queensland. For all the misery the fires are causing, scientists have much to learn from the novel sites that are burning.</p><p>\"That is part of the materials we need for the adaptation step \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I am very aware it is terrible at a human level but scientifically it is very -significant,\" Bowman tells The -Australian.</p><p>\"If we can start understanding the fire progression, how fires interact with different land uses and land types \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we can start wrapping our minds around the fact that this type of country has burned.\"</p><p>Risks underestimated Bradstock, an expert consultant to the royal commission into Victoria's 2009 Black Saturday disaster, says Queensland's bushfire risk has been creeping up on the 100-point Forest Fire Danger Index. Traditionally, a bad fire day in the state's thickly populated southeast scored about 50; but last November and during the current emergency it would have nudged the century mark at times.</p><p>That might be a far cry from the conditions on February 7, 2009, in Victoria, where the FFDI ranged from an unprecedented 160 to 200, ushering in the new \"catastrophic\" classification after 173 people died in the flames of Black Saturday, but it is highly confronting for communities with little or no bushfire exposure and would sternly challenge even the most hardened firefighters.</p><p>\"We know from our research that people underestimate their own personal bushfire risk,\" says Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre. \"Our research is consistently showing that many Australians, particularly those in higher-risk areas, are not sufficiently ready for fire and have not put fire plans in place well ahead of time.</p><p>\"They understand that when the conditions are right, hot and windy days, with dry vegetation, fires will occur. But they just don't think it will happen to them.\" It's no exaggeration to say Aust-ralia is entering uncharted territory this bushfire season. What's evident from the experience in NSW and Queensland to date is that more of just about everything is needed to tackle the lethally dry conditions: more muscle- power on the ground, more water-bombing aircraft overhead, more cash from the taxpayer.\"The risk is here, the risk is now, and we will have worsening conditions as we head into summer,\" NSW Rural Fire Services Com-missioner Shane Fitzsimmons warns. Who can afford to gainsay him?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-2695ba7e05b511eaa08a5bc5fa094d08b389929bd5a5b04713dd9d40dbad0502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGW-8R61-F0JP-W1KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1890\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A7YO</classCode><className>GEOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000172</classCode><className>BEACHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Our conversations tend to be influenced by the here and now.</p><p>\"It never used to be this hot,\" is the refrain as we brave the barbecue in the middle of a summer heatwave. Or else it's a bitter \"so much for global warming!\", as we stoke the home fire on a bitterly cold midwinter evening.</p><p>However, the data and the experts both suggest the decade now coming to a close was not business as usual, at least across several key measures.</p><p>\"It's definitely been a decade of extremes,\" says Anna Ukkola, climate scientist and research fellow at the Australian National University.</p><p>The hottest topic right now is temperature. \"It is the hottest decade on record over all of Australia,\" Ukkola says. \"It's about one degree hotter than the average of the last 100 years.</p><p>\"We've now had four decades in a row that have been hotter than the average, with the last one being the hottest of them all. It holds pretty much across Australia. The temperature trends are very similar.\" The Bureau of Meteorology tends to compare annual observations to those seen between 1961 and 1990, as a kind of scientific control period. The conclusion, however, is very similar.</p><p>\"It will be clearly Australia's warmest decade on record,\" says Blair Trewin, BoM senior climatologist. \"It's most likely going to come in around 0.85 of a degree above the 1961-90 average, which will make it about 0.3 of a degree warmer than any previous decade. It also looks like being the record warm decade for every individual state and territory.\" Trewin says that since 2013, every year has been among the top 10 warmest years on record in Australia, and that every year of the decade except 2011 recorded above annual mean temperatures (2011 was merely average).</p><p>The country's warmest year, in records stretching back a century, was 2013, although the last days of this month may yet see this overtaken by 2019.</p><p>The year drawing to a close is already on track to be among the four warmest years on record, with the final annual mean temperature expected to be 1.3C to 1.4C above average.</p><p>Heatwaves aren't what they used to be, either; they're worse. \"With the increase in mean temperatures, we also see an increase in the occurrence of extreme high temperatures,\" Trewin says.</p><p>The BoM says very high monthly maximum temperatures that used to occur only 2 per cent of the time in the past (1951-80) now occur 12 per cent of the time.</p><p>It suggests this decade has seen Australia's worst heatwaves, with the country recording the three hottest days on record.</p><p>As well, the BoM reports that Sydney, Hobart and Adelaide all had their hottest days on record during this decade.</p><p>Natural variations in climate undoubtedly have played a role in all this mercury-soaring record-busting. Australia always has been, and always will be, a land of \"droughts and flooding rains\", as Dorothea Mackellar would have it. Cyclical changes in the Pacific Ocean and the atmosphere above it give us the El Nino and La Nina weather patterns with which most Australians are now familiar.</p><p>The big wet experienced from mid-2010 to early 2012 was, for example, linked to a strong La Nina, bringing record rains to Queensland in 2010 and to Western Australia in 2011.</p><p>Natural differences in the sea surface temperatures in the western and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean - known as the Indian Ocean Dipole - also affect our climate.</p><p>A \"positive\" IOD typically brings less rainfall to southern Australia and the Top End and a \"negative\" IOD is linked to more rain in those regions.</p><p>This year, for example, a positive IOD has been a key player in the heat and drought conditions experienced in many regions.</p><p>Back in 2016, a very strong negative IOD saw unusually heavy rain throughout parts of eastern Australia between May and October.</p><p>However, several leading climatologists who have examined the decade as whole, and those preceding it, do not believe the extreme conditions of the 2010s can be explained entirely by such natural ebb and flow.</p><p>\"One of the advantages of looking at averages over a decade is that it will tend to smooth out a lot of that year-to-year variability,\" Trewin says.</p><p>\"So if you look at the decade as a whole we've had La Ninas but we've also had El Nino, we've had both positive and negative IODs. The fundamental underlining picture with the warming decade is the long-term warming trend.\" Ukkola agrees. \"In terms of the temperature, looking at the long-term context, it's way outside natural variability,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's a clear climate change signal and the temperatures are well above what we have seen for Australia in the past.\" One of the regions to feel the heat the most has been the Murray-Darling Basin, where farmers in one of the nation's key food bowls continue to battle drought.</p><p>\"Over the Murray-Darling Basin we have now had 12 consecutive seasons - so the last three years - in a row that have been below the long-term average (rainfall) conditions,\" Ukkola says.</p><p>\"That's the longest consecutive period that it has been below average that we can see in the 100 years of data that we have.\" Crucially, it is the winters in this vital region that have been exceptionally dry, depriving farmers of rains for crops and rivers of much-needed restoration.</p><p>\"The last three winters are all in the bottom 10 per cent (for rainfall) of all the years (in the basin),\" Ukkola says. \"We've never had three consecutive winters together that have been so dry.\" It has not only been exceptionally dry in the Murray-Darling region at the back end of this decade; it also has been remarkably hot, adding insult to injury.</p><p>According to the BoM, the region's four overall warmest January to August periods on record since 1910 have been this year, last year, 2017 and 2016.</p><p>\"The current drought is one of the worst droughts we've experienced,\" Ukkola says. \"We've had bad ones in the past - the millennium drought, for example - but this one is definitely in the top four droughts in Australia over the last 100 years.\" However, the picture for rainfall across the decade elsewhere is mixed. Ukkola says the 2010s was the driest decade on record only for the country's southwest, while the BoM advises the decade was neither the driest nor the wettest decade for any state or territory.</p><p>NSW, Victoria and Tasmania all had rainfall below the long-term average this decade, while Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland were all above the long-term average, the BoM says.</p><p>In fact, despite the drought, the record temperatures, the expanding fire seasons and the more intense heatwaves, Australia as a whole has just experienced its second wettest decade.</p><p>\"Excluding the current drought, which is unusual, the rainfall is well within what's normal for Australia,\" Ukkola says.</p><p>\"Apart from the driest decade on record for the southwest; everywhere else we can't say that it's unusual in the context of the last 120 years that we have records for.\" The rainfall for the decade was influenced by two intense big wets, in 2010-12 and 2016, with the largest impact on the tropics and parts of the outback. Queensland had its wettest year on record in 2010 and WA in 2011.</p><p>\"In general terms the longer-term trend is for southern Australian to get drier, particularly during the cooler part of the year, between about April and October,\" Trewin says. \"However, northwest Australia has definitely got wetter; the NT and the tropical parts of WA.\" While the decade was one of extremes, there were slightly fewer cyclones than is average. However, those that did strike more than compensated for this with their intensity and devastating impact.</p><p>Cyclone Yasi tore down the Queensland coast from late January to early February 2011, making landfall at Mission Beach on February 2. A category 5 cyclone with 285km/h winds, it forced 10,000 people from their homes, killed one man, damaged 2636 houses and businesses and caused an estimated $1.5bn in damage to public infrastructure.</p><p>Two years later, in January 2013, Cyclone Oswald brought heavy rainfall and floods to large parts of Queensland and NSW. Six people died, 2000 were isolated for days and damage to vital infrastructure ran into hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>And in March 2017, Cyclone Debbie, a powerful category 4 system with winds up to 263km/h, devastated resorts in the Whitsunday Islands, including Hamilton and Daydream, as well as Airlie Beach, Proserpine, Bowen and Collinsville. At least 10 people died as a result of the flooding and severe weather.</p><p>\"Over the 2010s there have been an average of about nine tropical cyclones per year in the Australian region, slightly below the long-term average of 10-11,\" Trewin says. \"We are seeing a slight decrease over time in the number of cyclones but an increase in the proportion of cyclones that are intense.\" If it wasn't flood it was fire. While coming after the horror of Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires in February 2009, the past decade saw its own share of major fires, as well as a lengthening of the bushfire season in parts of the country.</p><p>The fires are too numerous to mention but records point to this season as among the worst. Since September, bushfires have burnt an estimated two million hectares across NSW and Queensland, destroying more than 900 homes and killing eight people, while some are ongoing.</p><p>The early arrival of the bushfire season for 2019-20 was notable. According to a BoM analysis released on December 18, areas of all states and territories this past spring experienced highest on record daily Forest Fire Danger Index levels.</p><p>BoM reveals accumulated FFDI values for spring were more than twice the average across large areas of eastern Australia.</p><p>However, such early high bushfire conditions did not suddenly arrive this season. The BoM analysis shows it has been a marked trend across much of the nation this decade.</p><p>In 2010, the accumulated FFDI for spring in Australia was just over 1500; this past spring it was more than double that, with a steadily trending rise between these extremes.</p><p>Things also have warned up in the sea this decade, with more records set. \"The sea surface temperatures over the Australian region over the last decade have been about 0.55 of a degree above the 1961-90 average,\" Trewin says.</p><p>\"So not quite as sharp a difference as for land temperatures but still quite significant. It has also been about 0.2 of a degree warmer than any other decade.</p><p>\"Also, 2016 was clearly the warmest year on record (for ocean temperatures) in the Australian region. No other year gets close to it.\" Even Australia's Antarctic Territory has had a wild ride. \"Until 2015, sea ice cover in the Antarctic region had been increasing slightly, but it's decreased quite sharply after 2015,\" Trewin says. \"And since late 2016 it has been at or near the lowest levels of the past 40 years.\" From the Top End to Tassie, on land and sea, and even the ice, the decade's climate was tumultuous and often unprecedented.</p><p>AUSTRALIA'S WEATHER IN THE 2010S TEMPERATURE   Last decade (2010s) the hottest on record (0.85 degree above 1960-1990 average)   Last decade about .3 of a degree warmer than any previous decade.   Every year of the decade except 2011 was above annual mean temperatures. (2011 was average.)   Record warm decade for every individual state and territory.   Decade includes Australia's two hottest days on record: December 19, 2019 (average maximum across the country of 41.9\u00c2\u00baC, exceeding previous record of 40.3 \u00c2\u00baC on January 7, 2013).</p><p>RAINFALL / DROUGHT   The second wettest decade for Australia as a whole.</p><p>  NSW, Vic and Tas all had rainfall below the long term average this decade.   Rainfall in WA, the NT, SA and Qld all above the long term average this decade.</p><p>  Qld recorded its wettest year on record in 2010 and WA in 2011.   Jan to Nov 2019 the second lowest rainfall for that period on record for Australia as a whole.</p><p>  Last three years constitute the longest period of below average rainfall for Murray-Darling Basin and NSW since records begin in 1900 (3 years and counting).</p><p>Graph showing: Australian annual mean temperature anomalySources include: BoM, Aust National University, Aust Institute for Disaster Resilience</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-50483c50220911eaa66677545c0b26095ee365a7f730282e494722a13991b604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV8-3561-F0JP-W1TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2107\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 28, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DF9M</classCode><className>SEVERE SUMMER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DT1H</classCode><className>NATURAL SCIENCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The vineyards of Griffith passed in a blur. He stopped at Victoria's Twelve Apostles, but took a few photos and then left.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was not what the Griffith University professor had planned. But as a monster heatwave baked a crust onto southern Australia, \"it was not possible to be outside at all\", he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I couldn't do anything, I was basically just in the car all the time. Even then I got fried because the sunshine was so hot, it went through the glass,\" Stantic recalls.</p><p>\"When I was planning the trip, Uluru was supposed to be 36 degrees. But when I got to Adelaide the weather prediction said it would be 46 degrees there. I like warm weather but I thought 'this is extreme'.\"</p><p>After eight days on the road, Stantic cut his trip short and headed home to the Gold Coast, sadly concluding \"there was no reason to keep driving\".</p><p>Unhappy road trippers were not the only Australians whose plans were disrupted by freakishly hot weather this summer.</p><p>In Perth, cricket fans avoided an historic Test fixture amid predictions of 38-degree days. Sun melted a coastal highway filled with holidaymakers in northern NSW. Victoria's coal generators shut down. Tasmania burned. And rotting fish corpses lining the Darling River at Menindee forced anglers to seriously rethink their plans.</p><p>The record-smashing temperatures of recent weeks have made it very clear: climate change has arrived. Depictions of a world almost too hot for humans are no longer an abstraction. Summer has changed, and so must we.</p><p>\"Climate change is putting stress on all our communities,\" says Sheila Nguyen, executive director of the Sports Environment Alliance, which helps the sporting community manage changes to the natural environment.</p><p>\"That stress in Australia is of cultural importance and we have a lot to lose. Across the board, impacts are happening. We have to make decisions for the present and ... decisions for the future.\"</p><p>Western Sydney University researchers recently investigated the effect of high temperatures on city-dwellers. Their findings suggest Australian summers are increasingly being lived indoors, in air-conditioned environments - a trend that is making people more isolated and lonely.</p><p>\"[On hot days] people would, if they had air-conditioning at home, turn that on and stay within the home or get into an air-conditioned car to go to an air-conditioned shopping centre or cinema or other space,\" says senior researcher Dr Louise Crabtree.</p><p>\"If we keep relying on air-conditioned spaces as the focal points of activity on hot days, increasingly we will see people . . . not going to the local park or engaging in their local neighbourhood.\"</p><p>Extreme heat can be crippling for those who can't cool their homes, such as people on low incomes.</p><p>\"People in social housing can't put in an air-conditioning unit or install a ceiling fan. They would literally lie on the floor in the coolest part of the house and not move for hours,\" Crabtree says. \"We heard from people who, on a hot day, can't get out of the house because they don't have transport options that are affordable and cool.\"</p><p>Blast-furnace ambient temperatures also turn people off physical exercise.</p><p>\"If it's just too hot and a walk to the bus stop is too far and the bus stop has no shade, people will stop walking. It's very much impacting how much people are walking or bicycling,\" Crabtree says.</p><p>Aside from the obvious health implications of less physical activity, researchers are also concerned about the \"mental health effects of feeling trapped in your house and unable to do anything about it\".</p><p>Among its recommendations, the study suggested finding ways to cool outdoor urban spaces to draw people out of their homes, such as creating community gardens, as well as improving the accessibility of public infrastructure such as libraries, swimming pools and community centres.</p><p>A heavy reliance on air-conditioners can also cause problems when the power bill arrives.</p><p>When the mercury slid past 46 degrees in Adelaide last month, making it the hottest capital city on record, pensioner Ann Petersen had no choice but to run her air-conditioner day and night.</p><p>\"It worries me because this is going to cost me a huge bill which I haven't budgeted for. And I know a lot of other people are going to be in exactly the same boat,\" the 71-year-old says.</p><p>Petersen, who manages a number of severe health conditions, found it \"extremely difficult to cope because of the heat\".</p><p>\"I went out once to [get] the mail and I thought 'I'm going to pass out',\" she says. \"I've got a little cat, it worries me that he wants to go outside. I've got chickens out the back, you worry about them. And the garden is completely burnt.\"</p><p>Such was the heat that Petersen could not leave the house to get groceries, instead relying on outside help or making do with what little food was in the cupboard.</p><p>In a submission to a Senate inquiry last year, the Australian Medical Association warned that heatwaves kill more Australians than any other type of natural disaster. The elderly and the ill are especially vulnerable - a problem set to be compounded by the ageing population.</p><p>The association cited \"significant concerns\" over the preparedness of the healthcare system to withstand the challenges of more frequent and severe extreme weather events.</p><p>Heatwaves cause a spike in ambulance callouts, hospital admissions and GP visits. A GP working in Sydney's west recently recounted a week in which she treated a warehouse worker who felt unwell after working in 40-degree temperatures, elderly patients with heat exhaustion from taking public transport and a patient with multiple sclerosis experiencing fatigue and difficulty walking.</p><p>During Adelaide's heatwave, South Australian authorities reportedly declared a \"code red\" to release extra funds to homeless shelters, enabling them to extend their operating hours. A Red Cross phone service that checks on vulnerable people during heatwaves was also activated.</p><p>Even the fittest among us are being forced to adapt to blistering temperatures when braving the outdoors. The Climate Council has warned that extreme weather events such as heatwaves threaten the viability of Australian sport as it is currently played - from the elite level down to backyard cricket.</p><p>Heat affecting players and spectators at the Australian Open has become a perennial issue, and the opening stages of January's Tour Down Under cycling event were shortened amid predictions of temperatures above 40 degrees.</p><p>Sheila Nguyen says climate change is affecting sport at every level.</p><p>\"We are restricted [as] to when we can play, when we can ride our bike, when we can go and play beach cricket,\" she says.</p><p>\"All these things are changing the dynamic of the culture of sport, how we consume it and interact with it.\"</p><p>New sports infrastructure should be designed to minimise heat - by avoiding large expanses of concrete, for example - and the duration, format and time of play for some sports may have to change, Nguyen says.</p><p>The consequences of severe weather can rock communities where sport is a lifeline, she says. She cites the Millennium drought last decade, where towns and cities were forced to adopt tight water restrictions. Sports grounds went unwatered and in some cases sport was cancelled altogether.</p><p>The alliance encourages the development of policies, appropriate infrastructure and climate scenario planning to sustain sports into the future.</p><p>When summer gets unbearable, some might consider getting out of town. But Griffith University tourism expert Susanne Becken says searing temperatures and other extreme weather will change the way we vacation.</p><p>People will increasingly travel to beaches, lakes and swimming holes, or seek out the cooler temperatures of mountains and hinterlands.</p><p>Traffic congestion in these places will increase, and emergency services can suddenly be stretched if, say, a bushfire arrives and thousands of people need to be evacuated.</p><p>Meantime, \"people will avoid the hot places\", Becken says. These include outback and regional areas where governments are investing heavily in tourism infrastructure, she says, adding that global warming was \"in some ways undermining our economic development policies\".</p><p>Storms, hail, smoke from bushfires and other extreme weather can disrupt flights, throwing holiday schedules into disarray.</p><p>And of course the pernicious effects of climate change can badly damage tourism drawcards.</p><p>\"The coral bleaching [on the Great Barrier Reef] is the most obvious. But also a forest fire in Tasmania - if the landscape is not as scenic or what you wanted to see is not there anymore, that's obviously a longer-term problem,\" Becken says.</p><p>Bela Stantic has not given up on his road trip dreams.</p><p>He still wants to see the underground town of Coober Pedy and spend a New Year's Eve at Uluru. But in future he'll do it a little differently.</p><p>\"Summer was not a good time to travel anywhere,\" he says. \"Next time I'll do it in July.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc74020sgjjqum055hi5q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCS-SV91-JD34-V380-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Temperatures - Victorians sweltered through three days of 40 degree temperatures, wind speeds were up to about 100km an hour.</p><p>He spoke of the McArthur Forest Fire Index which measures how dangerous situations are and an index of over 50 is considered to be extreme. But he said on that day, on Black Saturday, in fact, the index was between 120 and 180.</p><p>JACK RUSH: The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index predicted that not only would 7 February have the potential to be the worst day on record for bushfires, but the intensity of the potential fires would be such that it could not be imagined by our generation.</p><p>Not only the intensity of the fire, the heat of the fire, but its speed was phenomenal. Fire spotted kilometres ahead. Fireballs seemingly of atomic force came before the fire. The fire did not discriminate between buildings of brick, timber or other construction.</p><p>Such fires create their own weather and are beyond the most sophisticated attempts to control them. The evidence will demonstrate people made decisions in relation to stay or go with an unrealistic optimism having regard to the nature of these fires.</p><p>PETER CAVE: Mr Jack Rush QC. Right at the heart of this investigation is that very contentious stay-or-go policy.</p><p>Is that your understanding that will be the focus?</p><p>RACHAEL BROWN: That's correct Peter as you heard Mr Rush QC just say then it will be pivotal to the first block of hearings which will run for at least eight weeks. He mentions the potential for confusion and misunderstanding of this bedrock policy and as everyone would remember to that day, for many people living in areas that were topographically just impossible to fight this fire, perhaps that stay option should not have been there.</p><p>Mr Rush QC mentioned the evacuation policies of some parts of Europe and the US, he cited the Californian fire in October 2007 in which more than 13 homes.. sorry, more than 3,000 homes were destroyed but only ten people were killed.</p><p>So one of the things that may come out of this commission is perhaps we need an evacuation policy for some parts of Victoria. Within that it things like refuges will also be considered, apparently there isn't any refuge in Victoria that meets CFA standards where community members can go.</p><p>And also planning regimes; Mr Rush QC said there are bureaucratic and complex laws regarding vegetation clearing and also our current building standards don't take in, into things, into account.</p><p>PETER CAVE: Rachel even before the hearing began this morning, there was already some controversy, can you take us through that?</p><p>RACHAEL BROWN: That surrounds the Commission's rule that only those whose conduct will come under scrutiny during the hearing can give evidence. Already federal Liberal MP Fran Bailey has come out saying that the refusal to allow some survivors to appear was a slap in the face.</p><p>I've spoken to the Gippsland Independent, the Independent Member for Gippsland East Craig Ingram this morning and he's been denied to appear on behalf of the Wildfire Task Force. And Tim Tobin QC representing people affected by fire that was caused by potentially power issues; like conductor failing or falling down.</p><p>He's still waiting to hear whether he can appear but that's confused slightly by the fact there's a class action in regards to the fire that started, potentially in Kilmore East because of alleged line coming down.</p><p>Justice Teague devoted most of his opening to this issue and invited people to make formal submissions but he also noted that there's only four months to produce an interim report before he delivers the formal report by the end of July next year.</p><p>BERNARD TEAGUE: We plan to meet those deadlines. We can only do so by limiting the issues that we address and by dealing with the more critical issues first. Our focus will be primarily on issues that will address how a better and safer environment can be created for Victorian communities.</p><p>PETER CAVE: And that was Justice Bernard Teague at the Royal Commission this morning, our reporter there was Rachel Brown.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-2547321</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VH0-C6H1-2RG6-Y559-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473395</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><timeReceived>12:14 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 20, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Event/ROYAL COMMISSION.
