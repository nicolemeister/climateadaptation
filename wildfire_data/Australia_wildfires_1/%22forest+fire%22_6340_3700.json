The grass grows inside the lake and around the Clear Lake Reserve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Parks Victoria describes fairy grass as \"a native blown grass which colonises in damp, bare areas and germinates as soon as temperature and moisture levels are suitable\".</p><p>Clear Lake is home to about 40 residents and the town has faced problems with fairy grass since the late 1980s.</p><p>Resident Trevor Watson has lived in the town his whole life and said the problem subsided when the grass was burned off.</p><p>\"The first year it got really bad, there was still water in the lake and the grass all around the tree line. We burned around the trees. Then the next year the lake dried up and we burned inside it,\" he said.</p><p>Related: Clear Lake fairy grass influx causes fire concerns</p><p>Parks Victoria, the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, the Country Fire Authority and Clear Lake residents co-ordinated the burn-off.</p><p>\"From then on we didn't have a problem with the fairy grass until 2015 when it came back. When Parks Victoria slash it, all it's doing is putting the seeds back on the floor of the lake,\" Mr Watson said.</p><p>Residents Jen and Craig Giggins said their house was inundated with fairy grass a few weeks ago, and most residents had experienced the same situation.</p><p>Mrs Giggins said the grass was \"more than eight feet high\" in some areas.</p><p>\"It's heartbreaking. It gets into all the sheds, the chicken coops, up the fences, over the air-conditioners. It comes into your house and is impossible to weed out of the garden,\" Mrs Giggins said.</p><p>\"We only just finished cleaning up our place from the last time it happened and then six weeks later it was back.\"</p><p>Mr Giggins said Parks Victoria had not contacted residents about conducting further assessments since its November assessment.</p><p>Related: Opinions split over fairy grass solutions</p><p>\"Parks Victoria keep telling us that they are monitoring the situation. We have all contracted Parks Victoria individually about different problems,\" Mr Giggins said.</p><p>\"Every year the fairy grass season rolls around and they just seem to ignore it. We keep getting told it's a huge fire risk, but nothing gets done.\"</p><p>In 2002 a build up of fairy grass caught on fire at Dock Lake Reserve, which threatened people who were at the reserve playing sport. About 225 hectares of land and the Taylors Lake Football Clubrooms were destroyed.</p><p>Clear Lake farmer Lachie Wilson said he was concerned about the fire danger risk of fairy grass at his property.</p><p>\"On the most recent Total Fire Ban day (on January 29) when it was more than 40 degrees and there were 50km/h winds blowing straight out the lake, if a pilot light or powerline had sparked then you have no break between the grass and the house. The grass is very combustible and can move around so easily,\" he said.</p><p>\"There are paddocks around here that are covered in fairy grass. I don't know how we're going to go about sowing in them. It was getting into the headers last time and were overheating.\"</p><p>Parks Victoria area chief ranger Zoe Wilkinson said fairy grass had appeared at many lakes and waterway across the Wimmera this summer.</p><p>\"This summer, Parks Victoria has been in regular contact with some of the people living near Clear Lake about the impact of fairy grass blowing from the lake-bed and onto their properties,\" she said.</p><p>\"It is a difficult grass to manage, as treatments such as herbicide and burning have been found to result in an increased density of the fairy grass in later seasons because the treatment also removes competing vegetation.</p><p>\"Local evidence suggests the best treatment is to allow the natural process of vegetation succession with minimal human intervention. Importantly, Clear Lake also contains registered Aboriginal heritage sites which must be protected when considering any treatment of this native grass.\"</p><p>She said Forest Fire Management Wimmera would assess the Clear Lake fairy grass as part of its fuel management strategy for 2019-20, alongside the CFA and Parks Victoria.</p><p>\"These will include the local community in these conversations,\" she said.</p><p>While you're with us, you can now receive updates straight to your inbox twice weekly from the Wimmera Mail-Times.

Narre Warren police executed a warrant about 6.30pm on September 12 at a house in Latrobe St and discovered the cache of weapons. Among the 29 prohibited and controlled weapons were flick knives, hunting knives, swords and machetes. A 39-year-old Cranbourne man is expected to be charged on summons with possessing and dealing in prohibited and controlled weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2 NARRE WARREN A Narre Warren driver lost control of her car and smashed into her neighbour's house on September 10. The woman, who lived across the road, pulled up to back into her garage but reverse instead and ended up crashing through the garage and into the main bedroom. Nobody was home at the time. Police warned people to drive carefully and pay attention when behind the wheel.</p><p>3 EUMEMMERRING Casey detectives are investigating an armed robbery in Eumemmerring on July 30 at 3.45pm. Two men went to the United service station in Princes Highway where they demanded money from the attendant. Police believed the first was armed with a long rifle. The attendant handed over cash from the till. It is believed the men then left in a white four-door VW Golf hatchback. The first man is described as caucasian, aged in his 20s, 165cm - 170cm with a light coloured beard. He was wearing a bandana over his face and mouth, had black hair and was wearing black gloves, light pants, a striped jumper and thongs. The second male had brown hair, slim build and was 177cm. He was aged in his mid 20s, and had tattoos on his right arm. He was wearing a red hoodie and black tracksuit pants. Anyone with information is asked to phone the Narre Warren police station on 9705\"3111.</p><p>4 HALLAM Fire crews from Hallam were called to a massive blaze that ripped through double-storey shops in Dandenong on September 13. Firefighters were called to the Lonsdale St address just after 1.30am and the building was already well alight when crews arrived on scene. Rostered duty officer Gary Bryant said it was a well-managed fire and crews worked hard to get it under control. Firefighters were also able to rescue a dog from the back of one of the shops, pictured above. An investigation will take place to determine how the fire started.</p><p>5 CASEY This year's bushfire season is predicted to start earlier and be worse than usual due to a warm, dry winter and forecasts of a hot summer. CFA chief officer Steve Warrington said firefighters wanted people in bushfire prone areas to be prepared for the worst case scenario. \"The outlook suggests that we could be looking at the commencement of a fire season as early as October,\" Mr Warrington said. \"Fire season preparations are well under way.\" CFA has, along with Forest Fire Management Victoria, brought forward the planned burning program. \"We are checking staging areas and landing sites for aircraft across districts as well as providing training on hazardous trees and encouraging our firefighters to do burn over drills,\" Mr Warrington said. \"We're confident that our people are ready to fulfil their important duty protecting lives and property.\" For information on how to prepare for the fire season, go to cfa.vic.gov.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRANBR-CranbourneLeader20170920Cranbourne7000331234468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MLBLDR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHG-D3N1-F0JP-W3T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cranbourne Leader (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Cranbourne Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 20, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

bushfires raging in NSW and Queensland, Vic-torians are bracing for a potentially deadly summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the state still reeling from Black Saturday in 2009, how is our region placed to deal with another catastrophic fire?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As NSW and Queensland burns, some politicians, such as Barnaby Joyce, have pointed the finger at \"greenies\" by claiming environmental regulations have strangled the ability to manage land and exacerbated the fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of last season's fires were on public land, which is the responsibility of Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>In the Otway District, which takes in Geelong, FFMVic says it is ready and has the ability to respond to emergencies 24 hours, seven days a week.</p><p>DELWP Barwon South West acting deputy chief fire officer Steve Pellicano said while the Otway District had received recent rain, there was the possibility of above average fire conditions due to underlying soil dryness coupled with an expected hot and dry -summer.</p><p>\"It is inevitable fires occur every summer in the Otway District, but the region is well-placed to respond to all emergencies and protect com-munities,\" Mr Pellicano said.</p><p>\"We have been preparing for the fire season throughout the year by undertaking planned burning, slashing and mowing vegetation, and maintaining fire access roads to -ensure fast response times.\" The royal commission into the Black Saturday bushfires, which killed 173 people on February 7, 2009, recommended 5 per cent of Victorian public land be burnt each year.</p><p>But planned burning in Victoria declined from more than 125,000ha in 2016-17 to about 74,000ha in 2017-18.</p><p>The main arguments against prescribed burning are it does not help reduce the damaging impacts of bushfires, and it causes problems for -biodiversity.</p><p>Deb Sparks, from the Centre of Excellence for Prescribed Burning, said prescribed burning was an essential part of bushfire mitigation but the windows for burning were -becoming shorter.</p><p>\"Recent research conducted in Tasmania and NSW into the windows for prescribed burning under climate change scenarios suggest that the windows are changing,\" Ms Sparks said.</p><p>FFMVic says planned burning in the Otway District over autumn was successful, covering more than 5500ha, mostly around coastal townships.</p><p>Mr Pellicano said planned burning was carried out under carefully managed conditions, greatly reducing the impact of bushfires by reducing the amount of fuel.</p><p>\"This means fires are less intense, making it more likely that our firefighters can contain fires before they impact on people, property and the environment,\" he said.</p><p>\"During the autumn planned burning season, FFMVic removed significant amounts of forest fuel around at-risk communities including Lorne and Aireys Inlet. \" CFA District 7 operations manager Mick McGuinness, who covers the Geelong -region, said he supported FFMVic's burning operations.</p><p>\"They engage in both low intensity burns and high intensity burns to reduce the fuel loads to reduce the impact of fire on our townships and communities,\" Mr McGuinness said.</p><p>\"If we don't do that, then we're not complying with our Act, which is prevention and suppression of fires.</p><p>\"If we can reduce fuel loads around the forest interface of our townships then there is a lot higher likelihood of survival in those towns and communities when a bushfire occurs.\" Throughout October and November, an additional 33 seasonal firefighters joined the local FFMVic workforce, and from next week, more than 150 seasonal and permanent firefighters will be in place.</p><p>The Otway District's on-road firefighting fleet com-prises 38 specialised vehicles, including numerous fire -tankers and earthmoving -machinery.</p><p>The Sikorsky S61 waterbombing helicopter will arrive at Colac air base in coming weeks, and with a water-carrying capacity of 3000 litres, it will be on call for immediate response to fires across the Otway District.</p><p>The district also has access to Victoria's 50-strong aerial firefighting fleet, which is one of the largest and most sophisticated aircraft fleets in the world.</p><p>As part of national aircraft arrangements, Victoria can also access NSW and SA-based aircraft when required.</p><p>If a major fire does break out, residents like those in the small town of Bannockburn could find themselves on the front line.</p><p>With many \"townies\" buying up lifestyle blocks, the population of Bannockburn is tipped to double from 5750 to 10,018 by 2036.</p><p>Each November, like every other council area in CFA District 7, Golden Plains Shire fire prevention officer Matthew Sims travels across the shire issuing fire prevention notices to any property owner whose home poses an unnecessary fire risk.</p><p>The works must be completed by early December.</p><p>If a property owner fails to comply with the notice, they will be issued with an $1652 -infringement.</p><p>Council will also engage a contractor to attend and slash your property on behalf of council.</p><p>Golden Plains issued 493 notices this year, 150 more than last year. \"We're seeing a lot of high grass in new acreage developments where either houses are under construction, vacant, or recently moved in,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"We would love to go around in our first round of -inspections and have 5000 bowling greens, but that's not the case.</p><p>\"We do get some repeat -offenders.</p><p>\"It is still green at the -moment but that will only take a few days of hot weather to dry off and be a large risk.\" Mr McGuinness said the onus was also on residents to do their bit in an emergency.</p><p>\"We live in one of the three most fire-prone areas in the world, so you can't live in this environment and not be prepared,\" he said.</p><p>\"On those severe and -extreme fire danger days, don't be there - it's simple. \"You need to move away to survive.</p><p>\"Have your kit ready, have phone numbers in your mobile phone, have a battery operated radio with you, make sure people know where you're going and move out of those high-profile bush areas where you may lose your life.</p><p>\"Leave early and don't -return until it's safe.\"</p><p>HISTORICAL FIRES IN OUR REGION</p><p>Black Friday, January 13, 1939: Four people died at Barongarook near Colac, 71 across Victoria.</p><p>January 8, 1969: 18 people died in and around Lara, 23 people across Victoria.

No lives or properties have been lost.Warringah Pittwater members recently travelled to South Australia to assist combating bushfires at the Eden Valley.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANLY-Manly Daily-20140125-Manly-18-000105363500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYDCUM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BBY-8TR1-F0JP-W0N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463826</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Manly Daily (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Manly Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 25, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS003</classCode><className>SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Multiple large fires burning across the state, the drought creating dangerous fuel conditions and a strong westerly wind pushing fire danger ratings off the charts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In one of the most terrifying firefighting days in recent years, three people perished with fears for several others in a firestorm that took many residents by surprise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An estimated 150 homes, schools and businesses between the Queensland border down to the NSW Mid North Coast are believed to be destroyed with the loss expected to rise as assessment teams move in.</p><p>However, the nightmare has only just begun.</p><p>The state is now facing up to a dangerous summer of fires as several blazes burning in deep bush edge towards coastal populations.</p><p>The next challenge will come on Tuesday with fire crews bracing for conditions on par, if not worse, than conditions that fuelled the unprecedented emergency last week.</p><p>NSW Rural Fire Service fire behaviour analyst Simon Heemstra described the upcoming conditions as \"very hot, very dry and very windy\". \"The three are lining up on Tuesday for potentially significant fire weather,\" he said.</p><p>Over the next two days fire crews will be racing the clock to bring as many blazes as they can under control.</p><p>But containment efforts will be challenged by a drought-stricken landscape where there is plenty of fuel and no moisture in the soil.</p><p>NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described the resulting fire behaviour as \"extraordinary\".</p><p>\"You've got flammability of the fuel, which is seeing extraordinary fire behaviour, fires starting extremely quickly, spreading and burning very intensely,\" he said.</p><p>\"And very quickly with spot fire activity doubling or tripling what is normally expected over the fire conditions we have been experiencing.\" The fuel coupled with gusty winds on Friday created a situation where embers were travelling for more than 10km and starting spot fires. \"What we had on Friday was really deep mixing and it was pulling strong winds down and that was giving us that strong gustiness that was fanning the flames,\" Mr Heemstra explained.</p><p>\"That provides more heat and energy. Then the embers get higher into the atmosphere and are transported further.\" In some regions, like Ballina and Armidale, the fire danger ratings on Friday were the highest on record. A decent downpour a week ago had little impact.</p><p>\"The water sat on the surface and the wind we've had has taken it away and we are back to square one,\" Mr Heemstra said.</p><p>Fire crews were drawing from rivers, ponds and streams when possible and relying heavily on areas where water supply wasn't dire, like Coffs Harbour and the Richmond air force base.</p><p>On Friday night, firefighters around the Taree blazes could be heard calling in as properties became engulfed in flames. One volunteer, who earlier called in to say his crew was \"under attack\", declared: \"It's out of control here.\" Another firefighter spoke of being unable to save homes: \"Three houses are gone and we are engaging in property protection, but going to pull out. House is unsaveable.\" Over at Frasers Creek, a call went out for resources to help a person who was trapped.</p><p>\"We are going to try and put a defensive perimeter around the property,\" a volunteer said. \"Bridge involved in fire and is unpassable,\" another said. Not all residents chose to leave their properties.</p><p>\"There is a property here with 80 per cent of it surrounded by fire,\" a firefighter said. \"The owners do not want to leave.\" Emergency Services Minister David Elliott thanked the 1300 RFS volunteers and 200 NSW Fire and Rescue and interstate firefighters that were fighting the blazes.</p><p>RICHMOND VALLEY * Crews are fighting a

If someone had a bad season, we would send some firefighters to NSW.\"</p><p>Now he said the overlapping fire seasons could make it very hard to get extra people on the ground.</p><p>\"The scientists out doing the work are just as frustrated as we are - they have a clear understanding of what's happening, and people are just not listening.\"</p><p>He urged residents to accept there was a \"clear and present danger\" and to make sure politicians knew how they felt: \"We have to get (it) into the federal agenda that we have a problem.\"</p><p>Former Forest Fire Management, Victoria chief fire officer Ewan Waller also signed the letter to the prime minister earlier this year.</p><p>He told The Courier one of the reasons he did so was to advocate for more resources to stop fires spreading in the first place.</p><p>\"It's not just about aircraft, it's not just about bigger and better trucks, it's about prevention,\" he said.</p><p>\"The fire problem is going to move into Victoria all too soon. We are all very wary of coming into the summer.</p><p>\"The fringe areas, the surrounding areas of Ballarat are quite exposed.</p><p>\"The rural subdivisions and the settlements around it - keeping fires from those is really quite difficult. They are quite vulnerable.</p><p>\"I am very keen to get more resourcing in fuel management so we can do more slashing and burning off on a far broader area than we are doing now.</p><p>\"In Enfield (State Forest) and Canadian you need to actively manage the fuels otherwise they will cause you no end of trouble.\"</p><p>He said the Scotsburn fire a few years ago showed how fuel management could help minimise the damage.</p><p>Mr Waller said he expected a response to the letter soon and wanted to ensure any action had \"bipartisan support\".</p><p>BREAZE FORUM The BREAZE forum took place on Sunday with local residents and fire experts joining to discuss the \"New Bushfire Reality\" and the changing nature of our area's fire risk.</p><p>Adrian Whitehead, the director of Council and Community Action in the Climate Emergency, was one of the keynote speakers at the forum.</p><p>His organisation aims to encourage and support councils to prepare for the climate emergency.</p><p>\"We know these extreme events are coming and the council should be doing everything it possibly can within its available budget to help the community prepare, adapt and have some resilience for these future fire events that we are going to see,\" he told The Courier ahead of the event.</p><p>He said it would require \"some really serious planning\" to get the community as ready as they needed to be for future fire seasons.</p><p>\"What would we do if the worst case scenario occurred?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Are the hospitals prepared? Can they run their generators for long enough?\"</p><p>He also said the issue needed to be considered as part of a wider planning strategy.</p><p>\"If you look at the fringe of Ballarat, there is quite a number of urban areas that are abutting pine plantations or natural woodlands,\" Mr Whitehead said.</p><p>\"Potentially we might need to step back some of these boundaries, otherwise we might find ourselves in a situation like Canberra where they had pine plantations up to their suburbs when they suffered their horrendous fires in 2003.</p><p>\"We wait for the next huge event to occur and then we put some things in place. We don't actually plan for what could be much bigger.</p><p>\"We need to look at the predictions of what climate change will bring us and prepare for those events. It's much more than what we're prepared for now.\"</p><p>Country Fire Authority community safety manager Michael Boatman also spoke at the event. He explained how the hotter climate is making bushfires more frequent and dangerous.</p><p>\"Across Australia, but particularly in south-east Australia and Victoria the most, there is significant change in weather, particularly in spring,\" he said.</p><p>He said the season had been drier and hotter - by about 1.4 degrees - in the past 40 years.</p><p>\"The change means we are getting fire seasons that start earlier - we need to be ready in November rather than December,\" he said.</p><p>The second message Mr Boatman was keen to convey was about planning. He said people on the urban fringes - such as Mount Helen, Mount Clear, Buninyong and Invermay - should prepare a plan for themselves and their properties.</p><p>He also said new development areas west could be at risk even if they are not surrounded by bush, with running grass fires a potential issue.</p><p>\"As we saw at Melton in 1985, you can lose 20 or 30 houses at the edge of a development if you don't know what you are going to do.\"</p><p>THE SCIENCE The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, an independent federal government agency, combined with the Bureau of Meteorology, pooled their resources with a website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au\">www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au</url>) projecting the likely effects of climate change in Australia.</p><p>For the purposes of their modelling, Australia is divided into eight \"Natural Resource Management\" clusters. Ballarat lies within the Southern Slopes Victoria West sub-cluster.</p><p>According to the climate modelling data, says temperatures are almost certain to carry on rising: \"More hot days and warm spells are projected with very high confidence. Fewer frosts are projected with high confidence.\"</p><p>\"Generally less rainfall in the cool season (winter and spring) is projected with high confidence.</p><p>\"Changes to summer and autumn rainfall are possible but less clear. Increased intensity of extreme rainfall events is projected, with high confidence.\"</p><p>The data also suggests a \"high confidence\" that climate change will result in a harsher fire-weather climate in the future.</p><p>There was less certainty about its extent: \"There is low confidence in the magnitude of the change to fire weather. This depends on the rainfall projection and its seasonal variation.\"</p><p>More on the fires, page 10</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc77x1tca9zsx1ku615meh</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG8-1KT1-JD34-V351-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climatic disasters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DQI9</classCode><className>BIPARTISANSHIP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N624190EM</classCode><className>COMMUNITY ACTION SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Their share of global greenhouse gases is less than 0.2 per cent, or about a eighth of Australia's.</p><p>Still, on a per capita basis, both nations have among the world's highest emissions, Mr Shaw said.</p><p>Tally the 90-odd nations contributing less than 1 per cent of emissions and you reach almost a third of the global total - larger than China or the US, he said.</p><p>\"An issue like this is something the whole world has to grapple with,\" Todd Muller, Mr Shaw's counterpart from the National Party, said.</p><p>To remove the politics from the negotiations, all sides agreed to take advice on New Zealand's targets from an independent climate commission.</p><p>\"If you have essentially your best and your brightest informed by science ... it's an easier place to have a conversation with your community than just playing partisan politics with them,\" Mr Muller said.</p><p>Mr Shaw said the opposition could have exploited a potentially divisive policy - agriculture contributes half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions - but did not. \"They are playing an absolute straight bat,\" he said.</p><p>New Zealanders, like Australians, have endured increasing extreme weather. These include a record hot 2016, droughts and a major forest fire last year.</p><p>\"We've definitely had a lot more extreme rainfall events,\" Nava Fedaeff, a climate scientist with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, said.</p><p>Farmers, who have in the past objected fiercely to taxes on methane, appear more ready to accept the need to act. DairyNZ, for instance, has welcomed the prospect of emissions targets enshrined in legislation to give the sector \"much needed certainty\".</p><p>Trish Rankin, a dairy farmer managing 440 cows for a Maori-owned co-operative in the Taranaki region of the North Island, said climate action \"needs to be apolitical\".</p><p>Ms Rankin said New Zealand farmers realised their social licence depended on their being good custodians of the land.</p><p>Mr Shaw said one reason for the different response was that farmers - unlike Australian coal companies - had options.</p><p>\"People are still going to want to eat in 30 years' time, so the question is what do you produce and how do you produce it - not whether or not you're going to produce food,\" he said.</p><p>\"But in 30 years' time, you can pretty much guarantee no one in the world is going to use coal.\"</p><p>tagCaptionCQ1Picture1 ID 8671290</p><p>Agriculture accounts for half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions - and will be the central to that country's climate action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc72azd2hv7k214df9pcgx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGD-6FP1-JD34-V2RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

nitf:lede=\"true\">MORE than 100 volunteer firefighters from the Geelong, Bellarine Peninsula and Surf Coast areas are winding down after fighting the Scotsburn fire, south of Ballarat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The volunteers joined -career firefighters on the frontline and containment line areas during 12-hour shifts across the weekend.</p><p>The CFA said almost every available volunteer unit -between Ballarat and the Bellarine Peninsula was dispatched as the flames burnt through 4600ha and 12 homes.</p><p>The CFA labelled the Scotsburn fire \"under control\" late Sunday, while crews in Lorne were still working last night to control a bushfire there.</p><p>A DEPI spokesman said firefighters would still be near Lorne today, to \"fully track\" the edges of the fire and control occasional flare ups. \"It's not freely burning, not a raging forest fire,\" he said last night. \"It's not really causing any great concert but the main thing is it's in inaccessible terrain.\" District 7 CFA duty officer Ian Bewick said strike teams on the weekend had been dispatched to the Meredith football ground.</p><p>\"It was good work done by our guys,\" he said. \"It was lucky it was on a weekend and we had a good number who could go and had strike teams -already in place due to pre-planning, so they were able to respond fairly quickly.\" Stonehaven volunteer Jeff Harriott said his team was fighting a fire at Fyansford on Saturday shortly before it was told to head west.</p><p>\"When we finished containing that and mopping up we saw smoke in the Elaine direction,\" he said. \"It wasn't long after that the call came through and you could tell from a distance it was big.\" Belmont CFA volunteer Nick Wojcik said he fought with a strike team from the southern side of the fire.</p><p>\"It was great to see so many go away from their families and jump on a fire truck to go out and help,\" he said. \"Nearly every brigade in district 7 was there.\"Emergency Services Minister Jane Garrett said the Scotsburn fire was the fastest locals had ever seen. \"There's been about $30,000 already paid to people who've been -directly affected by this fire,\" she said. \"I've also activated the ---re-establishment grants, which are up to $32,000 per household if a house has been -destroyed.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

So we've still got the forest fire risk but we've also now got significant grass fire risk due to the record rainfall over the last couple of years.</p><p>\"It's an expansive area that now has so much grass growing on it... some areas are carrying a lot of fuel.\"</p><p>The seasonal outlook paints a bleak picture with much of southern Australia ? particularly NSW, Western Australia and South Australia facing an above-normal fire season.</p><p>While Victoria is expected to experience normal activity, southern Queensland is also facing an above-average fire season.</p><p>Mr Rogers said there was potential for disastrous consequences in western parts of NSW this summer, with many people having not experienced the last major western grass fires of the 1970s and '80s.</p><p>\"People underestimate just how devastating grass fires can be. They travel at a frightening rate, can jump ahead of themselves at incredible speed and they can be very, very dangerous,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Rogers said the RFS was conducting hazard reduction burns and working with councils to install strategic fire breaks and ensure key roads were up to a high standard.</p><p>A fortnight ago the RFS took the unprecedented step of taking senior volunteers from brigades east of the ranges on a tour through the western grasslands.</p><p>Mr Rogers said these volunteers would be the basis of any strike teams, should they need to be assembled during the fire season.</p><p>\"They will be the key people if we need to send groups out west... to make sure they're there to provide a kind of induction for crews coming from the coast, because they have been out there in calm times, seen what some of the issues are and heard from some of the locals about particular fire hazards they have in their particular area,\" he said.</p><p>\"What we've got to do is make sure we use those people that have that knowledge and combine them with locals, just to make sure that crews that get sent in from outside do the best they can as far as helping what the locals need, but also keeping themselves safe.\"</p><p>Mr Rogers said given Victoria was not facing an above-average season, the RFS would not be \"too proud\" to ask for assistance from the Country Fire Authority.</p><p>Bushfire CRC chief executive officer Gary Morgan said the purpose of the seasonal outlook ? which assesses the fire potential based on previous rainfall and fires and climate outlook ? was to provide fire managers with the best, up-to-date fire information.</p><p>\"We provide this so that each of the State and territories can actually know what the threat is likely to be for the bushfire season and then do their planning accordingly to manage their threat,\" Mr Morgan said.</p><p>\"It enables them to know not only whether they've got a potential problem or not in their jurisdiction, but whether their adjoining neighbours have got a potential problem.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THLAND-66e8tfm492w1pl974nq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THLAND2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56FM-VBW1-F0J6-J0NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385748</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Land</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>August 30, 2012 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS003</classCode><className>SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS004</classCode><className>WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

they bring massive biosecurity risks with them.\"</p><p>Ms Mill said tackling pigs involved the whole community, including crown land managers, Parks Victoria, councils, water authorities and farmers.</p><p>\"As we come into autumn, pigs that have spent time in the bush, where they can get cover and food, start to move,\" she said.</p><p>\"There's a point where the feed runs out, and they start to look for other places to find food.\"</p><p>She said pigs would also be seeking water sources, such as rivers, creeks and farm dams.</p><p>Tyrendarra beef and veal producer Phill Saunders said he had been having problems for about five years.</p><p>Mr Saunders estimated pigs could cause as much as $1000 damage a hectare to pasture land.</p><p>\"You're looking at losing production for the winter and spring,\" he said.</p><p>\"The ground doesn't grow much pasture after they've been through it, so you have at least drag and resow it.</p><p>\"We tend to have smaller paddocks.</p><p>\"When they come in, they can very quickly damage between eight and 10 hectares, in a pretty short time.\"</p><p>He was concerned that ships, coming into Portland, could bring foot and mouth disease.</p><p>Mr Saunders said he would like to see the Department of Agriculture take a lead role in controlling feral pigs, as chief veterinary officer Dr Charles Milne had extensive experience in dealing with foot and mouth disease.</p><p>\"My rationale is pigs are the number one vector for foot and mouth, so we need one agency to take the lead role,\" he said.</p><p>Ron Millard, who runs sheep on a small block at Tyrendarra, said his property was close to a state forest.</p><p>He said he hadn't experienced stock losses, as the pigs appeared to have gone by lambing time.</p><p>But the pigs did extensive damage to paddocks.</p><p>\"They didn't have far to go out of the bush and they did an awful lot of damage,\" he said.</p><p>\"They rooted it all up, like you'd got in with a plough.\"</p><p>But he said it appeared last winter the population, living in the state forest, had been cleaned out by hunters.</p><p>\"I had the authorities there,\" he said.</p><p>\"They were out setting traps and cameras, but never had much success, probably because there were that many people with dogs coming out hunting the pigs.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STKLND-doc74v3grfs2coed8bsefr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STKLND2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVM-HCH1-F0J6-J1CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419420</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Stock and Land</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Cattle breeding</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Epidemics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Animals</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera says six people have died in the forest fire affecting the municipality of Carrahue, 700 kilometres south of Santiago, and he claimed that the outbreak of the fire itself was a terrorist act. \"We have reliable information that causes us to presume that an international criminal has been behind these fires,\" said the president during an appearance before reporters at La Moneda Palace. \"We must fight not only the fires but also the criminals who presumably are behind (them,)\" Pinera said. After confirming that six firefighters were injured as they tried to extinguish the flames in Carahua, the president emphatically stated that \"terrorist behaviour hides behind these deliberately caused fires\". Pinera's accusations come after remarks made on Tuesday by Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter, who said that \"political or economic aims\" could be behind some of the fires raging in the southern part of the country. In the past, attacks have been registered in the Araucania region against the facilities of forestry firms which the government attributed to Mapuche Indian activists. However, on this occasion the authorities have not said who might be behind the allegedly intentionally-set fires.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-630sibc90081gxc0a95i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54N9-J6G1-JD67-100G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Ballarat Courier</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>January 7, 2012 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002018</classCode><className>TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D0T5</classCode><className>TERRORIST ATTACKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>PE000DMJL</classCode><className>SEBASTIAN PINERA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX069</classCode><className>SANTIAGO, CHILE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC340</classCode><className>CHILE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This week this may include closure of part of the East Gippsland Rail Trail and traffic management applied to the Princes Highway.' </p><p>For your health and safety, find out when planned burns are happening near you. Go to vic.gov.au/plannedburn, download the FireReady app or call the Victorian Bushfire Information Line on 1800 240 667. The Planned Burns Notification System (PBNS) is an opt-in system and can send an SMS or email message prior to a burn being carried out and when it is in progress, in a region you subscribe to. To register go to vic.gov.au/plannedburn </p><p>The Chief Fire officer is currently the final approver of all planned burns. This measure is in place as DELWP changes its approach to risk management in response to the recommendations of the Lancefield-Cobaw Fire Investigation. </p><p>For more information go to: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://delwp.vic.gov.au/fire-and-emergencies\">http://delwp.vic.gov.au/fire-and-emergencies</url></emphasis></p><p>For more information on the Victorian Government's new approach to bushfire risk management go to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/safer-together\">http://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/safer-together</url></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BOMTIM-3865287</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BOMTIM2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JKX-3151-F0N8-R35P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386747</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The zone's residual risk, which is mainly a measure of fuel loads, has climbed from 39 per cent in the aftermath of Black Saturday's fire storms to about 76 per cent today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just before Black Saturday the residual risk was measured at 81 per cent. Forest Fire Management Victoria's chief officer Chris Hardman said \"a high-risk level meant communities needed to maintain awareness and readiness to enact their bushfire plan.</p><p>\"A heightened seasonal outlook and high risk has also triggered FFMVic to bring forward preparedness activity to enable increased bushfire response and suppression.</p><p>\"FFMVic has recruited over 650 seasonal project firefighters and brought forward servicing and investment in firefighting fleet and aviation resources. FFMVic also has aid arrangements in place to request interstate and international support if needed.\" More than 1800 homes and 159 people died in the King Lake-Marysville fire storms that swept across the state's East Central zone, leading to a Royal Commission recommendation: \"the state fund and commit to implementing a long-term program of prescribed burning based on an annual rolling target of 5 per cent minimum of public land\".</p><p>\" Continued, Page 4 \" Rule's View, Page 17 \" From Page 1 That recommendation was never adopted, with a 2015 Victorian Inspector-General for Emergency Management review instead recommending a risk-based approach to mitigate major bushfire risks around key population centres.</p><p>The Royal Commission also recommended the then Department of Sustainability and Environment: \"specify the characteristics of fire management zones - including burn size, percentage area burnt within the prescribed burn, and residual fuel loading\", plus \"report annually on prescribed burning outcomes in a manner that meets public accountability objectives \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 targets, area burnt (and) funds expended\".</p><p>While the current measures of residual risk are based on fuel loads, it also models risks to homes and other assets.</p><p>When The Weekly Times asked for specific fuel load data, the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning's spokeswoman stated: \"I've been advised that the fuel load data is only published to Business Level Data (an internal system), which means it is only available to internal DELWP users\".</p><p>Dry conditions have made fuel reduction burns more challenging, with FFMVic struggling to meet its BURN targets.</p><p>\"Challenges include the reduced opportunity to safely undertake fuel management given extended dry conditions, and the complexities of implementing planned burns in areas with significant population living in close proximity to forests and grasslands,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>\"FFMVic prioritises its fuel management program to target high risk-reduction burns. Sixty per cent of these burns were delivered in autumn 2018, utilising all available windows of opportunity.</p><p>\"Examples of some of these high risk-reduction burns include those targeting townships such as Cockatoo, Warburton, Emerald, Derrimut and Toolebewong.\" He said FFMVic also undertook mechanical fuel treatments such as slashing and mulching and these remained a priority in spring.</p><p>Meanwhile, two consecutive years of record low rainfall have left a large chunk of the East Central zone and East Gippsland in a tinder dry state, further reducing DELWP's opportunity to conduct fuel reduction burns.</p><p>\"Extended dry conditions and high fire danger into April has reduced windows for planned burning in Gippsland,\" the DELWP spokeswoman said.</p><p>However, DELWP was able to conduct high-priority burns in autumn at Bemm River, Bruthen, Buchan, Omeo and Orbost.</p><p>East Gippsland Forest and Fire Planning regional manager Peter West said unusually early bushfire activity occurred in East Gippsland during July and August, highlighting the severe level of dryness in forests.</p><p>\"These dry conditions are likely to be exacerbated during spring and summer, with the climate outlook for drier and warmer conditions. These areas can expect above normal fire potential from August right through summer.\" While East Gippsland's forests are dry the residual risk for the region is just 47 per cent, following a series of large fires across the region in recent years.</p><p>HAVE YOUR SAY Do you hold fears for this fire season?theweeklytimes.com.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-016c0f1cb49b11e88a58a1eda094768f0c957d99ab13af16ce4c01b9736012a3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7M-0P61-F0JP-W1HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 12, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F91</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DB1O</classCode><className>RESIDUAL FUEL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F91</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It confirms the strength of the relationship between climate drivers such as El Ni\u00f1o, climate change, and the Australian bushfire season. It also demonstrates that a few milder bushfire seasons do not mean climate change isn't happening.</p><h>Hot, dry, windy conditions spell fire trouble</h><p>The prerequisites for a severe bushfire season are high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds that coincide with long periods of low rainfall.</p><p>These weather ingredients are used to calculate an area's fire danger rating, using the Forest Fire Danger Index. The index produces a score reflecting the severity of fire weather on a given day, where zero represents minimal fire danger, 50 represents conditions where a fire ban may be issued, and 100 is considered potentially catastrophic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Climate change is bringing a new world of bushfires</emphasis></p><p>Loss of <url normalizedValue=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2013.09.013\">human lives</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=WF08175\">property</url> most often occurs on days when the index is high in a particular area. But strong seasonal fire weather doesn't always translate to high-impact fires. Other factors in play include terrain, vegetation, ignition and the weather on the day. </p><p>In our research, we analysed the strength of the worst fire weather conditions to understand the relative severity of fire weather during different seasons and years, in relation to various climate drivers. </p><h>Why is fire weather so different every year?</h><p>In Australia, the year-to-year changes in climatic conditions are largely driven by three factors: the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=enso\">El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation</url>, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=iod\">Indian Ocean Dipole</url>, and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=sam\">Southern Annular Mode</url>. </p><p>Each of these climate drivers involves either changes to sea surface temperatures, wind movements, or both. They can all can affect temperature and rainfall patterns across the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia. </p><p>Our research confirmed that across the continent over more than four decades, climate drivers have affected the variability of Australia's fire weather.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The phoenix factor: what home gardeners can learn from nature's rebirth after fire</emphasis></p><p>Of these drivers, the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation is the most influential. Weather during an El Ni\u00f1o phase is typically hot and dry, leading to worse seasonal bushfire conditions. </p><p>The positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole often coincides with El Ni\u00f1o and exacerbates its effects. This phase generally results in lower than average rainfall across southern Australia. </p><p>But when these two climate modes are in a negative phase, our research confirms that Australia often experiences more rain and milder bushfire conditions. </p><p>The modes evolve over many months and their effects on fire weather persist for several seasons. Their state during winter and spring is a strong indicator for the rest of the fire season for much of Australia. </p><p>The Southern Annular Mode refers to the north-south movement of strong westerly winds in parts of the Southern Hemisphere. When the mode is in a prolonged negative phase, fire weather conditions in Australia are worse - particularly in NSW. This effect is pronounced in winter and spring and means less rainfall and strong westerly winds.</p><p>The 2019 winter saw a persistent negative Southern Annular Mode, as did the 2013 and 2018 winter and spring seasons. There was a strong El Ni\u00f1o event and positive Indian Ocean Dipole in 2015. Australia's bushfire season started earlier than usual in each of these years.</p><p>The converse is also true. In 2011 a strong La Ni\u00f1a (the opposite of an El Ni\u00f1o) resulted in milder bushfire seasons, as did the negative Indian Ocean Dipole of 2016.</p><h>Climate change is a culprit too</h><p>Long-term climate change in Australia is an undeniable reality. The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">State of the Climate 2018</url> report for Australia notes strong land surface temperature increases and a 10-20% decline in cool season rainfall across southern Australia since the 1970s. These changes are closely associated with increasing human greenhouse gas emissions, as well as natural variability.</p><p>The changed conditions has led to an average increase in the severity of seasonal bushfire weather across Australia - especially in southern parts of the continent. The increased severity affects all seasons but in particular spring, which means that, on average, the bushfire season is starting earlier.</p><h>Pulling it all together</h><p>Our research has made clear that climate modes bring large and rapid swings to the fire weather, while human-induced climate change gradually increases background fire weather conditions.

Victorians need no reminding of the tragic devastation of the February 2009 Black Saturday bushfires and the 173 lives lost.</p><p>The CFA has called on people to prepare for an extreme summer of fires and, for the first time, fire restrictions were introduced in Gippsland as early as September.</p><p>As well as East Gippsland, which has endured two years of record low autumn and winter rainfall, and a large swath of northeastern Victoria, the Otways and Murray regions are also considered to be at high risk. The severe or extreme fire season has not only started early, with continued dry conditions predicted, it will also finish late, out to April.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria and the CFA have already brought forward preparedness activities, including fire prevention works.</p><p>Yet Victorians are being urged to revisit their own preparations in high-fire risk areas. A recent CFA survey revealed an alarming 52 per cent of Victorians living in areas at high risk of bushfire classified the risk to their home as \"moderate, minor or non-existent\".</p><p>The CFA is expecting temperatures to be higher than average in Victoria over December as part of the El Nino system of warm ocean water in the Pacific makes its way slowly across the state.</p><p>While it is hoped the perfect storm conditions of 2009, with multiple consecutive days of extreme heat and high and changing winds, are not repeated this season, the signs of increased danger are ominous.</p><p>Fire conditions have been assessed at the same status of in the 2002-03 fire season, with similar dryness and emergence of the El Nino pattern.</p><p>That year, Victoria's Alpine Region was hit with a highly challenging, 1.3 million hectare bushfire on multiple fronts.</p><p>Given the organisational, tactical and preventive changes adopted after Black Saturday, Victoria is better equipped to deal with major fire threat. But everyone has a part to play in adhering to restrictions, preparing for risk and responding to the dangers.</p><p>Foreign property rort IT will come as little surprise, but with great frustration, to Victorians that foreign buyers are illegally snapping up Melbourne properties.</p><p>The scale of rorting in the system is what has not, until now, been appreciated. As revealed in today's Herald Sun, Melbourne is home to 18 of the top 20 postcodes in Australia for foreign investors illegally buying real estate.</p><p>The new research reveals extended family members of foreign buyers are being used as fronts to buy properties in contravention of foreign investment laws.</p><p>With so many younger Australians locked out of the property market because of rampant growth in prices over the past decade, the data makes for angry reading.</p><p>What is just as infuriating is the admission by authorities they are under-prosecuting cases, claiming the chances of achieving a criminal conviction is low.</p><p>There were 877 breaches of the country's foreign ownership laws identified in Victoria in less than three years, but the Australian Tax Office has failed to see through a single prosecution despite tough new laws which were introduced in 2015.</p><p>Webs of family and commercial connections have seen foreign buyers run rings around authorities, with complex and undeclared purchasing arrangements.</p><p>More than half of all breaches of foreign investment laws have occurred in this state, evidence provided to a parliamentary committee reveals.It is not good enough that young Australians, or those doing it tough, cannot access affordable homes while foreign buyers break the law.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-b5704c48f85811e893a63b50d9c81b4d7741181d1c2eb7230d8b606a0b6ced89</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXK-7CP1-JD3N-50XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

The simple but engaging coming-of-age story of a lonely girl, Opal (Robb), who finds friendship with a scruffy dog. The story follows Opal through a summer of change, making friends (including a drifter, played by musician <person><nameText>Dave Matthews</nameText></person>) and revealing long-lost secrets.

So implausible it would make even a high-school science student chortle, this is a colour-by-numbers action flick that needs the Hubble telescope to locate the scarce traces of entertainment.</p><p>SPORT: Rugby Union, 4.30pm, Fox Sports 1 Air New Zealand Cup.

This week they examine the evergreen scuba diver in the forest fire tale (featured elsewhere in the opening sequence of Magnolia and in an episode of CSI), to see whether a fire-fighting takner aircraft can in fact scoop up a scuba diver and deposit him in the middle of a forest fire.</p><p>SATURDAY RADIO</p><p>The Weekender, ABC 702, Saturday, 8-10pm The footy is over, cricket reigns supreme and ABC local radio eases into summer on Saturday nights. This year, Warren Brown, cartoonist, ukulele virtuoso and automotive adventurer (Peking to Paris), throws open the doors to his virtual holiday shack up the coast and chats with anyone who drops by for a yak in the shack. The show kicks off tonight with a traditional housewarming party, replete with cheese cubes, cabanossi, Jatz and cask plonk, all served on the inevitable Formica table.

Here, young Sebastian (played as in the previous film by Felix Bossuet) roams freely in company with Belle, the film's real star.</p><p>Sebastian, like Belle, is a foundling, taken in by the crusty but golden-hearted farmer Cesar (Tcheky Karyo). With France liberated at last, all three await the return of Cesar's daughter Angelina (Margaux Chatelier), a fighter in the Resistance. But the idyll is shattered by news she has died in a plane crash on the way home. Refusing to accept this, Sebastian stows away on a rescue mission undertaken by the pilot Pierre (Thierry Neuvic), naturally bringing Belle along for the ride.</p><p>The formula works, so why change it? Nicolas Vanier, who directed the 2014 Belle and Sebastian, has been replaced this time by the Canadian journeyman Christian Duguay, who's probably best-known for the 1995 sci-fi B-movie Screamers.</p><p>But even the most sensitive viewer would be hard put to detect a directorial signature.</p><p>In its way, the film is a perfect object, delivering exactly the kind of reassuring family entertainment the publicity would lead you to anticipate. For dramatic purposes the plot introduces various threats, implicitly acknowledging the horrors of the off-screen war and building to a genuinely suspenseful climax with the characters trapped by a forest fire. A degree of ambiguity surrounds Pierre, who may or may not be Sebastian's father, while further adult realities are hinted at with the introduction of the teenage Gabriele (former child model Thylane Blondeau), who's forced to disguise herself as a boy for self-protection.</p><p>But none of this seriously threatens either the innocence of the protagonists or the more conscious simplicity of the film itself.</p><p>If you're fond of dogs, children, Alpine scenery, or the French, the fantasy retains a good deal of charm - enough, perhaps, to make up for the lack of anything resembling an original idea.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: BFFs: Sebastian (Felix Bossuet) and his dog Belle are back.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-6qde87sl5pk1lu1rjn8f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K44-KSB1-JD34-V1TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 30, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5QC</classCode><className>MOVIE RATINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A2EX</classCode><className>ORPHANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp;

By 2013 that had risen to 4595. The numbers were corrected downwards to account for certain fire events, such as planned burns by fire authorities.</p><p>\"In particular, a major increase in bushfire frequencies has been recorded from this data analysis since 2011 ... indicates a major climatic shift,\" the study says.</p><p>The bushfire frequency numbers were determined as the researchers were endeavouring to create a model to project a week ahead where bushfires could most likely occur, and at what potential intensity.</p><p>Using a computer model, bushfire \"hot spots\" were determined by crunching weekly weather data.</p><p>The group tested its model by looking at past conditions, then comparing where hot spots were being registered with the historical bushfire data from NASA. The model was finding hot spots where bushfires had occurred with 91 per cent accuracy.</p><p>Ritaban Dutta, a senior research scientist with CSIRO's Data61 group and an author of the study, said if the system were implemented it could help guide where best to dedicate resources in conjunction with firefighters' local knowledge and other information.</p><p>Dr Dutta said because he was not a climate scientist - rather a computer scientist and data analyst - he should not comment directly on whether global warming was behind the rise in bushfires the group had estimated.</p><p>But other scientific work has suggested the warming climate in Australia - temperatures have risen about one degree on average since 1910 - has increased the length of the bushfire season in well-populated parts of the country.</p><p>A fact sheet released by the advocacy group, the Climate Institute, this week pointed to evidence the total yearly Forest Fire Danger Index had significantly increased at 42 per cent of sites monitored around the country since the 1970s.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-6odh8dlj844heyk5hno</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J28-SFV1-JD34-V10J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 11, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents and Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather/Greenhouse Effect</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp;

Specifically, some 54 forest fire incidents have destroyed some 2,378 hectares with losses estimated to reach P3.58 million. Likewise, a total of 350,631 tree seedlings and 297,409 saplings in plantations and grass lands were either damaged or burned.</p><p>During the same period last year, the DENR said some 29 forest fires were recorded in the CAR destroying some 324 hectares with damages estimated at P0.48 million. This year's increase in forest fires incidents were mostly in places planted to Benguet Pine trees with 1,758 hectares, followed by grass lands with 425 hectares, and tree plantations with 195 hectares. The CAR's forest land is considered as one of the most forest fire-prone in the country owing to its endemic tree species, the Benguet Pine.</p><p> The DENR said this tree species is a \"highly fire-susceptible tree known to burn from roots to crown due to its flammable resin.\" Its resin is used as basic ingredient in the production of turpentine or commonly referred to as \"paint thinner\". The Benguet Pine tree is a soft wood commonly used for house construction, mine timber and telephone posts.</p><p> DENR-CAR Forestry Officer Emilio Damugo said that most of the incidents which occurred in forested areas were aggravated by the ENSO and were ignited by \"wayward\" fires that came from clearing activities of kaingin farmers in denuded areas.</p><p> Damugo explained that those in grass lands and plantation sites were caused by human carelessness ranging from throwing of lit cigarette butts, playing children, bunting and honey collection.</p><p> He said that the DENR was coordinating with the regional disaster and coordinating council (RDCC) and the Philippine Air Force (PAF) to immediately respond to any further outbreak of forest fire and that cloud seeding operations could be conducted once the weather is favorable.</p><p> Pine forests were endemic to the higher altitudes of Luzon and represents about 4.1 percent or 231,500 hectares of the country's remaining 800,000 hectares of virgin forests.</p><p> Most of the country's forests are classified as Dipterocarp forest with 66.2 percent or about 3.7 million hectares, followed by mossy or mid-mountain forests with 18.82 percent or 1.07 million hectares, sub-marginal or watershed forests with 8.71 percent or 496,500 hectares, and mangrove forests with 2.1 percent or 120,000 hectares.</p><p> (PNA)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SMR-1C30-0048-T399-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"451\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 AAP Information Services Pty.

The latter he blamed largely on current conservation laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/greens-policies-blamed-for-increased-fire-risks/news-story/bdf3d8ac083d06ba468f7135881f45b8\">Sky News</url>, he said: \"One [issue] is a lack of controlled burns - fire reduction burns ... that policy needs to be changed so we can get those controlled burns.\"</p><p>Similarly, Queenslander and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6103717836001\">accused</url> the Greens and Labor Party of restricting fire-reduction burns.</p><p>\"They've actually shut down the national parks, where you can't actually even clear the fuel on the floor,\" she claimed.</p><p>\"...They won't allow farmers to actually clean up their own properties.\"</p><p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.2gb.com/we-dont-do-enough-deputy-premier-admits-governments-failed-bushfire-prevention/\">pointed the finger at the Greens</url> and said: \"We've got to do better and I know that we don't do enough hazard reduction ... because of the ideological position [of] the Greens.\"</p><p>That same day, he widened <url normalizedValue=\"http://parliament/\">his attack</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardFull.aspx#/DateDisplay/HANSARD-1323879322-108740/HANSARD-1323879322-108752\">in Parliament</url>: \"The truth of the matter is we still live with [former Labor premier] Bob Carr's legacy: lock up the forest and let it burn.

the drier the fuel, the more fiercely it burns and the more intense the fire.</p><p>The moisture of a particular fuel load depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also the humidity and temperature of its surroundings.</p><p>Eucalyptus forests and grasslands are typically drier fuels that burn hot and fast, while rain forests and irrigated crops burn slower and can potentially slow the pace of a fire.</p><p>What methods are used to reduce fire hazards?</p><p>In a bid to reduce the intensity of unplanned fires, authorities carry out measures to \"treat\" the fuel and reduce the amount that is available to feed a fire.</p><p>\"They are treating fuel to change its structure and to typically reduce the amount of fuel or fuel load,\" Ross Bradstock, as senior professor at Wollongong University's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, told Fact Check.</p><p>This fuel treating process is called hazard reduction.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2898&amp;context=smhpapers\">Hazard reduction methods</url> include the intentional burning of surface fuel loads, but other practical and \"mechanical\" methods are also deployed.</p><p>The latter include activities such as \"thinning\" bushland (by cutting down trees), clearing, slashing or mulching ground litter, ploughing fields, cleaning guttering on houses and other buildings, and through fire-resistant garden design and maintenance.</p><p>Hazard reduction burns</p><p>Bushfire management is divided into two categories: firefighting and fire prevention.</p><p>Planned and purposeful burning of excess ground litter and fuel hazards in a specific area is known by many names - a \"hazard reduction burn\", \"controlled burn\" or \"prescribed burning\" to name a few.</p><p>These types of burns are widely used in fire prevention and are carried out in winter or generally outside the fire season when conditions are less volatile.</p><p>They require careful consideration and planning to achieve maximum results and to minimise potential dangers to health and wildlife, and to avoid causing accidental bushfires.</p><p>Prescribed burns should not be confused with \"back burning\", a fire-fighting tool.</p><p>As explained by bushfire expert and University of Tasmania professor David Bowman in <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605\">The Conversation</url>, back burning is \"a last-resort measure\" to stop a progressing bushfire from spreading to specific areas.</p><p>\"The difference between fuel-reduction burning and back burning is effectively the same as the difference between elective and emergency surgery,\" Bowman wrote.</p><p>\"Back burning ... works by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/back-burning-fighting-fire-with-fire/5040272\">setting fires from containment lines</url>, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand.\"</p><p>Who is responsible?</p><p>Bushfire management activities in Australia are conducted by state and territory governments and their relevant statutory authorities such as fire emergency services, including professional and volunteer firefighters, as well as by municipal councils and individual property owners.</p><p>At a federal level, bushfire management is regulated by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/about\">EPBC Act</url>).</p><p>A national policy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/publications/factsheet-bushfire-management-and-national-environment-law\">fact sheet</url> outlines the circumstances where fire prevention activities require federal environmental approval.</p><p>Activities that are not covered by the national law include those approved or authorised under federal or state/territory laws before July 2000 (when the legislation took effect), as well as continued lawful land uses of the sort that were occurring before July 2000 (such as maintaining access to existing tracks and fire breaks, roadside weed control, and routine controlled burns of the type that occurred in the past).</p><p>Activities that require ministerial approval, according to the act, are those affecting nationally threatened species and their habitats, as well as Commonwealth land.</p><p>These include, for example, the construction of substantial new fire breaks, access roads or tracks on a significant scale in habitat for national threatened species; one-off fuel burns in remnant forest that is important habitat for nationally threatened species and had not been subject previously to a burning regime; and, proposed new burning regimes in world heritage sites among others.</p><p>Queensland framework and operation</p><p>Fact Check contacted the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services for information about the legal framework, as well as the processes and procedures, governing prescribed burning in that state.</p><p>Numerous agencies and government departments are responsible for planning, overseeing and conducting hazard reduction on both state-managed and private land.</p><p>Queensland fire management groups, including volunteer fire brigades, also participate in the yearly operation <url normalizedValue=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2019/4/9/operation-cool-burn-blazes-across-the-state-in-preparation-for-bushfire-season\">Cool Burn</url> - a hazard reduction coordinating effort organised by QFES which generally operates from April 1 to August 31.</p><p>The goal of Cool Burn is to put in place a plan for hazard reduction and other mitigating activities across the landscape with a focus on protecting the community, and public and privately owned assets, as well as identifying areas at high risk of a fire, such as enclosed townships.</p><p>QFES Superintendent James Haig told Fact Check that authorisation under Queensland's Fire and Emergencies Act was necessary to conduct hazard reduction burns on private and state-managed lands. This would take the form of either a notification (in cases such as burning assignments for the sugarcane industry), or as a permit obtained from local fire wardens.</p><p>\"We have a large number of fire wardens, many of whom are volunteers, so they come from the community and they are aware of the local conditions,\" Mr Haig said.</p><p>According to QFES records, approximately 28,000 permits a year were issued for controlled fires since 2015.</p><p>\"In 2019, QFES and its partners completed 229 priority mitigation activities to reduce bushfire risk at high-risk sites,\" it said in a statement sent to Fact Check.</p><p>\"This includes 108 of 175 planned hazard reduction burns, 83 targeted education activities and 38 fire line upgrades.\"</p><p>However, such activities were \"highly dependent\" on weather conditions, it added, with not all planned 2019 burns able to be completed.</p><p>\"In some areas, it rapidly became too dry to burn safely,\" the QFES statement continued.</p><p>\"In other areas, it was too wet too early on and dried out rapidly, leaving a short window of opportunity to safely conduct mitigation activities.\"</p><p>Mr Haig elaborated: \"The most common reason for a permit not being granted would be because the local conditions were too dry; that it was difficult to conduct safely and with the appropriate outcome.\"</p><p>He added that if moisture levels in the soil were too low, then farmers (especially graziers) often would want to hold onto the grass they had, so there were fewer applications for fire permits.</p><p>Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages primarily native forests and state-owned land, is exempt from obtaining a \"permit to light fire\".</p><p>It has its own procedures and burn targets, and collaborates with the QFES on initiatives such as operation Cool Burn.</p><p>\"From 1 January [2019] to date, QPWS conducted 291 planned burns over 1,443,882 hectares - which is the largest area covered in the last six years,\" a statement provided to Fact Check said.</p><p>\"QPWS's annual target for Protection Zones burns is 90 per cent (14,884 hectares). In 2018-19, QPWS achieved 118 per cent of this target.\"</p><p>NSW framework and operation</p><p>In NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with the NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, Forestry Corporation and Sydney Catchment Authority to carry out hazard reduction burns and other hazard reduction activities such as mowing and building firebreaks.</p><p>According to the NSW Department of Environment, hazard reduction efforts in NSW have increased under the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/parks-reserves-and-protected-areas/fire/managing-fire/bushfire-management-program\">Enhanced Bushfire Management Program</url> (EBMP), which came into effect in 2011.</p><p>The statewide program began with a five-year commitment to treat 135,000 hectares of bushland (on average) each year. In 2017, the NSW Government extended the program to 2022.</p><p>The NSW<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/conservation-programs/hazard-reduction-program\">National Parks and Wildlife Service</url> operates under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/~/view/act/1997/65/\">Rural Fires Act 1997</url> and under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1974/80/\">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974</url>.</p><p>Over the last eight years, according to its website, the NPWS carried out hazard reduction burns in NSW parks and reserves covering more than 680,000 hectares - more than double that of the previous five-year period.</p><p>\"NPWS has undertaken 80 per cent of the total hazard reduction burning effort recorded in NSW, despite managing less than 9 per cent of the state,\" its website states.</p><p>Conducting planned burns</p><p>The University of Wollongong's Professor Bradstock, who also heads the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub, told Fact Check: \"In Australia, typically we do a lot of prescribed burning, perhaps more so than many other countries, but we are doing it with the intention of reducing the intensity of subsequent wildfires - unplanned fires - to a level where they are potentially controllable using suppression forces.\"</p><p>The threshold of safe and effective fire suppression is calculated by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, which Fact Check <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/fact-check-did-high-fire-danger-indices-come-earlier-this-year/11506082\">has looked at previously.</url></p><p>Using measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions, combined with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319164959_Using_alternative_soil_moisture_estimates_in_the_McArthur_Forest_Fire_Danger_Index#pf2\">formula</url> to account for the effect of drought, the meter creates the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI). The index ranges from one to 100, with one representing the minimum risk for a bushfire and 100 the maximum.</p><p>However, Professor Bradstock noted that the McArthur Meter and the FFDI were developed empirically through observations of small fires burning under mild conditions in the 1960s, and did not necessarily perform well in the extreme fire conditions prevailing in the current NSW bushfires.</p><p>\"[W]e know that the McArthur FFD models underpredict the rate of spread and intensity under high forest fire danger index conditions; in other words, they don't fully capture all the things that are going on when it's really hot, really windy and the humidity is very low,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Fire behaviour under extreme and catastrophic conditions</p><p>Experts emphasised that in extreme and catastrophic fire conditions, the surface fuel available for burning makes next to no difference to the level of a fire's intensity.</p><p>University of Melbourne associate professor Trent Penman, who studies bushfire behaviour,told Fact Check: \"Prescribed burning effectiveness decreases with [increasing] FFDI; when you exceed an FFDI of about 50, you switch from fuel-dominated to a weather-dominated fire.</p><p>\"At this point, while fuel has a small effect, it is overwhelmed by the weather.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock agreed, pointing to the example of Victoria's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/black-saturday-bushfires\">Black Saturday</url> bushfires in 2009 that claimed the lives of 173 people.</p><p>His team <url normalizedValue=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/smhpapers/138/\">studied</url> the aftermath of the fires which were associated with an FFDI of well above 100.</p><p>They found that even in the areas where fuel had been treated with planned burns less than five years prior, there was no measurable effect on the intensity of the fires.</p><p>\"At a level where we would have expected the fire intensity to be reduced to suppressible levels, we essentially found no effect,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"It's almost like a turbo-charging effect, when you have such incredibly high temperatures and very high winds that you only need a negligible amount of fuel to produce a fire intensity that is not suppressible.\"</p><p>The University of Tasmania's Professor Bowman said that in catastrophic conditions, such as those prevailing in the current Queensland and NSW bushfires, all \"organic matter is going to burn\".</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour.\"</p><p>Professor Bowman described embers rushing ahead of the fire front, passing over cleared areas to find available fuel like a \"heat gun blasting sparks at incredibly high speed\".</p><p>\"It's a wind-driven phenomenon,\" he said.</p><p>\"[E]ven if you can treat everything at a maximum level, it's still not going to give you the benefit under catastrophic fire weather conditions.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock likened the effect of prescribed burns on fire intensity to a sliding scale.</p><p>\"The window of effectiveness essentially narrows down to a point where it essentially disappears,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Some vegetation types cannot be treated with prescribed burning</p><p>Experts also explained that some fuel types, particularly wet forest vegetation, were not treatable in the cooler months of the year, when prescribed burns can be safely carried out.</p><p>\"Some fuel types are simply not dry enough to burn in the time, when it is safe to do so,\" Professor Penman said. \"These include rainforests and wet forests.\"</p><p>He gave the example of a campfire: \"[I]f you put green leaves on it to get it started; they won't work. There's too much moisture there to get the fire started. You can put green leaves on, once the fire is going and they'll burn, but if the fuel is too wet, the fire won't start in the first place.\"</p><p>However, these vegetation types would still burn under catastrophic conditions.</p><p>As Professor Bradstock explained, parts of the Victorian and NSW landscapes, such as the wet forests or alpine areas, were not treatable under normal conditions.</p><p>\"It's a waste of time because they are usually too wet to burn.</p><p>\"Because things are so critically dry at the moment, what typically would never burn, well, now it is burning,\" he said.</p><p>And Professor Bowman agreed that different fuel types affected fire intensity differently, but in catastrophic conditions, \"the variability and fuel load becomes irrelevant\".</p><p>How effective are prescribed burns?</p><p>A plethora of scientific papers describe hazard reduction burns as the easiest and most effective tool of bushfire management - more effective than slashing, weeding, herbicide use and so forth.</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check this was because of its wide reach and comparatively low cost.</p><p>\"You can treat [through burning] relatively large areas with costs around $100 a hectare in terms of operational costs; so you might be able to burn out 2000 hectares in a day or two, relatively cheaply,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you were to go in there and try and mechanically treat that, you wouldn't be able to do it.\"</p><p>Burning has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815213002326\">found</url> to be even more effective in areas adjacent to houses or within a so-called Bushland Urban Interface Zone, also known as the wildland-urban interface, despite the higher cost, which can range from $1000 to $10,000 per hectare.</p><p>\"[E]ven then, it's still probably cheaper than mechanical work,\" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check.</p><p>A 2018 research <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF18192\">article</url> published by the CSIRO indicated that \"intensifying prescribed burning treatments in public land in the [wild-urban interface] achieves a greater reduction in damages compared with applying the majority of the treatments in rural areas.</p><p>\"However, prescribed burning in the WUI is significantly more expensive and, despite additional benefits gained from this strategy, in most cases it is not the most economically efficient strategy.\"</p><p>But research has also found that prescribed burning as a bushfire management tool is not a panacea.</p><p>A 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.12579\">research paper</url> exploring variations in the effectiveness of prescribed burns in south-eastern Australia found that the inconsistency was due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes.</p><p>\"Prescribed burning solutions that are effective in one particular region may not be effective elsewhere unless there is strong similarity in vegetation types, fire weather, fuel accumulation and ignition rates.</p><p>\"The most efficient use of prescribed fire is applying it to the immediate proximity of assets, where a resultant reduction in fire intensity can be of immediate benefit in terms of impacts on structures and ease of suppression.\"</p><p>As an example of the futility of some prescribed burns, Dr Penman pointed to the forest around Port Macquarie in northern NSW, which has been widely studied and found to have fuel vegetation that regenerates every three to five years.</p><p>\"Any burn you undertake in those areas has a longevity of about three to five years,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to be burning a huge amount before you are actually reducing the risk at all.\"</p><p>In other areas where fuels accumulated more slowly, planned burns had a greater impact, he added.</p><p>\"But it's never going to stop wildfires.\"</p><p>What does the future of bushfire management look like?</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check that scientists and agencies with more advanced and up-to-date modeling capabilities would need to better choose treatment areas with maximum cost effectiveness.</p><p>\"We are going to have to get smarter about it,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"We are going to learn a lot from the current fire season.</p><p>\"I know, anecdotally, there has been major property damage done in NSW in areas that have been recently treated.\"</p><p>Professor Penman told Fact Check that \"chasing the hectares\" in prescribed-burn targets was misguided.</p><p>Rather, states and statutory authorities were using a combination of hectares treated and risk approach in their bushfire management.</p><p>\"What you're really trying to achieve is [to] reduce the risk to assets that you have of value in the landscape, so that might be ecological assets like at-risk forest types. It may be around cultural sites, and it might be Indigenous or European sites and then other things like power lines, water supply catchments, and then, of course, around houses,\" he said.</p><p>\"[N]one of the agencies just invest entirely in prescribed burning or something else. They have a mixture of what they do.</p><p>\"It should never be a debate about, 'Does one thing do everything for us', because everybody knows that's not the case. It's about getting that balance right, across the different approaches.</p><p>\"So it's quite a challenging landscape to be working in, and you put that in the context of a changing climate and it becomes even harder.\"</p><p>Barnaby Joyce elaborates</p><p>When invited to expand on his media statements regarding prescribed burns and bushfire preparation, Nationals MP Mr Joyce <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/fires-joyce-response/11817930\">sent Fact Check a list of grievances</url> which focused on higher burn targets, a lack of dams and the imposition of bushfire permits, and pointed to a number of policies that in his view needed to be amended to allow better bushfire management.</p><p>These included the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and land clearing laws (including the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the Local Land Services Act 2013 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.</p><p>Mr Joyce nominated the former, saying \"the annual targets need to be dramatically increased\" to allow for more hazard reduction burns.</p><p>He also pointed to the fact that Australia's National Parks and areas within state forests did not permit grazing, which \"obviously affects fuel loads\".</p><p>And he suggested that fire permit requirements (for firebreak provisions and mandatory monitoring throughout a burn), as well as the penalties for non-compliance, were stopping some farmers from conducting these all-important activities.</p><p>However, the bushfire experts Fact Check spoke to dismissed Mr Joyce's claims, saying they failed to address key issues.</p><p>They countered that reasonable safeguards ensuring landholders and neighbours were kept safe during prescribed burns were an important component of current fire management practices.</p><p>\"There is a deliberate misinterpretation of the ecological thresholds and there is still the inherent assumption that a fuel reduction burn will reduce wildfires,\" said Melbourne University's Professor Penman.</p><p>Professor Bradstock said: \"Prescribed burning is constrained by budgets, resources and weather conditions. Pretty simple really: essentially, what we pay for is what we get.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Principal researcher: Christina Arampatzi</emphasis></p><p><url

The latter he blamed largely on current conservation laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/greens-policies-blamed-for-increased-fire-risks/news-story/bdf3d8ac083d06ba468f7135881f45b8\">Sky News</url>, he said: \"One [issue] is a lack of controlled burns - fire reduction burns ... that policy needs to be changed so we can get those controlled burns.\"</p><p>Similarly, Queenslander and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6103717836001\">accused</url> the Greens and Labor Party of restricting fire-reduction burns.</p><p>\"They've actually shut down the national parks, where you can't actually even clear the fuel on the floor,\" she claimed.</p><p>\"...They won't allow farmers to actually clean up their own properties.\"</p><p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.2gb.com/we-dont-do-enough-deputy-premier-admits-governments-failed-bushfire-prevention/\">pointed the finger at the Greens</url> and said: \"We've got to do better and I know that we don't do enough hazard reduction ... because of the ideological position [of] the Greens.\"</p><p>That same day, he widened <url normalizedValue=\"http://parliament/\">his attack</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardFull.aspx#/DateDisplay/HANSARD-1323879322-108740/HANSARD-1323879322-108752\">in Parliament</url>: \"The truth of the matter is we still live with [former Labor premier] Bob Carr's legacy: lock up the forest and let it burn. That is Bob Carr's legacy for this state. This is the truth.\"</p><p>Federal Resources Minister Matthew Canavan, as recently as last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/the-fires-have-not-started-due-to-climate-change/11791398\">referred to the \"bogey man of climate change\"</url> which he said was being used to distract from the failure of the states to manage fire risks.</p><p>\"The Queensland Government taking powers off farmers, taking their rights off them to be able to manage their own land, put in fire breaks, do cool burns, and that has exposed us to much much higher risk than we should,\" he said.</p><p>So, how effective are hazard reduction burns and how are they managed?</p><p>RMIT ABC Fact Check considers the facts.</p><p>What can affect the behaviour of fires?</p><p>Fire behaviour refers to a variety of factors including the manner in which a fire burns, the speed at which it spreads, the amount of heat it gives off and the extent of vegetation it consumes.</p><p>The way a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/fire-and-the-environment/48-fire-behaviour\">fire behaves and its severity</url> is dependent on several elements, but can be narrowed down to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/managing-natural-resources/fire-management/fire-science/fire-behaviour\">three</url> essentials: weather, fuel and topography.</p><p>The volume of fuel, or \"surface fuel\", in a fire's path - such as shrubbery, bark, dry leaves, twigs and so forth - is often the only component of fire behaviour that can be directly modified by people.</p><p>The rate at which organic materials burns is directly related to its moisture content; the drier the fuel, the more fiercely it burns and the more intense the fire.</p><p>The moisture of a particular fuel load depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also the humidity and temperature of its surroundings.</p><p>Eucalyptus forests and grasslands are typically drier fuels that burn hot and fast, while rain forests and irrigated crops burn slower and can potentially slow the pace of a fire.</p><p>What methods are used to reduce fire hazards?</p><p>In a bid to reduce the intensity of unplanned fires, authorities carry out measures to \"treat\" the fuel and reduce the amount that is available to feed a fire.</p><p>\"They are treating fuel to change its structure and to typically reduce the amount of fuel or fuel load,\" Ross Bradstock, as senior professor at Wollongong University's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, told Fact Check.</p><p>This fuel treating process is called hazard reduction.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2898&amp;context=smhpapers\">Hazard reduction methods</url> include the intentional burning of surface fuel loads, but other practical and \"mechanical\" methods are also deployed.</p><p>The latter include activities such as \"thinning\" bushland (by cutting down trees), clearing, slashing or mulching ground litter, ploughing fields, cleaning guttering on houses and other buildings, and through fire-resistant garden design and maintenance.</p><p>Hazard reduction burns</p><p>Bushfire management is divided into two categories: firefighting and fire prevention.</p><p>Planned and purposeful burning of excess ground litter and fuel hazards in a specific area is known by many names - a \"hazard reduction burn\", \"controlled burn\" or \"prescribed burning\" to name a few.</p><p>These types of burns are widely used in fire prevention and are carried out in winter or generally outside the fire season when conditions are less volatile.</p><p>They require careful consideration and planning to achieve maximum results and to minimise potential dangers to health and wildlife, and to avoid causing accidental bushfires.</p><p>Prescribed burns should not be confused with \"back burning\", a fire-fighting tool.</p><p>As explained by bushfire expert and University of Tasmania professor David Bowman in <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605\">The Conversation</url>, back burning is \"a last-resort measure\" to stop a progressing bushfire from spreading to specific areas.</p><p>\"The difference between fuel-reduction burning and back burning is effectively the same as the difference between elective and emergency surgery,\" Bowman wrote.</p><p>\"Back burning ... works by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/back-burning-fighting-fire-with-fire/5040272\">setting fires from containment lines</url>, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand.\"</p><p>Who is responsible?</p><p>Bushfire management activities in Australia are conducted by state and territory governments and their relevant statutory authorities such as fire emergency services, including professional and volunteer firefighters, as well as by municipal councils and individual property owners.</p><p>At a federal level, bushfire management is regulated by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/about\">EPBC Act</url>).</p><p>A national policy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/publications/factsheet-bushfire-management-and-national-environment-law\">fact sheet</url> outlines the circumstances where fire prevention activities require federal environmental approval.</p><p>Activities that are not covered by the national law include those approved or authorised under federal or state/territory laws before July 2000 (when the legislation took effect), as well as continued lawful land uses of the sort that were occurring before July 2000 (such as maintaining access to existing tracks and fire breaks, roadside weed control, and routine controlled burns of the type that occurred in the past).</p><p>Activities that require ministerial approval, according to the act, are those affecting nationally threatened species and their habitats, as well as Commonwealth land.</p><p>These include, for example, the construction of substantial new fire breaks, access roads or tracks on a significant scale in habitat for national threatened species; one-off fuel burns in remnant forest that is important habitat for nationally threatened species and had not been subject previously to a burning regime; and, proposed new burning regimes in world heritage sites among others.</p><p>Queensland framework and operation</p><p>Fact Check contacted the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services for information about the legal framework, as well as the processes and procedures, governing prescribed burning in that state.</p><p>Numerous agencies and government departments are responsible for planning, overseeing and conducting hazard reduction on both state-managed and private land.</p><p>Queensland fire management groups, including volunteer fire brigades, also participate in the yearly operation <url normalizedValue=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2019/4/9/operation-cool-burn-blazes-across-the-state-in-preparation-for-bushfire-season\">Cool Burn</url> - a hazard reduction coordinating effort organised by QFES which generally operates from April 1 to August 31.</p><p>The goal of Cool Burn is to put in place a plan for hazard reduction and other mitigating activities across the landscape with a focus on protecting the community, and public and privately owned assets, as well as identifying areas at high risk of a fire, such as enclosed townships.</p><p>QFES Superintendent James Haig told Fact Check that authorisation under Queensland's Fire and Emergencies Act was necessary to conduct hazard reduction burns on private and state-managed lands. This would take the form of either a notification (in cases such as burning assignments for the sugarcane industry), or as a permit obtained from local fire wardens.</p><p>\"We have a large number of fire wardens, many of whom are volunteers, so they come from the community and they are aware of the local conditions,\" Mr Haig said.</p><p>According to QFES records, approximately 28,000 permits a year were issued for controlled fires since 2015.</p><p>\"In 2019, QFES and its partners completed 229 priority mitigation activities to reduce bushfire risk at high-risk sites,\" it said in a statement sent to Fact Check.</p><p>\"This includes 108 of 175 planned hazard reduction burns, 83 targeted education activities and 38 fire line upgrades.\"</p><p>However, such activities were \"highly dependent\" on weather conditions, it added, with not all planned 2019 burns able to be completed.</p><p>\"In some areas, it rapidly became too dry to burn safely,\" the QFES statement continued.</p><p>\"In other areas, it was too wet too early on and dried out rapidly, leaving a short window of opportunity to safely conduct mitigation activities.\"</p><p>Mr Haig elaborated: \"The most common reason for a permit not being granted would be because the local conditions were too dry; that it was difficult to conduct safely and with the appropriate outcome.\"</p><p>He added that if moisture levels in the soil were too low, then farmers (especially graziers) often would want to hold onto the grass they had, so there were fewer applications for fire permits.</p><p>Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages primarily native forests and state-owned land, is exempt from obtaining a \"permit to light fire\".</p><p>It has its own procedures and burn targets, and collaborates with the QFES on initiatives such as operation Cool Burn.</p><p>\"From 1 January [2019] to date, QPWS conducted 291 planned burns over 1,443,882 hectares - which is the largest area covered in the last six years,\" a statement provided to Fact Check said.</p><p>\"QPWS's annual target for Protection Zones burns is 90 per cent (14,884 hectares). In 2018-19, QPWS achieved 118 per cent of this target.\"</p><p>NSW framework and operation</p><p>In NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with the NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, Forestry Corporation and Sydney Catchment Authority to carry out hazard reduction burns and other hazard reduction activities such as mowing and building firebreaks.</p><p>According to the NSW Department of Environment, hazard reduction efforts in NSW have increased under the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/parks-reserves-and-protected-areas/fire/managing-fire/bushfire-management-program\">Enhanced Bushfire Management Program</url> (EBMP), which came into effect in 2011.</p><p>The statewide program began with a five-year commitment to treat 135,000 hectares of bushland (on average) each year. In 2017, the NSW Government extended the program to 2022.</p><p>The NSW<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/conservation-programs/hazard-reduction-program\">National Parks and Wildlife Service</url> operates under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/~/view/act/1997/65/\">Rural Fires Act 1997</url> and under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1974/80/\">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974</url>.</p><p>Over the last eight years, according to its website, the NPWS carried out hazard reduction burns in NSW parks and reserves covering more than 680,000 hectares - more than double that of the previous five-year period.</p><p>\"NPWS has undertaken 80 per cent of the total hazard reduction burning effort recorded in NSW, despite managing less than 9 per cent of the state,\" its website states.</p><p>Conducting planned burns</p><p>The University of Wollongong's Professor Bradstock, who also heads the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub, told Fact Check: \"In Australia, typically we do a lot of prescribed burning, perhaps more so than many other countries, but we are doing it with the intention of reducing the intensity of subsequent wildfires - unplanned fires - to a level where they are potentially controllable using suppression forces.\"</p><p>The threshold of safe and effective fire suppression is calculated by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, which Fact Check <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/fact-check-did-high-fire-danger-indices-come-earlier-this-year/11506082\">has looked at previously.</url></p><p>Using measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions, combined with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319164959_Using_alternative_soil_moisture_estimates_in_the_McArthur_Forest_Fire_Danger_Index#pf2\">formula</url> to account for the effect of drought, the meter creates the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).</p><p>An index of 1 means that a fire will not burn, or will burn so slowly that control presents little difficulty, while anything above 100 is considered a catastrophic rating (\"code red\" in Victoria).</p><p>However, Professor Bradstock noted that the McArthur Meter and the FFDI were developed empirically through observations of small fires burning under mild conditions in the 1960s, and did not necessarily perform well in the extreme fire conditions prevailing in the current NSW bushfires.</p><p>\"[W]e know that the McArthur FFD models underpredict the rate of spread and intensity under high forest fire danger index conditions; in other words, they don't fully capture all the things that are going on when it's really hot, really windy and the humidity is very low,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Fire behaviour under extreme and catastrophic conditions</p><p>Experts emphasised that in extreme and catastrophic fire conditions, the surface fuel available for burning makes next to no difference to the level of a fire's intensity.</p><p>University of Melbourne associate professor Trent Penman, who studies bushfire behaviour,told Fact Check: \"Prescribed burning effectiveness decreases with [increasing] FFDI; when you exceed an FFDI of about 50, you switch from fuel-dominated to a weather-dominated fire.</p><p>\"At this point, while fuel has a small effect, it is overwhelmed by the weather.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock agreed, pointing to the example of Victoria's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/black-saturday-bushfires\">Black Saturday</url> bushfires in 2009 that claimed the lives of 173 people.</p><p>His team <url normalizedValue=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/smhpapers/138/\">studied</url> the aftermath of the fires which were associated with an FFDI of well above 100.</p><p>They found that even in the areas where fuel had been treated with planned burns less than five years prior, there was no measurable effect on the intensity of the fires.</p><p>\"At a level where we would have expected the fire intensity to be reduced to suppressible levels, we essentially found no effect,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"It's almost like a turbo-charging effect, when you have such incredibly high temperatures and very high winds that you only need a negligible amount of fuel to produce a fire intensity that is not suppressible.\"</p><p>The University of Tasmania's Professor Bowman said that in catastrophic conditions, such as those prevailing in the current Queensland and NSW bushfires, all \"organic matter is going to burn\".</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour.\"</p><p>Professor Bowman described embers rushing ahead of the fire front, passing over cleared areas to find available fuel like a \"heat gun blasting sparks at incredibly high speed\".</p><p>\"It's a wind-driven phenomenon,\" he said.</p><p>\"[E]ven if you can treat everything at a maximum level, it's still not going to give you the benefit under catastrophic fire weather conditions.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock likened the effect of prescribed burns on fire intensity to a sliding scale.</p><p>\"The window of effectiveness essentially narrows down to a point where it essentially disappears,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Some vegetation types cannot be treated with prescribed burning</p><p>Experts also explained that some fuel types, particularly wet forest vegetation, were not treatable in the cooler months of the year, when prescribed burns can be safely carried out.</p><p>\"Some fuel types are simply not dry enough to burn in the time, when it is safe to do so,\" Professor Penman said. \"These include rainforests and wet forests.\"</p><p>He gave the example of a campfire: \"[I]f you put green leaves on it to get it started; they won't work. There's too much moisture there to get the fire started. You can put green leaves on, once the fire is going and they'll burn, but if the fuel is too wet, the fire won't start in the first place.\"</p><p>However, these vegetation types would still burn under catastrophic conditions.</p><p>As Professor Bradstock explained, parts of the Victorian and NSW landscapes, such as the wet forests or alpine areas, were not treatable under normal conditions.</p><p>\"It's a waste of time because they are usually too wet to burn.</p><p>\"Because things are so critically dry at the moment, what typically would never burn, well, now it is burning,\" he said.</p><p>And Professor Bowman agreed that different fuel types affected fire intensity differently, but in catastrophic conditions, \"the variability and fuel load becomes irrelevant\".</p><p>How effective are prescribed burns?</p><p>A plethora of scientific papers describe hazard reduction burns as the easiest and most effective tool of bushfire management - more effective than slashing, weeding, herbicide use and so forth.</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check this was because of its wide reach and comparatively low cost.</p><p>\"You can treat [through burning] relatively large areas with costs around $100 a hectare in terms of operational costs; so you might be able to burn out 2000 hectares in a day or two, relatively cheaply,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you were to go in there and try and mechanically treat that, you wouldn't be able to do it.\"</p><p>Burning has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815213002326\">found</url> to be even more effective in areas adjacent to houses or within a so-called Bushland Urban Interface Zone, also known as the wildland-urban interface, despite the higher cost, which can range from $1000 to $10,000 per hectare.</p><p>\"[E]ven then, it's still probably cheaper than mechanical work,\" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check.</p><p>A 2018 research <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF18192\">article</url> published by the CSIRO indicated that \"intensifying prescribed burning treatments in public land in the [wild-urban interface] achieves a greater reduction in damages compared with applying the majority of the treatments in rural areas.</p><p>\"However, prescribed burning in the WUI is significantly more expensive and, despite additional benefits gained from this strategy, in most cases it is not the most economically efficient strategy.\"</p><p>But research has also found that prescribed burning as a bushfire management tool is not a panacea.</p><p>A 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.12579\">research paper</url> exploring variations in the effectiveness of prescribed burns in south-eastern Australia found that the inconsistency was due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes.</p><p>\"Prescribed burning solutions that are effective in one particular region may not be effective elsewhere unless there is strong similarity in vegetation types, fire weather, fuel accumulation and ignition rates.</p><p>\"The most efficient use of prescribed fire is applying it to the immediate proximity of assets, where a resultant reduction in fire intensity can be of immediate benefit in terms of impacts on structures and ease of suppression.\"</p><p>As an example of the futility of some prescribed burns, Dr Penman pointed to the forest around Port Macquarie in northern NSW, which has been widely studied and found to have fuel vegetation that regenerates every three to five years.</p><p>\"Any burn you undertake in those areas has a longevity of about three to five years,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to be burning a huge amount before you are actually reducing the risk at all.\"</p><p>In other areas where fuels accumulated more slowly, planned burns had a greater impact, he added.</p><p>\"But it's never going to stop wildfires.\"</p><p>What does the future of bushfire management look like?</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check that scientists and agencies with more advanced and up-to-date modeling capabilities would need to better choose treatment areas with maximum cost effectiveness.</p><p>\"We are going to have to get smarter about it,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"We are going to learn a lot from the current fire season.</p><p>\"I know, anecdotally, there has been major property damage done in NSW in areas that have been recently treated.\"</p><p>Professor Penman told Fact Check that \"chasing the hectares\" in prescribed-burn targets was misguided.</p><p>Rather, states and statutory authorities were using a combination of hectares treated and risk approach in their bushfire management.</p><p>\"What you're really trying to achieve is [to] reduce the risk to assets that you have of value in the landscape, so that might be ecological assets like at-risk forest types. It may be around cultural sites, and it might be Indigenous or European sites and then other things like power lines, water supply catchments, and then, of course, around houses,\" he said.</p><p>\"[N]one of the agencies just invest entirely in prescribed burning or something else. They have a mixture of what they do.</p><p>\"It should never be a debate about, 'Does one thing do everything for us', because everybody knows that's not the case. It's about getting that balance right, across the different approaches.</p><p>\"So it's quite a challenging landscape to be working in, and you put that in the context of a changing climate and it becomes even harder.\"</p><p>Barnaby Joyce elaborates</p><p>When invited to expand on his media statements regarding prescribed burns and bushfire preparation, Nationals MP Mr Joyce sent Fact Check a list of grievances which focused on higher burn targets, a lack of dams and the imposition of bushfire permits, and pointed to a number of policies that in his view needed to be amended to allow better bushfire management.</p><p>These included the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and land clearing laws (including the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the Local Land Services Act 2013 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.</p><p>Mr Joyce nominated the former, saying \"the annual targets need to be dramatically increased\" to allow for more hazard reduction burns.</p><p>He also pointed to the fact that Australia's National Parks and areas within state forests did not permit grazing, which \"obviously affects fuel loads\".</p><p>And he suggested that fire permit requirements (for firebreak provisions and mandatory monitoring throughout a burn), as well as the penalties for non-compliance, were stopping some farmers from conducting these all-important activities.</p><p>However, the bushfire experts Fact Check spoke to dismissed Mr Joyce's claims, saying they failed to address key issues.</p><p>They countered that reasonable safeguards ensuring landholders and neighbours were kept safe during prescribed burns were an important component of current fire management practices.</p><p>\"There is a deliberate misinterpretation of the ecological thresholds and there is still the inherent assumption that a fuel reduction burn will reduce wildfires,\" said Melbourne University's Professor Penman.</p><p>Professor Bradstock said: \"Prescribed burning is constrained by budgets, resources and weather conditions. Pretty simple really: essentially, what we pay for is what we get.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Principal researcher: Christina Arampatzi</emphasis></p><p><url

The latter he blamed largely on current conservation laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/greens-policies-blamed-for-increased-fire-risks/news-story/bdf3d8ac083d06ba468f7135881f45b8\">Sky News</url>, he said: \"One [issue] is a lack of controlled burns - fire reduction burns ... that policy needs to be changed so we can get those controlled burns.\"</p><p>Similarly, Queenslander and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6103717836001\">accused</url> the Greens and Labor Party of restricting fire-reduction burns.</p><p>\"They've actually shut down the national parks, where you can't actually even clear the fuel on the floor,\" she claimed.</p><p>\"...They won't allow farmers to actually clean up their own properties.\"</p><p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.2gb.com/we-dont-do-enough-deputy-premier-admits-governments-failed-bushfire-prevention/\">pointed the finger at the Greens</url> and said: \"We've got to do better and I know that we don't do enough hazard reduction ... because of the ideological position [of] the Greens.\"</p><p>That same day, he widened <url normalizedValue=\"http://parliament/\">his attack</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardFull.aspx#/DateDisplay/HANSARD-1323879322-108740/HANSARD-1323879322-108752\">in Parliament</url>: \"The truth of the matter is we still live with [former Labor premier] Bob Carr's legacy: lock up the forest and let it burn. That is Bob Carr's legacy for this state. This is the truth.\"</p><p>Federal Resources Minister Matthew Canavan, as recently as last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/the-fires-have-not-started-due-to-climate-change/11791398\">referred to the \"bogey man of climate change\"</url> which he said was being used to distract from the failure of the states to manage fire risks.</p><p>\"The Queensland Government taking powers off farmers, taking their rights off them to be able to manage their own land, put in fire breaks, do cool burns, and that has exposed us to much much higher risk than we should,\" he said.</p><p>So, how effective are hazard reduction burns and how are they managed?</p><p>RMIT ABC Fact Check considers the facts.</p><p>What can affect the behaviour of fires?</p><p>Fire behaviour refers to a variety of factors including the manner in which a fire burns, the speed at which it spreads, the amount of heat it gives off and the extent of vegetation it consumes.</p><p>The way a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/fire-and-the-environment/48-fire-behaviour\">fire behaves and its severity</url> is dependent on several elements, but can be narrowed down to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/managing-natural-resources/fire-management/fire-science/fire-behaviour\">three</url> essentials: weather, fuel and topography.</p><p>The volume of fuel, or \"surface fuel\", in a fire's path - such as shrubbery, bark, dry leaves, twigs and so forth - is often the only component of fire behaviour that can be directly modified by people.</p><p>The rate at which organic materials burns is directly related to its moisture content; the drier the fuel, the more fiercely it burns and the more intense the fire.</p><p>The moisture of a particular fuel load depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also the humidity and temperature of its surroundings.</p><p>Eucalyptus forests and grasslands are typically drier fuels that burn hot and fast, while rain forests and irrigated crops burn slower and can potentially slow the pace of a fire.</p><p>What methods are used to reduce fire hazards?</p><p>In a bid to reduce the intensity of unplanned fires, authorities carry out measures to \"treat\" the fuel and reduce the amount that is available to feed a fire.</p><p>\"They are treating fuel to change its structure and to typically reduce the amount of fuel or fuel load,\" Ross Bradstock, as senior professor at Wollongong University's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, told Fact Check.</p><p>This fuel treating process is called hazard reduction.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2898&amp;context=smhpapers\">Hazard reduction methods</url> include the intentional burning of surface fuel loads, but other practical and \"mechanical\" methods are also deployed.</p><p>The latter include activities such as \"thinning\" bushland (by cutting down trees), clearing, slashing or mulching ground litter, ploughing fields, cleaning guttering on houses and other buildings, and through fire-resistant garden design and maintenance.</p><p>Hazard reduction burns</p><p>Bushfire management is divided into two categories: firefighting and fire prevention.</p><p>Planned and purposeful burning of excess ground litter and fuel hazards in a specific area is known by many names - a \"hazard reduction burn\", \"controlled burn\" or \"prescribed burning\" to name a few.</p><p>These types of burns are widely used in fire prevention and are carried out in winter or generally outside the fire season when conditions are less volatile.</p><p>They require careful consideration and planning to achieve maximum results and to minimise potential dangers to health and wildlife, and to avoid causing accidental bushfires.</p><p>Prescribed burns should not be confused with \"back burning\", a fire-fighting tool.</p><p>As explained by bushfire expert and University of Tasmania professor David Bowman in <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605\">The Conversation</url>, back burning is \"a last-resort measure\" to stop a progressing bushfire from spreading to specific areas.</p><p>\"The difference between fuel-reduction burning and back burning is effectively the same as the difference between elective and emergency surgery,\" Bowman wrote.</p><p>\"Back burning ... works by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/back-burning-fighting-fire-with-fire/5040272\">setting fires from containment lines</url>, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand.\"</p><p>Who is responsible?</p><p>Bushfire management activities in Australia are conducted by state and territory governments and their relevant statutory authorities such as fire emergency services, including professional and volunteer firefighters, as well as by municipal councils and individual property owners.</p><p>At a federal level, bushfire management is regulated by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/about\">EPBC Act</url>).</p><p>A national policy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/publications/factsheet-bushfire-management-and-national-environment-law\">fact sheet</url> outlines the circumstances where fire prevention activities require federal environmental approval.</p><p>Activities that are not covered by the national law include those approved or authorised under federal or state/territory laws before July 2000 (when the legislation took effect), as well as continued lawful land uses of the sort that were occurring before July 2000 (such as maintaining access to existing tracks and fire breaks, roadside weed control, and routine controlled burns of the type that occurred in the past).</p><p>Activities that require ministerial approval, according to the act, are those affecting nationally threatened species and their habitats, as well as Commonwealth land.</p><p>These include, for example, the construction of substantial new fire breaks, access roads or tracks on a significant scale in habitat for national threatened species; one-off fuel burns in remnant forest that is important habitat for nationally threatened species and had not been subject previously to a burning regime; and, proposed new burning regimes in world heritage sites among others.</p><p>Queensland framework and operation</p><p>Fact Check contacted the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services for information about the legal framework, as well as the processes and procedures, governing prescribed burning in that state.</p><p>Numerous agencies and government departments are responsible for planning, overseeing and conducting hazard reduction on both state-managed and private land.</p><p>Queensland fire management groups, including volunteer fire brigades, also participate in the yearly operation <url normalizedValue=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2019/4/9/operation-cool-burn-blazes-across-the-state-in-preparation-for-bushfire-season\">Cool Burn</url> - a hazard reduction coordinating effort organised by QFES which generally operates from April 1 to August 31.</p><p>The goal of Cool Burn is to put in place a plan for hazard reduction and other mitigating activities across the landscape with a focus on protecting the community, and public and privately owned assets, as well as identifying areas at high risk of a fire, such as enclosed townships.</p><p>QFES Superintendent James Haig told Fact Check that authorisation under Queensland's Fire and Emergencies Act was necessary to conduct hazard reduction burns on private and state-managed lands. This would take the form of either a notification (in cases such as burning assignments for the sugarcane industry), or as a permit obtained from local fire wardens.</p><p>\"We have a large number of fire wardens, many of whom are volunteers, so they come from the community and they are aware of the local conditions,\" Mr Haig said.</p><p>According to QFES records, approximately 28,000 permits a year were issued for controlled fires since 2015.</p><p>\"In 2019, QFES and its partners completed 229 priority mitigation activities to reduce bushfire risk at high-risk sites,\" it said in a statement sent to Fact Check.</p><p>\"This includes 108 of 175 planned hazard reduction burns, 83 targeted education activities and 38 fire line upgrades.\"</p><p>However, such activities were \"highly dependent\" on weather conditions, it added, with not all planned 2019 burns able to be completed.</p><p>\"In some areas, it rapidly became too dry to burn safely,\" the QFES statement continued.</p><p>\"In other areas, it was too wet too early on and dried out rapidly, leaving a short window of opportunity to safely conduct mitigation activities.\"</p><p>Mr Haig elaborated: \"The most common reason for a permit not being granted would be because the local conditions were too dry; that it was difficult to conduct safely and with the appropriate outcome.\"</p><p>He added that if moisture levels in the soil were too low, then farmers (especially graziers) often would want to hold onto the grass they had, so there were fewer applications for fire permits.</p><p>Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages primarily native forests and state-owned land, is exempt from obtaining a \"permit to light fire\".</p><p>It has its own procedures and burn targets, and collaborates with the QFES on initiatives such as operation Cool Burn.</p><p>\"From 1 January [2019] to date, QPWS conducted 291 planned burns over 1,443,882 hectares - which is the largest area covered in the last six years,\" a statement provided to Fact Check said.</p><p>\"QPWS's annual target for Protection Zones burns is 90 per cent (14,884 hectares). In 2018-19, QPWS achieved 118 per cent of this target.\"</p><p>NSW framework and operation</p><p>In NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with the NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, Forestry Corporation and Sydney Catchment Authority to carry out hazard reduction burns and other hazard reduction activities such as mowing and building firebreaks.</p><p>According to the NSW Department of Environment, hazard reduction efforts in NSW have increased under the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/parks-reserves-and-protected-areas/fire/managing-fire/bushfire-management-program\">Enhanced Bushfire Management Program</url> (EBMP), which came into effect in 2011.</p><p>The statewide program began with a five-year commitment to treat 135,000 hectares of bushland (on average) each year. In 2017, the NSW Government extended the program to 2022.</p><p>The NSW<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/conservation-programs/hazard-reduction-program\">National Parks and Wildlife Service</url> operates under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/~/view/act/1997/65/\">Rural Fires Act 1997</url> and under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1974/80/\">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974</url>.</p><p>Over the last eight years, according to its website, the NPWS carried out hazard reduction burns in NSW parks and reserves covering more than 680,000 hectares - more than double that of the previous five-year period.</p><p>\"NPWS has undertaken 80 per cent of the total hazard reduction burning effort recorded in NSW, despite managing less than 9 per cent of the state,\" its website states.</p><p>Conducting planned burns</p><p>The University of Wollongong's Professor Bradstock, who also heads the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub, told Fact Check: \"In Australia, typically we do a lot of prescribed burning, perhaps more so than many other countries, but we are doing it with the intention of reducing the intensity of subsequent wildfires - unplanned fires - to a level where they are potentially controllable using suppression forces.\"</p><p>The threshold of safe and effective fire suppression is calculated by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, which Fact Check <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/fact-check-did-high-fire-danger-indices-come-earlier-this-year/11506082\">has looked at previously.</url></p><p>Using measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions, combined with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319164959_Using_alternative_soil_moisture_estimates_in_the_McArthur_Forest_Fire_Danger_Index#pf2\">formula</url> to account for the effect of drought, the meter creates the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).</p><p>An index of 1 means that a fire will not burn, or will burn so slowly that control presents little difficulty, while anything above 100 is considered a catastrophic rating (\"code red\" in Victoria).</p><p>However, Professor Bradstock noted that the McArthur Meter and the FFDI were developed empirically through observations of small fires burning under mild conditions in the 1960s, and did not necessarily perform well in the extreme fire conditions prevailing in the current NSW bushfires.</p><p>\"[W]e know that the McArthur FFD models underpredict the rate of spread and intensity under high forest fire danger index conditions; in other words, they don't fully capture all the things that are going on when it's really hot, really windy and the humidity is very low,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Fire behaviour under extreme and catastrophic conditions</p><p>Experts emphasised that in extreme and catastrophic fire conditions, the surface fuel available for burning makes next to no difference to the level of a fire's intensity.</p><p>University of Melbourne associate professor Trent Penman, who studies bushfire behaviour,told Fact Check: \"Prescribed burning effectiveness decreases with [increasing] FFDI; when you exceed an FFDI of about 50, you switch from fuel-dominated to a weather-dominated fire.</p><p>\"At this point, while fuel has a small effect, it is overwhelmed by the weather.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock agreed, pointing to the example of Victoria's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/black-saturday-bushfires\">Black Saturday</url> bushfires in 2009 that claimed the lives of 173 people.</p><p>His team <url normalizedValue=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/smhpapers/138/\">studied</url> the aftermath of the fires which were associated with an FFDI of well above 100.</p><p>They found that even in the areas where fuel had been treated with planned burns less than five years prior, there was no measurable effect on the intensity of the fires.</p><p>\"At a level where we would have expected the fire intensity to be reduced to suppressible levels, we essentially found no effect,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"It's almost like a turbo-charging effect, when you have such incredibly high temperatures and very high winds that you only need a negligible amount of fuel to produce a fire intensity that is not suppressible.\"</p><p>The University of Tasmania's Professor Bowman said that in catastrophic conditions, such as those prevailing in the current Queensland and NSW bushfires, all \"organic matter is going to burn\".</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour.\"</p><p>Professor Bowman described embers rushing ahead of the fire front, passing over cleared areas to find available fuel like a \"heat gun blasting sparks at incredibly high speed\".</p><p>\"It's a wind-driven phenomenon,\" he said.</p><p>\"[E]ven if you can treat everything at a maximum level, it's still not going to give you the benefit under catastrophic fire weather conditions.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock likened the effect of prescribed burns on fire intensity to a sliding scale.</p><p>\"The window of effectiveness essentially narrows down to a point where it essentially disappears,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Some vegetation types cannot be treated with prescribed burning</p><p>Experts also explained that some fuel types, particularly wet forest vegetation, were not treatable in the cooler months of the year, when prescribed burns can be safely carried out.</p><p>\"Some fuel types are simply not dry enough to burn in the time, when it is safe to do so,\" Professor Penman said. \"These include rainforests and wet forests.\"</p><p>He gave the example of a campfire: \"[I]f you put green leaves on it to get it started; they won't work. There's too much moisture there to get the fire started. You can put green leaves on, once the fire is going and they'll burn, but if the fuel is too wet, the fire won't start in the first place.\"</p><p>However, these vegetation types would still burn under catastrophic conditions.</p><p>As Professor Bradstock explained, parts of the Victorian and NSW landscapes, such as the wet forests or alpine areas, were not treatable under normal conditions.</p><p>\"It's a waste of time because they are usually too wet to burn.</p><p>\"Because things are so critically dry at the moment, what typically would never burn, well, now it is burning,\" he said.</p><p>And Professor Bowman agreed that different fuel types affected fire intensity differently, but in catastrophic conditions, \"the variability and fuel load becomes irrelevant\".</p><p>How effective are prescribed burns?</p><p>A plethora of scientific papers describe hazard reduction burns as the easiest and most effective tool of bushfire management - more effective than slashing, weeding, herbicide use and so forth.</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check this was because of its wide reach and comparatively low cost.</p><p>\"You can treat [through burning] relatively large areas with costs around $100 a hectare in terms of operational costs; so you might be able to burn out 2000 hectares in a day or two, relatively cheaply,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you were to go in there and try and mechanically treat that, you wouldn't be able to do it.\"</p><p>Burning has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815213002326\">found</url> to be even more effective in areas adjacent to houses or within a so-called Bushland Urban Interface Zone, also known as the wildland-urban interface, despite the higher cost, which can range from $1000 to $10,000 per hectare.</p><p>\"[E]ven then, it's still probably cheaper than mechanical work,\" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check.</p><p>A 2018 research <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF18192\">article</url> published by the CSIRO indicated that \"intensifying prescribed burning treatments in public land in the [wild-urban interface] achieves a greater reduction in damages compared with applying the majority of the treatments in rural areas.</p><p>\"However, prescribed burning in the WUI is significantly more expensive and, despite additional benefits gained from this strategy, in most cases it is not the most economically efficient strategy.\"</p><p>But research has also found that prescribed burning as a bushfire management tool is not a panacea.</p><p>A 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.12579\">research paper</url> exploring variations in the effectiveness of prescribed burns in south-eastern Australia found that the inconsistency was due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes.</p><p>\"Prescribed burning solutions that are effective in one particular region may not be effective elsewhere unless there is strong similarity in vegetation types, fire weather, fuel accumulation and ignition rates.</p><p>\"The most efficient use of prescribed fire is applying it to the immediate proximity of assets, where a resultant reduction in fire intensity can be of immediate benefit in terms of impacts on structures and ease of suppression.\"</p><p>As an example of the futility of some prescribed burns, Dr Penman pointed to the forest around Port Macquarie in northern NSW, which has been widely studied and found to have fuel vegetation that regenerates every three to five years.</p><p>\"Any burn you undertake in those areas has a longevity of about three to five years,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to be burning a huge amount before you are actually reducing the risk at all.\"</p><p>In other areas where fuels accumulated more slowly, planned burns had a greater impact, he added.</p><p>\"But it's never going to stop wildfires.\"</p><p>What does the future of bushfire management look like?</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check that scientists and agencies with more advanced and up-to-date modeling capabilities would need to better choose treatment areas with maximum cost effectiveness.</p><p>\"We are going to have to get smarter about it,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"We are going to learn a lot from the current fire season.</p><p>\"I know, anecdotally, there has been major property damage done in NSW in areas that have been recently treated.\"</p><p>Professor Penman told Fact Check that \"chasing the hectares\" in prescribed-burn targets was misguided.</p><p>Rather, states and statutory authorities were using a combination of hectares treated and risk approach in their bushfire management.</p><p>\"What you're really trying to achieve is [to] reduce the risk to assets that you have of value in the landscape, so that might be ecological assets like at-risk forest types. It may be around cultural sites, and it might be Indigenous or European sites and then other things like power lines, water supply catchments, and then, of course, around houses,\" he said.</p><p>\"[N]one of the agencies just invest entirely in prescribed burning or something else. They have a mixture of what they do.</p><p>\"It should never be a debate about, 'Does one thing do everything for us', because everybody knows that's not the case. It's about getting that balance right, across the different approaches.</p><p>\"So it's quite a challenging landscape to be working in, and you put that in the context of a changing climate and it becomes even harder.\"</p><p>Barnaby Joyce elaborates</p><p>When invited to expand on his media statements regarding prescribed burns and bushfire preparation, Nationals MP Mr Joyce <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/fires-joyce-response/11817930\">sent Fact Check a list of grievances</url> which focused on higher burn targets, a lack of dams and the imposition of bushfire permits, and pointed to a number of policies that in his view needed to be amended to allow better bushfire management.</p><p>These included the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and land clearing laws (including the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the Local Land Services Act 2013 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.</p><p>Mr Joyce nominated the former, saying \"the annual targets need to be dramatically increased\" to allow for more hazard reduction burns.</p><p>He also pointed to the fact that Australia's National Parks and areas within state forests did not permit grazing, which \"obviously affects fuel loads\".</p><p>And he suggested that fire permit requirements (for firebreak provisions and mandatory monitoring throughout a burn), as well as the penalties for non-compliance, were stopping some farmers from conducting these all-important activities.</p><p>However, the bushfire experts Fact Check spoke to dismissed Mr Joyce's claims, saying they failed to address key issues.</p><p>They countered that reasonable safeguards ensuring landholders and neighbours were kept safe during prescribed burns were an important component of current fire management practices.</p><p>\"There is a deliberate misinterpretation of the ecological thresholds and there is still the inherent assumption that a fuel reduction burn will reduce wildfires,\" said Melbourne University's Professor Penman.</p><p>Professor Bradstock said: \"Prescribed burning is constrained by budgets, resources and weather conditions. Pretty simple really: essentially, what we pay for is what we get.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Principal researcher: Christina Arampatzi</emphasis></p><p><url

Cole traffics in gentle wryness, peppering his romantic warmth with low-lying quips.</p><p>The US-based English songwriter, who has maintained a loyal cult following since the mid-1980s, half-jokingly spruiked his latest album, Standards, but made no attempt to shy from his deep catalogue of fan favourites.</p><p>He played the early single Rattlesnakes second in his set, and bookended an intermission with 2003's No More Love Songs and 1984's Are You Ready To Be Heartbroken.</p><p>Cole has the art of the solo act down pat: he asked the crowd for vocal harmonies on Jennifer She Said and backed away from the mic for a natural fade-out on Don't Look Back.</p><p>He spiked his banter with the same degree of wittiness as his lyrics: of Undressed, he said, \"I wrote this song for Julio Iglesias. He didn't want it.\" If his performance lacked dynamic range due to the acoustic format, his words, singing and guitar playing made up for it.</p><p>Unfortunately, a high-pitched noise persisted throughout the first half of the night and was especially distracting for audience members seated on the second level. It was fixed during intermission.</p><p>After Bob Dylan's I Threw It All Away, he capped the encore with the excellent oldie Forest Fire, prompting a wobbly attempt at a group clap-along from fans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Lloyd Cole prefers the solo acoustic setting when he takes his songs on the road.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-6fxsu3npa881604tudwc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CJ8-84T1-F0J6-J24T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"270\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 30, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The latter he blamed largely on current conservation laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/greens-policies-blamed-for-increased-fire-risks/news-story/bdf3d8ac083d06ba468f7135881f45b8\">Sky News</url>, he said: \"One [issue] is a lack of controlled burns - fire reduction burns ... that policy needs to be changed so we can get those controlled burns.\"</p><p>Similarly, Queenslander and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6103717836001\">accused</url> the Greens and Labor Party of restricting fire-reduction burns.</p><p>\"They've actually shut down the national parks, where you can't actually even clear the fuel on the floor,\" she claimed.</p><p>\"...They won't allow farmers to actually clean up their own properties.\"</p><p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.2gb.com/we-dont-do-enough-deputy-premier-admits-governments-failed-bushfire-prevention/\">pointed the finger at the Greens</url> and said: \"We've got to do better and I know that we don't do enough hazard reduction ... because of the ideological position [of] the Greens.\"</p><p>That same day, he widened <url normalizedValue=\"http://parliament/\">his attack</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardFull.aspx#/DateDisplay/HANSARD-1323879322-108740/HANSARD-1323879322-108752\">in Parliament</url>: \"The truth of the matter is we still live with [former Labor premier] Bob Carr's legacy: lock up the forest and let it burn. That is Bob Carr's legacy for this state. This is the truth.\"</p><p>Federal Resources Minister Matthew Canavan, as recently as last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/the-fires-have-not-started-due-to-climate-change/11791398\">referred to the \"bogey man of climate change\"</url> which he said was being used to distract from the failure of the states to manage fire risks.</p><p>\"The Queensland Government taking powers off farmers, taking their rights off them to be able to manage their own land, put in fire breaks, do cool burns, and that has exposed us to much much higher risk than we should,\" he said.</p><p>So, how effective are hazard reduction burns and how are they managed?</p><p>RMIT ABC Fact Check considers the facts.</p><p>What can affect the behaviour of fires?</p><p>Fire behaviour refers to a variety of factors including the manner in which a fire burns, the speed at which it spreads, the amount of heat it gives off and the extent of vegetation it consumes.</p><p>The way a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/fire-and-the-environment/48-fire-behaviour\">fire behaves and its severity</url> is dependent on several elements, but can be narrowed down to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/managing-natural-resources/fire-management/fire-science/fire-behaviour\">three</url> essentials: weather, fuel and topography.</p><p>The volume of fuel, or \"surface fuel\", in a fire's path - such as shrubbery, bark, dry leaves, twigs and so forth - is often the only component of fire behaviour that can be directly modified by people.</p><p>The rate at which organic materials burns is directly related to its moisture content; the drier the fuel, the more fiercely it burns and the more intense the fire.</p><p>The moisture of a particular fuel load depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also the humidity and temperature of its surroundings.</p><p>Eucalyptus forests and grasslands are typically drier fuels that burn hot and fast, while rain forests and irrigated crops burn slower and can potentially slow the pace of a fire.</p><p>What methods are used to reduce fire hazards?</p><p>In a bid to reduce the intensity of unplanned fires, authorities carry out measures to \"treat\" the fuel and reduce the amount that is available to feed a fire.</p><p>\"They are treating fuel to change its structure and to typically reduce the amount of fuel or fuel load,\" Ross Bradstock, as senior professor at Wollongong University's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, told Fact Check.</p><p>This fuel treating process is called hazard reduction.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2898&amp;context=smhpapers\">Hazard reduction methods</url> include the intentional burning of surface fuel loads, but other practical and \"mechanical\" methods are also deployed.</p><p>The latter include activities such as \"thinning\" bushland (by cutting down trees), clearing, slashing or mulching ground litter, ploughing fields, cleaning guttering on houses and other buildings, and through fire-resistant garden design and maintenance.</p><p>Hazard reduction burns</p><p>Bushfire management is divided into two categories: firefighting and fire prevention.</p><p>Planned and purposeful burning of excess ground litter and fuel hazards in a specific area is known by many names - a \"hazard reduction burn\", \"controlled burn\" or \"prescribed burning\" to name a few.</p><p>These types of burns are widely used in fire prevention and are carried out in winter or generally outside the fire season when conditions are less volatile.</p><p>They require careful consideration and planning to achieve maximum results and to minimise potential dangers to health and wildlife, and to avoid causing accidental bushfires.</p><p>Prescribed burns should not be confused with \"back burning\", a fire-fighting tool.</p><p>As explained by bushfire expert and University of Tasmania professor David Bowman in <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605\">The Conversation</url>, back burning is \"a last-resort measure\" to stop a progressing bushfire from spreading to specific areas.</p><p>\"The difference between fuel-reduction burning and back burning is effectively the same as the difference between elective and emergency surgery,\" Bowman wrote.</p><p>\"Back burning ... works by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/back-burning-fighting-fire-with-fire/5040272\">setting fires from containment lines</url>, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand.\"</p><p>Who is responsible?</p><p>Bushfire management activities in Australia are conducted by state and territory governments and their relevant statutory authorities such as fire emergency services, including professional and volunteer firefighters, as well as by municipal councils and individual property owners.</p><p>At a federal level, bushfire management is regulated by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/about\">EPBC Act</url>).</p><p>A national policy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/publications/factsheet-bushfire-management-and-national-environment-law\">fact sheet</url> outlines the circumstances where fire prevention activities require federal environmental approval.</p><p>Activities that are not covered by the national law include those approved or authorised under federal or state/territory laws before July 2000 (when the legislation took effect), as well as continued lawful land uses of the sort that were occurring before July 2000 (such as maintaining access to existing tracks and fire breaks, roadside weed control, and routine controlled burns of the type that occurred in the past).</p><p>Activities that require ministerial approval, according to the act, are those affecting nationally threatened species and their habitats, as well as Commonwealth land.</p><p>These include, for example, the construction of substantial new fire breaks, access roads or tracks on a significant scale in habitat for national threatened species; one-off fuel burns in remnant forest that is important habitat for nationally threatened species and had not been subject previously to a burning regime; and, proposed new burning regimes in world heritage sites among others.</p><p>Queensland framework and operation</p><p>Fact Check contacted the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services for information about the legal framework, as well as the processes and procedures, governing prescribed burning in that state.</p><p>Numerous agencies and government departments are responsible for planning, overseeing and conducting hazard reduction on both state-managed and private land.</p><p>Queensland fire management groups, including volunteer fire brigades, also participate in the yearly operation <url normalizedValue=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2019/4/9/operation-cool-burn-blazes-across-the-state-in-preparation-for-bushfire-season\">Cool Burn</url> - a hazard reduction coordinating effort organised by QFES which generally operates from April 1 to August 31.</p><p>The goal of Cool Burn is to put in place a plan for hazard reduction and other mitigating activities across the landscape with a focus on protecting the community, and public and privately owned assets, as well as identifying areas at high risk of a fire, such as enclosed townships.</p><p>QFES Superintendent James Haig told Fact Check that authorisation under Queensland's Fire and Emergencies Act was necessary to conduct hazard reduction burns on private and state-managed lands. This would take the form of either a notification (in cases such as burning assignments for the sugarcane industry), or as a permit obtained from local fire wardens.</p><p>\"We have a large number of fire wardens, many of whom are volunteers, so they come from the community and they are aware of the local conditions,\" Mr Haig said.</p><p>According to QFES records, approximately 28,000 permits a year were issued for controlled fires since 2015.</p><p>\"In 2019, QFES and its partners completed 229 priority mitigation activities to reduce bushfire risk at high-risk sites,\" it said in a statement sent to Fact Check.</p><p>\"This includes 108 of 175 planned hazard reduction burns, 83 targeted education activities and 38 fire line upgrades.\"</p><p>However, such activities were \"highly dependent\" on weather conditions, it added, with not all planned 2019 burns able to be completed.</p><p>\"In some areas, it rapidly became too dry to burn safely,\" the QFES statement continued.</p><p>\"In other areas, it was too wet too early on and dried out rapidly, leaving a short window of opportunity to safely conduct mitigation activities.\"</p><p>Mr Haig elaborated: \"The most common reason for a permit not being granted would be because the local conditions were too dry; that it was difficult to conduct safely and with the appropriate outcome.\"</p><p>He added that if moisture levels in the soil were too low, then farmers (especially graziers) often would want to hold onto the grass they had, so there were fewer applications for fire permits.</p><p>Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages primarily native forests and state-owned land, is exempt from obtaining a \"permit to light fire\".</p><p>It has its own procedures and burn targets, and collaborates with the QFES on initiatives such as operation Cool Burn.</p><p>\"From 1 January [2019] to date, QPWS conducted 291 planned burns over 1,443,882 hectares - which is the largest area covered in the last six years,\" a statement provided to Fact Check said.</p><p>\"QPWS's annual target for Protection Zones burns is 90 per cent (14,884 hectares). In 2018-19, QPWS achieved 118 per cent of this target.\"</p><p>NSW framework and operation</p><p>In NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with the NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, Forestry Corporation and Sydney Catchment Authority to carry out hazard reduction burns and other hazard reduction activities such as mowing and building firebreaks.</p><p>According to the NSW Department of Environment, hazard reduction efforts in NSW have increased under the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/parks-reserves-and-protected-areas/fire/managing-fire/bushfire-management-program\">Enhanced Bushfire Management Program</url> (EBMP), which came into effect in 2011.</p><p>The statewide program began with a five-year commitment to treat 135,000 hectares of bushland (on average) each year. In 2017, the NSW Government extended the program to 2022.</p><p>The NSW<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/conservation-programs/hazard-reduction-program\">National Parks and Wildlife Service</url> operates under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/~/view/act/1997/65/\">Rural Fires Act 1997</url> and under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1974/80/\">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974</url>.</p><p>Over the last eight years, according to its website, the NPWS carried out hazard reduction burns in NSW parks and reserves covering more than 680,000 hectares - more than double that of the previous five-year period.</p><p>\"NPWS has undertaken 80 per cent of the total hazard reduction burning effort recorded in NSW, despite managing less than 9 per cent of the state,\" its website states.</p><p>Conducting planned burns</p><p>The University of Wollongong's Professor Bradstock, who also heads the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub, told Fact Check: \"In Australia, typically we do a lot of prescribed burning, perhaps more so than many other countries, but we are doing it with the intention of reducing the intensity of subsequent wildfires - unplanned fires - to a level where they are potentially controllable using suppression forces.\"</p><p>The threshold of safe and effective fire suppression is calculated by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, which Fact Check <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/fact-check-did-high-fire-danger-indices-come-earlier-this-year/11506082\">has looked at previously.</url></p><p>Using measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions, combined with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319164959_Using_alternative_soil_moisture_estimates_in_the_McArthur_Forest_Fire_Danger_Index#pf2\">formula</url> to account for the effect of drought, the meter creates the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).</p><p>However, Professor Bradstock noted that the McArthur Meter and the FFDI were developed empirically through observations of small fires burning under mild conditions in the 1960s, and did not necessarily perform well in the extreme fire conditions prevailing in the current NSW bushfires.</p><p>\"[W]e know that the McArthur FFD models underpredict the rate of spread and intensity under high forest fire danger index conditions; in other words, they don't fully capture all the things that are going on when it's really hot, really windy and the humidity is very low,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Fire behaviour under extreme and catastrophic conditions</p><p>Experts emphasised that in extreme and catastrophic fire conditions, the surface fuel available for burning makes next to no difference to the level of a fire's intensity.</p><p>University of Melbourne associate professor Trent Penman, who studies bushfire behaviour,told Fact Check: \"Prescribed burning effectiveness decreases with [increasing] FFDI; when you exceed an FFDI of about 50, you switch from fuel-dominated to a weather-dominated fire.</p><p>\"At this point, while fuel has a small effect, it is overwhelmed by the weather.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock agreed, pointing to the example of Victoria's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/black-saturday-bushfires\">Black Saturday</url> bushfires in 2009 that claimed the lives of 173 people.</p><p>His team <url normalizedValue=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/smhpapers/138/\">studied</url> the aftermath of the fires which were associated with an FFDI of well above 100.</p><p>They found that even in the areas where fuel had been treated with planned burns less than five years prior, there was no measurable effect on the intensity of the fires.</p><p>\"At a level where we would have expected the fire intensity to be reduced to suppressible levels, we essentially found no effect,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"It's almost like a turbo-charging effect, when you have such incredibly high temperatures and very high winds that you only need a negligible amount of fuel to produce a fire intensity that is not suppressible.\"</p><p>The University of Tasmania's Professor Bowman said that in catastrophic conditions, such as those prevailing in the current Queensland and NSW bushfires, all \"organic matter is going to burn\".</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour.\"</p><p>Professor Bowman described embers rushing ahead of the fire front, passing over cleared areas to find available fuel like a \"heat gun blasting sparks at incredibly high speed\".</p><p>\"It's a wind-driven phenomenon,\" he said.</p><p>\"[E]ven if you can treat everything at a maximum level, it's still not going to give you the benefit under catastrophic fire weather conditions.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock likened the effect of prescribed burns on fire intensity to a sliding scale.</p><p>\"The window of effectiveness essentially narrows down to a point where it essentially disappears,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Some vegetation types cannot be treated with prescribed burning</p><p>Experts also explained that some fuel types, particularly wet forest vegetation, were not treatable in the cooler months of the year, when prescribed burns can be safely carried out.</p><p>\"Some fuel types are simply not dry enough to burn in the time, when it is safe to do so,\" Professor Penman said. \"These include rainforests and wet forests.\"</p><p>He gave the example of a campfire: \"[I]f you put green leaves on it to get it started; they won't work. There's too much moisture there to get the fire started. You can put green leaves on, once the fire is going and they'll burn, but if the fuel is too wet, the fire won't start in the first place.\"</p><p>However, these vegetation types would still burn under catastrophic conditions.</p><p>As Professor Bradstock explained, parts of the Victorian and NSW landscapes, such as the wet forests or alpine areas, were not treatable under normal conditions.</p><p>\"It's a waste of time because they are usually too wet to burn.</p><p>\"Because things are so critically dry at the moment, what typically would never burn, well, now it is burning,\" he said.</p><p>And Professor Bowman agreed that different fuel types affected fire intensity differently, but in catastrophic conditions, \"the variability and fuel load becomes irrelevant\".</p><p>How effective are prescribed burns?</p><p>A plethora of scientific papers describe hazard reduction burns as the easiest and most effective tool of bushfire management - more effective than slashing, weeding, herbicide use and so forth.</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check this was because of its wide reach and comparatively low cost.</p><p>\"You can treat [through burning] relatively large areas with costs around $100 a hectare in terms of operational costs; so you might be able to burn out 2000 hectares in a day or two, relatively cheaply,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you were to go in there and try and mechanically treat that, you wouldn't be able to do it.\"</p><p>Burning has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815213002326\">found</url> to be even more effective in areas adjacent to houses or within a so-called Bushland Urban Interface Zone, also known as the wildland-urban interface, despite the higher cost, which can range from $1000 to $10,000 per hectare.</p><p>\"[E]ven then, it's still probably cheaper than mechanical work,\" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check.</p><p>A 2018 research <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF18192\">article</url> published by the CSIRO indicated that \"intensifying prescribed burning treatments in public land in the [wild-urban interface] achieves a greater reduction in damages compared with applying the majority of the treatments in rural areas.</p><p>\"However, prescribed burning in the WUI is significantly more expensive and, despite additional benefits gained from this strategy, in most cases it is not the most economically efficient strategy.\"</p><p>But research has also found that prescribed burning as a bushfire management tool is not a panacea.</p><p>A 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.12579\">research paper</url> exploring variations in the effectiveness of prescribed burns in south-eastern Australia found that the inconsistency was due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes.</p><p>\"Prescribed burning solutions that are effective in one particular region may not be effective elsewhere unless there is strong similarity in vegetation types, fire weather, fuel accumulation and ignition rates.</p><p>\"The most efficient use of prescribed fire is applying it to the immediate proximity of assets, where a resultant reduction in fire intensity can be of immediate benefit in terms of impacts on structures and ease of suppression.\"</p><p>As an example of the futility of some prescribed burns, Dr Penman pointed to the forest around Port Macquarie in northern NSW, which has been widely studied and found to have fuel vegetation that regenerates every three to five years.</p><p>\"Any burn you undertake in those areas has a longevity of about three to five years,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to be burning a huge amount before you are actually reducing the risk at all.\"</p><p>In other areas where fuels accumulated more slowly, planned burns had a greater impact, he added.</p><p>\"But it's never going to stop wildfires.\"</p><p>What does the future of bushfire management look like?</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check that scientists and agencies with more advanced and up-to-date modeling capabilities would need to better choose treatment areas with maximum cost effectiveness.</p><p>\"We are going to have to get smarter about it,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"We are going to learn a lot from the current fire season.</p><p>\"I know, anecdotally, there has been major property damage done in NSW in areas that have been recently treated.\"</p><p>Professor Penman told Fact Check that \"chasing the hectares\" in prescribed-burn targets was misguided.</p><p>Rather, states and statutory authorities were using a combination of hectares treated and risk approach in their bushfire management.</p><p>\"What you're really trying to achieve is [to] reduce the risk to assets that you have of value in the landscape, so that might be ecological assets like at-risk forest types. It may be around cultural sites, and it might be Indigenous or European sites and then other things like power lines, water supply catchments, and then, of course, around houses,\" he said.</p><p>\"[N]one of the agencies just invest entirely in prescribed burning or something else. They have a mixture of what they do.</p><p>\"It should never be a debate about, 'Does one thing do everything for us', because everybody knows that's not the case. It's about getting that balance right, across the different approaches.</p><p>\"So it's quite a challenging landscape to be working in, and you put that in the context of a changing climate and it becomes even harder.\"</p><p>Barnaby Joyce elaborates</p><p>When invited to expand on his media statements regarding prescribed burns and bushfire preparation, Nationals MP Mr Joyce <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/fires-joyce-response/11817930\">sent Fact Check a list of grievances</url> which focused on higher burn targets, a lack of dams and the imposition of bushfire permits, and pointed to a number of policies that in his view needed to be amended to allow better bushfire management.</p><p>These included the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and land clearing laws (including the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the Local Land Services Act 2013 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.</p><p>Mr Joyce nominated the former, saying \"the annual targets need to be dramatically increased\" to allow for more hazard reduction burns.</p><p>He also pointed to the fact that Australia's National Parks and areas within state forests did not permit grazing, which \"obviously affects fuel loads\".</p><p>And he suggested that fire permit requirements (for firebreak provisions and mandatory monitoring throughout a burn), as well as the penalties for non-compliance, were stopping some farmers from conducting these all-important activities.</p><p>However, the bushfire experts Fact Check spoke to dismissed Mr Joyce's claims, saying they failed to address key issues.</p><p>They countered that reasonable safeguards ensuring landholders and neighbours were kept safe during prescribed burns were an important component of current fire management practices.</p><p>\"There is a deliberate misinterpretation of the ecological thresholds and there is still the inherent assumption that a fuel reduction burn will reduce wildfires,\" said Melbourne University's Professor Penman.</p><p>Professor Bradstock said: \"Prescribed burning is constrained by budgets, resources and weather conditions. Pretty simple really: essentially, what we pay for is what we get.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Principal researcher: Christina Arampatzi</emphasis></p><p><url

The latter he blamed largely on current conservation laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/greens-policies-blamed-for-increased-fire-risks/news-story/bdf3d8ac083d06ba468f7135881f45b8\">Sky News</url>, he said: \"One [issue] is a lack of controlled burns - fire reduction burns ... that policy needs to be changed so we can get those controlled burns.\"</p><p>Similarly, Queenslander and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6103717836001\">accused</url> the Greens and Labor Party of restricting fire-reduction burns.</p><p>\"They've actually shut down the national parks, where you can't actually even clear the fuel on the floor,\" she claimed.</p><p>\"...They won't allow farmers to actually clean up their own properties.\"</p><p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.2gb.com/we-dont-do-enough-deputy-premier-admits-governments-failed-bushfire-prevention/\">pointed the finger at the Greens</url> and said: \"We've got to do better and I know that we don't do enough hazard reduction ... because of the ideological position [of] the Greens.\"</p><p>That same day, he widened <url normalizedValue=\"http://parliament/\">his attack</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardFull.aspx#/DateDisplay/HANSARD-1323879322-108740/HANSARD-1323879322-108752\">in Parliament</url>: \"The truth of the matter is we still live with [former Labor premier] Bob Carr's legacy: lock up the forest and let it burn. That is Bob Carr's legacy for this state. This is the truth.\"</p><p>Federal Resources Minister Matthew Canavan, as recently as last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/the-fires-have-not-started-due-to-climate-change/11791398\">referred to the \"bogey man of climate change\"</url> which he said was being used to distract from the failure of the states to manage fire risks.</p><p>\"The Queensland Government taking powers off farmers, taking their rights off them to be able to manage their own land, put in fire breaks, do cool burns, and that has exposed us to much much higher risk than we should,\" he said.</p><p>So, how effective are hazard reduction burns and how are they managed?</p><p>RMIT ABC Fact Check considers the facts.</p><p>What can affect the behaviour of fires?</p><p>Fire behaviour refers to a variety of factors including the manner in which a fire burns, the speed at which it spreads, the amount of heat it gives off and the extent of vegetation it consumes.</p><p>The way a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/fire-and-the-environment/48-fire-behaviour\">fire behaves and its severity</url> is dependent on several elements, but can be narrowed down to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/managing-natural-resources/fire-management/fire-science/fire-behaviour\">three</url> essentials: weather, fuel and topography.</p><p>The volume of fuel, or \"surface fuel\", in a fire's path - such as shrubbery, bark, dry leaves, twigs and so forth - is often the only component of fire behaviour that can be directly modified by people.</p><p>The rate at which organic materials burns is directly related to its moisture content; the drier the fuel, the more fiercely it burns and the more intense the fire.</p><p>The moisture of a particular fuel load depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also the humidity and temperature of its surroundings.</p><p>Eucalyptus forests and grasslands are typically drier fuels that burn hot and fast, while rain forests and irrigated crops burn slower and can potentially slow the pace of a fire.</p><p>What methods are used to reduce fire hazards?</p><p>In a bid to reduce the intensity of unplanned fires, authorities carry out measures to \"treat\" the fuel and reduce the amount that is available to feed a fire.</p><p>\"They are treating fuel to change its structure and to typically reduce the amount of fuel or fuel load,\" Ross Bradstock, as senior professor at Wollongong University's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, told Fact Check.</p><p>This fuel treating process is called hazard reduction.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2898&amp;context=smhpapers\">Hazard reduction methods</url> include the intentional burning of surface fuel loads, but other practical and \"mechanical\" methods are also deployed.</p><p>The latter include activities such as \"thinning\" bushland (by cutting down trees), clearing, slashing or mulching ground litter, ploughing fields, cleaning guttering on houses and other buildings, and through fire-resistant garden design and maintenance.</p><p>Hazard reduction burns</p><p>Bushfire management is divided into two categories: firefighting and fire prevention.</p><p>Planned and purposeful burning of excess ground litter and fuel hazards in a specific area is known by many names - a \"hazard reduction burn\", \"controlled burn\" or \"prescribed burning\" to name a few.</p><p>These types of burns are widely used in fire prevention and are carried out in winter or generally outside the fire season when conditions are less volatile.</p><p>They require careful consideration and planning to achieve maximum results and to minimise potential dangers to health and wildlife, and to avoid causing accidental bushfires.</p><p>Prescribed burns should not be confused with \"back burning\", a fire-fighting tool.</p><p>As explained by bushfire expert and University of Tasmania professor David Bowman in <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605\">The Conversation</url>, back burning is \"a last-resort measure\" to stop a progressing bushfire from spreading to specific areas.</p><p>\"The difference between fuel-reduction burning and back burning is effectively the same as the difference between elective and emergency surgery,\" Bowman wrote.</p><p>\"Back burning ... works by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/back-burning-fighting-fire-with-fire/5040272\">setting fires from containment lines</url>, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand.\"</p><p>Who is responsible?</p><p>Bushfire management activities in Australia are conducted by state and territory governments and their relevant statutory authorities such as fire emergency services, including professional and volunteer firefighters, as well as by municipal councils and individual property owners.</p><p>At a federal level, bushfire management is regulated by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/about\">EPBC Act</url>).</p><p>A national policy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/publications/factsheet-bushfire-management-and-national-environment-law\">fact sheet</url> outlines the circumstances where fire prevention activities require federal environmental approval.</p><p>Activities that are not covered by the national law include those approved or authorised under federal or state/territory laws before July 2000 (when the legislation took effect), as well as continued lawful land uses of the sort that were occurring before July 2000 (such as maintaining access to existing tracks and fire breaks, roadside weed control, and routine controlled burns of the type that occurred in the past).</p><p>Activities that require ministerial approval, according to the act, are those affecting nationally threatened species and their habitats, as well as Commonwealth land.</p><p>These include, for example, the construction of substantial new fire breaks, access roads or tracks on a significant scale in habitat for national threatened species; one-off fuel burns in remnant forest that is important habitat for nationally threatened species and had not been subject previously to a burning regime; and, proposed new burning regimes in world heritage sites among others.</p><p>Queensland framework and operation</p><p>Fact Check contacted the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services for information about the legal framework, as well as the processes and procedures, governing prescribed burning in that state.</p><p>Numerous agencies and government departments are responsible for planning, overseeing and conducting hazard reduction on both state-managed and private land.</p><p>Queensland fire management groups, including volunteer fire brigades, also participate in the yearly operation <url normalizedValue=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2019/4/9/operation-cool-burn-blazes-across-the-state-in-preparation-for-bushfire-season\">Cool Burn</url> - a hazard reduction coordinating effort organised by QFES which generally operates from April 1 to August 31.</p><p>The goal of Cool Burn is to put in place a plan for hazard reduction and other mitigating activities across the landscape with a focus on protecting the community, and public and privately owned assets, as well as identifying areas at high risk of a fire, such as enclosed townships.</p><p>QFES Superintendent James Haig told Fact Check that authorisation under Queensland's Fire and Emergencies Act was necessary to conduct hazard reduction burns on private and state-managed lands. This would take the form of either a notification (in cases such as burning assignments for the sugarcane industry), or as a permit obtained from local fire wardens.</p><p>\"We have a large number of fire wardens, many of whom are volunteers, so they come from the community and they are aware of the local conditions,\" Mr Haig said.</p><p>According to QFES records, approximately 28,000 permits a year were issued for controlled fires since 2015.</p><p>\"In 2019, QFES and its partners completed 229 priority mitigation activities to reduce bushfire risk at high-risk sites,\" it said in a statement sent to Fact Check.</p><p>\"This includes 108 of 175 planned hazard reduction burns, 83 targeted education activities and 38 fire line upgrades.\"</p><p>However, such activities were \"highly dependent\" on weather conditions, it added, with not all planned 2019 burns able to be completed.</p><p>\"In some areas, it rapidly became too dry to burn safely,\" the QFES statement continued.</p><p>\"In other areas, it was too wet too early on and dried out rapidly, leaving a short window of opportunity to safely conduct mitigation activities.\"</p><p>Mr Haig elaborated: \"The most common reason for a permit not being granted would be because the local conditions were too dry; that it was difficult to conduct safely and with the appropriate outcome.\"</p><p>He added that if moisture levels in the soil were too low, then farmers (especially graziers) often would want to hold onto the grass they had, so there were fewer applications for fire permits.</p><p>Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages primarily native forests and state-owned land, is exempt from obtaining a \"permit to light fire\".</p><p>It has its own procedures and burn targets, and collaborates with the QFES on initiatives such as operation Cool Burn.</p><p>\"From 1 January [2019] to date, QPWS conducted 291 planned burns over 1,443,882 hectares - which is the largest area covered in the last six years,\" a statement provided to Fact Check said.</p><p>\"QPWS's annual target for Protection Zones burns is 90 per cent (14,884 hectares). In 2018-19, QPWS achieved 118 per cent of this target.\"</p><p>NSW framework and operation</p><p>In NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with the NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, Forestry Corporation and Sydney Catchment Authority to carry out hazard reduction burns and other hazard reduction activities such as mowing and building firebreaks.</p><p>According to the NSW Department of Environment, hazard reduction efforts in NSW have increased under the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/parks-reserves-and-protected-areas/fire/managing-fire/bushfire-management-program\">Enhanced Bushfire Management Program</url> (EBMP), which came into effect in 2011.</p><p>The statewide program began with a five-year commitment to treat 135,000 hectares of bushland (on average) each year. In 2017, the NSW Government extended the program to 2022.</p><p>The NSW<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/conservation-programs/hazard-reduction-program\">National Parks and Wildlife Service</url> operates under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/~/view/act/1997/65/\">Rural Fires Act 1997</url> and under the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1974/80/\">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974</url>.</p><p>Over the last eight years, according to its website, the NPWS carried out hazard reduction burns in NSW parks and reserves covering more than 680,000 hectares - more than double that of the previous five-year period.</p><p>\"NPWS has undertaken 80 per cent of the total hazard reduction burning effort recorded in NSW, despite managing less than 9 per cent of the state,\" its website states.</p><p>Conducting planned burns</p><p>The University of Wollongong's Professor Bradstock, who also heads the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub, told Fact Check: \"In Australia, typically we do a lot of prescribed burning, perhaps more so than many other countries, but we are doing it with the intention of reducing the intensity of subsequent wildfires - unplanned fires - to a level where they are potentially controllable using suppression forces.\"</p><p>The threshold of safe and effective fire suppression is calculated by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, which Fact Check <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/fact-check-did-high-fire-danger-indices-come-earlier-this-year/11506082\">has looked at previously.</url></p><p>Using measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions, combined with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319164959_Using_alternative_soil_moisture_estimates_in_the_McArthur_Forest_Fire_Danger_Index#pf2\">formula</url> to account for the effect of drought, the meter creates the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).</p><p>An index of 1 means that a fire will not burn, or will burn so slowly that control presents little difficulty, while anything above 100 is considered a catastrophic rating (\"code red\" in Victoria).</p><p>However, Professor Bradstock noted that the McArthur Meter and the FFDI were developed empirically through observations of small fires burning under mild conditions in the 1960s, and did not necessarily perform well in the extreme fire conditions prevailing in the current NSW bushfires.</p><p>\"[W]e know that the McArthur FFD models underpredict the rate of spread and intensity under high forest fire danger index conditions; in other words, they don't fully capture all the things that are going on when it's really hot, really windy and the humidity is very low,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Fire behaviour under extreme and catastrophic conditions</p><p>Experts emphasised that in extreme and catastrophic fire conditions, the surface fuel available for burning makes next to no difference to the level of a fire's intensity.</p><p>University of Melbourne associate professor Trent Penman, who studies bushfire behaviour,told Fact Check: \"Prescribed burning effectiveness decreases with [increasing] FFDI; when you exceed an FFDI of about 50, you switch from fuel-dominated to a weather-dominated fire.</p><p>\"At this point, while fuel has a small effect, it is overwhelmed by the weather.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock agreed, pointing to the example of Victoria's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/black-saturday-bushfires\">Black Saturday</url> bushfires in 2009 that claimed the lives of 173 people.</p><p>His team <url normalizedValue=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/smhpapers/138/\">studied</url> the aftermath of the fires which were associated with an FFDI of well above 100.</p><p>They found that even in the areas where fuel had been treated with planned burns less than five years prior, there was no measurable effect on the intensity of the fires.</p><p>\"At a level where we would have expected the fire intensity to be reduced to suppressible levels, we essentially found no effect,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"It's almost like a turbo-charging effect, when you have such incredibly high temperatures and very high winds that you only need a negligible amount of fuel to produce a fire intensity that is not suppressible.\"</p><p>The University of Tasmania's Professor Bowman said that in catastrophic conditions, such as those prevailing in the current Queensland and NSW bushfires, all \"organic matter is going to burn\".</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour.\"</p><p>Professor Bowman described embers rushing ahead of the fire front, passing over cleared areas to find available fuel like a \"heat gun blasting sparks at incredibly high speed\".</p><p>\"It's a wind-driven phenomenon,\" he said.</p><p>\"[E]ven if you can treat everything at a maximum level, it's still not going to give you the benefit under catastrophic fire weather conditions.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock likened the effect of prescribed burns on fire intensity to a sliding scale.</p><p>\"The window of effectiveness essentially narrows down to a point where it essentially disappears,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>Some vegetation types cannot be treated with prescribed burning</p><p>Experts also explained that some fuel types, particularly wet forest vegetation, were not treatable in the cooler months of the year, when prescribed burns can be safely carried out.</p><p>\"Some fuel types are simply not dry enough to burn in the time, when it is safe to do so,\" Professor Penman said. \"These include rainforests and wet forests.\"</p><p>He gave the example of a campfire: \"[I]f you put green leaves on it to get it started; they won't work. There's too much moisture there to get the fire started. You can put green leaves on, once the fire is going and they'll burn, but if the fuel is too wet, the fire won't start in the first place.\"</p><p>However, these vegetation types would still burn under catastrophic conditions.</p><p>As Professor Bradstock explained, parts of the Victorian and NSW landscapes, such as the wet forests or alpine areas, were not treatable under normal conditions.</p><p>\"It's a waste of time because they are usually too wet to burn.</p><p>\"Because things are so critically dry at the moment, what typically would never burn, well, now it is burning,\" he said.</p><p>And Professor Bowman agreed that different fuel types affected fire intensity differently, but in catastrophic conditions, \"the variability and fuel load becomes irrelevant\".</p><p>How effective are prescribed burns?</p><p>A plethora of scientific papers describe hazard reduction burns as the easiest and most effective tool of bushfire management - more effective than slashing, weeding, herbicide use and so forth.</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check this was because of its wide reach and comparatively low cost.</p><p>\"You can treat [through burning] relatively large areas with costs around $100 a hectare in terms of operational costs; so you might be able to burn out 2000 hectares in a day or two, relatively cheaply,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you were to go in there and try and mechanically treat that, you wouldn't be able to do it.\"</p><p>Burning has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815213002326\">found</url> to be even more effective in areas adjacent to houses or within a so-called Bushland Urban Interface Zone, also known as the wildland-urban interface, despite the higher cost, which can range from $1000 to $10,000 per hectare.</p><p>\"[E]ven then, it's still probably cheaper than mechanical work,\" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check.</p><p>A 2018 research <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF18192\">article</url> published by the CSIRO indicated that \"intensifying prescribed burning treatments in public land in the [wild-urban interface] achieves a greater reduction in damages compared with applying the majority of the treatments in rural areas.</p><p>\"However, prescribed burning in the WUI is significantly more expensive and, despite additional benefits gained from this strategy, in most cases it is not the most economically efficient strategy.\"</p><p>But research has also found that prescribed burning as a bushfire management tool is not a panacea.</p><p>A 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jbi.12579\">research paper</url> exploring variations in the effectiveness of prescribed burns in south-eastern Australia found that the inconsistency was due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes.</p><p>\"Prescribed burning solutions that are effective in one particular region may not be effective elsewhere unless there is strong similarity in vegetation types, fire weather, fuel accumulation and ignition rates.</p><p>\"The most efficient use of prescribed fire is applying it to the immediate proximity of assets, where a resultant reduction in fire intensity can be of immediate benefit in terms of impacts on structures and ease of suppression.\"</p><p>As an example of the futility of some prescribed burns, Dr Penman pointed to the forest around Port Macquarie in northern NSW, which has been widely studied and found to have fuel vegetation that regenerates every three to five years.</p><p>\"Any burn you undertake in those areas has a longevity of about three to five years,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to be burning a huge amount before you are actually reducing the risk at all.\"</p><p>In other areas where fuels accumulated more slowly, planned burns had a greater impact, he added.</p><p>\"But it's never going to stop wildfires.\"</p><p>What does the future of bushfire management look like?</p><p>Professor Bradstock told Fact Check that scientists and agencies with more advanced and up-to-date modeling capabilities would need to better choose treatment areas with maximum cost effectiveness.</p><p>\"We are going to have to get smarter about it,\" he told Fact Check.</p><p>\"We are going to learn a lot from the current fire season.</p><p>\"I know, anecdotally, there has been major property damage done in NSW in areas that have been recently treated.\"</p><p>Professor Penman told Fact Check that \"chasing the hectares\" in prescribed-burn targets was misguided.</p><p>Rather, states and statutory authorities were using a combination of hectares treated and risk approach in their bushfire management.</p><p>\"What you're really trying to achieve is [to] reduce the risk to assets that you have of value in the landscape, so that might be ecological assets like at-risk forest types. It may be around cultural sites, and it might be Indigenous or European sites and then other things like power lines, water supply catchments, and then, of course, around houses,\" he said.</p><p>\"[N]one of the agencies just invest entirely in prescribed burning or something else. They have a mixture of what they do.</p><p>\"It should never be a debate about, 'Does one thing do everything for us', because everybody knows that's not the case. It's about getting that balance right, across the different approaches.</p><p>\"So it's quite a challenging landscape to be working in, and you put that in the context of a changing climate and it becomes even harder.\"</p><p>Barnaby Joyce elaborates</p><p>When invited to expand on his media statements regarding prescribed burns and bushfire preparation, Nationals MP Mr Joyce <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/fires-joyce-response/11817930\">sent Fact Check a list of grievances</url> which focused on higher burn targets, a lack of dams and the imposition of bushfire permits, and pointed to a number of policies that in his view needed to be amended to allow better bushfire management.</p><p>These included the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and land clearing laws (including the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the Local Land Services Act 2013 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.</p><p>Mr Joyce nominated the former, saying \"the annual targets need to be dramatically increased\" to allow for more hazard reduction burns.</p><p>He also pointed to the fact that Australia's National Parks and areas within state forests did not permit grazing, which \"obviously affects fuel loads\".</p><p>And he suggested that fire permit requirements (for firebreak provisions and mandatory monitoring throughout a burn), as well as the penalties for non-compliance, were stopping some farmers from conducting these all-important activities.</p><p>However, the bushfire experts Fact Check spoke to dismissed Mr Joyce's claims, saying they failed to address key issues.</p><p>They countered that reasonable safeguards ensuring landholders and neighbours were kept safe during prescribed burns were an important component of current fire management practices.</p><p>\"There is a deliberate misinterpretation of the ecological thresholds and there is still the inherent assumption that a fuel reduction burn will reduce wildfires,\" said Melbourne University's Professor Penman.</p><p>Professor Bradstock said: \"Prescribed burning is constrained by budgets, resources and weather conditions. Pretty simple really: essentially, what we pay for is what we get.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Principal researcher: Christina Arampatzi</emphasis></p><p><url

I've read, for example, every single \"Kmart hack\" story despite not visiting a store in over a decade. And I'm hate-clicking on every gender reveal write-up, from the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/pregnancy/prepare-for-baby/baby-showers/move-over-cupcakes-gender-reveal-lasagna-is-now-a-thing-20190122-h1adgd\">tie-dyed lasagnes</url> to the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/pregnancy/prepare-for-baby/expectant-parents-fined-306000-after-massive-gender-reveal-party-fail-20181002-h165mw\">gender reveal forest fire</url>, because, evidently, I have neither dignity nor willpower.And whenever a bride-from-hell-story presents itself, I'm there for it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite having zero interest in weddings or wedding culture I'm powerless to the pull of finding out just how unreasonably she acted in the lead up to her Special Day.</p><p>Why? Where does the pleasure come from?</p><p>Most obviously there's the same joys that are mined from any what-in-the-weird news item. The vegan bride-to-be who uninvited her \"murderous\" relatives, or the one with different dress codes for differently girthed guests are, simply, objectively funny stories.</p><p>I'll laugh just as I did at the parents who circulated a list of acceptable birthday presents for their toddler or at the white woman who darkened her skin and now thinks she'll have a \"milk chocolate\" baby. People can be awful and the more awful they are the more hilarious.</p><p>Laughter also comes from these stories complying with the worst stereotype of brides: the woman who feels that the world revolves solely around her and her princess-for-a-day soiree. The entitlement, the melodrama, the exquisite treachery of her nearest-and-dearest leaking the story all make for a hilarious read.</p><p>And, just quietly, her shenanigans can help us feel less wretched about our own high-maintenance: my skincare regime might have 97 steps but, hey, at least I'm not secretly slipping fattening mickeys into my bridesmaids smoothies.</p><p>But is that all that's going on? Surely the pleasures of devouring these diabolical divas is worth unpacking a little.</p><p>It wasn't mere chance that I opened this article by flagging my lack of interest in wedding culture. I do find all of it ??? from the poofy dresses to the dress-a-like lady slaves to the seating charts and the gift registries ??? to be ridiculous. It's easy to pin my opposition largely on politics; the feminist in me has never liked the institution of marriage. But it's more than this. I'm going to admit here to some regrettable internalised sexism.</p><p>Culturally, things that are disproportionately enjoyed by women are frowned upon. From boy bands to chick lit, from women's magazines to reality television, there's a tendency ???and I'm unquestionably guilty of it ??? of often dismissing things women like. When we think of high culture, or even just celebrated culture, almost never do the passions of women make the list. I wholeheartedly believe that reality TV is garbage.</p><p>And boy bands will undoubtedly be the soundtrack to my kidnapping. But I admit to occasionally wondering about whether a culture that couples the frivolous with the female is to blame for thwarting my ability to just enjoy an episode of Married at First Sight or Masterchef and not hurl a brick through the screen.</p><p>It's no accident that the much-maligned Bridezilla figure is not just a woman, but one who's wholeheartedly partaking of the dress-up, coiffed-hair, centre-of-attention femininity extravaganza. And I have to ask myself, am I laughing at her not only because I think of her demands as outrageous, but because I actually have no respect for the malarkey she's chosen to become obsessed with.</p><p>Gender is also at play here given that these Bridezilla stories are playing out in a space notoriously hostile to women. Viral Bridezilla stories, after all, are an Internet age phenomena: not only rapidly circulated but with the inevitable ensuing feeding frenzy across social media.</p><p>Assuming that the tales are real, underneath all the mockery and the memes is a living, breathing woman who's being recreationally shredded.</p><p>No, she's not a particularly sympathetic figure, and her demands that guests put aside two-weeks vacation for a destination-to-be-determined palaver don't quite frame her as a victim. But it's interesting that in a society so worried about schoolyard bullying and so conscious of the different ways we shame one another, that we let ourselves off the hook for partaking of similar mean-spirited behaviour towards these b(r)atty brides.</p><p>I'm not woke enough to resist clicking on tomorrow's bride-gone-bonkers story. And I probably won't embrace the idea of marriage anytime soon. Instead, I'll do my bit for gender equality and ask the universe to even things out with some stories of nutty grooms. Surely they're out there, freaking out about boutonni??re and bonbonniere, just salivating for my cackle and scorn.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lauren Rosewarne is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Melbourne and author of nine books about gender, media and popular culture.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520090978</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V92-9BF1-JBJ7-N3F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><timeReceived>06:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That's a new Victorian high temperature record for September,\" she said.</p><p>Ms Imielska said that both Victoria and New South Wales saw temperatures that were 16C above the September average.</p><p>\"It's very significant for September specifically. More than 70 per cent of New South Wales broke their September temperature record,\" she said.</p><p>It was not just the high numbers but the spread of the heat that was noteworthy.</p><p>\"Most of Australia, with the exception of western WA, was experiencing above-average temperatures during these warm conditions.\"</p><p>Fire danger</p><p>With dry conditions and high winds on top of all this heat, the Forest Fire Index was above-average for most of Australia for this event.</p><p>\"We've been seeing very dry conditions, dry soils, all of those factors really exacerbating the bushfire risk,\" Ms Imielska said.</p><p>The high fire danger has not just been for the few days of this heat event.</p><p>\"Bushfire season has started early this year, especially if we compare it to this time last year, when there were areas of New South Wales that were experiencing flooding in September.\"</p><p>So what made this time a record breaker?</p><p>On September 20, a high settled over the east of Australia drawing warm dry air down across the continent.</p><p>It was followed by series of board troughs, fronts and low pressure systems, further drawing hot dry air in front of them.</p><p>But anyone who is into their nightly weather will know that highs and fronts crossing Australia are a frequent occurrence.</p><p>Ms Imielska explained that rather than bringing a normal, widespread cool change after they went through, these brought more warm air.</p><p>\"These changes didn't bring the significantly cool conditions after the initial change went through,\" she said.</p><p>\"So with the next cold front, with conditions being warmer already, we had another wave of those warmer air temperatures.</p><p>\"Of course, climate change is another factor here.</p><p>\"We have been experiencing a warming trend and we continue to set new records and experience these warmer temperatures.</p><p>\"So [because of] a combination of the natural variability factors and background warming, definitely this season it is important to be aware of heat.\"</p><p>What about the rest of the year?</p><p>Ms Imielska said with dry soils and dry conditions, the landscape is primed to exacerbate any hot conditions.</p><p>\"We have already seen some warm temperatures and on the forecast there are some warm temperatures coming through this weekend as well,\" she said.</p><p>Heatwaves may not be as exciting as floods or fires, but Ms Imielska warned of the simple dangers of extreme heat.</p><p>\"Heat is the biggest killer of any weather related hazard,\" she said</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Their share of global greenhouse gases is less than 0.2 per cent, or about a eighth of Australia's.</p><p>Still, on a per-capita basis, both nations have among the highest emissions in the world, Mr Shaw said.</p><p>Tally up the 90-odd nations contributing less than 1 per cent of emissions and you reach almost a third of the global total - larger than China or the US, he says.</p><p>\"An issue like this is something the whole world has to grapple with,\" Todd Muller, Mr Shaw's counterpart from the National Party, says.</p><p>To remove the politics from the negotiations, all sides agreed to take advice on New Zealand's targets from an independent climate commission.</p><p>\"If you have essentially your best and your brightest informed by science ... it's an easier place to have a conversation with your community than just playing partisan politics with them,\" Mr Muller said.</p><p>Mr Shaw said the Opposition could have exploited a potentially divisive policy - agriculture contributes half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions - but didn't.</p><p>\"They are playing an absolute straight bat,\" he said. </p><p>New Zealanders, like Australians, have endured an increasing spate of extreme weather events. These include a record hot year in 2016, droughts and a major forest fire last year.</p><p>\"We've definitely had a lot more extreme rainfall events,\" Nava Fedaeff, a climate scientist with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), said. </p><p>Farmers, who have in the past objected fiercely to taxes on methane, appear more ready to accept the need to act. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/Organisations-1/11259_DairyNZ_Redacted.pdf\">DairyNZ, for instance, has welcomed the prospect</url> of emissions targets enshrined in legislation to give the sector \"much needed certainty\".</p><p>Trish Rankin, a dairy farmer managing 440 cows for a Maori-owned co-operative near Hawera in the Taranaki region of the North Island, said climate action \"needs to be apolitical - it needs to be able to last over time\".</p><p>Ms Rankin said New Zealand farmers realise their social licence depends on them being good custodians of the land, and the principle extends to curbing emissions. Open consultations with experts have also helped.</p><p>\"If you know they are listening to you, you're more likely to listen to them,\" she said.</p><p>Mr Shaw said one reason for the different response is that farmers - unlike Australian coal companies - have options.</p><p>\"People are still going to want to eat in 30 years' time, so the question is what do you produce and how do you produce it - not whether or not you're going to produce food,\" he said. \"But in 30 years' time, you can pretty much guarantee no one in the world is going to use coal for anything.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520064630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGD-7T61-DY19-C15B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The entrance to Stanley was closed for about an hour while the Smithton SES lifted the vehicle allowing the road to re- open. The bus driver and male truck driver were uninjured. Stanley Road House owner Brad Abblitt heard ``the screech of tyres and a two bangs\" and thought the worse. ``Every day I think: `Will this be the day there is a serious accident?\" he said. Mr Abblitt believes a roundabout is the only option to improve the safety of the large number of tourists, locals and industries that use the road daily. He has the support of the Circular Head Council, which also supports a roundabout. Mayor Daryl Quilliam said the council had always believed a roundabout would be the safest improvement and had been ``fighting for that for about three years\". A DIER spokesman confirmed there were funds reserved for the upgrade as part of the State Government's $90 million community roads program. He said designs for the project were being decided, following further discussions with key stakeholders and more are planned with the council, but a roundabout does not appear to be the best option. Police, Ambulance Tasmania, Forest fire brigade and Smithton SES all attended the accident.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVOCE-622goaqeo7s9jmbgoio</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVOCE2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:545T-HSK1-F0N8-R3K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386051</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advocate (Burnie)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>November 1, 2011 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Transport/Road Transport/Safety</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001745</classCode><className>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001765</classCode><className>TRUCK SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001745</classCode><className>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001765</classCode><className>TRUCK SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001764</classCode><className>TRUCK DRIVERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
