In the years since cultural burning had been used, the landscape had become degraded and \"sick\". The region, which includes the towns of Daylesford, Bendigo and Boort, used to be cloaked in box-ironbark forests and woodlands but is now one of the most profoundly altered landscapes in Victoria, where agriculture, urban settlement and mining have left ecosystems fragmented.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nelson learnt cultural burning - known as djandak wii or \"country fire\" - from his father, who learnt from his father before him and other elders. \"We don't make it really, really hot, we burn cool. It's a lot slower than planned burns.\"</p><p>In the wake of last summer's catastrophic bushfires, there is heightened national interest in the role of Aboriginal cultural burning, sometimes called traditional burning. What is it, and how does it work? And can it reduce the threat of out-of-control fires in an era of climate change?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this article contains the images and names of people who have passed away.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: </emphasis>A burn on Gunbower Island in May 2018. Source: DELWP, Victoria</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is cultural burning?</emphasis></p><p>For at least 65,000 years, Aborigines have used cultural land-management practices - including fire - to care for country (the term used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to describe family origins, ownership and associations with particular areas of Australia).</p><p>Cultural burns are done by Indigenous custodians, or people given their permission and guidance. The use of fire is specific to each location, its animals and flora and their totemic and cultural value.</p><p>There are many interconnected objectives, which include protecting cultural or natural assets by maintaining the health of surrounding country, ceremony, habitat protection and fuel reduction. But fuel reduction - targeted burning to reduce the amount or density of foliage - is often not the primary objective.</p><p>Indigenous land management was critical to preventing catastrophic bushfires, the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements was told in 2020, but Aboriginal voices had been ignored. \"Cultural land management is not an add-on or an enhancement, it's not a practice that can simply be grafted onto the regime of non-Indigenous land managers,\" Euahlayi man and Australian National University researcher Bhiamie Eckford-Williamson told the commission.</p><p>He also said that short-term funding was a barrier to Aboriginal land management. \"It is not possible for groups to develop, to recruit, train and retain staff to maintain that corporate memory, to build relationships with non-Indigenous land-management agencies over time, if their funding is not secure,\" he explained.</p><p>Most Australian wildfires occur in the northern tropical savanna, and most cultural burning also occurs in northern Australia - about 70 per cent of projects occur in the Northern Territory, Queensland or Western Australia, <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>according to the CSIRO</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><p>In Western Australia, for example, the Great Western Woodlands, 16 million hectares of temperate woodland, heathland and mallee, are cared for in part by the <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Ngadju Nation and the Ngadju Rangers Group</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. The Ngadju undertake cultural burns at a certain time \u2014 when the grass is green, or a few days afterrain, or when rain is coming. In the warmer seasons, the fire must be started in the morning before the sea breezes rise.</p><p>In early colonial artwork, letters and journals, there is considerable historical evidence of Aboriginal use of fire. In 1836, naturalist Charles Darwin visited Sydney and commented on the sparsity of the trees and the prevalence of grasslands, much of which is now thick scrub. \"The extreme uniformity in the character of the Vegetation, is the most remarkable feature in the landscape of the greater part of New S. Wales. Everywhere we have open woodland, the ground being partially covered with a most thin pasture,\" he wrote.</p><p>The use of \"prescribed\" or \"hazard-reduction burning\" is the process of applying fire to a predetermined area to achieve a desired outcome - usually the mitigation of the presence or severity of bushfires.</p><p>While there are some crossovers between the two practices, cultural burning may also be used to clear important pathways or manage vegetation around significant sites. But where fire is a concern, it may be possible to use cultural burning where prescribed burning is unsafe - because of the warming climate, it is becoming more challenging for land-management agencies to find periods of time when prescribed burns can be safely lit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How does cultural burning work?</emphasis></p><p>Most cultural burns use \"cool\" fires - smaller, low-intensity fires - which reduce the risk of extreme, high flames that can burn whole trees and forest canopies. Protecting the canopy is considered paramount in cultural burning because it holds many precious resources - insects, birds' nests, bats and shade. And canopy removal fundamentally alters the surrounding ecosystem - sunlight breaks through and dries out the soil. Unlike hazard-reduction burns, where lines of fire can create walls of flame, cultural burning tends to use spot ignitions, creating a mosaic of fires. This leaves space for wildlife to escape.</p><p>Oliver Costello, a Bundjalung man from the Northern Rivers region of NSW and chief executive of the Firesticks Alliance, says cultural fire may not be about fuel reduction. He gives the example of a burn near Guyra in NSW where Banbai rangers used cultural burning around an art site that contained a painting of an echidna, a Banbai totem.</p><p>The fire encouraged the growth of native grasses and reduced the density of vegetation so that echidnas could move around the area more easily and find food. Rangers saw more evidence of echidnas after burning and more growth of a local endangered species, the black grevillea.</p><p>\"The country has a culture and we're a part of that culture. When you apply the right fire to that culture, you're maintaining your identity with country, maintaining the land,\" Costello says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: </emphasis>A small area of fire in a cultural burn on Gunbower Island, May 2018. Source: DELWP, Victoria</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you learn cultural burning?</emphasis></p><p>Despite European colonisation and land theft, Aboriginal cultural lore and knowledge of burning practices remain across Australia. A revival is being led through initiatives such as the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.firesticks.org.au/\">Firesticks Alliance</url>, an Indigenous-led network that does training, on-ground cultural burning and scientific monitoring of its ecological effects.</p><p>Fire knowledge has been handed down through generations of Aboriginal families. Costello learnt from his stepfather, a senior Dalabon man from Arnhem Land, who knew how to use fire the traditional way. When his stepfather died, Costello realised how much knowledge had gone with him. It motivated Costello to go to university and focus on Indigenous knowledge systems and sustainability in an era of climate change. \"In NSW land management, no one was using cultural burning methodology and protocols, and no one was supporting people to burn their country,\" he says.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Firesticks Alliance has organised fire workshops in Cape York with <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Dr Tommy George</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, a Kuku Thaypan elder. George and his brother, Dr George Musgrave, (now both deceased) were granted honorary doctorates for their knowledge of fire management and ecology. Workshops such as those held on the south coast of NSW and on Yorta Yorta country at Barmah on the Murray River draw participants from around the country.</p><p>Firesticks Alliance practitioners burn on private and public land, including in NSW national parks. Since the 2019-20 summer bushfires, the alliance has fielded a huge increase in inquiries from private landholders and public land-management agencies. One landowner in NSW credits cultural burning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/it-s-miraculous-owners-say-cultural-burning-saved-their-property-20200103-p53okc.html\">with saving structures on his remote bush property during the Gospers Mountain fire</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Does cultural burning work? </emphasis></p><p>There is a small but growing body of Western academic research on cultural burning and it chimes with what Aboriginal experts have always known. For example, scientists analysing data on fire-scarred land in northern Australia on behalf of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental organisation, found that early dry-season cultural burning reduced the extent of destructive late-season fires by about 30 per cent compared with the four years before the burning program began.</p><p>In Victoria, traditional owners have also noticed a change. There have been more than a dozen cultural burns on Dja Dja Wurrung country, and Trent Nelson says there has been healthy plant and grass regeneration, including kangaroo grass, a traditional dietary staple, and yam daisy, which is used for fibre.</p><p>Cultural burning is being brought into Victoria's existing burning program, with more planned in addition to \"fuel management\" burning done by Forest Fire Management Victoria. They will be conducted in areas nominated by traditional owners, who will lead the burns.</p><p>The CSIRO has <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>published a number of papers</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> that find cultural burning delivers a range of social and economic benefits for Aboriginal people, including the protection of heritage, the retention of language and identity and career development opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it help against climate-fuelled bushfires? </emphasis></p><p>Aboriginal people were devastated to see the damage wrought by last summer's catastrophic bushfires, says Oliver Costello. \"We have this knowledge about land management ... and we're really sad because people haven't been listening to us,\" he says. \"We have been saying this is going to happen: this country is really thick and it will burn.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has argued hazard-reduction burns are at least as important as cutting carbon emissions in Australia's fight against bushfires, although the Climate Council and federal opposition say this is a distraction from the government's lack of action on climate change.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/hazard-reduction-burning-had-little-to-no-effect-in-slowing-this-summers-bushfires\">But analysis from forest scientists at the University of Melbourne</url> found hazard-reduction burns had little to no effect in slowing the severe fires that devastated more than 5 million hectares across NSW. It would be best used around assets to protect them from less intense fires, the research found.</p><p>Former Victorian emergency management commissioner Craig Lapsley describes cultural burning as a \"holistic land-management strategy\" and says last summer's bushfires showed that land-management agencies need to test new approaches.</p><p>\"I don't think we valued Indigenous people, and what they believed as a long-term well-tested strategy, I don't think we have taken that seriously at all,\" says Lapsley.</p><p>Costello wants land-management agencies to support the Firesticks Alliance to develop a national mentoring program so there can be 100 skilled cultural fire practitioners nationwide. \"We are drawing on the oldest, living knowledge system around fire and it works for us,\" he says. \"But you also need to share some of the resources and power you have.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above:</emphasis> Lighting small fires as part of a burn on Gunbower Island in 2018.

It burnt gently through grasslands and connected up with other fires lit on the forest floor to create a mosaic effect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This fire was lit by Dja Dja Wurrung people, including employees of Forest Fire Management Victoria, and their non-Aboriginal colleagues. It was the first cultural burn in the area in 170 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a momentous day, says Trent Nelson, the chairperson of the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation. In the years since cultural burning had been used, the landscape had become degraded and \"sick\". The region, which includes the towns of Daylesford, Bendigo and Boort, used to be cloaked in box-ironbark forests and woodlands but is now one of the most profoundly altered landscapes in Victoria, where agriculture, urban settlement and mining have left ecosystems fragmented.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nelson learnt cultural burning - known as djandak wii or \"country fire\" - from his father, who learnt from his father before him and other elders. \"We don't make it really, really hot, we burn cool. It's a lot slower than planned burns.\"</p><p>In the wake of last summer's catastrophic bushfires, there is heightened national interest in the role of Aboriginal cultural burning, sometimes called traditional burning. What is it, and how does it work? And can it reduce the threat of out-of-control fires in an era of climate change?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this article contains the images and names of people who have passed away.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: </emphasis>A burn on Gunbower Island in May 2018. Source: DELWP, Victoria</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is cultural burning?</emphasis></p><p>For at least 65,000 years, Aborigines have used cultural land-management practices - including fire - to care for country (the term used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to describe family origins, ownership and associations with particular areas of Australia).</p><p>Cultural burns are done by Indigenous custodians, or people given their permission and guidance. The use of fire is specific to each location, its animals and flora and their totemic and cultural value.</p><p>There are many interconnected objectives, which include protecting cultural or natural assets by maintaining the health of surrounding country, ceremony, habitat protection and fuel reduction. But fuel reduction - targeted burning to reduce the amount or density of foliage - is often not the primary objective.</p><p>Indigenous land management was critical to preventing catastrophic bushfires, the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements was told in 2020, but Aboriginal voices had been ignored. \"Cultural land management is not an add-on or an enhancement, it's not a practice that can simply be grafted onto the regime of non-Indigenous land managers,\" Euahlayi man and Australian National University researcher Bhiamie Eckford-Williamson told the commission.</p><p>He also said that short-term funding was a barrier to Aboriginal land management. \"It is not possible for groups to develop, to recruit, train and retain staff to maintain that corporate memory, to build relationships with non-Indigenous land-management agencies over time, if their funding is not secure,\" he explained.</p><p>Most Australian wildfires occur in the northern tropical savanna, and most cultural burning also occurs in northern Australia - about 70 per cent of projects occur in the Northern Territory, Queensland or Western Australia, <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>according to the CSIRO</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><p>In Western Australia, for example, the Great Western Woodlands, 16 million hectares of temperate woodland, heathland and mallee, are cared for in part by the <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Ngadju Nation and the Ngadju Rangers Group</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. The Ngadju undertake cultural burns at a certain time \u2014 when the grass is green, or a few days afterrain, or when rain is coming. In the warmer seasons, the fire must be started in the morning before the sea breezes rise.</p><p>In early colonial artwork, letters and journals, there is considerable historical evidence of Aboriginal use of fire. In 1836, naturalist Charles Darwin visited Sydney and commented on the sparsity of the trees and the prevalence of grasslands, much of which is now thick scrub. \"The extreme uniformity in the character of the Vegetation, is the most remarkable feature in the landscape of the greater part of New S. Wales. Everywhere we have open woodland, the ground being partially covered with a most thin pasture,\" he wrote.</p><p>The use of \"prescribed\" or \"hazard-reduction burning\" is the process of applying fire to a predetermined area to achieve a desired outcome - usually the mitigation of the presence or severity of bushfires.</p><p>While there are some crossovers between the two practices, cultural burning may also be used to clear important pathways or manage vegetation around significant sites. But where fire is a concern, it may be possible to use cultural burning where prescribed burning is unsafe - because of the warming climate, it is becoming more challenging for land-management agencies to find periods of time when prescribed burns can be safely lit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How does cultural burning work?</emphasis></p><p>Most cultural burns use \"cool\" fires - smaller, low-intensity fires - which reduce the risk of extreme, high flames that can burn whole trees and forest canopies. Protecting the canopy is considered paramount in cultural burning because it holds many precious resources - insects, birds' nests, bats and shade. And canopy removal fundamentally alters the surrounding ecosystem - sunlight breaks through and dries out the soil. Unlike hazard-reduction burns, where lines of fire can create walls of flame, cultural burning tends to use spot ignitions, creating a mosaic of fires. This leaves space for wildlife to escape.</p><p>Oliver Costello, a Bundjalung man from the Northern Rivers region of NSW and chief executive of the Firesticks Alliance, says cultural fire may not be about fuel reduction. He gives the example of a burn near Guyra in NSW where Banbai rangers used cultural burning around an art site that contained a painting of an echidna, a Banbai totem.</p><p>The fire encouraged the growth of native grasses and reduced the density of vegetation so that echidnas could move around the area more easily and find food. Rangers saw more evidence of echidnas after burning and more growth of a local endangered species, the black grevillea.</p><p>\"The country has a culture and we're a part of that culture. When you apply the right fire to that culture, you're maintaining your identity with country, maintaining the land,\" Costello says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: </emphasis>A small area of fire in a cultural burn on Gunbower Island, May 2018. Source: DELWP, Victoria</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you learn cultural burning?</emphasis></p><p>Despite European colonisation and land theft, Aboriginal cultural lore and knowledge of burning practices remain across Australia. A revival is being led through initiatives such as the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.firesticks.org.au/\">Firesticks Alliance</url>, an Indigenous-led network that does training, on-ground cultural burning and scientific monitoring of its ecological effects.</p><p>Fire knowledge has been handed down through generations of Aboriginal families. Costello learnt from his stepfather, a senior Dalabon man from Arnhem Land, who knew how to use fire the traditional way. When his stepfather died, Costello realised how much knowledge had gone with him. It motivated Costello to go to university and focus on Indigenous knowledge systems and sustainability in an era of climate change. \"In NSW land management, no one was using cultural burning methodology and protocols, and no one was supporting people to burn their country,\" he says.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Firesticks Alliance has organised fire workshops in Cape York with <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Dr Tommy George</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, a Kuku Thaypan elder. George and his brother, Dr George Musgrave, (now both deceased) were granted honorary doctorates for their knowledge of fire management and ecology. Workshops such as those held on the south coast of NSW and on Yorta Yorta country at Barmah on the Murray River draw participants from around the country.</p><p>Firesticks Alliance practitioners burn on private and public land, including in NSW national parks. Since the 2019-20 summer bushfires, the alliance has fielded a huge increase in inquiries from private landholders and public land-management agencies. One landowner in NSW credits cultural burning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/it-s-miraculous-owners-say-cultural-burning-saved-their-property-20200103-p53okc.html\">with saving structures on his remote bush property during the Gospers Mountain fire</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Does cultural burning work? </emphasis></p><p>There is a small but growing body of Western academic research on cultural burning and it chimes with what Aboriginal experts have always known. For example, scientists analysing data on fire-scarred land in northern Australia on behalf of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental organisation, found that early dry-season cultural burning reduced the extent of destructive late-season fires by about 30 per cent compared with the four years before the burning program began.</p><p>In Victoria, traditional owners have also noticed a change. There have been more than a dozen cultural burns on Dja Dja Wurrung country, and Trent Nelson says there has been healthy plant and grass regeneration, including kangaroo grass, a traditional dietary staple, and yam daisy, which is used for fibre.</p><p>Cultural burning is being brought into Victoria's existing burning program, with more planned in addition to \"fuel management\" burning done by Forest Fire Management Victoria.

The 25-page report looks at how the CRRC has been interacting with local communities and organizations; from organizing multi-cultural events, to establishing a harmonious multi-cultured working environment, CRRC also sets the role it wishes to continue to play into the future.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In being an international partner, CRRC understands the importance of localization and diversification. From front-line operations staff to key management personnel, the fusing of local knowledge and international expertise creates the ideal conditions for cultural exchange, as well as an open and accepting work environment. This has spearheaded recruitment efforts and resulted in around half of all employees being Aboriginal Australians. In addition, with much of the CRRC's operations being situated in rural locations, the company has put in considerable effort to actively encourage employing Australian indigenous peoples and is proud of their increasing role within the organization.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Engaging with our local communities is essential to our success. We respect every employee and provide them with career development opportunities. Committed to creating a diverse and inclusive corporate culture, we respect employees with different backgrounds. Our culture is based on an ethos of open communication and we promote wellbeing through targeted entertainment for our staff.\" Liu Hualong, Chairman of CRRC Corporation Limited.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Creating a diverse ethnic culture is not only about sharing emotional bonds, but also about connecting new friendships within CRRC. The company takes deliberate measures to make actively sharing culture and fascination of modern rail transportation as a part of everyday work, in order to inspire young and talented people to make more friends through a love of photography and trains.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 As a result of being locally-driven, CRRC has shown great care for its role in developing the community. In December 2019, the CRRC held the Australia Rail Transit Photography event to showcase the iconic nature of railways in developing Australia and, joined by Victorian Senator Bruce Atkinson, presented 16 photographers with a range of awards in front of a crowd of over 150 honoured guests. In total, 400 submissions were collected over 3 months, 70% of which came from Australians, and the top 50 were placed on exhibit in Melbourne Town Hall for locals to enjoy the \"enviable visual feast, allowing people to rediscover the beauty of Australian rail transportation\" said Shane Hulbert, Professor and Associate Dean of Photography at RMIT.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 During the competition, a large forest fire broke out in Sydney and in response, Gao Kang - CRRC's Minister of Culture, decided to dedicate funds raised from the selling of artwork to the recovery efforts. These actions are symbolic of a company culture that promotes local identities, supports local causes and develops local communities.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Cooperation with local talent institutions is also an important part in building effective and longstanding relationships. The CRRC has long been a proponent of giving practical experience to talented individuals and has worked in collaboration with some of Australia's most renowned technical institutions: Melbourne University, Swinburne University and the University of NSW.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Talented electrical and mechatronics engineering students from these institutions have been invited to work on the Special Purpose Vehicle, Evolution Rail, alongside experts from CRRC to give them real technical work experience and future career opportunities. As well as this project, the CRRC looks to local universities for interns and regularly gives study tours to young people interested in engineering.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 For more information, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crrcgc.cc/en\">http://www.crrcgc.cc/en</url>.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 About CRRC<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 CRRC (China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation) is one of the world's largest rail transportation equipment companies, with annual sales revenue of RMB 229.01 billion in 2019.

Unique in many ways, not only is the garden one of the few botanic gardens within a world heritage area, but it is also surrounded by large areas of national park, much of which is prone to bushfire.</p><p>In 2013 a week after starting the job, he had to manage operations as the State Mine fire threatened from the west. But nothing had prepared Greg for what was to come six years on.</p><p>By December 2019, the Gospers Mountain fire - which had started about 50km north of the gardens - had joined four other fires to form the 'mega-blaze' that would become Australia's biggest ever bushfire.</p><p>\"We had already worked closely with the RFS managing the area around the gardens and knew it had been the worst year in history for drought, so everything was incredibly dry,\" said Greg, who is also a member of his local RFS.</p><p>The usually resilient eucalypts were wilting and dry.</p><p>\"We closed the gardens a couple of days before the fire hit,\" said Greg, who also had to fight to save his own house which was heavily impacted.</p><p>\"I came in to the gardens on the morning of December 15 - the day the fire hit - to open it up as an emergency refuge for local residents.\"</p><p>As Greg headed to the garden, his family headed in the opposite direction to the safety of Sydney's suburbs.</p><p>\"Then things got really bad up here. In ended staying fighting the fire for 15 days.\" The inferno itself raged for 46 days.</p><p>\"I never felt like my life was being threatened, but being the manager of the garden I am passionate about conservation and this was my responsibility.</p><p>Of the thousands of hectares burnt in the \"mega-blaze\", the cool-climate gardens lost portions of its unique living collection and more than 90 per cent of the surrounding 186 hectares of conservation area around the garden was also heavily impacted.</p><p>\"We lost over 500 ornamental plants and the Conifer collection, the North American woodland, Gondwana Forest and Darug Walk were heavily impacted,\" said Greg.</p><p>Fortunately, many of the garden's rarest species were spared. Areas such as the Formal Garden, Brunet Meadow, Lady (Nancy) Fairfax Walk, the Dahlia collection, the Liliums and the Explorers' Walk were also saved. The main buildings including the Potager restaurant, The Jungle Lodge and event spaces were undamaged.</p><p>Greg said he knows the word has been used a lot, \"but it really was an unprecedented situation\".</p><p>\"It's taken a long time for me to be comfortable admitting it, but without our intervention much more would have been lost,\" he said.</p><p>\"It really is hard to put a value on the garden's collection, but you could liken losing it it to losing Taronga Zoo and all it's animals or everything in the National Art Gallery. It would be devastating.</p><p>\"The botanic garden here is a NSW asset of the people and is critical to conservation.\"</p><p>Recovery process As Greg was helping save the gardens, the passionate photographer was also documenting the unfolding crisis - and its aftermath - with his digital SLR camera.</p><p>\"I carry my camera everywhere and took photos thoughout the fire and recovery,\" he said.</p><p>Some of Greg's photos are now being shown at a free exhibition called Through the Smoke, Through our Eyes in the gardens until April 27.</p><p>The exhibition showcases 27 pieces of artwork by staff, residents and visitors telling the stories and experiences of those who helped defend the garden from the blaze.</p><p>Some of the images show the new growth that has sprouted up since the bushfires.</p><p>\"It is nice to see the growth. It was such an incredibly intense impact and could still take around 100 years, if at all, for some areas to recover.</p><p>\"While it is a long road, there are areas that are recovering - the bush is resilient. And there's lots of positivity to this too.\"</p><p>Greg has also photographed native animals returning into the gardens. \"In the fires, I photographed a partially burned possum. It was devastating. But recently I saw possums returning. Every time you see the animals coming back it's very moving.\"</p><p>He said the exhibition has also been an important part of his own personal recovery.</p><p>\"I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder after the fire. For me the exposure to the fires again, through the photographs and exhibition, has helped - looking back and talking about it and showing visitors the impact the fires had.\"</p><p>Botanic Gardens Greater Sydney chief executive Denise Ora said the exhibition was a moment of reflection for the Mount Tomah team \"who are not only part of the local community that was hit by Australia's largest forest fire, but also fiercely passionate people who have dedicated their lives to protect our natural environment and the gardens' regrowth\".</p><p>Through the Smoke, Through our Eyes is at the Blue Mountains Botanic Gardens Mount Tomah Visitor Centre until April 27.

At the same time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/22213033/covid-19-mutation-variant-vaccine-uk-south-africa\">new strains</url>, some of which appear to be more infectious than the original one, are threatening to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-55673006\">derail progress</url> in fighting the disease. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One way to capture the effectiveness of our effort to fight the virus is to consider the concept of <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/herd-immunity-why-the-figure-is-always-a-bit-vague-141839\">\"herd immunity\"</url>. During an epidemic, people become infected and those who survive usually become immune. Resistance to the disease can also be reached by vaccination, which complements the levels of natural immunity. Infected people increasingly come into contact with immune people rather than those who are still susceptible. Like a forest fire that runs out of dry wood, at the point of reaching herd immunity, the epidemic stops growing and starts to decline.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/04/covid-model-epidemic-collaboration-experiment\">Mathematical models</url> help us relate herd immunity levels to how fast the disease spreads. The percentage of immune people needed to create herd immunity <url normalizedValue=\"https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccines-and-herd-immunity/\">depends</url> on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52473523\">reproductive number</url>, R, which is a measure of how many people each infected person will infect on average. We can reach herd immunity either by waiting long enough so that large parts of the society pass through infection, by reducing the value of R using social distancing forever, or by vaccinating enough people.</p><p>Letting the epidemic <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/230\">run unchecked</url> threatens to overload the health system and will result in many deaths. Conversely, lockdowns are causing economic, social and mental health issues. So we hope <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/how-will-vaccines-affect-the-length-of-englands-lockdown-152714\">vaccines</url> will stop the epidemic more effectively. </p><p>But how many people will <url normalizedValue=\"https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccines-and-herd-immunity/\">need to be vaccinated</url> to stop the disease spreading? This depends on how infectious the viral strain is, how effective the vaccine is, and how much we are prepared to continue with lockdown measures. The model predictions for the success of the vaccination programmes depend on the vaccine being able to limit the transmission of the virus - not just stop people getting ill. But we still <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-do-the-vaccines-stop-transmission-how-can-i-volunteer-to-help-your-questions-answered-12183087\">don't know</url> if the current batch of approved COVID vaccines stops transmission. </p><p>We could continue with very strict social distancing indefinitely, bringing R below 1 so that the number of new infections decreases. In this case, we would not need any vaccination (point marked A on the graph). But the moment control measures were relaxed, R would jump back above 1 and the epidemic would start to spread again. </p><p>Or we could <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/back-to-normal-by-spring-are-we-expecting-too-much-from-the-first-covid-19-vaccines-149342\">combine some level of lockdown</url> with the roll out of vaccines. In this scenario (point marked B on the graph) we would see a decline in cases once 40% of the population were immune to the virus. However, this strategy relies on keeping R just above 1. The disease would probably come back as soon as further relaxation occurred.</p><p>As we want to return to our activities and freedoms without social distancing, the vaccination levels need to be much higher, taking into account how fast the virus can spread with no additional control. </p><p>A reliable estimate of the rate of spread of the first variant of SARS-CoV-2, during the first stages of the epidemic, is R=3. In other words, every person infected with the coronavirus passes it on to three other people, on average. The corresponding herd immunity level for this value of R is 67%, so assuming a vaccine efficacy of 90%, we need to vaccinate <url normalizedValue=\"https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccines-and-herd-immunity/\">74% of the population</url> (point marked C) to stop the virus from advancing further. </p><p>How does the emergence of the new variants change this value? We do not know for sure how fast the new strains would have spread if allowed to do so without any mitigation measures. The evidence suggests that the UK strain is <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/950823/Variant_of_Concern_VOC_202012_01_Technical_Briefing_3_-_England.pdf\">30-50%</url>, and maybe <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944\">as much as 70%</url>, more infectious than the original one. Choosing the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/12/24/new-coronavirus-strain-is-56-more-infectious-scientists-estimate/\">value of 50%</url>, the needed vaccination levels are pushed up to 86% (point marked D). </p><p>An even higher proportion will need to be immunised if we want to push the virus towards eradication or to guard against a potential underestimation of the rate of spread.</p><p>Can such high levels of protection <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8def3a81-9b80-46a1-9742-f64b80bfc74f\">be attained at all</url>? If a vaccine is only 50-70% effective, as the Oxford and Sinovac vaccines appear to be, this is the highest herd immunity level that can be achieved, if everybody gets the vaccine. Even with the higher efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, vaccinating nearly 90% of the population will be very difficult, as not everybody can or will want to be treated. </p><p>On the positive side, a previous COVID infection still provides <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/past-covid-19-infection-provides-some-immunity-but-people-may-still-carry-and-transmit-virus\">good protection</url> against reinfections and so we can probably count on nearly 20% of the population having natural immunity. </p><p>The herd immunity levels depend on R values and we can, to some extent, manipulate them by lockdowns. If countries can keep R reduced to just above 1, eradication can be achieved even with smaller vaccination levels. But what is really needed is a coherent <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/vaccines-alone-arent-enough-to-eradicate-a-virus-lessons-from-history-152734\">long-term plan</url>: one that includes both quick vaccination roll out and continuing social distancing and testing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adam Kleczkowski has received funding from BBSRC, NSF, Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Scottish Government.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-153025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61SC-GTT1-JB75-93JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><timeReceived>4:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 15, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DP57</classCode><className>DISEASE IMMUNITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

While unable to launch for some time due to the high winds, the firefighting effort on the ground was also assisted by the dispatch of a water bombing aircraft, which refilled with water from Mr McKechnie's dam.</p><p>Mr McKechnie and his wife have lived at their property for about eight years. While their home and working vehicles were not affected by the fire, about half of the land they graze cattle and goats on was burnt and a large machinery shed filled with equipment and hay was lost. None of their animals were harmed by the fire.</p><p>After burning across Mr McKechnie's property the fire jumped Henders Road to Kevin Moneghetti's property, from which he runs a wholesale nursery business, 'Floral Enterprises'.</p><p>Throughout the year the business supplies flowers and shrubs for the City of Ballarat, including the Christmas reindeers. It also supplies begonias for purchase at the Ballarat Begonia Festival.</p><p>While shadecloths were singed and many plants killed due to the extreme heat, Mr Moneghetti was thankful as \"it could have been a lot worse\".</p><p>In the past Mr Moneghetti has volunteered as a firefighter and as such understood what was happening as the fire tore across the landscape towards his property.</p><p>He said it was pretty \"frightening\" with the wind driving the fire straight towards his house as he was only armed with a garden hose.</p><p>\"We consider ourselves very lucky,\" Mr Moneghetti said. \"The firefighters did an excellent job and saved the three homes here.\"</p><p>\"I was driving home from work and I saw the flames along the road and lots of smoke,\" another nearby resident, Rebecca Bell said.</p><p>Worried about the petrol tank in her car exploding, she reversed down the road, just before the flames began to lick across the road.</p><p>\"It just took off, it went straight down past our fence line, and then when the wind changed it came back in a big circle, but amazingly it missed every house.\"</p><p>Ms Bell said her horses remained safe in their stables.</p><p>CFA Commander Anthony Pearce said the fact that a deep seeded burn had not been completely extinguished and was reignited by the high temperature and wind, causing nearby vegetation to ignite, was a reminder of the importance that any planned burns completed prior to the fire season needed to be regularly monitored.</p><p>He said local crews had responded promptly and did a fantastic job in protecting the Allendale and Broomfield communities before support arrived from brigades from the wider region. The fire was classified as contained just after 8pm.</p><p>\"That was predominantly down to the great work of fire crews on the ground,\" Commander Pearce said.</p><p>He said the wind change also arrived at a convenient time to push the fire away from Broomfield, stopping it from spreading.</p><p>Commander Pearce said the fire season was still well and truly active, despite recent rain.</p><p>\"People still need to be vigilant. The rain has by no means been enough to put an end to the fire season. When the next period of hot weather arrives Victoria will again be under threat of fire,\" he said.</p><p>-With Greg Gliddon</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc78z2xatry8i19gvf82gp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y21-YH41-JD34-V4CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 24, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Traffic accident</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CFDI</classCode><className>HORSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001238</classCode><className>OFFICE SUPPLIES &amp; EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N111422MM</classCode><className>FLORICULTURE PRODUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N111400CC</classCode><className>GREENHOUSES, NURSERIES &amp; FLORICULTURE PRODUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001836</classCode><className>WHOLESALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N424930MM</classCode><className>NURSERY WHOLESALERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The number of Level 3 Incident Controllers was below the target number in 2017-18 and 2018-19.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COUNCILS</emphasis> have roles before, during and after bushfires that exceed the resources and funding received through emergency management programs, grants or ratepayer levies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE</emphasis> majority of community members who shared experiences of staying to defend property were well prepared, understood the risks, worked with neighbours and had fall back plans in place for the 2019-20 fire season. Unfortunately, due to the severity and swift moving fires this preparation was not always enough to successfully defend property, however it was sufficient to save lives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THERE</emphasis> is a shortage of level 3 incident controllers, due to the difficulty in achieving accreditation. The amount of training and experience required to be accredited as a Level 3 Incident Controller is high and makes it difficult to sustain appropriate numbers. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DURING </emphasis>the 2019-20 fire season, recommended evacuation and relocation occurred on a scale in Victoria never before seen or experienced, but there remains a degree of confusion in Victoria around 'evacuation' during bushfires - partly because it is rarely mandatory.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISOLATED </emphasis>communities that may be cut off during prolonged fires need to plan for critical infrastructure failure (especially communications and power), food and water supplies and rapid response to immediate needs. </p><p>This could involve planning for the use of community contingency caches - trialled for the first time during these fires - containing emergency supplies including satellite phones, torches, first aid and hygiene essentials, water, food and other equipment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The new strategies will guide bushfire risk reduction on both public and private land across the Grampians, into the future.\"</p><p>I refer to the above extracts that appear to be initiating a new improved model, where feedback from the community is sought, but the link to the page is broken. I would have said that, \"it's the bleeding obvious. Clean up the highways in particular, so that people can evacuate on these major country roads should the need arise. Which quite honestly, under the current and ongoing climate environment, seems rather inevitable\".</p><p>I drove along the Pyrenees Highway today, aghast at the long grass, fallen trees and branches, anyone can see how vulnerable we are. Someone needs to act on it, because no matter how often we are told to be \"fire ready\", how can we rely on the tinder dry and overgrown highways to take us to safety?</p><p>Angie McKew, Ararat</p><p>Climate change, anybody? As Member for Western Victoria Bev MacArthur's talent is wasted at state level politics. She would fit in well at Federal level. Like her Federal Liberal counterparts she perpetuates the lie that green ideology is preventing hazard reduction activities such as prescribed burning off and clearing of the forest floor.</p><p>As she well knows (or should) hazard reduction activities have been exempted from national environmental law, even if they \"have the potential to have a significant impact on nationally protected matters\".</p><p>Also, large amounts of prescribed burning and hazard reduction have gone ahead in Victoria and NSW. Philip Zylstra, from Wollongong University, said: ''the reality is we are at a peak of prescribed burning by state agencies. More has been done in the past decade than in many, many decades.''</p><p>It is not the greenies who have prevented further hazard reduction. The rising temperatures (climate change anyone?), old equipment, shortage of man power and funds (Liberal government cut 35 per cent from the N.S.W. branch of fire and rescue) all mean less burning off can be done.

The new strategies will guide bushfire risk reduction on both public and private land across the Grampians, into the future.\"</p><p>I refer to the above extracts that appear to be initiating a new improved model, where feedback from the community is sought, but the link to the page is broken. I would have said that, \"it's the bleeding obvious. Clean up the highways in particular, so that people can evacuate on these major country roads should the need arise. Which quite honestly, under the current and ongoing climate environment, seems rather inevitable\".</p><p>I drove along the Pyrenees Highway today, aghast at the long grass, fallen trees and branches, anyone can see how vulnerable we are. Someone needs to act on it, because no matter how often we are told to be \"fire ready\", how can we rely on the tinder dry and overgrown highways to take us to safety?</p><p>Angie McKew, Ararat</p><p>Climate change, anybody? As Member for Western Victoria Bev MacArthur's talent is wasted at state level politics. She would fit in well at Federal level. Like her Federal Liberal counterparts she perpetuates the lie that green ideology is preventing hazard reduction activities such as prescribed burning off and clearing of the forest floor.</p><p>As she well knows (or should) hazard reduction activities have been exempted from national environmental law, even if they \"have the potential to have a significant impact on nationally protected matters\".</p><p>Also, large amounts of prescribed burning and hazard reduction have gone ahead in Victoria and NSW. Philip Zylstra, from Wollongong University, said: ''the reality is we are at a peak of prescribed burning by state agencies. More has been done in the past decade than in many, many decades.''</p><p>It is not the greenies who have prevented further hazard reduction. The rising temperatures (climate change anyone?), old equipment, shortage of man power and funds (Liberal government cut 35 per cent from the N.S.W. branch of fire and rescue) all mean less burning off can be done. Furthermore, hazard reduction does not stop 90 per cent of fires and as the weather gets worse, research shows its effectiveness diminishes.</p><p>By playing the blame game, playing politics in a crisis, ignoring the facts that don't suit her (climate change anyone?) and cherry picking the ones that do Bev McArthur demonstrates the qualities needed to succeed at the Federal level.

If from that moment Australia had 100 per cent abated its CO2 emissions and made net zero contribution to anthropogenic CO2 for 30 years, then the cumulative global CO2 actually emitted as of January 2020 would have been delayed to May 2020. Yes, five months difference after 30 years if Australia had uniquely, and instantly, achieved the impossible.</p><p>It is a terrible fire season. There is loss of life, and property, and huge contributions being made by career firefighters and volunteers. Would it perhaps be possible to stop the dribbling of nonsense that in some way Australia's climate policy has had any impact on fire conditions today? It has made the 2020 season a bit more like the 2021 season is going to be anyway.</p><p>Regardless of what level of climate change believer you are, the link between Australian climate policy and the fires this season is statistically tenuous. That's what the pure science of mathematics demonstrates.</p><p>Australian government action cannot change the rainfall, the temperature, the wind, the geography, and the ignition of fires from natural sources. The Australian government can influence the ignition of fires from human sources - an astonishing 87 per cent of all fires by the way. State governments can control the level of hazard reduction burning, the resourcing of emergency services, the planning for those services, and the operational decisions of those services.</p><p>David Owens, Parklands</p><p>'Sinful' to clear forest Fire has ravaged our forests on the mainland, and parts of Tasmania, killing native animals, birds, insects and rare vegetation. This requires from us a radical rethink of what we Tasmanians can do to preserve our remaining native forests.</p><p>Our fellow Australians will wish to come to our cool, green places to recover, mentally and spiritually. The clear felling of the Oldina coupe, a small patch of old regrowth on a steep incline above the Calder River, only minutes from Wynyard, should be left for all these reasons.</p><p>It is sinful to consider calculating this forest only in monetary terms for a short term gain. Leave it to grow into a mature haven for all of us; humans, animals, plants, insects, as it conserves carbon, filters our air and produces oxygen, preserves moisture and protects us from wind. We need it standing, not wood chipped.</p><p>Susan Hartley, Oldina</p><p>Support for fuel burns Shane Davidson can rest assured that my support for the need of hazard reduction burning is unambiguous and on the public record (Adv., Jan. 13).</p><p>Whether as convenor of Friends of Forestry in the federal parliament, as Minister for Forestry, in an opinion piece in a national newspaper published in early December, or in recent TV and radio comments, I've always championed the cause of hazard reduction as vital to reducing fire risk.</p><p>How my recent comments could lead Shane to the interesting conclusions he has formed about me is truly baffling. I look forward to working with Shane in advocating for more fuel reduction burns, a measure that the Hodgman Liberal government has sensibly embraced.</p><p>Senator Eric Abetz, Liberal Senator for Tasmania</p><p>Do you have something to say?

whatever it is, it's big enough to necessitate blowing up the district attorney's house.</p><p>The DA's accountant (Jake Weber) fears that he's next, so he scoops up his adolescent son, Connor (Finn Little), and hightails it into the Montana forest, bound for a survival school run by his old friend Allison (Medina Senghore) and her husband, local sheriff Ethan (Jon Bernthal).</p><p>The bad guys give deadly pursuit, and soon the kid is lost in the forest, where he encounters Hannah, alone in her lookout tower perched high above the trees.</p><p>How ever will a woman haunted by her failure to rescue some kids redeem herself?</p><p>If that wasn't enough, Jack and Patrick helpfully start a whole forest fire as distraction from their killing mission, so Hannah has \u2013 wouldn't you know it \u2013 the perfect chance to reckon with those deep-seated fears, too.</p><p>Sheridan has clearly designed this to be a lean and elemental thriller, with minimal character information and a focus on the relentless pursuit \u2013 something in which a face like Jolie's might assume its natural, iconic command.</p><p>Aided by the Montana wilderness backdrop, he and cinematographer Ben Richardson (Wind River; Beasts of the Southern Wild) manage the occasional punchy image \u2013 Jolie plunging off a watchtower after being struck by lightning, a villain getting scarred to resemble a comic-book villain \u2013 and it's true that nothing crackles and pops on screen quite like fire, providing a vivid backdrop for the climactic sequences.</p><p>Both Little and Jolie \u2013 playing fugitive child and protective mother figure \u2013 invest their growing bond with an element of warmth and humour.</p><p>But Sheridan's script, co-written with Koryta and Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond), is also riddled with hokey character work: there's Hannah troubled past, her rocky former relationship with sheriff Ethan, and his current partner Allison's convenient pregnancy \u2013 which somehow inspires a flash of sympathy in two killers who've been gunning down witnesses in cold blood.</p><p>Ironically, the film's most enigmatic and compelling character \u2013 Tyler Perry's criminal mastermind \u2013 is glimpsed for all of one short scene, never to be seen again.</p><p>None of which might have mattered in the hands of a transformative filmmaker, but Sheridan's direction lacks for excitement and a real sense of peril \u2013 the film has the drab look of so much digital cinematography, and despite attempts to build tension, we always seem to know what's coming (especially when characters snap into dumb horror movie decision-making as a way to resolve scenes.)</p><p>You can't help imagine what this film would have looked like in the 90s, where a director might have leaned into all the silliness, or an 80s version that would have treated us to the hotshot firefighter story \u2013 scored by Giorgio Moroder with a theme song by Bonnie Tyler.</p><p>Jolie would have lit up either, but rather than jazz the material here, her star power feels weirdly dimmed by it.</p><p>The film's best moments are the scenes between Hannah and Connor, in which the script's maternal dynamic is complicated by the camera's inherent attraction to Jolie's star presence \u2013 she's as much cool big sister or object of teenage affection as she is mother figure, a dissonance that echoes the film's awkward attempts at realism.</p><p>Even covered in mud and bruises and at the end of her tether, Jolie can seem almost computer generated, popping against the murky backgrounds and unmooring the film's attempts at grit.</p><p>She's like some kind of digital <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/04/sunset-boulevard-at-70-were-all-norma-desmond-now\">Norma Desmond</url>, trapped in a diminished cinema at the mercy of the streaming aesthetic.</p><p>\"Getting struck by lightning made you weird,\" Connor says to her at one point.</p><p>\"I was already weird,\" she replies.</p><p>The film doesn't know what to do with the moment.</p><p>Maybe that's the dilemma of Jolie's career \u2013 she's too much for most ordinary movies to handle, too unreal to play average humans and their mortal lives.</p><p>No wonder she returns to Disney's digital queendoms. For better and worse, their worlds have the scale to match hers. Their pictures haven't gotten small.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Those Who Wish Me Dead is in cinemas from May 13.</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-100131208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62N3-X9H1-DY47-52HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 12, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

If you want to minimise the threat, you have to minimise the fuel around you.\" Mr Cheney said state government environment departments had taken too much notice of ecological scientists with \"very little practical experience of bushfires\".</p><p>\"For one of these scientists to stand up and tell me that there's no evidence that prescribed burning works, only tells me that they have absolutely no idea about fire behaviou-r and, perhaps worse than that, they have not experienced fire in the raw themselves, studied and measured the fires close up, and they have not fought fires on the ground.\" Federal Natural Disaster and Emergency Management Minister David Littleproud said vegetation management was primar-ily the responsibility of the states but the Morrison government had started a House of Representatives inquiry into vege-tation management and its efficacy in relation to hazard reduction and bushfires.</p><p>\"The terms of reference include the roles of different jurisdictions and an examination of indigenous practices,\" Mr Littleproud said.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria- chief Chris Hardman said Victoria had chosen a \"risk-based\" approach rather than a hectare-based target.</p><p>\"This approach was endorsed by an expert reference panel and it was adopted because it represented a more effective -approach to reducing- risk for life and property than a hectare-based target,\" he said.\"A risk-based target focuses our efforts on burning where we achieve the most successful outcomes- instead of how many -hectares are burned.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-88df291a32b811eab8abb9040b94093272d8733b4015bd81593d6d3b6955a533</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY2-KF21-F0JP-W0VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

They come from an urban environment and they don't have the knowledge of the risk.\" Last Monday, when the mercury exceeded 43C, Forest Fire Management Victoria deputy chief fire officer -Andrew Morrow said the conditions were the worst in the state since 2009's Black Saturday.</p><p>Mr Beswicke said the risk in the Otways was ever-present.</p><p>\"There is always risk during the fire danger period,\" he said. \"Any time a fire could start down there, the impact could be enormous.\" \"Last Monday, it was a really bad day, similar to Black Saturday conditions. \"With the number of people in the Surf Coast and in other areas, if a fire had started that day and we hadn't got on top of it within the first five minutes, it would have kept burning.\" Mr Beswicke said the -Otways National Park area was incredibly dry, \"100 per cent\" ready to burn.</p><p>Former Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley, who headed the ser-vices during the 2015 Wye River fires, said closing the Great Ocean Road was part of contingency plans.</p><p>\"Holidayers must understand where they are. Just don't disconnect, listen to what locals are saying, try to get -information,\" Mr Lapsley said.</p><p>\"The Great Ocean Road is not a risk, it is a challenge.

In NSW, recreational fishing has been recognised as passive exercise and is allowed to continue.</p><p>Ms Pulford tweeted: \"The advice is clear, you need to stay home. There are a lot of sacrifices we need to make, and going out to fish is one of them.</p><p>\"For some people, fishing is their job - and at this stage that's OK - however, if you don't need to go fishing, you shouldn't be.\" The message echoed Premier Daniel Andrews' pleas to Victorians that \"if you can stay home, you must stay home\".</p><p>Amid the confusion last night, Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton also said people must stay at home.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, this means no fishing, no hunting, no boating, no camping, and no golf. Hang up your rods, leave the tinnie in the driveway, and clean your clubs at home,\" Professor Sutton said.</p><p>\"We ask Victorians to stop looking for loopholes. Just do the right thing. The advice is clear; by staying at home you're saving lives.</p><p>\"These restrictions are tough, but they are there for a reason.

(Don't let ill-informed turn you off vaccine, 13/12). I keep wondering why their misleading comments are considered newsworthy. Anti-vaxxers are like hecklers at debates, interrupting the intelligent commentators, militantly obsessed with unlikely detail, expecting to convince without scientific foundation and generally becoming a pain in the backside to everyone else. Thanks to the genius of cartoonist Warren, the adage is proven true that humour wins the debate when all else fails. Backstabbing (with syringes), our former prime ministers step up to vaccinate each other. Great laugh and best cartoon of the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALAN SEXTON NORTH PARRAMATTA</p><p>Once again Warren Brown (cartoon, 13/12) nails it - or should I say needles it - in his whirlpool of syringe-bearing prime ministerial arms vaccinating (or trying to vaccinate) each other in the back. But I am at a loss to explain the meaning of Tony Abbott having his head facing backwards. As prime minister Mr Abbott always struck me as being rather inflexible \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 politically speaking.</p><p>DOUGLAS MACKENZIE DEAKIN, ACT</p><p>CHINA'S NO MATE I completely agree with Mary Zegura (Letters, 13/12). With China's leaders acting like a bunch of spoilt brats over Australia's decision to question the source of the coronavirus and to be so bold as to decide what other countries we have ties with without seeking their permission first, they are showing us that we need to find other markets and not rely on them alone. The recent promotion to travel within Australia is also a good way to help our economy, but I believe that the tourist industry needs to play a part as well by sourcing local products if possible to sell in their shops and attractions. On a recent road trip we found that almost every item in most attractions and shops were made in China, even though they had the attraction's brand name on them. A lot had multiple labels promoting them as Australian designed or \"by Australian artist\" etc, but the small bottom label showed they were all made in China. I for one will no longer buy products made in China if at all possible and if more people did the same then I believe our small manufacturers will take the opportunity to fill the gap. It may cost a bit more to buy, but it will help our economy and show China's leaders they cannot bully the world into doing what they want.</p><p>TONY ROELANDTS TAMWORTH</p><p>YULE BE GLAD While strolling through the toy department at Kmart I noticed the perfect Christmas gift for Donald Trump - Monopoly For Sore Losers.</p><p>ROSALYN CHILDS GOROKAN</p><p>FIRE HAZARDS Those seeking to downplay the importance of global warming in amplifying fire hazards should note the Royal Commission on National Natural Disaster Arrangements reported the situation differently. The royal commission, in its final report, pointed out that extreme weather has already become more frequent and intense, 2019-2020 saw the highest Forest Fire Index since records began, further global warming over the next 20 to 30 years is inevitable and \"catastrophic fire conditions may render traditional bushfire prediction models and firefighting less effective\". Royal commissions tend to choose their words carefully, and their warnings are hard to characterise as alarmist.</p><p>EMILIE NUCK WAGGA WAGGA</p><p>VOTING FEARS I have long thought that voting in Australia was wrought with danger of manipulation. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, as discussed in Peta Credlin's article (ST, 13/12), wants an electronic electoral role and digital copies at each polling booth, so people can't vote twice.</p><p>Additionally, they have determined that voters need to produce personal identification, to which I couldn't agree more, and in fact I'd go a step further and have voters prove that they are entitled to vote in that electorate. Labor has called this an assault on democracy. I call it keeping our elections fair and democratic. I can't help but question Labor's stand in this regard.</p><p>PETER CATTLIN FRESHWATER</p><p>HOORAY FOR PETA Another great article by Peta Credlin. Her article has convinced me to alter my ballot paper when next I vote to read: Vote 1: Build more coal, gas and nuclear power plants Vote: 2: Build more dams Vote: 3: Introduce digital voting system Vote 4: De-fund any university that does not introduce free speech into its curriculum Vote 5: Introduce optional preferential voting.</p><p>BRUCE ROLLO WOLLONGBAR</p><p>A NEW START Many have described 2020 as a lost year. The opportunity to harvest excess water from the north into dams, cheaper electricity, best possible control of COVID-19 and some sort of resolution to the renewable/fossil fuel arguments would be a good start for 2021. I am still waiting for a true cost-benefit analysis regarding solar, windmill and battery 24 hour power supplies and the real reason why the Greens are so fearful of carbon-free, low-cost nuclear and hydrogen energy.</p><p>TERRY GROVES FORSTER</p><p>CONGRATULATIONS Wow, what a great jab in the arm from Lucy Carne; Piers Akerman's brilliant assessment of our pollies; Wes the Commander providing insight into \"fog of war\"; Ellen Whinnett's wake-up call and David Penberthy's truth about Australia's COVID situation.

And what should - and could - have been done to reduce the risk of a catastrophe that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/africa/cape-town-table-mountain-fire.html\">destroyed priceless cultural heritage</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Table Mountain National Park is clothed in fynbos - a distinctive type of vegetation found only in South Africa - and is surrounded by the city of Cape Town. </p><p>Fynbos is a highly flammable shrubland, which has evolved over millennia to become dependent on fire for survival. It burns. <url normalizedValue=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1dee/1185429d1ca8a7608e528a293559b55db436.pdf\">Science tells us</url>  that we can expect most fynbos to burn on average every 12 to 15 years in natural conditions.  </p><p>Therefore <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/120137\">managing fynbos means managing fires</url>. </p><p>Fire hazard is influenced by <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/what-science-tells-us-about-fire-hazards-facing-cape-town-and-its-surrounds-125069\">three factors</url>: the weather, an ignition source and fuel loads. </p><p>The weather can affect fires by increasing spread through high wind speeds or resulting in dry vegetation after a period of warm weather. Ignition sources may be a result of lightning or arson. </p><p>Both weather and ignition sources are hard to control and prevent, and yet often receive the most media attention. But the one factor that is possible to manage, is fuel loads. Fuel loads in fynbos can be kept down through ecological burns and keeping the mountain clear of invasive alien trees. </p><p>The recent out-of-control wildfire on Table Mountain may be linked to several key issues: fire suppression, alien trees, constrained budgets and unsupportive policies, together creating a wicked problem. Climate change may also have played a role in the high temperatures and fierce winds around the time of the fire, though attribution studies will need to confirm this. </p><h>Fire suppression</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14861\">Recent research</url> has shown that urban expansion of Cape Town has created anthropogenic fire shadows which are changing the fire regime, often causing a decline in fire activity. For example, the fires that used to sweep the slopes of Newlands and Kirstenbosch from the flats below have been blocked by the suburbs of Newlands and Rondebosch, meaning that the fynbos on these slopes has not burnt in decades. </p><p>Scientists are calling this process a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14861\">hidden collapse</url>\", that desperately requires management intervention. They also predicted two years ago that this would lead to extreme fires in ecosystems globally where there was no ecological restoration and where fuels were allowed to accumulate. </p><p>Further evidence of a decline in fire activity in Table Mountain Natonal Park is presented in a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pcu.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/192/poulsen%202013.pdf\">study</url> on indigenous forests which showed that they had been expanding on Table Mountain due to fire suppression policies. </p><h>Invasion of alien trees</h><p>Invasion of alien trees also contributes to increased fuel loads, and therefore more dangerous fires. Fynbos is made up mainly of shrubs and therefore when alien trees invade or are planted in fynbos, they tower several meters above fynbos, carrying considerably more fuel. A change from fynbos to pines and gum trees can increase fuel loads <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/news/DispForm.aspx?ID=5908\">from 4 to 20 tonnes per hectare</url>.</p><p>One study found that the 2017 Knysna wildfire had a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/news/DispForm.aspx?ID=5908\">significantly higher</url> severity in plantations of invasive alien trees and fynbos invaded by these trees, compared to areas with just fynbos. </p><p>Unfortunately, invasive alien plant species are <url normalizedValue=\"https://tokaipark.com/tokai-park/adopt-a-plot/\">proliferating faster than authorities can remove or manage them</url>. This is also despite the efforts of Working for Water Teams working in the park, as well as over <url normalizedValue=\"https://tokaipark.com/tokai-park/adopt-a-plot/\">20 volunteer groups working</url> hard to clear invasive alien plants on the Cape Peninsula and beyond. </p><p>In an article in 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/what-science-tells-us-about-fire-hazards-facing-cape-town-and-its-surrounds-125069\">scientists warned</url> of the areas of highest risk at the urban-fynbos fringe, and gave clear steps that could be taken to mitigate this risk. But these issues have been identified <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226751784_Management_of_the_natural_ecosystems_of_the_Cape_Peninsula_Current_status_and_future_prospects\">as early as 1995</url>. </p><p>Could Cape Town have been better prepared to deal with this disaster?</p><h>Why is this a wicked problem?</h><p>Although we have the ecological knowledge to undertake prescribed burns and alien clearing, unsupportive policies, constrained budgets and a complex social setting make implementation challenging. </p><p>In the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/news/DispForm.aspx?ID=5908\">1970s and 1980s</url>, regular prescribed burns were practised <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226216492_The_Cape_Peninsula_South_Africa_Physiographical_biological_and_historical_background_to_an_extraordinary_hot-spot_of_biodiversity\">in some parts of the park </url> with the dual goals of rejuvenating the fynbos, and reducing fuel loads (and hence risk). However this was halted at the end of the 1980s, and fire management shifted to fire suppression to protect plantations and residential developments. </p><p>The current <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.za/documents/national-veld-and-forest-act#\">National Veld and Forest Fire Act 101 of 1998</url> does not adequately cater for prescribed burning, as it only allows burning for the purposes of preparing firebreaks. This makes it extremely difficult to obtain permission to conduct fires that would maintain the fynbos, assist with the control of alien plants, and reduce fuel loads. </p><p>Another issue is the social resistance to prescribed ecological burns in Cape Town. The public have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.za/speeches/minister-barbara-creecy-convenes-open-dialogue-session-table-mountain-national-park-and-its\">raised concerns around lack of communication</url>, while the authorities past communications around prescribed and alien clearing has resulted in public efforts to block the planned management actions. This has resulted in a lack of trust between authorities and residents.</p><p>These challenges result in a management stalemate.</p><h>Recommendations</h><p>What should the priorities be in the short-term? Will funds for basic needs, such as recovering buildings and capacity, compete with disaster risk reduction needs, such as ecological restoration and clearing invasive alien trees? </p><p>Alien plant management needs to compete with all other budgetary pressures, which perpetuates a complex, wicked problem. </p><p>What can be done better going forward? </p><p>Firstly, the policy framework needs to be addressed. Although prescribed burns are dangerous and inconvenient, out-of-control wildfires are disastrous and could threaten many people's lives. </p><p>Secondly, citizens of Cape Town need to be more supportive of prescribed ecological burns and alien clearing.

But Elite Protection security guard Andrew Buntine, who was a supervisor at Rydges on Swanston in the weeks before the outbreak there, said DHHS officers had told guards to ration personal protective equipment to ensure there was enough for nurses and other essential staff when supplies were dwindling.</p><p>\"The [department] officers really struggled to know what was going on and they were out of their depth,\" he said in June.</p><p>Security guards and other hotel quarantine workers who spoke to The Age said DHHS did not provide them with infection control training before the coronavirus outbreaks at Rydges on Swanston and the Stamford Hotel.</p><p>Lapses at the Rydges and Stamford Plaza are considered responsible for most or all of Victoria's second wave outbreak.</p><p>Ms Mikakos was not asked about infection control measures when appearing at the parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday but said the hotels program was a \"multi-agency effort\".</p><p>Mr Pakula told the public accounts and estimates committee hearing his team was in charge of \"the booking of rooms, the organising of meals and laundry and things of that nature. They were responsible for logistics, the provision of meals.\"</p><p>Mr Pakula defended public servants from Global Victoria, an international trade department, who appeared in a leaked video this week boasting of their success in establishing the program.</p><p>\"If your point is that it would not be sensible for people from Global Victoria to be responsible for things like infection control, I would agree. And they were not,\" Mr Pakula told the inquiry. \"The responsibility for infection control and health matters was the DHHS, as you would expect.\"</p><p>Mr Pakula insisted he was not pointing the finger at Ms Mikakos or the DHHS and refused to answer a question from Liberal MP Bridget Vallence asking which minister was ultimately responsible for the program.</p><p>Premier Daniel Andrews and Ms Mikakos have in recent weeks refused to answer questions on the quarantine hotels program that is before the inquiry being led by retired judge Jennifer Coate.</p><p>However, over two hours of questioning from the 10 MPs on the parliamentary public accounts and estimates committee, Mr Pakula and his most senior public servants painted the clearest picture yet of how Victoria's quarantine hotels program was hatched.</p><p>They said at 4.30pm on March 27, hours after National Cabinet agreed each state should establish a hotel quarantine system, Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp chaired a meeting at Victoria's State Control Centre with representatives from various government agencies and police. Senior ministers, including Mr Andrews and Mr Pakula, did not attend.</p><p>The secretary of the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions, Simon Phemister, said his department was given 36 hours to hire private security companies. It has since been revealed the contracting arrangements allowed companies to use subcontracting to pay guards as little as $18 an hour and hire them via WhatsApp messages.</p><p>Mr Pakula confirmed reports in The Age last month that, within days of setting up the arrangement, his department had become worried about the security guards.</p><p>\"There were on a couple of occasions, early in the program, entreaties from officers of my department, where it was our view that police should be on-site at hotels,\" Mr Pakula said.</p><p>Mr Phemister said those concerns were directed to Craig Eagle, a senior officer with Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>\"The deputy state controller [Mr Eagle] acknowledged and heard at all times any concerns that were raised,\" Mr Phemister said. \"What he did with our concerns, I'm unsure.\" Victoria Police became involved in quarantine hotels in July.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7buqkv4zg2go575xm23</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K2-XHH1-F0J6-J183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Especially seeing as it's summertime in Australia? Look, it's easy to make fun of those who state the bleeding obvious when it comes to temperatures topping out, but why do so many remain oblivious when it comes to the reason behind it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heatwave headlines might seem superfluous when that's literally what this season was made for \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the truth is there is something truly newsworthy behind the sensationalism.</p><p>Climate change.</p><p>Yes, it's summer \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but not as we once knew it.</p><p>Almost 60 towns and cities across Australia last month recorded their hottest November day since records began, new data has revealed.</p><p>A further 40 locations saw their hottest ever November night, leading weather watcher Professor David Holmes from Monash University to observe that \"climate change is happening while we sleep\".</p><p>Further, Prof Holmes says La Nina, which was declared in October and usually brings cooler weather, may have been \"overwhelmed\" by global warming.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology has already confirmed that, overall, last month was the hottest November on record in Australia, and there are indications that it could also be soon declared the hottest November worldwide following unseasonal warmth in the continental US and parts of Latin America and Europe as well as Australia.</p><p>Climate deniers may insist it's all a hoax, but why then are industries from finance to insurance to development and town planning banking on it being a part of the future?</p><p>Speaking to the Planning Institute of Australia's Queensland state manager Matt Collins, he said climate change was one of the biggest factors for planners to consider for the future.</p><p>And, unfortunately, the Gold Coast is especially vulnerable to this danger. Rising sea levels and increased risk of bushfires in our Hinterland mean that almost every suburb could be at risk.</p><p>Data compiled by the company XDI for the firm Climate Risk suggests one in six Gold Coast properties could become uninsurable due to an increased frequency of natural disasters It projects that more than half of the current addresses in the suburbs of Palm Beach, Broadbeach Waters, and Bundall may face unaffordable insurance premiums by 2100, with potential increases of up to 55.5 per cent by 2050.</p><p>\"The Gold Coast is an extremely desirable place to live but it's that desirability that's actually the source of some of its weakness,\" chief executive of XDI Cross Dependency Initiative Rohan Hamden told the ABC late last year.</p><p>\"It's relatively low-lying land that's exposed to both sea level rise and riverine flooding to a significant degree.</p><p>\"You've got that hinterland running along the back where there's the interaction of that urban fringe with the potential for forest fire.\" Let's be brutally honest. Dealing with the prospect of climate change is a pain in the backside.</p><p>But it's a pain worth going through for a huge gain.</p><p>Building more sustainable, less wasteful industries is surely something we should be investing in, regardless of whether or not the world is on fire.</p><p>To me, it seems a no-brainer to simply conduct ourselves as though climate change is real (which it is), whether you believe it or not.</p><p>Certainly that's what some of our biggest business players are already doing. Just recently, ANZ announced it would halt lending to its largest customers unless the businesses could prove carbon transition plans by next year.</p><p>ANZ's new emissions policies aim to support efforts to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, with significant steps to be taken by the 2021 financial year to shape the bank's operations until 2030.</p><p>The bank will also \"only finance the construction of new large-scale office buildings if they are highly energy efficient\", and by next year, will disclose \"more robust and credible metrics\" so the impact of its lending to the power generation and commercial property industries is clearer.</p><p>ANZ's policies were sharply criticised by the Nationals, who said the moves would cripple farmers. But the question has to be asked: which hurts more - climate change policies or climate change itself?</p><p>Between a rock and a hard place, surely it's better to opt for the short-term pain that may at least give farmers land to farm in the future.</p><p>And even for a suburban parent like myself, it's clear that it's time to take action. As someone who struggles to remember to recycle, the sad fact is that my heart is willing but too often my hands are just too damn lazy.</p><p>But I'm not too damn stupid to realise that this is a real problem and we all need to be part of the solution.</p><p>And if that means I need to pay more for products or be taxed more heavily, fine.</p><p>Ultimately, it's an investment in my children's future. Surely that should be bleedingly obvious to all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GCBULL-28b3328c35d911eb91a3186d33155de961ae813a494b8edf913ab7740b5ffab4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GCBULL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FH-DK81-F0JP-W376-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464543</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Gold Coast Bulletin</publicationName><edition>GoldCoast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 5, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp;

During the first seven months of 2020, more than 11,000 fires were detected in the 14,000 square kilometer (5,400 square mile) region, according to the Antonio Scasso Museum of Natural Sciences. More than 530 square kilometers of marshland -- an area equivalent to three times Argentina's sprawling capital Buenos Aires, which lies to the southeast -- has been razed, according to estimates based on satellite images.The flames are devastating the rich biodiversity of a territory that is home to 700 species of plants and animals, according to the National Rosario and Littoral universities. </p><p>\"The fires generate an immediate impact and others that are felt over the medium and long term: the death of animals, the loss of the natural habitat of many species, impoverishment of the soil, water and air contamination, emissions that generate climate change,\" Graciela Klekailo, from Rosario University, told AFP. The delta is a flood plain made up of several islands where the Parana River empties into the Rio de la Plata.  Boats stranded on the banks of the River Parana in Rosario where the level of the river is four to five times lower than usual AFP / Marcelo MANERA  The question on everyone's mind, though, is who is responsible? Forest fire fighters preparing to take to the skies to battle the thousands of fires raging across the Parana Delta marshes AFP / Marcelo MANERA Environment Minister Juan Cabandie accuses livestock producers of using fire to clear dry pastureland and regenerate it for their livestock. Cabandie has filed a criminal complaint against producers and land tenants. But those producers deny the accusations and claim the fires undermine their activities, in turn blaming authorities for \"lack of control and neglect.\"  An aerial view of livestock on the parched marshland of the Parana Delta AFP / Marcelo MANERA Jorge Postma, from Rosario University, says this year's exceptional conditions have caused the catastrophe. The Parana River -- whose name means little sea in the local Guarani language -- is much lower than normal. \"Right now the level of the Parana River in the Rosario port hydrometer is 80 centimeters. Normally in this area at this time of year it's three or four meters,\" said Postma. Authorities and livestock producers blame each other for the thousands of forest fires ravaging the Parana Delta, one of the most biodiverse in the world ARGENTINE FEDERAL POLICE / Gustavo SAITA  Javier Torres belongs to a family in the city of Entre Rios that has produced honey for decades. This year, 270 bee hives in the Delta's island areas were devoured by fire. \"It took years to build and will take me years to rebuild. I'm heart- broken. I haven't received any help from anyone so far,\" Torres told AFP. Depending on the direction of the wind, the largest coastal cities on the western bank of the Parana, such as Rosario, San Lorenzo and Villa Constitucion, are engulfed by a dense cloud of smoke that causes breathing problems and allergies. It's made all the worse by the coronavirus pandemic. In June, Rosario University researchers found that the city's air had five times the allowed level of pollution. \"This is very serious in the context of a pandemic, with breathing issues,\" the researchers wrote.While livestock rearing is the main activity in the Delta area, it also attracts poachers, fishermen and real estate speculators. Pablo Cantador, an environmentalist from the \"Don't Touch Parana\" group, told AFP that the uncontrollable fires \"are the result of decades of forgetting about the marshes.\" A group of universities and environmental organizations is clamoring for Congress to urgently pass a bill aimed at protecting the marshland. They say the new law would create greater regulations regarding the use of the land and protect the Delta. However, it has already failed twice to win passage in the legislature.  \"It's the most important marsh system in Argentina.

The record-breaking temperatures during one week in December - which smashed previous Australia-wide daily maximums - were 10 times more likely a century earlier, they said.</p><p>Identifying climate change's role for the drought was more difficult. The scientists did not find an attributable climate change trend in either extreme annual drought or the driest month of the September-February fire season.</p><p>However, the climate influence was clear for the broader fire weather index, arguably before summer had begun.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/annual/aus/#tabs=Temperature\">The Bureau of Meteorology identified record high values</url> during spring for almost 60 per cent of the country using its accumulated forest fire danger index.</p><p>Using a modified Canadian fire weather index that better accommodated wind speeds, the researchers found a trend towards higher risks since at least 1979.</p><p>They estimate the probability of an index as high as recorded during the recent summer had increased by at least 30 per cent - and as much as 80 per cent - since 1900 as a result of anthropogenic climate change.</p><p>\"We think it could be much higher\" than 30 per cent, said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, and another of the researchers.</p><p>Climate models \"are bad at capturing small-scale extremes, or extremes that depend on small-scale processes,\" Professor van Oldenborgh said.</p><p>\"This is partly resolution, but in the case of heat extremes these depend strongly on factors like land use, irrigation, urbanisation, air pollution and other non-climate factors that are often not represented in climate models, and if they are have large uncertainties.\"</p><p>Australia has warmed about 1.4 degrees over the past century, or faster than the global rise of about 1 degree. With a global temperature rise of 2 degrees, the weather conditions behind the recent fires would be at least four times more common than in 1900, research found.</p><p>However, the world's weak emissions reduction efforts leave temperatures on course to rise 4.1-4.8 degrees by 2100 compared with pre-industrial levels, <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Climate Action Tracker estimates</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><p>While the attribution study did not examine fire weather risks associated with a 4-degree warmer world, there is \"no reason to assume\" fire threats won't continue to climb, Friederike Otto, from Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520247801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBS-3J61-JBJ7-N465-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The day commemorates rangers killed or injured in the line of duty and celebrates the work rangers do to protect the planet's natural treasures and cultural heritage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ranger Team Leader Creswick, Kyra Winduss, is one of 600 rangers - including almost 40 Aboriginal rangers - employed through Parks Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She completed a Diploma of Natural Resource Management and began working in consulting where she had a realisation:</p><p>\"I realised that sitting in the office all day wasn't really what I was after. I wanted to be outside and give back to our wonderful natural world.\"</p><p>With an innate love of the great outdoors, she made the decision to change the direction of her career.</p><p>Starting her career with Parks Victoria at Wilsons Promontory National Park as an information officer one summer almost 20 years ago, she later secured a role as a ranger based in Creswick in November 2003.</p><p>As team leader, she and her team cover a wide area - encompassing Hepburn, Creswick and up to Mt Beckworth, across to Ararat and Lake Bolac.</p><p>\"I left my office job and pursued a career as a ranger and I'm so fortunate to be able to say that I absolutely love my job.</p><p>\"Everyday is a highlight because of the variety of things we do. Being able to come to work everyday, working outside and protecting beautiful parks and reserves around here is fantastic.</p><p>\"Sometimes I'm out there and think 'wow, this is my job and I'm so lucky.'\"</p><p>Ms Winduss said rangers were important as they helped the community connect with nature safely, while working to ensure the state's unique natural environment was protected for future generations.</p><p>\"We work hard - in partnership with Traditional Owners - to maintain the health and wellbeing of our parks, reserves, forests, and marine sanctuaries for our current and future generations,\" she explained.</p><p>CAREER HIGHLIGHTS It is a diverse career, with each and every day working as a ranger different - from protecting parks and the plants and animals within them to running environmental programs and cultural heritage management.</p><p>In this region that includes Indigenous heritage, as well as sites such as Andersons Mill in Smeaton.</p><p>Rangers ensure visitor facilities such as campgrounds, walking tracks and roads are managed for people to enjoy and plan for the summer period through planned burning - not only to minimise fuel loads but also in the best way for the environment.</p><p>Rangers also respond to bushfires and other emergencies.</p><p>Ms Winduss enjoys working in a team environment in which everyone has the same goals and passions, and seeing how the changes the team implements in parks and reserves develop over time.</p><p>She is \"really proud and honoured\" to have a lead role in running the Brush-Tailed Phascogale monitoring program for Parks Victoria in the Hepburn area - running for about 20 years, it the longest-running conservation program in the state for the species.</p><p>It involves staff from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and TAFE volunteers.</p><p>\"It's a trapping program to collect DNA from the species to understand the genetic diversity and we link that across the state,\" she explained.</p><p>It is hoped the program can be expanded to other areas of the state.</p><p>\"To have a long-running program that can track data over time is important so you have a good basis to analyse what's happening and look at trends,\" she explained, adding the data helped inform strategies to protect the threatened species.</p><p>She said this included looking at how to increase habitat linkages and mitigating the threats to the species, while also analysing any changes to biodiversity in the area.</p><p>\"What we have learnt has allowed our management of fire in the landscape to be modified to protect Victorians while supporting our precious threatened species.\"</p><p>Ms Winduss also enjoys working to revitalise facilities to motivate more people to enjoy what nature has to offer across the region.</p><p>Rangers were excited to recently welcome people back to the Blowhole - a unique historical remnant of Victoria's gold rush - in Hepburn Regional Park after an extensive closure due to flooding in 2016.</p><p>The flooding caused parts of the cliff face to collapse next to the walking track and damaged the foundation of the viewing platform. It was reopened late last year.</p><p>\"It's been great to see that happen - from the devastation of the storm impact in 2016 to working through getting that site revitalised so people can enjoy that safely,\" Ms Winduss said.</p><p>\"A walk down there this time of year is well worth it and a great opportunity to immerse yourself in nature.\"</p><p>Ms Winduss is also proud to work with Traditional Owners. In her patch, Parks Victoria jointly manages Hepburn Regional Park with the traditional owners of the land, the Dja Dja Wurrung people.</p><p>As part of this, there are some \"exciting programs\", including the \"Walking Together\" program that sees the two work together to realise their aspirations for country.</p><p>CHALLENGES Ms Winduss said there were many challenges in being a ranger - from natural challenges like fires and storms to human challenges.</p><p>With more than 100 million visits to the estate each year, visitor behaviour and littering are just some of the issues rangers deal with.</p><p>\"We want visitors to understand that taking care of our natural places is a shared responsibility,\" Ms Winduss said.</p><p>For her personally, a challenge has been returning to her role in a part-time capacity after having children and finding the right work-life balance.</p><p>\"Parks Victoria and my team members specifically have been incredibly supportive and made that transition easier to overcome,\" she added.</p><p>CURRENT WORK At the moment, one of the key focuses for the region's five rangers is the continued clean up following the severe storms which battered the region on June 9.</p><p>Hepburn Regional Park, Macedon Regional Park and Coliban River Scenic Reserve (Trentham Falls) were seriously impacted by the storms and are still closed due to the damage.</p><p>Ms Winduss said rangers were working to ensure the sites were made safe so visitors could be welcomed back again in the near future.</p><p>Other current projects include investment in Lalgambook (Mt Franklin) in the Hepburn Regional Park, in conjunction with the Dja Dja Wurrung people.</p><p>This investment will be for improved visitor amenities to showcase the living culture of the Dja Dja Wurrung with the wider community.</p><p>Rangers are also currently working on pest animal and plant programs in rural landscapes.</p><p>DAY OF REFLECTION Ms Winduss said World Ranger Day was an important time to reflect and remember those who had made significant sacrifices to protect natural environments across the world.</p><p>In some parts, such as Africa, rangers are killed by poachers while in Australia, rangers have also been killed on the job.</p><p>These include Bill Slade - a veteran with 40 years' service with Parks Victoria and as a Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighter. He died while on active duty in East Gippsland during the Black Summer bushfires on January 11, 2020.</p><p>Zach Robba, 23, also died off the Great Barrier Reef last year.</p><p>\"We are at the frontline, often, working in all conditions to protect some of these amazing landscapes year-round.</p><p>\"It is a great time to reflect and remember what people do across the world and that we are working together and remembering those who were not so fortunate here in Victoria, across Australia and the world.\"</p><p>Our team of local journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the Ballarat community.

Hodges took over control of the massive incident.</p><p>\"It may have been more than 500,000 hectares in size, but once you add in the fires that joined up with it, it was a million hectares,\" she said. \"There was 2500 to 3000 firefighters across the fireground at any one time when it was at its height.\"</p><p>Supt. Hodges has been with the RFS for decades and in that time has seen and managed her fair share of fire related incidents, but the Gospers Mountain bushfire was a beast like she had never seen before.</p><p>\"This has been the largest, most complex fire I've ever dealt with and I've been here for 31 years,\" she said. \"It was a fire burning on the urban interface and in rugged terrain and just the sheer vastness of it.\"</p><p>The blaze was so big, so intense and so dangerous that firefighters from across Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada came to help.</p><p>NSW RFS firefighters worked alongside those from Fire and Rescue NSW, as well as firefighters from National Parks and Wildlife and the Forestry Corporation of NSW.</p><p>Police, State Emergency Service (SES) and paramedics were also on duty to deal with traffic control, injuries and a huge range of other duties.</p><p>And, in charge of it all was Supt. Hodges.</p><p>Finally on January 12, 79 days after it ignited, the fire was brought under control.</p><p>It was now 512,626 hectares and its perimeter was 1380 kilometres, the equivalent of driving from Sydney to Adelaide.</p><p>When reflecting on her time in charge of the largest blaze of her career, Supt. Hodges said many words spring to mind.</p><p>Fatigue, exhaustion, fear, heartbreak, relief and moments of inspiration are among the emotions she felt during the massive campaign.</p><p>She is also proud. Proud of the community that rallied to help each other, and proud of the \"huge team effort\" of all emergency services who worked so hard to save lives.</p><p>\"We've had a very successful campaign and there were no lives lost and there were some very significant saves,\" she said.</p><p>\"There's been some very difficult times, but the team, the volunteers and all the agencies, it was quite rewarding that they all came together at such a hard time, they just shone. It was truly international in terms of the support we had.</p><p>\"We would just like to say thank you to the volunteers.\"</p><p>When asked what her best day was when trying to bring the blaze under control, she pauses for a moment and then answers.</p><p>\"Bringing it to contained,\" she said. \"But, there was also a lot of good moments throughout the campaign and to see the community and firefighters rally and they showed up and did beyond what they needed to. It was really rewarding to see that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WSTADV-doc7936ytrtq7nt1k0z91r</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WSTADV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3R-PYW1-F0J6-J1FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Western Advocate</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

That fear has the power to decide the next election. So much power, in fact, that no political leader will take the risk of swimming against the tide.</p><p>Those who have to deal with political leaders have to be careful about what they say, but they know they will be forced to wait until after the election before they find out when the federal government will open the international border. The sooner the election, the sooner everyone knows the answer.</p><p>Scott Morrison sees this national mood and knows how to put it to use. He has adjusted his message in the past fortnight to warn of greater dangers ahead, to the point where he seems to almost stoke the fears.</p><p>Four months ago, when the country emerged from summer lockdowns and border closures, the Prime Minister thought the risks were subsiding. Confident that vaccines were on their way, he said COVID-19 could present a similar risk to many other viruses already in the community.</p><p>\"What I'm saying is that the risk environment is reducing,\" he said on February 5.</p><p>Not any more. Morrison now argues the pandemic is a greater threat than it was one year ago. \"The pandemic is raging. The pandemic is morphing. It's changing every day,\" he said last Tuesday. \"I'm not going to take risks with Australians' lives.\"</p><p>When Virgin chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka called for a road map to open the borders but made her unwise remark that \"some people may die\" from the pandemic, Morrison made no attempt to acknowledge her case for a clear plan to open the country. He slapped down the remark as \"insensitive\" and said it was difficult to \"have any truck\" with what she was saying. Evidently Morrison does not want to calm the farm. He wants to talk about the forest fire next door.</p><p>A clear majority embraces this caution. The Resolve Political Monitor, published by the Herald on Tuesday, shows overwhelming support for border controls at a time when 3.4 million people have died from COVID-19 worldwide.</p><p>Asked about the federal budget assumption the border will stay closed until the middle of next year, 44 per cent of respondents said this was about right and 33 per cent said it was too optimistic. Only 9 per cent thought it was too pessimistic. Those who want a faster plan to open the border are clearly in the minority.</p><p>The same survey, based on responses from 1622 voters online in the five days after the budget, also showed majority support for the overall budget strategy, with 62 per cent agreeing with the priority of stimulus spending. Only 17 per cent prefer action on deficits and debt.</p><p>Yet there is a caution on another front, too. The survey found 29 per cent of respondents were reluctant to take a vaccine against the coronavirus in the months ahead. To be exact, 14 per cent said they were \"not very likely\" and 15 per cent said they were \"not at all likely\" to do so.</p><p>The survey found 35 per cent had registered for a vaccine or had already received one or two doses. It also found a separate 14 per cent were extremely likely to be vaccinated, 8 per cent were very likely to do so and 13 per cent were fairly likely to do so.</p><p>The government has its own surveys showing similar concerns, which helps explain why Morrison said he was \"not overly troubled\" by the results.</p><p>And the Coalition went into campaign mode this week. Morrison went to Lilley in Brisbane, held by Labor on a margin of just 0.64 per cent, and Dunkley in suburban Melbourne, held by Labor by 2.7 per cent.</p><p>The visits to Coalition seats also took Morrison to Deakin, Goldstein and La Trobe in Melbourne, Bass and Braddon in Tasmania and at least five seats in Queensland: Bonner, Brisbane, Flynn, Forde and Longman.</p><p>Morrison still strikes some observers, especially women, as too belligerent and arrogant at times. He has floundered on social issues over the past few months. Some expert observers, distant from Canberra but familiar with its ways, think he has been off his game since Brittany Higgins went public with her allegations of rape in Parliament House on February 15.</p><p>Now, with a budget to sell, Morrison is back on safer ground. The Resolve Political Monitor shows why. When voters are asked about policy issues, they generally favour the Coalition as the better party to run the country.</p><p>Asked who is best to manage the COVID-19 situation, 46 per cent name the Coalition but only 20 per cent prefer Labor. The government's support is up from 42 per cent in the survey one month earlier.</p><p>On economic management, 46 per cent name the Coalition as best to manage the issue but only 20 per cent name Labor. The result one month ago was much closer: 43 to 21 per cent.</p><p>Labor is in dire trouble because the Coalition leads in areas where Labor has usually held the advantage.</p><p>This is a different sort of budget bounce for a government. It is not the jump in primary vote that observers usually watch for. That core support was largely unchanged for both major parties. Resolve director Jim Reed says the result is \"way too close to call\" in two-party terms.</p><p>Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, says anyone who depends on tourism is in \"diabolical\" trouble and the daily political doorstops, with ideas like vaccine passports, are not helping.</p><p>\"There are too many different communications circulating,\" she says. \"There is a desperate need for some sort of national unity.\"</p><p>Yet national cabinet is back to meeting once a month. There is no sense of the urgency that led Morrison to put the group on an \"operational footing\" just six weeks ago.</p><p>While Morrison seems too cautious for some business leaders, he is in tune with scientists on the continuing risks.</p><p>\"The PM is correct, the pandemic is changing,\" says Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of NSW. \"Pandemics shouldn't be viewed from a linear perspective as there are many facilitators that do not have equal impact and some that have more impact than the sum of each.\"</p><p>Those factors include the vaccination rate and the variants overseas. Missteps, says McLaws, could quickly throw Australia into another wave of infection.</p><p>Just as Australians want to play it safe, so does Morrison.</p><p>For the moment, the political imperative is to keep people anxious until their votes are counted. The path to policy certainty runs through the ballot box. No wonder some want to get there as fast as possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7fvm2t7vwyws0p4632v</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R6-P8G1-F0J6-J1JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

He closed the shop on Thursday and sent staff home but he stayed on for one incredibly lucky bride.</p><p>\"I stayed because a lady was getting married [on Friday] and she couldn't come in,\" he said.</p><p>\"If I left I couldn't come back, so I had to make sure everything was done around here and then grab her wedding flowers and go and deliver them.\"</p><p>Mr Bonansea said when the fire started on Wednesday he wasn't that concerned but that quickly changed.</p><p>\"Basically a customer came in and said 'I think the smoke is coming from the airport' and I didn't think much of it,\" he said.</p><p>\"But it slowly progressed more and more and in the afternoon when I left here the fire was just out the back.</p><p>\"There were helicopters and fire brigades everywhere and I thought they must have had it under control but then bit by bit it was getting worse and worse and SES sent a text to think about evacuating.\"</p><p>After conditions calmed, Mr Bonansea opened the business as usual on Thursday but after the fires merged the property was encircled by fire.</p><p>\"On Thursday morning the wind started up again and there was a huge amount of wind around here,\" he said.</p><p>\"All of a sudden the fire was worse and it was getting closer and than apparently it jumped. It was all over the place.\"</p><p>Around the corner, Kate Gauthier left work on Thursday to defend her home.</p><p>\"When I drove home from work I saw flames on the other side and then got to the house,\" she said.</p><p>\"I just kept everything watered and watered my neighbour's garden and out the back as well because they weren't there.\"</p><p>Ms Gauthier's children were picked up from their holiday care program by her husband and dropped at a relative's house.</p><p>The plan was for her husband to come home and defend the property in the evening but the roads into the suburb were blocked.</p><p>\"I was unable to get out, so he took the kids to safety and I stayed at the house,\" she said.</p><p>They were able to get back at about 9pm Thursday.</p><p>Ms Gauthier lamented no buses were used to help residents evacuate.</p><p>\"Oaks Estate has the highest rate of non-car ownership than anywhere else in the ACT community,\" she said.</p><p>\"They were not providing bus services to the community here to get them out.</p><p>\"They were providing services to run people from Queanbeyan evacuation centre into the Dickson evacuation centre but many of the local people here would have been unable to get into that centre, so they did to some extent leave the community here a little bit high and dry.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc78zlkd9pwkjo9orz6hs</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y27-BK31-JD34-V0W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

His death came as firefighters continued to tackle fires across the state, with an emergency warning issued on Sunday for Bennies, Cheshunt South, Markous, Rose River, Top Crossing and Wabonga in the state's northeast.</p><p>Across Victoria 286 homes have been confirmed damaged or destroyed, as well as a further 400 outbuildings.</p><p>The number of homes lost in NSW since the season began in July has risen to 2136, 1220 of which have been destroyed since New Year's Eve.</p><p>At least 26 people have died in the bushfires nationally - with two confirmed dead in South Australia and 20 in NSW.</p><p>Parks Victoria chief executive Matt Jackson on Sunday said Mr Slade had received a service commendation last year for 40 years with the organisation, including battling the devastating Ash Wednesday fires in 1983.</p><p>\"It was a privilege to present him with that recognition, not only for our peer group, his recognition from service to the Victorian community in conservation but to make sure his legacy will go on,\" Mr Jackson said.</p><p>\"Having that formalised and recognised most recently as a month ago, whilst there's a tragedy, we can also honour such a great career and proactive approach and expertise that Bill provided so I was delighted and honoured to do that.\" Neighbour Andy Stewart said Mr Slade was friendly, helpful and \"capable of just about anything\".</p><p>\"Bill was extremely knowledgeable and experienced around fire (if you were on the fireground with him, you knew to heed his advice) and his loss comes as a terrible shock to everyone around the Bass, Woolamai, Wonthaggi area,\" Mr Stewart wrote in a Facebook post.</p><p>Another neighbour Lizzy Rivett said Mr Slade was down to earth, honest and hardworking and described him as \"fabulous\".</p><p>\"A true gentleman with the kindest and gentlest of souls who was always willing to help anyone in need, no question asked,\" she posted on Facebook.</p><p>Premier Daniel Andrews sent his condolences to Mr Slade's wife, Carol, and his two children, Steph and Ethan.</p><p>\"He was much loved, an absolute mentor to many, many people \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and he will be missed,\" Mr Andrews said. \"I think this shows us that this is still a very, very dangerous environment.\" Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said Mr Slade's death was a significant loss for the organisation, and the Victorian community as a whole.</p><p>\"Although we do have enormous experience with identifying hazardous trees, there are occasions where some of these tree failures cannot be predicted,\" he said.</p><p>He said it was a dynamic, high-risk environment for firefighters from the organisation and from the Country Fire Authority. \"It has been a really difficult and challenging experience for everybody,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Slade's death will be investigated by Victoria Police.</p><p>The Victorian government will announce on Monday tax relief for businesses, families and individuals in bushfire-affected communities including ex gratia relief for their 2020 land tax assessment if their properties were destroyed or substantially damaged.</p><p>People who decide not to rebuild in their local community will be able to receive up to $55,000 in stamp duty relief if they buy a home elsewhere.People who lost motor vehicles due to the bushfires would be able to receive up to $2100 in ex gratia relief from the duty on up to two replacement vehicles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

nitf:lede=\"true\">10.09 pm UPDATE Both the Werri Berri and the Border fires are in the process of being downgraded to advice level says FSC Public Liaison Officer Marty Webster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We had seen strong southerlies around the border, they're now abating and conditions are easing accordingly,\" Mr Webster said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There is no current threat to any built assets.\"</p><p>A number of crews had been stationed nearby Towamba and Burragate, but Mr Webster said conditions had been less severe than predicted and crews were able to respond to any threats quickly.</p><p>\"We did have concerns for those areas so we loaded them up with resources, but they've fortunately been able to have a quiet night.\"</p><p>In the Werri Berri fire near Bemboka, Mr Webster said there had been some strong showers aiding fire fighters to battle small areas of fire activity up until 10pm.</p><p>\"The Werri Berri areas have had some heavy showers, which have knocked the fire right down,\" Mr Webster said.</p><p>\"Conditions have never climbed to quite as bad as anticipated and we've got through the day relatively unscathed,\" he said.</p><p>Wind gusts were dropping at Eden by 10.15pm with peaks back below 40kmh and averages dropping to around 20kmh, with conditions also easing north of Bega.</p><p>Crews have also been responding to some areas of spot fires around the Badja Forest fire with some fire activity near Coolagolite and Dignam's Creek.</p><p>Crews were also responding to some trees alight on the road near Wonboyn, while they had also earlier responded to reports south of Nethercote.</p><p>EARLIER As of 9.15pm RFS Command said they weren't seeing significant increases in fire activity at either the Werri Berri or Border fires.</p><p>A spokesman for the RFS said as the southerly shift had moved through the Eden and Bega regions there has certainly been areas of fire activity, but nothing that would cause an upgrade to the status of either fire.</p><p>\"Over the ranges they were expecting 40 to 65kmh winds and gusts up to 90kmh, we haven't seen any of those extremes at this time along the coast, but they are experiencing it further inland.\"</p><p>Everyone is urged to stay alert of the strengthening winds with the forecast for wind expected to peak around Midnight in Eden before steadily dropping off into Saturday morning.</p><p>Meanwhile gusts north of Bega are forecast to already be at their strongest and should continue to ease into the night.</p><p>\"We are watching all the fires very closely at the moment as given those wind movements there is still the possibility in a situation change over the next hour or so,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>\"But on the coast we haven't seen any increases significant enough that would warrant upgrading the fire to emergency level.\"</p><p>\"That's the really good news right now.\"</p><p>Crews have been actively responding to any reports of fire and are

They make out like I'm to blame for these pictures, that it looks like I'm encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message. I don't know what to say.\" Similarly, while denying ever making Kate cry during bridesmaid fittings for Meghan and Harry's 2018 wedding, the book details a clash with the Queen's personal dresser, whom Harry accused of ignoring his request for a tiara fitting. Frustrated by the stalling, Harry took it on himself to get the plans moving, calling his grandmother and getting the fitting sorted. The antagonism of staff, whom the couple accuse of leaking damaging details, reaches its peak when the couple first raise their intention to step back from royal duties in an email to the Queen and Prince Charles.</p><p>The details of the private message were promptly leaked to the press, and in a meeting to make the arrangements, one royal aide cattily predicted Meghan would launch a line of beauty products.</p><p>Perhaps most shocking is the arm's length relationship between William and Harry and their wives, making a lie of the Fab Four image fostered early on.</p><p>While the couple had been dating in secret since June 2016, Meghan did not meet William until early November of that year, and even then Kate was not there, choosing to stay at Anmer Hall with George and Charlotte.</p><p>It was a warm welcome, the book claims, with William opening the black double doors to his home and telling her: \"I was looking forward to meeting the girl who has put that silly grin on my brother's face.\" Despite the warmth Harry had shown Kate in her first moves into public life, the favour was not returned to his then bride-to-be, who had to wait until January 10, 2017, to receive her first brief audience with the future queen.</p><p>Instead, Meghan kept close her posse of celebrity friends and made her own London circle. It was to these friends whom she turned during some of the darkest days of the tabloid coverage.</p><p>The avalanche of negative press, as well as Meghan's bi-racial background, was blamed for triggering death threats and online abuse that described her as the N-word or a \"mutt\".</p><p>The book's launch came on the same day Harry gave an interview to US civil rights campaigner Rashad Robinson, in which he compared addressing racism without first fixing institutional problems to \"bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire\".</p><p>He said: \"We have to go to the root of the problem \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and actually fix it there. As we've discussed before, it is going to take every single one of us.</p><p>\"This is not down to the black community, it's going to take every single person on the planet right now.\"</p><p>Finding Freedom, Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family By Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, HarperCollins, $27.99</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-36df68fadc4a11eabe8f2120d24317687c2eacef02b91b61d6e5fac07f27b4da</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N4-N0S1-JD3N-51B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>TasWeekend Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 22, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CVO6</classCode><className>BRITISH ROYALTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001830</classCode><className>WEDDINGS &amp; ENGAGEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000181</classCode><className>PROFILES &amp; BIOGRAPHIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CZUL</classCode><className>NIGHT &amp; SHIFT WORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DKD4</classCode><className>COURTSHIP &amp; DATING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CVO6</classCode><className>BRITISH ROYALTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>PE000DM1A</classCode><className>MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>PE0009Y83</classCode><className>HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009YB3</classCode><className>CHARLES III, KING OF THE UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But he figured it was a small price to pay for supporting his local community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Britton had his Holden Torana coupe on the trailer and was heading north to Canberra via the Illawarra Highway for the annual street machine festival when he started to hear reports about the seriousness of the oncoming bushfire front heading for his local town of Cobargo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Summernats is something I look forward to every year but as we headed out the reports we were hearing about the fire situation were just getting worse,\" he said.</p><p>\"So we parked up at the roadside near Moruya and had a family meeting, turned around and headed home.\"</p><p>It was December 30 and behind the Far South Coast towns of Wandella, Quaama and Cobargo, the Bagda Forest Fire was building a momentum that was to soon destroy dozens of homes and take two lives.</p><p>\"As we headed back home, we were stopped by a road block at Narooma,\" he said.</p><p>\"I had the dog and cat back at home and had arranged for my mother-in-law to mind them while we were away. But she couldn't get in either, so we were stuck.\"</p><p>He said he felt completely powerless to help as the firestorm swept through his community. For 36 hours, all he could do was wait and hope.</p><p>\"In the end, we snuck back into town via the national park road,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was probably not the right thing to do but we had all the right gear in case we got into strife.\"</p><p>READ MORE:</p><p>How Cobargo pulled together after a firestorm on two fronts Friday looms as next potential flashpoint in bushfire crisis NSW bushfires 'may impact' ACT warns Emergency Services Agency After checking on his house and pets - \"I lost a shed and the cat had singed feet but we were otherwise OK\" - he unloaded the Torana off the trailer and got to work.</p><p>\"The big thing was that people were bringing their horses down to the Cobargo relief centre at the showground but they had no feed for them,\" he said.</p><p>\"There was also a lot of farms around which had lost all their hay stores and their pasture. They just had stock wandering the bare paddocks looking for feed.</p><p>\"It was awful.\"</p><p>He asked around and found that Rockstarcows, a livestock breeding centre, had become a central point for people dropping off free feed for the area.</p><p>He loaded up the car trailer with big square bales and began the first of about 30 round trips, dropping off the feed wherever it was needed.</p><p>\"People were so pleased to get something which could keep them going,\" he said.</p><p>\"It felt good to be useful. I went around as many places as I could, dropping a bale off here and there.\"</p><p>He said he saw some heartbreaking sights on his many journeys.</p><p>\"A lot of burnt sheep and cows out the back of Quaama and Wandella. It was pretty bad out there. Farmers are pretty tough blokes but there were a fair few who were pretty shattered,\" he said.</p><p>\"They shook my hand and some told me their stories. It would break your heart to hear them. But this community will bounce back, I know it will.\"</p><p>The precautionary evacuation of about 100 horses from the Moruya Racecourse has created its own added feed demand in the area.</p><p>Graeme Harvgraves, who runs Harrisons Horse Pet and Rural in Moruya, was behind the wheel of his semi-trailer heading for Cowra on Wednesday to freight 500 bales of hay back to the coast.</p><p>The emergency hay shipment has been funded by Racing NSW.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc78rd2rmyz3s1k2bq8jke</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXT-TKY1-JD34-V2M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
