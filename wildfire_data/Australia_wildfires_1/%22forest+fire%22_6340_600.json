Specifically, this is Renewable Energy Infrastructure (REI) being wind turbines, large-scale solar and battery installations, high voltage (220 kva plus) transmission lines and connection hubs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tuesday-September-17-2024-169.jpg\">Image courtesy The Buloke Times</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whilst initially communicated as \u201cIndustrial Action\u201d, and whilst we still seek the objectives in the initial communication, this is not so much Industrial Action as it is Brigades simply giving notice of their stance and that this position is ongoing and that we request support from CFA, VFBV and other Brigades.</p><p>The fundamental reasons for, and objectives of this stance are:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To state our objection to the compromised safety of our members and community imposed by REI.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To draw attention to the immense negative and divisive impact these projects will have to both our people and their communities if they proceed, as well as the threat they impose to the livability of our homes, the viability of our family businesses and to food and fibre production capacity generally.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To halt, and genuinely explore alternatives to, a multitude of proposed REI projects in our immediate region, none more impactful than the WRL and VNI West transmission lines which we genuinely believe paves the way to transforming the Wimmera Mallee and much of Regional Victoria\u2019s food bowl communities into a divided industrial zone with a significantly reduced population and fire fighting capacity.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To determine where in the regions that this REI is accepted or tolerated and where it is not, irrespective of where Renewable Energy Zones are imposed.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To establish clearly under what terms and safety compromises members and specific Brigades are prepared to continue donating their time and resources to support REI and non farming enterprise given the complete dependence on volunteer firefighters over much of the State.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To avoid impacted members leaving brigades due to division and in protest to REI issues, further depleting CFA membership and response capacity.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To obtain genuine representation and consideration of our concerns at Technical Reference Groups and planning hearings as they pertain to REI projects.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>For CFA to ensure community information remains accurate and accessible with respect to safety of firefighting operations on and around REI and misstatements or inaccuracies by proponents of REI are appropriately rebuked and withdrawn.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To correct and remedy the injustice of the new Fire Services Levy funding model, particularly the negligible contribution by the RE Industry and the significant increase in levy payable by the farming community and volunteer members owning property, in stark contrast to the lack of spend on fire protection resources to the CFA in our regions and the expected increase in volunteer time commitment required from both call outs and training due to renewables expansion.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To request immediate consideration and response by CFA on their position with respect to Brigade safety and compromise to fire fighting capacity imposed by Mineral Sands Mining in farming areas. Specifically, as they present further firefighter risks and impediments, and negatively impact water availability for firefighting. High water use requirements of dredge sand mining will likely put extreme pressure on the reticulated supply in our fire brigade zones. Firefighting often relies on this pressurised system via standpipes and augmented by strategic tank storages and we are conscious of impacts to pressure in the pipeline and interruptions to the replenishment of our tanks when firefighting.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>To obtain an immediate halt of any service or funding reduction to DEECA and Forest Fire Management fire services in regional Victoria which will place increased and unreasonable reliance on CFA and volunteers.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The CFA was founded out of commonality of purpose however with the rollout of renewables there is the creation of two categories of landholders, community members and therefore Brigade members, causing fragmentation and leading to much angst and division.</p><p>Those already with, or with the prospect of hosting and profiting from, renewables infrastructure on their properties, as well as others sympathetic to the expansive renewables rollout, are fundamentally at odds with those with no appetite to increase risks to our safety, host renewables or see our districts changed permanently and communities divided, with a focus on retaining their purpose of food and fibre production, and to remain living in a region not impacted by industrial energy generation.</p><p>We appreciate that various brigades will already have the impact of this division playing out and invariably have situations where members are compromised by involvement at different levels in the renewable energy industries, or where the implementation is broadly accepted as palatable.</p><p>The clear identification of these areas is essential both for planning purposes and to maintain volunteer members. Brigade areas provide a very clear picture on maps of where Renewable Energy Zones should not be. We are genuinely attempting to maintain the CFA institution in our region which has been and will be fractured further by the renewables rollout.</p><p>The adequacy of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) relating to High Voltage Transmission Lines was questioned and fire fighter safety concerns identified with WRL and VNI West Transmission Line projects nearly 12 months ago but is yet to be delivered, all the while proponents of the renewables rollout have been able to play down safety concerns we have raised.</p><p>We need the support of the CFA to shine light on misinformation regardless of whether there are political ramifications of doing so, and to ensure SOPs pertaining to High Voltage Transmission, Mineral Sand Mines and Renewables installations err on the side of caution in proclaiming safe distances and procedures so that the reality of the risks they impose can be fairly assessed.</p><p>We maintain that brigades taking a perimeter only defence of renewables stance, where controlling an incident, will appraise both the risks of non action and the risks of action, and if considered sufficiently safe, take action where lives are considered jeopardised or external properties placed at higher risk due to non action. Similarly, our Brigade members will make the same assessment of their involvement at all operational turnouts.</p><p>We ask that the CFA and other members acknowledge our stance and if undertaking the same action, formalize their Brigade position with respect to availability for unrestricted protection of industrial renewable energy facilities, and communicate that position to their respective CFA District Command and Group Officers for their planning purposes pre fire season.</p><p>We can be contacted on the numbers below or by email at . </p><p>Sincerely, Firefighters Against Renewables Over Victoria</p><p>Contacts:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Peter Knights, Captain, Gre Gre Village CFA Brigade, 0427340166.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Jason Barratt, Captain, Traynors Lagoon CFA Brigade, 0437966246.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Simon Goode, Captain, Gooroc CFA Brigade, 0418369708.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Linda Taylor, Firefighter/Im.

Statements are not universally supported by forest scientists, and do not recognise the knowledge, expertise and credibility of Australia's world-leading forest scientists.</p><p>It is also disappointing that recent coverage has not included these other voices.</p><p>Forestry Australia is a not-for-profit, independent professional association with 1200 members. Our members are individuals who have high levels of scientific expertise and extensive operational experience.</p><p>They operate across all aspects of forest, fire and land management, farm forestry and tree growing. Some of our members are current or past employees of state forest agencies responsible for timber harvesting.</p><p>These forest scientists and professionals are among the most dedicated and passionate individuals, who make significant and under-acknowledged contributions to forest management, forest conservation and provision of renewable, sustainable and responsibly-sourced timber for the Australian public.</p><p>This contribution furthers our understanding of forest ecology and forest fire management. It also includes operational expertise in active and adaptive management options that are crucial for building climate resilience and mitigating wildfires.</p><p>These forest scientists make significant contributions to managing and conserving our forests for the benefit of society. They provide elite and specialised firefighting capacity to all major wildfire events, collect and apply seed to revegetate forests severely degraded bushfires, and are at the forefront of technological advancement such as drones and apps to record and monitor forest values.</p><p>In addition, they conduct the most comprehensive threatened species monitoring in this country, and oversee comprehensive management plans that provide high quality, sustainable local hardwood timbers.</p><p>It is time to move on from these tiresome, divisive and outmoded forest wars. Australia needs forest management decisions to be informed by pragmatic, open minded, evidence-based and credible voices who engaged in positive dialogue regarding future forest management. In doing so, it is only right that we recognise the immense positive contributions of the forest scientists and professionals who have dedicated their careers to evidence-based care for our forests.</p><p>Dr Michelle Freeman, President Forestry Australia Queries over Coliban's solar panels The Bendigo Advertiser of 26/3/24 quotes Coliban Water as saying its new 300 kW solar panel installation will reduce its carbon emissions by 6149 tonnes, equivalent to taking 2200 cars off the road annually.</p><p>Firstly, how can Coliban Water be so specific about the CO2 saved when it is well known that solar (and wind) energy production is very intermittent and variable?</p><p>Secondly, have Coliban Water factored in the embodied energy of the panels, i.e. the energy used in mining the raw materials, construction, shipping to Australia, installation and maintenance of the panels?</p><p>The embodied energy of solar panels is approx. 600 kWh per square metre, which should be factored into their plan to reach net-zero C emissions by 2030.</p><p>Thirdly, a plan to establish tree plantations was mentioned. This is good, provided that the tree species was suited to the selected land (and climate). If it was managed well it might sequester 200-300 tonnes (dry weight) of C per hectare over 50 years.</p><p>Peter Fagg, Blackburn Easter offers peace and hope The Salvation Army would like to extend an invitation to all and ask you to join us for one of our special Easter services.</p><p>With more than 300 local Salvo churches throughout Australia, we welcome you to experience the community and hope that The Salvation Army offers.</p><p>Each year, across our services, we help over 250,000 people in financial hardship, those experiencing homelessness or living in unsafe homes, people struggling with addiction and mental illness, and people feeling lonely, abandoned and hurt. Ultimately, we help people looking for hope and peace.</p><p>Our passion for helping others comes from the heart of what Easter is all about - Jesus.</p><p>On Good Friday, we commemorate the death of Jesus Christ. It was the most incredible sacrifice for all humankind. But the story didn't end there. God had a wonderful plan: to bring salvation and hope to the world. On Easter Sunday, we celebrate Jesus' resurrection, and the new life He offers to those who believe in Him.</p><p>Let me encourage you to find peace, hope and an authentic faith community at the Salvos this Easter. To find your local Salvos, visit salvationarmy.org.au/easter. God bless you.</p><p>Commissioner Miriam Gluyas, Territorial Commander, The Salvation Army</p><p>Send letters to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:addynews@austcommunitymedia.com.au\">addynews@austcommunitymedia.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc7uro93c512c5u2fx182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BNM-Y6J1-JD34-V1BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 30, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Future</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congresses</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environmental policy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

You should leave using the Ararat Halls Gap Road and head towards Ararat. When you leave remember to take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. In the car:</p><p>If you are travelling, do not enter the area. Make a u-turn and travel to safety. Slow down and turn on your headlights. Smoke will make it difficult to see. If you are unable to leave you should shelter indoors:</p><p>Close all exterior doors, windows and vents. Turn off cooling systems. You must take shelter before the fire arrives. The extreme heat is likely to kill you well before the flames reach you. Shelter in a room that has two exits, such as a door or window including one directly to the outside. It is important to be able to see outside so you know what is happening with the fire. If your home catches on fire and the conditions inside become unbearable, you need to get out and go to an area that has already been burnt. If you cannot get indoors, other last resort options include:</p><p>Shelter in the middle of a large open area like a ploughed paddock, football oval or sporting reserve. Get into a large body of water like a dam, lake, river, the ocean or inground pool. Try to protect yourself from the fire's heat. If you are caught in fire in your car:</p><p>Park behind a solid structure to block the fire's heat or pull over to cleared area. Try to position the car towards the approaching fire. Turn on your hazard lights and headlights. Close all windows. Turn off the air-conditioning and shut all the air vents. Turn your car engine off. Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a pure woollen blanket. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Trees can be extremely hazardous during a bushfire or high winds. Avoid standing, parking or travelling in areas of fire affected trees. Bushfires can generate extreme heat. Heat will kill you before the fire reaches you. Update (1.50pm): Dadswell Bridge residents have been told to leave as crews continue to fight fires in the region.</p><p>This Watch and Act message is being issued for Dadswells Bridge, Laharum, Ledcourt, Roses Gap, Wartook.</p><p>There is a bushfire at Grampians National Park, Mt Stapylton that is not yet under control. The bushfire is located east of Mt Stapylton and is travelling in a southerly direction. A wind change is expected around 2pm, which will cause the fire to change directions towards Dadswells Bridge and Ledcourt. Conditions can become very dangerous and unpredictable. This Watch and Act replaces the Advice message issued at 12.19. \"Don't wait, leaving now is the safest option - conditions may change and get worse very quickly,\" a Forest Fire Management Victoria statement said.</p><p>\"Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay.\"</p><p>Tuesday, February 13, is a Total Fire Ban for the Wimmera, Mallee and Northern Country fire weather districts; the Wimmera is rated as Catastrophic.</p><p>A Catastrophic Fire Danger Rating means conditions will be the most dangerous for a fire under the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System.</p><p>What you should do:</p><p>Monitor changes to the situation. Increased wind speed, change in wind direction, smoke or poor visibility can indicate the situation is changing. Protect yourself and your family. If you are away from home, do not return. If the situation changes or you feel unsafe you should leave:</p><p>Take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. Many people have died trying to leave at the last minute during fires. Travel to the home of family or friends that are away from the warning area or Horsham. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Bushfires can spread quickly and are extremely dangerous. Bushfires can generate enormous amounts of radiant heat. Heat will kill you before the fire reaches you.

Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.</p><p>One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.</p><p>Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.</p><p>\"We are facing a biblical catastrophe,\" said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. \"Our whole town is engulfed in flames,\" he told the Skai television channel.</p><p>Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.</p><p>\"Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly,\" Vathrakogiannis said.</p><p>The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.</p><p>A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said.

That makes this week's media release from New Zealand's Foodstuffs North Island quite remarkable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But before we get to its release, we may need to explain Foodstuffs to Australian readers. The company is New Zealand's largest retailer. It is a cooperative, operating under the brands New World, PAK'nSAVE, Four Square, Gilmours and Liquorland. Think of Coles, IGA and Dan Murphy's combined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In their media statement, Foodstuffs North Island did not mince their words on the state of retail crime in New Zealand. And their numbers are startling. They reported a 38 per cent increase in reported incidents of retail crime between February and April 2023 compared to the same period last year.</p><p>Incidents such as burglary, assault, robbery, and other aggressive, violent, and threatening behaviour are up 36 per cent for the same quarter, year on year. Shoplifting was up even higher - 57 per cent over the past 12 months.</p><p>\"Our grocers have never seen retail crime at these levels. It's an extremely concerning trend, and it's unacceptable,\" said Foodstuffs' chief executive Chris Quin.</p><p>And it is not just Foodstuffs. Rising crime in New Zealand is an issue for society at large. And if the cost-of-living crisis were not dominating New Zealand politics as much as it is, crime would be the number one issue in this year's election.</p><p>New Zealand used to be a peaceful country in which people had little reason to be concerned about crime. As recently as 2020, about one in eight New Zealand households did not lock their properties. Almost half of New Zealanders did not have locks on their windows, and about the same number did not lock their garages when their cars were parked inside.</p><p>New Zealanders felt safe back then. But things have changed dramatically, and not for the better.</p><p>New Zealanders believe that crime is a bigger issue now than five years ago, as per a recent poll for the New Zealand Herald. Two-thirds of Kiwis are more concerned that they may be a victim of crime today than they were five years ago. Only five per cent stated they were less worried about crime.</p><p>And no wonder: The data underlines that it is not just a matter of perception.</p><p>In the 2022 calendar year, police recorded 516 ram raids. That is when offenders drive stolen vehicles into stores to rob them - often not gaining more than petty cash and a few cigarettes.</p><p>Among the offenders identified, only 12 per cent were adults. The majority were teenagers, and ten per cent were even younger than 13 years.</p><p>Membership of gangs also seems to have increased. In 2016, there were 4,420 gang members on the police National Gang List, which now stands at 8,875. Every year, that list has grown by about 1,000 gang members. That said, nobody has an accurate figure on gang membership. It is essentially a list the police maintain and populate themselves, but at least it indicates that organised crime is not a marginal feature in New Zealand.</p><p>The organised nature of crime is also reflected in the Foodstuffs experience. \"The trend we're increasingly seeing is professional criminals who're stealing brand-specific goods to order,\" said Chris Quin. \"That's not something we've seen before at these levels.\"</p><p>Crime Stoppers, an independent charity that reports anonymous information to police, has launched a campaign urging people to report any suspicious activity related to ram raids.</p><p>The government's response to this crisis leaves much to be desired. Hiring an extra 1,800 police has not substantially increased the visibility of law enforcement in New Zealand cities. Apart from that, the government's main policy for dealing with retail crime has been a program subsidising fog cannons for shops and supermarkets.</p><p>While this may be a novel approach to deter retail crime, it remains a reactive measure that does little to address the root causes of the problem. It might make for good headlines, but it does little to quell the flames. It is akin to trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol.</p><p>More seriously, it appears the government has taken its eyes off the ball regarding crime and law enforcement. Indeed, statistics paint a stark picture of the crime situation in New Zealand under its Labour-led government.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2022, reported victims of crime increased by 12 per cent. This is a significant rise that underscores the growing concern among New Zealanders about their safety and security.</p><p>However, while the number of reported victims has been on the rise, the number of offenders arrested and convicted has been on a downward trend.</p><p>Arrests have decreased by 25 per cent, and convictions have fallen by 26 per cent over the same period. This suggests a widening gap between the number of crimes committed and the number of criminals brought to justice.</p><p>The number of people imprisoned has also seen a significant decrease, down by 45 per cent. This startling figure raises questions about the criminal justice system's effectiveness in deterring crime.</p><p>The situation becomes even more concerning when we look at the changes in reported crimes over the same period. Reported crime has surged by 33 per cent, yet police actions have decreased by 26 per cent. Convictions have also fallen by 25 per cent, and prison sentences have dropped by 38 per cent.</p><p>These figures indicate a troubling trend. As crime rates rise, the response from the criminal justice system appears to be flagging.</p><p>The implications of these trends for New Zealand society are profound. The rise in crime and decreased arrests, convictions, and imprisonments contribute to a growing sense of lawlessness.</p><p>This is not the New Zealand anyone knew, a country that has long prided itself on its safety and tranquillity.</p><p>The government's reactive measures, such as the fog cannon program, are insufficient. They may provide temporary relief but do not address the root causes of the crime wave.</p><p>New Zealand would need a different, proactive approach to crime prevention. This includes addressing social issues contributing to crime, such as poor education attendance and attainment.</p><p>The government should also reassess its approach to law enforcement. The decrease in police actions, despite the increase in reported crime, is a worrying trend. Where criminals do not need to fear being brought to justice, they will continue their activities.</p><p>In its recent media release, Foodstuffs has expressed a plea for assistance. And perhaps the path from New Zealand to San Francisco-style crime levels is shorter than one might have thought.</p><p>That is a concern for New Zealanders. And it should be a massive headache for the government this election year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dr Oliver Hartwich is the Executive Director of The New Zealand

nitf:lede=\"true\">The fight against a fire that prompted the evacuation of several towns south-west of Ballarat last week was aided by the blaze reaching an area of a previously carried out planned burn.</p><p>Crews were called to Staffordshire Reef Road near Jubilee Road, Newtown about 3.30pm on Tuesday, February 13, after the blaze sparked on private land during hot and windy conditions.</p><p>It came as Ballarat reached a top of 35.1 degrees at 12.30pm, with some wind gusts reaching 80kmh in the middle of the afternoon.</p><p>The fire burned into the Ross Creek State Forest as volunteers from the CFA and crews from Forest Fire Management Victoria battled the blaze in tough conditions.</p><p>An Emergency Warning and Watch and Act Warning was issued for areas including Newtown, Scarsdale and Staffordshire Reef, before Ross Creek, Smythesdale and Italian Gully were added to further warnings as fire reached the forest.</p><p>An FFMV spokesperson said the fire burnt about 563 hectares in the forest and preparations for an upcoming planned burn also helped with fire suppression.</p><p>The spokesperson said as of Sunday, February 18, the cause of the fire was still to be determined by fire investigators and police.</p><p>After the immediate threat of the fire impacting the nearby towns eased, residents speaking to The Courier said they were thankful for the firefighters from local and out of town brigades who battled the fire throughout the afternoon and overnight.</p><p>Ross Creek residents and General Store owners Anna Paxton and Ben Martin said they had seen CFA trucks coming from places they had never heard of.</p><p>\"The CFA guys and girls were incredible,\" Ms Paxton said. \"They just made sure people were safe.\"</p><p>Firefighting efforts continued into Wednesday, with aerial waterbombers continuing to dump water, bringing the blaze under control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

care with campfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That follows Forest Fire Management Victoria's revelation that 40 unattended or abandoned campfires were recorded across Victoria in one weekend recently.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hume deputy chief fire officer Aaron Kennedy said this was extremely disappointing given the potential for campfires to spark a bushfire emergency.</p><p>\"Unattended campfires are a really big problem for us across the North East,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's completely unacceptable.\"</p><p>Mr Kennedy said 10 per cent of fires that emergency services responded to resulted from flames escaping from unattended campfires.</p><p>That was alarming, he said, because if they did spread, they would impact communities.</p><p>\"We don't want to see that occur,\" he said.</p><p>\"We need to protect life, property and the environment and make sure a campfire is never left unattended, that they're fully extinguished with water and that before you leave they're cool to touch.\"</p><p>Mr Kennedy said people needed to be more vigilant when it came to lighting campfires, especially now with summer having begun.</p><p>\"The first question that people need to ask is, 'do I really need to light a fire at this time of year?',\" he said.</p><p>\"Typically we use fire for heating and for cooking, but what we suggest is that if you don't need a fire, don't light it.</p><p>\"If you can cook your food on a portable cooking device, then use that instead of lighting a campfire.</p><p>\"It reduces that risk, removes the risk of a campfire escaping and impacting communities.\"</p><p>Mr Kennedy said Forest Fire Management worked across 1.7 million hectares of public land.</p><p>\"As a state, we're responsible for the management of bushfires,\" he said.</p><p>\"Forest Fire Management Victoria has sufficient resources coming into the fire season; we have over 300 frontline firefighters, up to 200 incident management team personnel, and we work closely with our partner agencies as well, particularly the CFA.</p><p>\"We work together and cooperatively in the first aggressive attack of bushfires to protect life, property, and the environment.\"</p><p>CFA District 24 assistant chief fire officer Brett Myers said it was essential to \"work together closely, because at the end of the day, the community is our number one priority\".</p><p>\"Regardless of whose land is actually legislated to be managing that particular area,\" he said.</p><p>\"The important part is working together to make sure that all Victorians are safe leading into this fire season.\"</p><p>Mr Myers said the region was heading into a traditional summer, with some wet periods but also high temperatures.</p><p>He said with those temperatures and a level of dryness and wind it would create the potential for fires to spread quite rapidly, especially in grasslands.</p><p>\"The message for this year, particularly for areas of urban rural interface, is don't be complacent and make sure you've got a plan leading into this fire season,\" he said.</p><p>\"During the winter period, we did experience a large amount of rain and coupled with this warmer spring weather and leading into summer, that rain has created significant growth in grassland areas.</p><p>\"And now, particularly with this week, with some 34, 35-degree days, that grass is drying off very, very quickly, so what we're going to be seeing is a fairly normal fire season for north-east Victoria.</p><p>\"A normal fire season does bring a large amount of fires, though, so it's certainly something not to be complacent about.</p><p>\"There's going to be an abundance of grass that's available as fuel to burn.</p><p>\"That's something that people need to make sure they're not complacent about leading into this summer period.\"</p><p>Mr Myers said with the fire danger period that came into effect on November 27, people must comply with the conditions if they're using fire as a tool.</p><p>\"That means there is to be no burning off in the open air without a permit,\" he said.</p><p>\"If people are wanting to undertake welding or angle grinding, or even extract honey from bees, they do need to have a permit to do that or make sure that they are complying with certain conditions for undertaking those activities.</p><p>\"There's also a number of things that people can do.\"</p><p>Mr Myers said he would \"really encourage\" people to have a bushfire survival plan in place.</p><p>\"What that means is, 'what's going to trigger you to defend your property, what's going to trigger you to leave, where are you going to go, how are you actually going to find information about what conditions are and what fires are in your area?'.\"</p><p>For more

This is the only place.\"</p><p>Mr Barkla said fauna in the bush was already struggling after months of low rain and the burn would be catastrophic for future growth.</p><p>\"You can basically say this [bush] will be murdered.\"</p><p>FFMV said fire fuel management programs reduced the spread and intensity of bushfires and made suppression more achievable.</p><p>They also aimed to mimic the natural cycles of fire to suit plants and animals.</p><p>But Mr Wellard said research pointed to proceeding with the planned burn could do more harm than good.</p><p>\"We are arguing that leaving this [bush] for 150 years would mean it actually becomes a fire break,\" he said.</p><p>\"Burning it will turn it into fuel ... it will be fuel production ... it will become more of a problem.\"</p><p>Mr Wellard said common tree types which grew after planned burning also increased fire risk.</p><p>The group had contacted the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action to ask for specifics on why the 153-hectare section needed to be burnt but had not received an answer.</p><p>Protesters planned to camp out overnight Friday, April 26 and from 6am on Saturday.</p><p>The Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action was contacted for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc7v628cuqg2qzyxsfbvd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BWM-6JV1-JD34-V1BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 27, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental protection organizations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forestry hunt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protection of species</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

However, few investigations have inquired about the processes that produce and sustain hot and cold spots of child victimization. As a result, the mechanisms that produce the observed spatial clustering of child victimization, and hence \u201cwhy\u201d harms against children tend to cluster in space, remains unknown. Does the likelihood of being a victim of violence in one location depend on a similar event happening in a nearby location within a specified timeframe? Rather, are child victims of violence more likely to reside in suboptimal neighborhood conditions? This paper aims to present an analytical and theoretical framework for distinguishing between these locational (point) processes to determine whether the empirical spatial patterns undergirding child victimization are more reflective of the \u201cspread\u201d via contagion (i.e., dependency) or whether they are produced by neighborhood structural inequality resulting from spatial heterogeneity. To detect spatial dependence, we applied the inhomogeneous K-function to Los Angeles Medical Examiner data on child homicide victim locations while controlling for regional differences in victimization events (i.e., heterogeneity). Our analysis found strong evidence of spatial clustering in child victimization at small spatial scales but inhibition at larger scales. We further found limited support for the spatiotemporal clustering of child victimization indicative of a contagion effect. Overall, our results support the role of neighborhood structural vulnerability in the underlying mechanisms producing patterns of child victimization across Los Angeles County. We conclude by discussing the policy implications for understanding this spatial patterning in geographical context and for developing effective and targeted preventive interventions.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><h>Introduction</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a report issued by the World Health Organization (2016), the high rates at which children are victimized \u201cpaints an alarming picture of the extent to which children live with the impact of violence, in the absence of supports and services\u201d (1, p. 13). The pervasiveness of child victimization in the United States and around the globe has become a public health crisis of epic proportions. In the United States, violence is the second leading cause of death among children and teens and the leading cause of death for Black children and teens (Children\u2019s Defense Fund, 2020). The aftermath of violence alters the equitable distribution of a community\u2019s resources and magnifies existing social, economic, psychological, and health disparities across sociodemographic groups (Slutkin et al., 2018).</p><p>A plethora of real-world phenomena, including but not limited to child victimization, demonstrate epidemic properties similar to a contagious disease, but the causal mechanisms remain unknown (Christakis &amp; Fowler, 2013; Fagan et al., 2007; Funk et al., 2010; Loeffler &amp; Flaxman, 2018; Papachristos et al., 2015). At a population level, both behavioral and disease states are influenced by similar social and spatial risk and protective factors. Research conducted in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, demonstrated that rates of child victimization shifted, creating what some have called the \u201cco-occurrence of two public health crises\u201d (Shreffler et al., 2021). Increases in child victimizations have been attributed to caregiver disability (e.g., poor physical and health) (Milner, 2007; Oleck\u00e1, 2022), public health policy (e.g., education policy, safety legislation; Draus et al., 2017; Gijzen et al., 2014), and structural neighborhood characteristics (e.g., widespread layoffs, poverty) (Barboza-Salerno, 2024). Identification of ecological correlates that contextualize the social disease layers is critical, including the immediate (i.e., individual), distal (e.g., cultural), and temporal socioecological contexts that accelerate the trajectory of the co-occurring development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Therefore, the individual-context interaction, an essential ingredient for understanding the potential spread of child victimization, must be considered when developing interventions.</p><p>Social contagion is defined as the spread of behaviors and attitudes through crowds and other types of social aggregates from one person to another (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2023). Blumer (1939) defined social contagion as the transmission of ideas, feelings, or actions among individuals within a social context. He delineated two broad types of contagion: behavioral contagion, which involves the spread of specific behaviors or actions, and emotional contagion, which is the spread of emotions within a group. Previous research on child victimization contagion acknowledges that abusive behavior can spread via social contagion due to direct exposure to violence and aggression (Fagan et al., 2007; Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2020). According to social contagion theory, exposure to abusive behavior normalizes the occurrence of maladaptive behavior and creates an environment where future instances are more likely to happen. Over time, increased exposure heightens the likelihood of the behavior occurring and contributes to its spread to nearby geographical areas (Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2020).</p><p>Because social interactions are vulnerable to spatial and place-based effects, spatiotemporal modeling frameworks must be able to distinguish between clusters of behaviors produced by diffusion rather than the mere heterogeneity of underlying risk factors. However, although the concept of social contagion is well articulated, studies have yet to provide adequate empirical support for the untested proposition that social behaviors spread within confined geographic areas rather than being a product of neighborhood risk factors only (G. Barboza et al., 2022; Barboza-Salerno, 2020b). More specifically, we do not know whether the observed association between potentially violent and/or abusive behavior is more likely to result from a deterministic process that produces \u201chot spots\u201d of both or rather from co-location and/or physical distance.</p><p>To respond holistically to the public health crisis of child victimization, it is critical to identify neighborhoods that lack the necessary resources to respond at multiple contextual levels and the corresponding failure to implement effective preventive interventions. In this framework, child victimization is viewed not as an individual or cultural phenomenon but rather as the product of social interactions that are situated within the broader contexts in which those interactions take place (P\u00e9rez-Figueroa et al., 2022). For example, the past two decades have seen an emergence of empirical studies confirming that certain forms of child victimization (e.g., child physical abuse) are clustered across densely populated, urban environments and associated with specific \u201cneighborhood\u201d characteristics such as economic inequality, health equity, environmental justice, and/or educational attainment (Coulton et al., 2007; Freisthler, Merritt, &amp; LaScala, 2006). This work has identified neighborhood areas with higher rates of maltreatment that persist through time. Yet this work could be obscuring smaller geographic clusters that may change due to social processes rather than the structural conditions associated with where people live (Wolf, Freisthler, et al., 2017). A better understanding of the causal processes undergirding such patterns is important for interpreting social behavior and community norms around child protection across neighborhoods of varying spatial risk (Barboza-Salerno, 2020a).</p><p>Here, we argue that a clearer understanding of these processes will deepen our understanding of how child victimization is spread and transmitted at different spatiotemporal scales. Is the observed pattern more likely the product of exogenous or endogenous neighborhood characteristics or some combination of both? On the one hand, the spatial concentration of child victimization in each region may be produced by individuals living in proximity who share similar values/norms about violence, child-rearing strategies and/or who reside in an area for similar reasons. In this case, if norms change or a population with different norms moves into the area, these clusters may change accordingly. Also possible, however, is the higher risk of child victimization in areas characterized by fewer community-based resources, transportation, and housing insecurity, and an overburdened child welfare system. Without attention to building the necessary infrastructure to support families, these clusters may appear more \u201centrenched\u201d over time. Regardless of whether child victimization is produced through the spread of norms or the lack of resources, the aggregation of all child victimization incidents into \u201chot spot\u201d areas demonstrates a spatial pattern that looks similar regardless of the underlying cause. Different causes, however, could very well necessitate different types of preventive action (Eck et al., 2005).</p><p>Accordingly, a geographic cluster of child homicides is not sufficient to show a contagion process, especially if it is constrained by a particular event or results from an accumulation over time. Further, the underlying mechanisms may have space and time dimensions. As an example, an analysis that shows a spatial cluster that resulted from a murder-suicide of a family with seven children could emerge due to the psychopathology of the perpetrator (e.g., severe trauma experiences) or because of external pressures (e.g., job loss) of the perpetrator (i.e., the person who committed suicide). In other words, violence may be the product of an individual\u2019s response to specific circumstances and/or experiences rather than a structural or neighborhood condition. Here, since the violence is due to a specific pathological response in the perpetrator, regular yearly clusters of homicides in this area would be unexpected. Rather, we would expect the data to reflect more cases in short space and time intervals than would be expected if the data were randomly generated. On the other hand, if we change the context to the Great Recession of the mid-2000s, individuals who have lost a house, job, or both and who lack access to other resources to mitigate the effects of those circumstances may see violence as a \u201csolution\u201d to an unsolvable problem. To better identify this mechanism, we start with a more basic framework by introducing spatial and temporal aspects into the study.</p><h>Literature Review</h><h>Spatial and Spatiotemporal Studies of Child Maltreatment</h><p>Decades of empirical research reveal that child victimization tends to cluster in densely populated urban areas with high social fragmentation. Factors like housing vulnerability, neighborhood poverty, concentrated affluence, unemployment, alcohol availability, vacant housing, and racial segregation are consistently associated with increased risks of child harm (Barboza et al., 2021; Barboza-Salerno, 2020a; Barboza, 2018; Deccio et al., 1994; Klein &amp; Merritt, 2014; Freisthler, 2004; Freisthler et al., 2004). More recently, research has begun to address whether child victimization is spatially clustered or randomly dispersed, but this work focuses on child maltreatment. Analyzing physical child abuse point data using nearest-neighbor and single kernel density methods, Paulsen (2004) found a hot spot in the center of a large urban city (Paulson, 2004). Similarly, Shenoi et al. (2013) used the nearest-neighbor method on a dataset of child homicides in Harris County, Texas, finding 12 clusters, all primarily within the limits of Houston. Using case-control and Poisson spatial scan statistical methods on a dataset of child maltreatment fatalities and hospitalizations, Thurston et al. (2017a) found four clusters that moved across the county in time and space (Thurston et al., 2017a). Similarly, Barboza (2018, 2019, 2020b) identified space-time clusters of child maltreatment in Los Angeles County, California, and in the state of New Mexico. These studies focus on the place-based mechanisms producing aggregate observable patterns of child victimization rather than the role of both space and time to examine locational codependence between individual victimization events. The failure to examine dependency between events within short time intervals is an important limitation of past research because it provides evidence for contagion.</p><p>The social contagion of child victimization has been articulated but not studied directly as many datasets do not have required spatial resolution (see Freisthler et al., 2016, 2020; Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2020). As such, these small exploratory studies have yet to provide adequate empirical support for the untested proposition that child victimization spreads over a geographic area (Holinger et al., 1987) analogous to a disease capable of contagion (Loftin, 1986) rather than being produced by space-time heterogeneity (Loeffler &amp; Flaxman, 2018) or spatial spillover (Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2020). Considering the case of child maltreatment, for example, Freisthler and colleagues (2020) found that clusters of parents who use physical abuse and/or corporal punishment may shop at the same stores but do not provide evidence that actual contagion has occurred. A different study used a spatial contagion framework to examine whether child physical abuse incidents in one neighborhood influence abusive incidents in nearby neighborhoods (Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2020). The study focused on geographic proximity to determine spatial spread, which states that social behaviors, defined in the study as child physical abuse, are vulnerable to diffusion processes due to people in proximal social structures. Operationalizing co-location of child physical abuse as a function of neighborhoods, the study found evidence of spatial spillover that was evidence of contagion. The present study seeks to add to existing research using point pattern locations of child homicides to determine if the underlying socio-spatial process is more reflective of spatial dependence (i.e., \u201ctrue\u201d contagion) or spatial heterogeneity (i.e., \u201capparent\u201d contagion). In what follows, we center our discussion on contagion using network principles as a lens by which to focus on the spatial dynamics and structures that emerge from the underlying connections between individuals that produce the observed spatial patterns of child victimization in social context (Gonzalez Canche, 2019).</p><h>A Diffusion Framework for Understanding Child Victimization Contagion</h><p>A theoretical model of child victimization contagion must incorporate three key characteristics of infectious disease: clustering, spread, and transmission. Previous research confirms that many maladaptive social behaviors, including violent victimization, are highly clustered across space and over time (Barboza, 2018; Loeffler &amp; Flaxman, 2018; Papachristos et al., 2015). However, the causes of this observed clustering remain unknown: is it caused by spatial heterogeneity of underlying indicators (indicating only an apparent contagion process), or can it be attributed to spatiotemporal dependence (which would indicate a true contagion process)? Apparent contagion arises from neighborhood structural vulnerability that produces clusters of maladaptive behavior that vary in intensity in person-to-person transmission in which physical distance or social connection is used to capture relationships between individuals. In contradistinction to apparent contagion, another source of spatial clustering due to proximity of neighboring incidents arises from spatial dependence or true contagion. True contagion is more consistent with person-to-person transmission in which physical distance and/or proximity are used to capture relationships between victimization events. Empirically, true contagion exists when a given phenomenon exhibits a distinct, non- random geographical pattern in which higher incidences of an event are observed closer to the location where the initial incident occurred. In other words, the presence of child victimization in one location increases the probability that another incident will be found nearby. For example, true contagion results when cultural norms around the appropriateness of violence give rise to local sub-populations that \u201cspread\u201d violence to surrounding neighbors. True contagion is produced by correlated point processes that make it more likely to observe co-located behaviors.</p><p>In contrast to spatial heterogeneity, which can be identified using regression-based models, spatial dependence is best captured by point pattern methods and/or spatial network analyses (Gonzalez Canche, 2019). These characterize the transmission process, for example, by detecting spatiotemporal proximity to other victims or potential victims in space and over time. As noted by others (see for e.g., [Slutkin, 2013]), the speed of transmission, whether violence spreads more quickly than slowly, is an important characteristic of transmission or contagion dynamics. Studying the spread of violence in Chicago, Slutkin (2013) found that violence contagion is comprised of \u201cwaves upon waves\u201d of violent events due to their diffusion over time; thereafter, contact with new susceptible populations in new locations coupled with the emergence of new violence-precipitating factors results in new outbreaks. In contrast, there is some evidence that child victimization spread more slowly than other forms of violence. For example, using 12\u2009years of data tracking serious injury and death, Thurston et al. (2017a) found only four spatiotemporal hot spots shifting over time and space (Thurston et al., 2017a). In contradistinction, in the case of violence in Chicago, Slutkin (2013) found that violence spreads rapidly because one initial \u201cinfectious event\u201d can result in many subsequent cases (for example, in the case of gang violence). The same may not be true of the spread of harm perpetrated against children.</p><h>Moving Toward Contagion</h><p>A true social contagion process is naturally represented with spatial models in which connection probabilities are modeled as a function of the distance from spatial and temporal constraints. Due to data limitations, studies have relied on data aggregated to the county level, census tract, or, in rare cases, census block group levels. Reliance on areal data raises several methodological concerns. Results from small areas may be biased due to variance instability associated with the intrinsic heterogeneity of victimization rates computed for varying at-risk populations (Messner &amp; Anselin, 2004). Recent work has attempted to address this by using Bayesian models that deal with small areas and unstable estimates by \u201cborrowing strength\u201d from a location\u2019s neighbors (Waller &amp; Gotway, 2004). In addition, the use of areal data with defined but arbitrary boundaries may lead to improper inferences about the distribution of certain phenomena due to the ecological fallacy (Gibson et al., 2000) and the modifiable areal unit problem (Martin &amp; Bracken, 1991; Openshaw, 1984). While these have been assessed by examining child victims at differing spatial scales (see Lery, 2009), the concern is not fully mitigated.</p><h>Spatial Networks</h><p>Spatial heterogeneity is driven by external decisions imposed on systems (e.g., boundaries of zip codes, which change with postal regional demand), whereas true contagion involves decisions imposed on systems from within (e.g., individuals in an area refusing to take adequate precautions to prevent the spread of a fatal disease). The most difficult spatial phenomena may have characteristics of both. The conceptualization of dependency in shared spaces and/or places (Gonzalez Canche, 2019) may be useful to identify how being part of a network defined by close physical proximity can influence the behaviors and norms of nearby individuals. Importantly, a network lens allows researchers to posit questions that account for spatial dependence in ways that are not available using other statistical techniques. In the present case, for example, research has demonstrated an association between child victimization and substance use. Patterns of parents\u2019 substance use, including where and with whom a person drinks, have been found to alter the risk of specific types of harm to children (Freisthler, 2011; Freisthler &amp; Gruenewald, 2013; Freisthler, Holmes, &amp; Price Wolf, 2014, Freisthler, Price Wolf, &amp; Johnson-Motoyama, 2015). Using a geographical network analysis makes it possible to pinpoint the effect of local networks on perpetrators\u2019 behaviors and norms before assessing whether their common exposure to drugs or alcohol increases the probability of perpetration (Gonzalez Canche, 2019): are individuals located near others who misuse alcohol more likely to use physical aggression with children? Understanding these microcontexts provides a richer and more dynamical assessment of how nearby structures and circumstances further influence outcome dependence. Our proposed empirical models will allow us to disentangle these factors.</p><h>Research Question and Hypothesis</h><p>Clustering can arise from two non-exclusive pathways. In a true contagion framework, child victimization is assumed to locate randomly in space, while those that \u201cfollow\u201d these behaviors have a positive probability to locate close by. On the other hand, if exogenous conditions are determinative of the location of perpetration, apparent contagion is in place. These different processes lead us to posit the following research questions: (1) Are the locations of child homicide victimizations randomly distributed across Los Angeles County? (2) If child homicide victimizations are clustered across the county, was the clustering produced by apparent or true contagion? and (3) At what spatiotemporal scale can we expect the next child homicide to occur? We address these questions by using methods to detect whether child victimizations are co-located in both space and time (i.e., is there a space-time interaction) and by analyzing the spatiotemporal scale associated with the probability of observing the new child homicide closest in space and time to the one occurring before it. True contagion as a probable explanation (i.e., spread via social processes) is ruled out if space-time clustering is not observed because that means that events that are closer in space are not also closer in time.</p><h>Methodology</h><h>Study Design</h><p>In this exploratory, descriptive study, we examined whether homicides perpetrated against children under 6\u2009years of age clustered geographically further if any observed clustering can be attributed to a process of true contagion.</p><h>Data</h><p>Publicly available data from the Los Angeles Homicide Reports was used for this study (The L.A. Homicide Report, http://homicide.latimes.com/). The website includes all homicides committed in Los Angeles County that were investigated by the Los Angeles Department of the Medical Examiner-Coroner (ME-C). The ME-C is mandated by law to \u201cinquire into and determine the circumstances, manner, and cause of all violent, sudden, or unusual deaths; unattended deaths\u201d; and deaths where \u201cthe deceased has not been attended by a physician in the 20\u2009days before death\u201d (California Government Code Section 27491).1 The Python language was used to scrape the data from the website and save it to an Excel spreadsheet before being imported into the R programming environment. The data and code used for this analysis can be found at https://github.com/elisegia/coroner_data/blob/master/Final%20web%20scrap%20medium.ipynb.</p><h>Sample</h><p>Previous research has shown that the circumstances, perpetrators, and risk factors of homicides among very young children differ across many dimensions and should be analyzed separately (Finkelhor &amp; Ormrod, 2001). For example, homicides of infants and toddlers tend to be committed by family members, including parents or caregivers, and precipitated by abuse or neglect (Wilson et al., 2023). Therefore, we chose to analyze <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis>\u2009=\u2009473 homicides involving very young children under the age of 6\u2009years old that took place during the period spanning 2000 to 2021 (up through June). Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the sample. Fifty percent of the child homicide victims were identified as Latine, 29.7% were Black only, 11.7% were White only, and 4.9% were Asian, the remainder being some other race. Among homicide victims, 53.5% were male and 43.8% were female (with 2.6% unknown). The majority of victims were under the age of 1\u2009year old (54.2%). The most common cause of death indicated by the ME-C\u2019s officer was \u201cother,\u201d followed by blunt force trauma (19.2%) and gunshot wounds (12.6%).</p><h>Table 1.</h><p>Descriptive Characteristics of Child Homicide Victims in Los Angeles County.</p><p>Figures 1 and 2 show the temporal and spatial distribution of the child homicides from January 1, 2000, through June 2021.

In addition to the latitude and longitude, the death date, age, race, and gender of the child were recorded.</p><h>The Human Development Index</h><p>The Human Development Index (HDI; Social Science Research Council, 2016) was used to provide context to the victimization events. The HDI is a composite measure of child well-being created by the Social Science Research Council for Los Angeles County. The HDI is comprised of three essential measures of well-being including health, access to knowledge, and standard of living across multiple domains. The health indicator includes life expectancy at birth; access to knowledge encompasses two indicators: school enrollment for the population aged 3 and over and educational degree attainment for the population 25 and over; standard of living is measured using median personal earnings of full- and part-time workers 16 and over (Measure of America, n.d.). The HDI was calculated using data from the California Department of Public Health, Health Information and Research Section, Death Statistical Master File from 2010 to 2014, and population data from the US Census Bureau and the CDC WONDER Bridged-Race Population Estimates from 2010 to 2014. The HDI was calculated by first creating an index for each of the three dimensions separately to transform the indicators into a common scale ranging from 0 to 10. The results from the three scales are average to obtain on value between 0 to 10, with 10 representing the highest level of human development. More information about the HDI, as well as the actual data, can be found at https://data.lacounty.gov/d/j7aj-mn8v</p><h>Statistical Analysis</h><p>Geographical network analysis of point patterns is a multifaceted method that reveals meaningful structures and patterns in location data and helps to elucidate contagion processes across a geographic region (Gonzalez Canche, 2019). Spatial analysis using point pattern data overcomes the limitations of aggregation to provide further insight into the processes that drive child victimization clustering at different spatial scales (i.e., distances) (Podur et al., 2002). As such, we utilized primary and secondary point pattern methodology to examine the geographic clustering of child homicide events. First, the coordinates associated with each child homicide location were retrieved using the urllib, selenium, beautiful soup, and requests libraries in Python. To overcome the problem of varying geographic administrative boundaries, a raster layer was created using the county polygon shapefile with a 5,000\u2009km resolution to create a 24\u2009\u00d7\u200924 grid with 576 cells. The number of child homicides in each quadrat was computed using the rasterize function in R. Quartic KDE was used to smooth the density of the points using a bandwidth selected by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) (using the bw.diggle function in R).</p><p>To begin, first-order spatial statistics were used to quantify the relative intensity \u03bb(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis>) of point patterns of child homicides at or around each location <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> without using explicit relational data regarding inter-point information. Next, second-order statistics (i.e., K- and g- function) were used to assess spatial clustering only, that is, whether the homicide events cluster in space without regard to time. Spatial dependence is expressed as a second-order intensity \u03bb2=(x,y), where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> denote the coordinates of arbitrary points (Espa et al., 2010). A point pattern process is homogenous when the intensity does not vary across space, that is, \u03bb(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis>)\u2009=\u2009<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> for all <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x.</emphasis> The null hypothesis of homogeneity (i.e., Complete Spatial Randomness [CSR]) was tested using Ripley\u2019s K (Espa et al., 2010). Ripley\u2019s K-function denoted <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>), reports the expected number of additional points located in a circle of radius <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis> surrounding an arbitrary event. CSR assumes that the number of points (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis>) observed in a specific area follows a Poisson distribution with intensity \u03bb\u2009=\u2009<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis>/A, where A is the area of Los Angeles County; and (2) the actual locations are uniformly distributed over the region (i.e., each location is random and has the same probability of occurrence). The null hypothesis is that the point pattern is homogenous across the county; hence, rejecting the null hypothesis is evidence of spatial heterogeneity. In that case, the inhomogeneous K-function can be applied to the point pattern process using second-order, intensity-reweighted stationarity (see Baddeley et al., 2000) discounted for the effect of spatial heterogeneity (Espa et al., 2010). In cases where there are no spatial interactions between events, K1(d)=\u03c0d2. On the other hand, when K1(d)&gt;\u03c0d2 or K1(d)&lt;\u03c0d2, the point pattern is more (or less) aggregated compared to one drawn from an inhomogeneous first-order intensity <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bb</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis>) with no spatial interactions between events (Diggle et al., 2007). Both Ripley\u2019s K and the inhomogeneous K-function are available from the spatstat library in R.</p><p>Next, we addressed the question of whether the child homicide locations clustered in both space and time, that is, whether the homicide locations are space-time independent? For this analysis, the bivariate K-function from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">splancs</emphasis> library (Bivand, Rowlingson &amp; Diggle, 2017) in R was used to test the space-time interaction between events, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s, t</emphasis>). More specifically, this analysis addresses the question of whether events that are closer in space are also closer in time (Tonini, Pereira, Parente, &amp; Orozco, 2017). K(s,t) is computed as the cumulative number of cases that are expected within a given distance, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis>, and a specified time interval, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>, of a random case, divided by the expected number of cases per unit space and per unit time. In the absence of a space-time interaction, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s, t</emphasis>) is equivalent to the product of the purely spatial and purely temporal K-function. However, if space and time interact to generate clusters, the K-function difference will be greater than 0 (D(s,t) &gt; 0). D(s,t) estimates the cumulative number of cases expected within distance, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis>, and time interval <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>, of an arbitrarily selected case attributable to the interaction between space and time, scaled by the intensity (lambda). For given space and time separations, the proportional increase in cases attributable to space-time interaction is computed as D0(s,t)=D(s,t)Ks(s)KT(t).</p><p>To assess the significance of the K-functions used here (or its linearized transformation denoted L[<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>]), Monte-Carlo simulations of inhomogeneous Poisson processes were derived to obtain confidence envelopes. Monte-Carlo methods were used to simulate 999 CSR patterns for the construction of confidence envelopes used to test deviations from CSR. The edge correction was applied to account for edge effects near the boundary of the study area. A significant departure from the null hypothesis results when the observed L(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>) lies outside of the envelopes. Spatiotemporal thresholds were created using the Knox test (Knox &amp; Bartlett, 1964). The Knox statistic represents the number of \u201cclose\u201d pairs of events that occur within specified distances and times to compare the interaction between child homicide locations across different time/distance thresholds (Ornstein &amp; Hammond, 2017). The Knox statistic uses the observed data to simulate 999 Monte-Carlo simulations to derive the expected distribution under the assumption of independence. If the null hypothesis that the clustering is due to spatial or temporal clustering (but not both) is not rejected, then that is evidence against contagion. The null hypothesis is rejected when the estimated Knox statistic is greater than a statistically significant proportion of Monte-Carlo-generated Knox statistics. Finally, QGIS was used to map the point pattern locations of child homicides across key variables of the HDI and to compute the spatial correlation and descriptive statistics within child homicide quartiles.</p><h>Results</h><h>Are the Locations of Child Homicide Victimizations Randomly Distributed Across Space?</h><p>Child homicide counts were aggregated within each of the 272 neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. As shown by Table 1, more than one-quarter of the homicides came from only nine neighborhoods. To measure spatial influence, we first calculated the spatial weights matrix to represent the neighborhood structure and account for spatial dependence. Spatial connectedness was measured by a first-order queen\u2019s contiguity. The spatial weights matrix is represented by a matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">w</emphasis>ij such that the elements of the matrix\u2009=\u20091 if the geographical units are spatially connected and 0 otherwise. We then computed the minimum distance from each point to every other point and then the mean nearest-neighbor distance. The minimum and maximum distances between child homicide locations were 92.23 (~1/20 of a mile) and 17603.06\u2009m (~10\u2009miles), respectively. The nearest-neighbor analysis revealed a mean nearest-neighbor distance(nnd) of 1250.631 (standard deviation\u2009=\u20091359.249; minimum\u2009=\u20097.435; maximum\u2009=\u200911360.05) (see Figure 3).</p><h>Figure 3.</h><p>Spatial network of child homicide locations showing links to nearest neighbor.</p><p>Child homicide counts for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis>\u2009=\u200924 quadrants are shown in Figure 4, and the resultant counts and variances are shown in Table 2. The Chi-square test of CSR for the point pattern based on the quadrat count was statistically significant (\u03c72\u2009=\u20092372.5, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">df</emphasis>\u2009=\u2009435, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). The mean, variance, and variance-mean ratio (VMR) were .543, 3.24, and 5.962, respectively. Since a VMR\u2009&gt;\u20091 is strong indication of clustering, the calculated VMR suggests a highly clustered pattern. Further, the high variability in the VMR implies that there are many more quadrants containing fewer child homicides than would be expected by chance. Next, the cumulative frequency distribution of nearest-neighbor distances was computed from the child homicide locations (Figure 5). The cumulative distribution function, G(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>), represents the probability that a location involving child homicide will have a nearest-neighbor within distance <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d.</emphasis> The value of G for any distance, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>, tells us what fraction of all the nearest-neighbor distances in the pattern is &lt;<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>. In this case, as shown by Figure 5, when G(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>)\u2009=\u2009.5 (i.e., the median), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis>\u2009=\u20091,275. Therefore, half of the nearest-neighbor distances are less than 1,275\u2009m. Again, the G function shows that the homicides are very closely clustered together because G increases rapidly at short distances. These results strongly indicate heterogeneity in child homicides across the county.</p><h>Figure 4.</h><p>Quadrat counts of child homicides imposed on a 24\u2009\u00d7\u200924 grid in Los Angeles County, California, from 2000 to 2021.

The results confirm that child homicides cluster across the county but further indicate that the spatial dependence is very strong and statistically significant at very small spatial scales up to about 2,000\u2009m, whereas inhibition is evident at larger distances (~7,500\u2009m). This suggests a need to further investigate the spatial trends to assess how child homicides cluster at varying spatial distances.</p><h>Figure 6.</h><p>Lhat estimates for an inhomogeneous Poisson point process adjusted for intensity of child homicides across Los Angeles County. The chart shows spatial dependence up to about 2,000\u2009m and inhibition at larger distances (~7,500\u2009m).</p><h>Is the Observed Clustering Due to Apparent or True Contagion (i.e., What is the Spatiotemporal Scale of Child Victimization)?</h><p>Figure 7 demonstrates the varying spatial intensity of the point process (i.e., the homicide locations) for each year, indicating non-stationarity or inhomogeneity. Since a completely inhomogeneous point process for the homicide locations would indicate that all deaths took place at the same location, the results seem to suggest that the homicides were concentrated into hotspots with similar intensity over time. If child homicides are both spatially dependent and spread via contact, however, space-time clustering should characterize the data. This means that events that are closer in space are also closer in time. The Knox test results are shown in Figure 8. The Knox test was computed for between 0\u20135,000\u2009days and 0\u20135,000\u2009m. The Knox test revealed significant clustering in only one space-time category representing between [400\u2013800) m and [60, 90) days (Knox Ratio\u2009&gt;\u20092.2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>\u2009=\u2009.039). This result means that following an initial child homicide incident, another child homicide was more likely to occur within 400 to 800\u2009m and 2 to 3\u2009months of the initial event than would be expected if the times and distances were independent. To derive further insight, we calculated the probability of a child homicide happening within a 2-week time period at varying distances. The number of homicides was classified into 400-m intervals from 400 to 1,600\u2009m for 2- to 4-week intervals. The joint and marginal probabilities were then calculated for the discrete times and distances. The results confirmed that most (51%) of the homicides happen within small distances (&lt;800\u2009m) but that the days that a child homicide occurred were more heterogeneous. The likelihood of a homicide occurring within 400, 800, 1,200, and 1,600\u2009meters of the previous child homicide within the first two weeks is only 3%, 7%, 9%, and 10%, respectively. However, for all consecutive child homicides, the likelihood of occurrence within 400, 800, 1,200, and 1,600\u2009m is 15%, 51%, 66%, and 75%. The chances of a second homicide happening within 800\u2009m of another is greater than 50%, but the chances of a second homicide happening within 800\u2009m of another within a 2-week time frame is only 7% (Table 3).</p><h>Figure 7.</h><p>Kernel density estimation (KDE) of child homicides for each year of the study period.</p><h>Figure 8.</h><p>Monte-Carlo test of space-time clustering.</p><h>Table 3.</h><p>Probability of a Second Child Homicide Event at Varying Distances.</p><h>Is There a Relationship Between Spatial Dependence (Contagion) and Spatial Heterogeneity?</h><p>The child homicide locations were overlaid onto a map of the HDI by census tracts to explore the possible exogenous factors associated with victimization events. The HDI indicators were summarized within quantiles of child homicide counts. The results, which are presented in Table 4, show significant differences across quantiles and a strong and significant spatial association between the HDI and number of homicides in each census tract (see Figure 9). For example, the HDI for the census tracts in the first quartile (Q1) of child deaths is 6.403, but 3.926 for census tracts in the fourth quartile (Q4). Overall, there is a graded relationship between the indicators and child homicides, where the lowest quartile tracts have much higher mean scores across all indicators.</p><h>Table 4.</h><p>Means and Spatial Correlations of the Human Development Index, Items, and Subindices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Notes.</emphasis> Quartiles of child homicide deaths across key indicators from the Human Development Index (HDI).

A strong tendency for child homicide events to cluster at small distances during narrow time intervals is an indication that the cluster was characteristic of true contagion and suggests that child victimization is susceptible to social contagion processes (Huesmann, 2012; Papachristos et al., 2015). We further found that when a child homicide event occurs at one location, another victimization event is likely to occur nearby (between 400 and 800\u2009m) within a 2- to 3-month time frame. Therefore, the limited evidence we found for contagion suggests that it is a slow process and dissipates with distance. We further found a strong spatial association between neighborhood structural factors and child homicide locations, indicating that spatial heterogeneity is produced, at least in part, by structural disadvantage.</p><p>Regarding contagion effects, our results are consistent with other studies suggesting that behaviors associated with child victimization, including excessive physical punishment, may become normalized, which in turn contributes to its spread (Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2020). Whereas this research has focused on spatial spillover effects, our work examined spatial dependence defined as the likelihood of observing a future victimization event, and the spatiotemporal scale to which the next event is more probable. As there is compelling evidence that both mobility and communication are spatially dependent, with the frequency of both human behaviors degrading over distance (Deville et al., 2016), one possible explanation consistent with our results is that some of the violence perpetrated against children spreads through personal networks with beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that support violence (Papachristos et al., 2015). We can think of these networks as the disease source, much like a contaminated water supply. In this paradigm, abusive behaviors are normative within a person\u2019s social network. However, our results further demonstrated that not all child homicides could be explained by dependency or true contagion. This was shown by overlaying the point patterns of child homicides onto the human development index at the census tract level and examining descriptive spatial correlations between child homicide counts and indicators of structural disadvantage. Therefore, structural neighborhood characteristics are plausible mechanisms that impact one\u2019s susceptibility to social contagion or child victimization. This is consistent with other studies attributing spatial patterns of child homicides to neighborhood structural vulnerability, which persists over time. For example, it is known that alcohol outlet exposure and housing insecurity make children more susceptible to violence (Barboza-Salerno, 2020b; Freisthler et al., 2007). However, in the present study we further viewed child victimization as events produced by spatiotemporal point processes that generate patterns containing geographic locations and timestamps resulting in emergent social behavior. In examining interactions between events, we showed that the next victimization event is more likely to occur about 2 to 3\u2009months following and within 800\u2009m surrounding the first event. Thus, social contagion of child victimization is slower at covering greater distances compared to other forms of violence contagion, including gun violence (Loeffler &amp; Flaxman, 2018).</p><p>Whether or not personal networks are the original source of transmission, we can think of environmental factors operating as prevention efforts\u2014analogous to masks and vaccines for influenza\u2014in mitigating the transmission and spread of the phenomenon. Most child victims of homicide were under 1\u2009year of age and non-White (88.3%) who were living in the more impoverished and hyper-segregated areas of Los Angeles County at the time of their death, such as South Central and Long Beach (Yee, Bosler, Velasquez, Patterson &amp; Blackwell, 2020). These were also neighborhoods with the lowest scores on the human development index across multiple indicators of health, income, and education. It is worth highlighting that such areas of concentrated disadvantage are historically rooted in market practices of redlining, illegal real estate practices, gentrification, and race-restrictive neighborhood covenants, all of which segregated people of color into areas of inferior housing quality with limited potential for wealth accumulation (An et al., 2019) and resulted in violence (Rothstein, 2017). The subprime predatory practices which targeted residents in these areas only further cemented these areas as markets for investment (rental properties) excluding them from potential market forces that enhance largely owner-occupied neighborhoods (Dymski et al., 2013). Future work should continue to address the macro-contexts associated with child victimization in a socio-spatial framework to demonstrate the impact of these policies on harms perpetrated against children.</p><p>Overall, our findings are in accordance with previous research identifying highly vulnerable areas where combined influence of risk is concentrated. For example, Garbarino and colleagues (1978, 1980, 1992) surveyed residents from areas with similar socio-economic profiles but either high or low child maltreatment rates. The researchers found that in the low-rate areas, residents indicated much higher levels of social interaction and social support (Garbarino &amp; Crouter, 1978; Garbarino &amp; Sherman, 1980; Garbarino &amp; Kostelny, 1992). Here, we present evidence of spatial heterogeneity in child homicide locations within neighborhoods, but we do not investigate the characteristics of those neighborhoods in much detail. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms that produce spatial heterogeneity and dependence to provide more robust explanations for child victimization and abuse.</p><p>This study illustrates the tremendous contribution of advancing technology to the public health issue of child victimization. Our unique dataset is limited, however, by nuances and definition. First, child homicide as a contagion is imperfect, as this \u201cdisease\u201d has many underlying co-morbidities. Some filicides arise from revenge (e.g., after a divorce) or altruism (e.g., in the case of delusions that led the parent to believe the child is better off dead). Especially with psychosis-related homicides, the parent may have never previously demonstrated aggressive parenting or any propensity to violence. Second, the included events were just a subset of certain other populations. For example, children who are murdered are a subset of the larger population of children who are victimized at the hands of their caregivers or by community-based gun violence. Our dataset is a subset of all child deaths caused by homicide. We were not able to subset the child homicides by either manner or cause of death due to data limitations; nevertheless, research suggests that the majority of child homicides are caused by either parent inaction (neglect) or physical harm (Douglas &amp; Lee, 2020). It is very possible that disaggregating child homicides will yield different results, and we, therefore, cannot rule out the possibility of under-ascertainment bias. As well, we did not adjust for factors known to be associated with child victimization, such as regional poverty and/or racial/ethnic composition, as our goals were largely descriptive. Future work would benefit from expanding the present analysis to model child victimization using more advanced modeling frameworks, such as self-exciting spatiotemporal point process models (Reinhart, 2018). Finally, we have no information about the actual values and norms of perpetrators of harm against children but rather can only statistically test for the presence of dependence, which is an indication of contagion but not dispositive. However, in this paper, we have laid out a theory that can ground further discussions about the spread of child victimization and introduced geostatistical methods that are useful in describing the underlying patterns observed in existing datasets.</p><h>Limitations and Implications for Future Research</h><p>Future work should continue to examine the role of true contagion in child victimization as our results may not be generalizable across different contexts and time periods. Nevertheless, in addition to exploring contagion effects and visually represent incidents and clusters of offenses against children to approximate exposure to multiple cumulative risks (Bautista et al., 2008; Tanser et al., 2009), spatial point pattern analyses can be a critical component of program evaluation. This type of analysis can point to circumstances where reducing apparent contagion of child victimization would require broader intervention than child welfare agencies alone could provide. For example, interventions that only seek to provide additional and alternative social networks for parenting norms are unlikely to be effective on their own without considering the historical circumstances that produce spatial heterogeneity and vice versa. In the previously mentioned study of 12\u2009years of serious child maltreatment in a large metropolitan area, risk of death or hospitalization decreased with family\u2019s distance from family resource centers, suggesting that the centers were both well placed and insufficient as prevention efforts (Thurston et al., 2017b). Therefore, examining child victimization using socio-spatial models will give policymakers new insights into how complex processes interact under different socio-environmental constraints and in light of different activity spaces and mobility patterns. Child welfare authorities should routinely utilize information derived from spatial analyses to assess not only the location of prevention and intervention services but the sufficiency of these services alone to reduce negative outcome events in the neighborhoods they serve.</p><h>Supplemental Material</h><h>sj-docx-1-jiv-10.1177_08862605241245388 \u2013 Supplemental material for The Spatial Scale and Spread of Child Victimization</h><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-jiv-10.1177_08862605241245388 for The Spatial Scale and Spread of Child Victimization by Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno, Holly Thurston and Bridget Freisthler in Journal of Interpersonal Violence</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link to PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"10117708862605241245388\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"61903\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>An B., Orlando A.

Retired Monash University bushfire scientist David Packham said the old Forest Fire Danger Index forecast for Horsham on February 28 was just 56, compared to the new FBI's prediction that it would reach a catastrophic level of 99.</p><p>The forecast led to calls for 30,000 residents Victorians to leave their homes in Amphitheatre, Beaufort, Clunes, Elmhurst, Lexton, Glenbrae and Learmonth.</p><p>\"I feel the new index disastrously overrates the risk and will lead to a loss of faith in our warning system,\" Mr Packham said.</p><p>He said the old FFDI had proven itself extremely valuable since it was developed by CSIRO in the 1960s.</p><p>But he said the BOM had recently cut CFA volunteers' access to FFDI, forcing them to rely solely on the new FBI.</p><p>Last Friday, BOM's weather page for Victorian fire management agencies - CFA Volunteers - showed the FFDI had been frozen since February 6.</p><p>A BOM spokesman said it had \"transitioned to calculating the FBI in line with the national adoption of Australian Fire Danger Rating System\".</p><p>\"As a result, the FFDI web page on the bureau website is no longer operational and has been retired as part of the move to the new system\".</p><p>Yet on Monday this week the BOM appeared to reinstate a modified version of the FFDI, creating a map of Victoria's latest wind, relative humidity and temperature (shaded) observations, which appears to have corresponded to the old FFDI and fire danger rating system.</p><p>When asked what evidence the BOM had used to shift to the new index and the huge difference between the FBI and FFDI values generated on February 28, the BOM spokesperson said \"this is a question best directed to the Victorian CFA\". A note to the BOM's fire weather forecast states \"fire weather district ratings are provided in conjunction with fire authorities\". \" CFA show of strength, Page 9</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-ceae6774df2711ee807ad3c2d66dd4fc14e91488a23bb65b44e00c3e566d554c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJ4-KWB1-F0JP-W1D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"379\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 13, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

being planted,\" they said.</p><p>Bill Ellis, an ecologist at the University of Queensland,wants to see better public access to information on what's happening to species like the koala, especially around habitat clearing.</p><p>\"There is very little by way of transparent reporting \u2014 so it takes a while to understand the scale of this,\" he said.</p><p>\"The average person can't get access

for heart, lung and brain conditions was recorded during the Black Summer.</p><p>In Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, an 85 per cent increase in hospitalisations [46 in total] for cerebrovascular conditions, including stroke, occurred in the week from January 5, 2020.</p><p>And on the Central Coast, a 96 per cent increase in hospitalisations [42 in total] for heart attacks occurred in the week

Today, crews will continue to patrol containment lines and use under more favourable weather to bring the fire under control. Helicopters using thermal imaging cameras continue to identify hot spots to have firefighters mop up and black out. The Newell Highway is now open. What you need to do</p><p>If you are in the area of Baan Baa, Willala, Goolhi, Rocky Glen, Jack Creek, Bohena Creek, Stannix Park and Wynella, stay informed because conditions could change. Follow your Bush Fire Survival Plan. If you do not have a Bush Fire Survival Plan decide what you will do if the fire gets closer. Leaving early is your safest option. Decide where you and the people you live with will go. This could be with family or a friend away from the fire. Watch out for emergency services personnel and follow their directions. Evacuation Centres</p><p>The evacuations centres at Narrabri and Gunnedah have now closed.</p><p>Other Information</p><p>Stay up to date on bush fires in your area by checking Hazards Near Me, the RFS website, listening to your local radio station, or by calling the RFS Bush Fire Information Line on 1800 679 737. For assistance with large animal safer places, please contact Local Land Services on 0407 940 970. For information on road closures, check Live Traffic NSW. Monitor weather conditions and weather warnings at Bureau of Meteorology.

around habitat clearing.</p><p>\"There is very little by way of transparent reporting \u2014 so it takes a while to understand the scale of this,\" he said.</p><p>\"The average person can't get access

One of the grievances with the Albanese government described by David Jochinke, NFF president, refers to the forthcoming ban of live sheep exports, which instigated a vote of no confidence in the government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It seems that New Zealand has already banned live animal exports (from April 2023) and the UK looks set to follow suit.</p><p>And up to 99 per cent of the Australian live exports come out of Western Australia alone; a state poll there found that 70 per cent supported the ban.</p><p>Furthermore, of the lamb and mutton exports from Australia, just 2 per cent consisted of live animals.</p><p>So, continuing with this ban (from 2028) will have barely any effect on the lamb and mutton trade.</p><p>Gordon Flynn, Ballarat Aid is there to get out of live sheep It is not good enough to dismiss or overlook the suffering inflicted by the live sheep trade, as one correspondent appears to do (\"Sheep trade vital to global interests', Letters, TWT, May 22).</p><p>Presumably the 71 per cent of West Australians (69 per cent in rural and regional WA) who want the live sheep trade to end are better informed.</p><p>The decision to cease the trade surely comes as no surprise. The live sheep export industry has been in decline for years and its cessation became Labor policy in 2019.</p><p>However, given that NZ and the UK have already banned live animal exports, Australia's four-year phase-out feels far too long.</p><p>I certainly hope that those involved in the live sheep export trade take advantage of the $107 million government transition support and depart the industry sooner rather than later.</p><p>Isabelle Henry, Ascot Vale Wombat action is logging by stealth Gary McIntosh is absolutely correct that it is a matter of concern that logging equipment was damaged in apparent response to Forest Fire Management Victoria operations in the Wombat Forest. (Letters, TWT, May 22).</p><p>But it also concerning that FFMV are, contrary to their brief, wrongly logging live trees far from tracks and which present no potential fire threat.</p><p>Chris Taylor, a research fellow at the Australian National University Fenner School of Environment and Society, recently visited the Wombat Forest.</p><p>In his experienced opinion, it resembled an industrial-scale logging operation, and not a fire-protection one.</p><p>Dr Taylor added that it is unclear what regulatory framework FFMV operates under and that we may be \"entering into a lawless logging regime, which (is) very, very concerning\".</p><p>Ben Gill, a Victorian National Parks Association conservation campaigner, also points out that FFMV logging contractors frequently remove saleable saw, logs but leave behind the tops of the trees, or \"fine fuels\".</p><p>It seems there may be fault on both sides in the forests.</p><p>Lesley Walker, Northcote Coalition needs a rethink on energy With the CSIRO finding that nuclear energy is a highly expensive option for Australia with estimated delivery as late as 2040, the Coalition should take stock and review energy and emission reduction options with an open mind.</p><p>Not just one starting in some hypothetical distant future after coal-fired power plants are expected to have closed.</p><p>Jim Allen, Panorama SA Go to the regions to buy first home Regions need to be the place of, and for, opportunity for young families to buy a home build a secure life and future.</p><p>The city/suburban dream of owning a home is beyond many and, if taken up, loaded with stress and pressure.</p><p>It is time to have some reports/promotions of how a region can be the place to own a home and live the dream out of the suburbs with less stress.</p><p>Teachers, doctors, nurses, PAs, and many work choices are in regions and the home mortgage is possible.</p><p>Regions have much to offer young families and regions need many skills. Capital cities are beyond many first home buyers and that needs to be faced up to and for people to take a look beyond the city to buy a home.</p><p>Stuart Davie, Corowa NSW</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-1ff2f6ee11a611ef9bb689296a2ec6ddd75034a133263b3608ac7ebe9a6986c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C4J-FG71-F0JP-W1P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 29, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D4ER</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK EXPORTS &amp;

Black Summer'</h><p>Lots of eyes are fixed on the centre of Cobargo's main street, where land remains vacant.</p><p>There's progress on that front, with construction finally underway on one of those sites, which is set to be transformed into the Cobargo Bushfire Resilience Centre.</p><p>The land was donated by the Ayliffe family, whose shop was destroyed in Black Summer.</p><p>Vice-chair and Cobargo local Rhonda Ayliffe admits the rebuild has been slower than ideal.</p><p>\"I did not expect that it would take four and a half years to come out of the ground, but here we are,\" she said.</p><p>\"COVID was a blip compared to the minefield, the absolute quagmire, of bureaucracy we have had to deal with ... it's beyond frustrating.\"</p><p>It is hoped the building will be finished in a year's time and open to the public in early 2026.</p><p>Ms Ayliffe, who is also a PhD candidate at the University of Canberra, said despite the hurdles she had experienced on the way, seeing construction underway had brought a sense of excitement to her and the broader community.</p><p>She believes it could take a decade for the region to fully recovery, but what Cobargo went through remains in the public's heart.\u00a0</p><p>\"Research shows that it's a minimum 10-year period just to get started with these things,\" she said.</p><p>\"Cobargo is, in many respects, the face of Black Summer.\"</p><p>\"That gives me great hope for when we do have the heart of the town rebuilt, that people will come.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

These suburbs are about 70km northwest of Ballarat.</p><p>Firefighters have managed to slow the spread of the fire but emergency services warn the conditions can change.</p><p>People from surrounding towns were earlier asked to leave their homes immediately. They have been asked not to return until the CFA says it is safe.</p><p>These suburbs include Avoca, Bayindeen, Chute, Elmhurst, Mount Lonarch and surrounds, Main Lead, Raglan, Middle Creek, Waterloo, Glenlofty, Glenpatrick, Glenshee, Green Hill Creek, Nowhere Creek, Amphitheatre, Crowlands, Eversley, Landsborough, Percydale and Warrenmang.</p><p>A watch and act warning remains in place for the towns as the Bayindeen bushfire remains out of control.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's Angus Hynes said Saturday was expected to be more benign and settled weather as firefighters battle the blaze.</p><p>He said the slightly cooler and more humid conditions would help quell the fire risk.</p><p>About 500 firefighters are expected to attend the blaze on Saturday, along with water bombing aircraft.</p><p>Assessment teams are surveying damage from the air while it has also become safe for these crews to attend the fire-struck areas to find out the extent of the damage.</p><p>Farmers have been particularly affected by the bushfire with cattle and sheep impacted by the blaze.</p><p>Road closures are in place to prevent motorists straying into the fireground.</p><p>Conditions are expected to ease to continue easing on Saturday with cool and humid conditions remaining, but midweek the weather will begin to shift again.</p><p>Wednesday has been described as a potential \"spike\" day as the mercury is set to again soar above 40 degrees.</p><p>\"We'll be working really hard to do as much as we can to contain this fire in time for that spike day on Wednesday,\" Chief Fire Officer of Forest Fire Management Chris Hardman told the Nine Network.</p><p>The cause of the blaze is being investigated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

She said those issues were outside the scope of her inquiry.</p><p>Teresa O'Sullivan handed down her findings on March 27 into the Black Summer bushfires, including into the deaths of 25 people across the state, seven of them fire-fighters.</p><p>She made 28 recommendations to the RFS commissioner, the NSW Police commissioner and to the CEO of Essential Energy.</p><p>In relation to the Grose Valley fire which burnt 22 homes and 30 out-buildings in the northern stretch of the Blue Mountains local government area, she found that it was started by the strategic backburn at Mt Wilson.</p><p>It was meant to halt the progress of the massive Gospers Mountains fire, the so-called \"mega blaze\" which burnt 512,600 hectares over 15 weeks and was the largest single forest fire in Australian recorded history.</p><p>Ms O'Sullivan said the backburn was lit on December 14 when winds and humidity were predicted to be as good as conditions could get during that extremely dry and dangerous summer.</p><p>But the humidity levels dropped and the wind direction changed at lunchtime, the easterly turning south-westerly which pushed the embers across Mt Wilson Rd and eventually into the Grose Valley.</p><p>Residents whose properties burnt the next day had told the inquiry the emergency warnings they were given on December 14 and 15 were not timely or appropriate and gave them little indication of the level of threat they faced.</p><p>Ms O'Sullivan noted that some communities affected, including Mt Wilson, had only one road in and out, \"leaving them with little option but to shelter where they could and brace for impact. Even those who were on notice of the oncoming fire were not prepared for its relentless ferocity and speed.\"</p><p>But she made a recommendation that the RFS develop training for public liaison officers addressing the \"significance of early warning to communities with limited access to reliable communication systems\".</p><p>She also recommended to both the RFS and NSW Police commissioners that if it was suspected that a bushfire had started because of a backburn, police could ask for modelling from the RFS to consider what might have happened if the backburn hadn't taken place.</p><p>The residents had also asked that the NSW Government formally apologise to residents, fire-fighters and communities impacted by escaped backburns and that it set up a compensation scheme for those affected by the Mt Wilson backburn and other backburns.</p><p>But Ms O'Sullivan said it wasn't appropriate for her to make such recommendations as the NSW government had not been represented at the inquiry by a capable department and had not been asked to comment on the appropriateness or practicality of any such recommendations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BLUMOU-doc7utqasxpnptmppwx182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BLUMOU2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BPG-TXP1-JD34-V22K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385916</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Blue Mountains Gazette</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Sunday's event ties in with a Christmas market at Myrniong's St Anne's Winery - half an hour's drive east of Ballarat - with action between 10am and 4pm. It also comes 40 years after a catastrophic blaze killed two firefighters at Greendale and burnt through the Wombat and Lerderderg forests for 55 days. CFA Pentland duty group officer Dale Salathiel said it was a chance for the community to ask questions, get to know the people defending their community and identify opportunities. \"We really want to have some face-to-face interaction and revitalise networks and relationships. We need to increase awareness and education around the role and purpose of emergency service organisations.\" Other agencies will include the State Emergency Service, Ambulance Victoria, Forest Fire Management Victoria, St John Ambulance, Fire Rescue Victoria, the Red Cross, Life Saving Victoria, the Victoria Council of Churches Emergencies Ministry (chaplains), Crime Stoppers, Victoria Police Assistance Line and Moorabool Council.</p><p>OzLotto Draw 1555.

Now he lives on the road, on couches and above pubs, chasing temporary work around Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I have no fixed address any more,\" Lockett said. \"You're constantly chasing work, wondering where you'll be, where you'll end up.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Native logging was formally banned in the state from yesterday, but most work had already wound up. First there were Supreme Court injunctions that found the state-owned logging agency, VicForests, had failed to protect endangered gliders. Then in May, the state government gave six months' notice that it would bring forward its ban by six years from 2030 to 2024.</p><p>\"It makes it real that we've got nothing to go back to,\" Lockett said of the January 1 deadline. \"On the other hand, the reality was we had nothing anyway.\"</p><p>Lockett, 47, has been ferrying logs from the High Country to sawmills for more than 25 years. When the going was good, he had a home base to return to each night. But now he takes whatever contracts he can, for weeks or months at a time. He tries to sleep on couches but often spends $100 or more a night on cheap accommodation. It is an exhausting way to make a living.</p><p>\"I have no option,\" Lockett said. \"Just gotta keep going.\"</p><p>He still owes about $120,000 on specialised logging trailers, which he says are worth scrap now that there's minimal work. He is yet to receive financial support from the state because he was a subcontractor not directly employed through VicForests.</p><p>In December the government expanded its support package to pay for equipment owned by haulage subcontractors, like Lockett, as well as wood chip truck operators, road contractors, and seed collectors.</p><p>The government will foot the cost of staff redundancies and some businesses will receive termination payments, generally lower than the value of contracts they held.</p><p>Tim Lester, general manager of the Australian Forest Contractors Association, said the package failed to recognise the value of businesses lost because of the government's decision.</p><p>Brendon Clark has been collecting seeds, mostly for alpine ash trees, for 20 years to help the state regenerate after forest fires, but his contracts with VicForests ended in June. He said there was now too little work to store seeds for future fires.</p><p>Clark and silviculture scientist Owen Bassett, from Forest Solutions, said there were six tonnes of alpine ash seeds in the state's bank. Bassett said that was enough to regenerate after one large bushfire but 20 tonnes should be set aside.</p><p>Under the updated transition package, the 15 staff Clark has lost since last Christmas will have their redundancies covered by the state.</p><p>\"I've had to sack people that have worked for me for years. I'm just making my wife redundant now,\" the 42-year-old said. \"They're giving us no compensation for decades of service and hard work unless you hold a supply agreement. I just want our industry treated fairly, that's it. I don't want any more [than is fair].\"</p><p>Forest fire management has relied on the logging industry to manage roads, create containment lines and lop dangerous trees. How forest fires will be managed is a lingering concern to the industry.</p><p>Harvest contractors have been offered five-year contracts with Forest Fire Management Victoria to do bushfire reduction works, the government said.</p><p>\"More than 1000 native forestry workers and family members have registered with the Victorian Forestry Worker Support Program and are receiving one-to-one case management for financial assistance, health and wellbeing, training and employment support,\" a spokeswoman said.</p><p>\"More than 2300 training and employment activities are under way, including developing existing skills and pursuing training opportunities directly linked to employment opportunities.\"</p><p>In all, the government said its support has added up to more than $1.2 billion. It has always argued that ongoing court action made native logging unviable and that bringing the statewide ban forward to January 1 gave the industry certainty and the tools to transition.</p><p>The native logging ban followed decades of advocacy by environmentalists, some of whom called on Victoria to expand protection for native forests.</p><p>\"Let's get on with creating new national parks to save gliders, owls and other precious animals and plants from extinction, protect our drinking water, and safeguard our climate,\" Environmental Justice Australia campaigns manager Luke Chamberlain said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7tic3guzzuepunpg9gc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B0V-P1W1-JD34-V0P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
