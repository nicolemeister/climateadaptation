working day and night to put out potential spot fires and flare-ups.</p><p>\"We've got a number of tankers, heavy plant equipment like bulldozers and harvesters, as well as the aircraft available to us,\" Mr Burns said who said the weather could lead to parts of the fire becoming active again.</p><p>\"We are doing our utmost to ensure [a flare-up] doesn't happen again.\"</p><p>He said the focus now was on ensuring hot material did not escape the perimeter.</p><p>\"We are systematically working around the perimeter of this fire, detecting and extinguishing all those hot spots or burning bits of material to ensure that they can't give rise to the fire escaping,\" Mr Burns said.</p><p>Mr Rankin said the perimeter was very long so the team was prioritising work at spots where the fire was most at risk of escaping.</p><p>\"We are quite confident we will be able to continue to hold that control line,\" he said.</p><p>\"What we are finding is that even on mild days with not too much wind, the fires are running quite quickly through the grass and into the forest.\"</p><p>High alert over hot weather forecast</p><p>Below average rainfalls and hotter temperatures over the past few years have created a large amount of fire fuel, including fallen leaves and dry grass.</p><p>\"Our fire season really started in Gippsland in August and September, so that really goes to show the underlying dryness in the landscape,\" Mr Burns said.</p><p>Dry conditions means an active fire can quickly get out of control but in addition, one of the less visible aspects of the Rosedale fire is underground peat.</p><p>Peat is a highly combustible material, almost like coal, that can continue burning for months.</p><p>\"The concern for us with this particular fire is that it will continue to burn underground, and potentially come to the surface at some point when the weather conditions become warmer,\" Mr Burns said.</p><p>But Mr Rankin emphasised that the peat in this fire was different to the <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2018-05-07/peat-fires-south-west-victoria-appear-to-be-out/9734054\">peat that burned in south-west Victoria last year</url> releasing a large amount of carbon

few bits of peat that we have inside the line.\"</p><p>Nervous time for local farmer</p><p>The fire means Longford hay and silage farmer Brad Cumming has had a stressful week.</p><p>\"We obviously had the warning there was a fire south of Rosedale and we came down and did what we could before leaving the area,\" Mr Cumming said.</p><p>He returned on Saturday morning to find significant damage to his property.</p><p>\"We lost all our front fences and our trees and windbreaks, a couple of internal fences and all the hay and silage,\" he said.</p><p>But he is grateful no lives have been lost.</p><p>Warning to community</p><p>While authorities appear confident the fire is mostly under control, they are warning the community to remain vigilant and continue to monitor emergency warnings.</p><p>Firefighters will continue working for weeks to come.</p><p>\"At the point we are at [with] this fire, we've slowed the fire right down,\" Mr Burns said.</p><p>\"It's not getting any bigger, but it's what I refer to as the hard dirty work or the grind.\"</p><p>Mr Cumming said he would not be taking any chances this weekend.</p><p>\"Hopefully we've been burnt out enough now and

What is the connection between climate change and the latest severe bushfires?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, has made his views clear: talk of climate change in connection with these bushfires is \"the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, as Sydney braces for its first ever day of catastrophic fire danger, it's worth recapping what scientists think about the links between bushfire risks and a warming world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is there a link between climate change and more severe and frequent bushfires?</p><p>How do scientists measure fire danger?</p><p>The likelihood of hostile extreme weather can be measured in a range of ways. For bushfires, scientists look at the<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bushfirecrc.com/sites/default/files/managed/resource/ctr_010_0.pdf\"> McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index</url>, developed in the 1960s by CSIRO scientist A.G. McArthur to forecast how weather would affect fire behaviour.</p><p>As the name suggests, the gauge examines the risks to woodlands from fire using a combination of rainfall or drought conditions along with predicted wind speeds, temperature and relative humidity.</p><p>Typically, winter and spring see the highest ratings on this fire danger index in the north and these move southwards as spring makes way for summer.</p><p>How bad is catastrophic then?</p><p>Fire and emergency authorities <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>started to review response plans in 2008</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> to adjust to \"the growing intensity and severity of recent bushfire experiences across the country\".</p><p>Then Black Saturday's bushfires erupted in Victoria on February 7 in 2009, leaving 173 people dead. That event \"brought into sharp focus the possibility that the current legislation, systems, practices andprocesses to support effective community safety outcomes may no longer match the increasing levels of risk and expectations\", a bushfire warning taskforce report noted.</p><p>The highest fire danger rating was set as \"catastrophic\" for index readings of 100 or more. (In Victoria, they are dubbed Code Red.) The basic message was boiled down to: \"For your survival, leaving is the best option.\"</p><p>The dire assessment is because some fires on such days are likely to become \"uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving\" and \"there is a very high likelihood that people in the path of the fire will die or be injured\", the taskforce said.</p><p>Melbourne reached an index reading of about 150 on Black Saturday, according to Ross Bradstock, director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong. For Sydney to exceed 100 on the index could be a first, at least for its Observatory Hill and Sydney Airport sites, where the weather is measured.</p><p>Does climate change play a part?</p><p>Yes, there is a link between climate change and the prevalence and severity of fires. In fact, the research identifying a link between fires and climate change is \"old hat\", says Professor Bradstock. \"The research has all been done. We don't need to keep doing it.\"</p><p>As the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO pointed out in last year's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/State-of-the-Climate-2018.pdf\">latest State of the Climate report</url>, the number of the most extreme 10 per cent of fire weather days based on the fire danger index \"has increased in recent decades across many regions of Australia, especially in southern and eastern Australia\".</p><p>\"There has been an associated increase in the length of the fire weather season,\" it said. \"Climate change, including increasing temperatures, is contributing to these changes.\"</p><p>Or, as Hamish Clarke, a former NSW government scientist and now with the University of Wollongong, puts it: \"Across the country, at a number of high-quality long-term weather stations, there had either been an increase, or no change [in the fire danger index]. We didn't find a significant decrease anywhere.\"</p><p>In general, one consequence for fire authorities is that the fire season is getting longer. In eastern Australia, that means fire risks start to increase earlier in the spring and last longer into the autumn. The window for hazard-reduction burning is shifting into winter - if it's not too damp to do it.</p><p>How human activity and natural climate variability factored in bushfire ratings increases from 1973 to 2017 was the focus of research by Sarah Harris, from the Victoria's Country Fire Authority, and Chris Lucas in September.</p><p>While rainfall changes from one year to the next, with phenomena such as El Ninos in the Pacific and shifting Indian Ocean conditions playing a role, the researchers' findings were conclusive:</p><p>\"We propose that anthropogenic [human-led] climate change is the primary driver of the [upward trend in the fire danger index], through both higher mean temperatures and, potentially, through associated shifts in large-scale rainfall patterns.\"</p><p>How unusual is this year?</p><p>Depending on where you are, very usual. NSW, for instance, could see a million hectares burned so far this fire season within days - if it hasn't already done so.

For bushfires, scientists look at the<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bushfirecrc.com/sites/default/files/managed/resource/ctr_010_0.pdf\"> McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index</url>, developed in the 1960s by CSIRO scientist A.G. McArthur to forecast how weather would affect fire behaviour.</p><p>As the name suggests, the gauge examines the risks to woodlands from fire using a combination of rainfall or drought conditions along with predicted wind speeds, temperature and relative humidity.</p><p>Typically, winter and spring see the highest ratings on this fire danger index in the north and these move southwards as spring makes way for summer.</p><p>How bad is catastrophic then?</p><p>Fire and emergency authorities <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>started to review response plans in 2008</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> to adjust to \"the growing intensity and severity of recent bushfire experiences across the country\".</p><p>Then Black Saturday's bushfires erupted in Victoria on February 7 in 2009, leaving 173 people dead. That event \"brought into sharp focus the possibility that the current legislation, systems, practices andprocesses to support effective community safety outcomes may no longer match the increasing levels of risk and expectations\", a bushfire warning taskforce report noted.</p><p>The highest fire danger rating was set as \"catastrophic\" for index readings of 100 or more. (In Victoria, they are dubbed Code Red.) The basic message was boiled down to: \"For your survival, leaving is the best option.\"</p><p>The dire assessment is because some fires on such days are likely to become \"uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving\" and \"there is a very high likelihood that people in the path of the fire will die or be injured\", the taskforce said.</p><p>Melbourne reached an index reading of about 150 on Black Saturday, according to Ross Bradstock, director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong. For Sydney to exceed 100 on the index could be a first, at least for its Observatory Hill and Sydney Airport sites, where the weather is measured.</p><p>Does climate change play a part?</p><p>Yes, there is a link between climate change and the prevalence and severity of fires. In fact, the research identifying a link between fires and climate change is \"old hat\", says Professor Bradstock. \"The research has all been done. We don't need to keep doing it.\"</p><p>As the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO pointed out in last year's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/State-of-the-Climate-2018.pdf\">latest State of the Climate report</url>, the number of the most extreme 10 per cent of fire weather days based on the fire danger index \"has increased in recent decades across many regions of Australia, especially in southern and eastern Australia\".</p><p>\"There has been an associated increase in the length of the fire weather season,\" it said. \"Climate change, including increasing temperatures, is contributing to these changes.\"</p><p>Or, as Hamish Clarke, a former NSW government scientist and now with the University of Wollongong, puts it: \"Across the country, at a number of high-quality long-term weather stations, there had either been an increase, or no change [in the fire danger index]. We didn't find a significant decrease anywhere.\"</p><p>In general, one consequence for fire authorities is that the fire season is getting longer. In eastern Australia, that means fire risks start to increase earlier in the spring and last longer into the autumn. The window for hazard-reduction burning is shifting into winter - if it's not too damp to do it.</p><p>How human activity and natural climate variability factored in bushfire ratings increases from 1973 to 2017 was the focus of research by Sarah Harris, from the Victoria's Country Fire Authority, and Chris Lucas in September.</p><p>While rainfall changes from one year to the next, with phenomena such as El Ninos in the Pacific and shifting Indian Ocean conditions playing a role, the researchers' findings were conclusive:</p><p>\"We propose that anthropogenic [human-led] climate change is the primary driver of the [upward trend in the fire danger index], through both higher mean temperatures and, potentially, through associated shifts in large-scale rainfall patterns.\"</p><p>How unusual is this year?</p><p>Depending on where you are, very usual. NSW, for instance, could see a million hectares burned so far this fire season within days - if it hasn't already done so. That is about the same as the past three fire seasons combined - and summer is yet to arrive.</p><p>Rainfall deficiencies - or what most of us call \"drought\" - are already the worst on record for northern NSW and parts of southern Queensland. And it has also been hot.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia posted its hottest January-October in records going back to 1910 for maximum temperatures. It looks like only a cool spell, which is not on the forecast charts, will stop 2019 being the hottest year on record for daytime readings.</p><p>Of particular concern for this week is how very dry areas are around big population centres such as Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong.</p><p>Temperatures are likely to reach the mid- to high 30s on November 12 at a time when moisture levels in plants - a gauge of how quickly they will burn if fire breaks out - are tracking below those of the big fire season of 2013 in the Sydney area, and the worst since 2002.</p><p>Professor Bradstock published research in 2009 that predicted how the fire danger index would track to 2030 and 2050, using CSIRO data from 2007.</p><p>\"The current predictions [for Sydney on November 12] are beyond what we predicted back in 2007,\" he says. \"That's not good.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520204582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGC-0261-DY19-C056-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><timeReceived>01:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

McArthur to forecast how weather would affect fire behaviour.</p><p>As the name suggests, the gauge examines the risks to woodlands from fire using a combination of rainfall or drought conditions along with predicted wind speeds, temperature and relative humidity.</p><p>Typically, winter and spring see the highest ratings on this fire danger index in the north and these move southwards as spring makes way for summer.</p><p>How bad is catastrophic then?</p><p>Fire and emergency authorities <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>started to review response plans in 2008</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> to adjust to \"the growing intensity and severity of recent bushfire experiences across the country\".</p><p>Then Black Saturday's bushfires erupted in Victoria on February 7 in 2009, leaving 173 people dead. That event \"brought into sharp focus the possibility that the current legislation, systems, practices and processes to support effective community safety outcomes may no longer match the increasing levels of risk and expectations\", a bushfire warning taskforce report noted.</p><p>The highest fire danger rating was set as \"catastrophic\" for index readings of 100 or more. (In Victoria, they are dubbed Code Red.) The basic message was boiled down to: \"For your survival, leaving is the best option.\"</p><p>The dire assessment is because some fires on such days are likely to become \"uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving\" and \"there is a very high likelihood that people in the path of the fire will die or be injured\", the taskforce said.</p><p>Melbourne reached an index reading of about 150 on Black Saturday, according to Ross Bradstock, director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong. For Sydney to exceed 100 on the index could be a first, at least for its Observatory Hill and Sydney Airport sites, where the weather is measured.</p><p>Does climate change play a part?</p><p>Yes, there is a link between climate change and the prevalence and severity of fires. In fact, the research identifying a link between fires and climate change is \"old hat\", says Professor Bradstock. \"The research has all been done. We don't need to keep doing it.\"</p><p>As the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO pointed out in last year's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/State-of-the-Climate-2018.pdf\">latest State of the Climate report</url>, the number of the most extreme 10 per cent of fire weather days based on the fire danger index \"has increased in recent decades across many regions of Australia, especially in southern and eastern Australia\".</p><p>\"There has been an associated increase in the length of the fire weather season,\" it said. \"Climate change, including increasing temperatures, is contributing to these changes.\"</p><p>Or, as Hamish Clarke, a former NSW government scientist and now with the University of Wollongong, puts it: \"Across the country, at a number of high-quality long-term weather stations, there had either been an increase, or no change [in the fire danger index]. We didn't find a significant decrease anywhere.\"</p><p>In general, one consequence for fire authorities is that the fire season is getting longer. In eastern Australia, that means fire risks start to increase earlier in the spring and last longer into the autumn. The window for hazard-reduction burning is shifting into winter - if it's not too damp to do it.</p><p>How human activity and natural climate variability factored in bushfire ratings increases from 1973 to 2017 was the focus of research by Sarah Harris, from the Victoria's Country Fire Authority, and Chris Lucas in September.</p><p>While rainfall changes from one year to the next, with phenomena such as El Ninos in the Pacific and shifting Indian Ocean conditions playing a role, the researchers' findings were conclusive:</p><p>\"We propose that anthropogenic [human-led] climate change is the primary driver of the [upward trend in the fire danger index], through both higher mean temperatures and, potentially, through associated shifts in large-scale rainfall patterns.\"</p><p>How unusual is this year?</p><p>Depending on where you are, very unusual. NSW, for instance, could see a million hectares burned so far this fire season within days - if it hasn't already done so. That is about the same as the past three fire seasons combined - and summer is yet to arrive.</p><p>Rainfall deficiencies - or what most of us call \"drought\" - are already the worst on record for northern NSW and parts of southern Queensland. And it has also been hot.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia posted its hottest January-October in records going back to 1910 for maximum temperatures. It looks like only a cool spell, which is not on the forecast charts, will stop 2019 being the hottest year on record for daytime readings.</p><p>Of particular concern for this week is how very dry areas are around big population centres such as Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong.</p><p>Temperatures are likely to reach the mid- to high 30s on November 12 at a time when moisture levels in plants - a gauge of how quickly they will burn if fire breaks out - are tracking below those of the big fire season of 2013 in the Sydney area, and the worst since 2002.</p><p>Professor Bradstock published research in 2009 that predicted how the fire danger index would track to 2030 and 2050, using CSIRO data from 2007.</p><p>\"The current predictions [for Sydney on November 12] are beyond what we predicted back in 2007,\" he says. \"That's not good.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520204582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGF-S0T1-JBJ7-N4GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><timeReceived>11:49 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

have been able to use community information to connect communities.</p><p>We appreciate the many years of support from Horsham Rural City Council, surrounding councils and the community as we have provided an online database to the Wimmera, Grampians and Mallee communities plus a printed directory to Horsham Rural City Council residents.</p><p>Horsham Rural City Council has decided to work with a new community directory provider My Community Directory to provide a platform that promotes community activities across the region.</p><p>As such WIN will no longer be funded by the council and will no longer have the resources to continue operating.</p><p>To ensure the database that has been developed over many years will continue we have agreed to transfer the WIN Wimmera Grampians and Mallee online database to the council.</p><p>Organisations will have the opportunity to be a part of this online community directory, and WIN encourages you to do so.</p><p>Organisations will shortly receive a letter from My Community Directory providing more details about how they will operate and how you can manage your information, including options for opting out of the directory.</p><p>We thank organisations for their support over the past years.</p><p>WIN Committee wishes to acknowledge the untiring commitment of the late chairman, Dr Donald McGregor Johns - better known as Don Johns - and also the unflinching commitment of the executive officer, Judith Bysouth both of whom were the mainstay of this outstanding community information service.</p><p>Barry Laird, interim chairman, Wimmera

able to use community information to connect communities.</p><p>We appreciate the many years of support from Horsham Rural City Council, surrounding councils and the community as we have provided an online database to the Wimmera, Grampians and Mallee communities plus a printed directory to Horsham Rural City Council residents.</p><p>Horsham Rural City Council has decided to work with a new community directory provider My Community Directory to provide a platform that promotes community activities across the region.</p><p>As such WIN will no longer be funded by the council and will no longer have the resources to continue operating.</p><p>To ensure the database that has been developed over many years will continue we have agreed to transfer the WIN Wimmera Grampians and Mallee online database to the council.</p><p>Organisations will have the opportunity to be a part of this online community directory, and WIN encourages you to do so.</p><p>Organisations will shortly receive a letter from My Community Directory providing more details about how they will operate and how you can manage your information, including options for opting out of the directory.</p><p>We thank organisations for their support over the past years.</p><p>WIN Committee wishes to acknowledge the untiring commitment of the late chairman, Dr Donald McGregor Johns - better known as Don Johns - and also the unflinching commitment of the executive officer, Judith Bysouth both of whom were the mainstay of this outstanding community information service.</p><p>Barry Laird, interim chairman, Wimmera

When Prabowo stood again earlier this year, many stuck with Jokowi for the same reason, long after it was clear that their president was not the reformer many had hoped he would be.</p><p>The make-up of Joko Widodo's second-term cabinet confirms some worrying trends.</p><p>You can only imagine, then, how those voters felt this week when Prabowo accepted the offer of a senior position in Jokowi's second-term cabinet. Amid a process which is already being panned in the Indonesian press for its accommodation of political parties and vested interests, his appointment as defence minister has dominated international attention. As one Australian academic quipped, \"What was that election for again?\"</p><p>Prabowo is a grossly inappropriate choice for the defence portfolio. After Suharto's resignation he was dismissed from the military for organising the abduction and torture of anti-regime activists, and he faces serious questions over his role in atrocities during the occupation of East Timor. Prabowo is ambitious, and nobody knows whether he is joining the government in order to white-ant it, or to inherit it when Jokowi leaves office in 2024. The circumstances of his return to public office are emblematic of the broader pathologies of post-Suharto politics.</p><p>Democratic accountability rests upon the idea that the public votes leaders and parties out of office as much as into it. But in Indonesia, ideological and political economy factors encourage oversized ruling coalitions designed to accommodate a swathe of elite factions and social groups - including the notional election \"losers.\"</p><p>Jokowi might have exhorted his new ministers not to be corrupt, but he knows that opportunities for rorts are the whole point of these \"fat\" coalitions. Much of the viability and influence of parties and religious organisations is dependent on their delivering patronage - pork-barrel projects, jobs for the boys, government contracts, favourable regulatory decisions - to their clienteles. The prospect of controlling a ministry and its budget is one reason why, though parties compete vigorously with each other in elections, they then \"enter power-sharing agreements that effectively void voters' preferences.\"</p><p>Even when viewed in light of these conventions the new cabinet is qualitatively worse than those that preceded it. At a time when Papuan grievances are driving civil unrest and observers worry that anti-Chinese prejudice is growing, there is no indigenous Papuan or ethnic Chinese Indonesian in the ministry, and only five out of thirty-four portfolios are held by women, a decrease from Jokowi's first term.</p><p>And it's not as if those ministers who did make the cut are an impressive bunch. The new health minister was sanctioned by Indonesia's medical association over his promotion of \"brain wash\" therapy for stroke patients. Pro-Jokowi media tycoon Surya Paloh had a politician from his Nasdem Party installed as communications minister and now has the luxury of regulating his own media empire. Despite last month's large protests about the weakening of anti-corruption laws, a draconian new criminal code, and the government's persistent failure to discipline industry for its role in Indonesia's forest-fire crisis, forestry and environment minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar and justice minister Yasonna Laoly have kept their portfolios.</p><p>This cabinet reflects a renewed atmosphere of ideological conflict between the religious pluralism that has long dominated the political mainstream and the Islamism that is ascendant in an increasingly pious society - and particularly among the urban middle classes who play an outsize role in cultural and political life. Former national police chief Tito Karnavian, a political ally of the president, has been appointed as home minister, with wide powers over the civil service and regional government. Former general Fachrul Razi will be minister for religion - the first time since the New Order that a military man has held this post. The two will spearhead \"deradicalisation\" within Indonesia's civil and religious bureaucracy, which moderate organisations have long worried is being colonised by sympathisers of radical groups.</p><p>Indonesian pluralists and many westerners will be encouraged by the idea that radicals will no longer be indulged by the state. But those who know what the rhetoric of \"deradicalisation\" signifies in Indonesia are wary of what a crackdown on ill-defined \"radicalism\" might mean in practice.</p><p>Indeed, what has (re)emerged under Jokowi is a strain of \"nondemocratic pluralist\" thinking, which sees the threat of Islamism as so acute as to justify restrictions on freedom of association and purges of Islamist sympathisers in the bureaucracy, something which anecdotal evidence suggests has been quietly under way for some time. One need only look to the Arab world, or even the New Order, to see the ineffectiveness of aggressive nationalism - combined with the delegitimisation of Islamist movements and discrimination against their followers - as a remedy for the spread of Islamist ideas.</p><p>The new cabinet embodies what has been rotten about Indonesia's post-Suharto politics as well as new problems being created and exacerbated by Jokowi's leadership. It's tempting to hope that Indonesians get lucky with their presidential candidates in the 2024 elections - yet if there's one idea that Jokowi's presidency has put to rest, it's that Indonesian democracy needs a saviour.</p><p>Liam Gammon is a PhD candidate in the Department of Political and Social Change at the Australian National University's Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs.

It's just a matter of how big and what you can do about them,' he said.</p><p>'We aren't predicting any significant rainfall in summer so we are working on the premise that the wet winter has promoted grass growth and created fuel.</p><p>'It all depends on how much rain we get in spring, and how hot and dry it is over summer ' whether the grass dried out completely or the rain keeps it green.'</p><p>Mr Eagle said the fire season would be beginning as usual in mid to late November. </p><p>He said the increased rainfall also had other implications. </p><p>'We've noticed the dams are starting to fill up, which hasn't happened in recent years,' he said. 'It means bonus water sources for us.</p><p>'Getting more rain keeps the forests damper over summer, which decreases the chance of a forest fire.'</p><p>District 17 acting operations manager Trevor Ebbels said residents were 100 per cent responsible for preparing their land for summer. </p><p>'It's a strong message but it's the responsibility of a property owner to keep an eye on things and get work done in preparation,' he said. </p><p>'One of the hardest things about this amount of rain is people can do the work, do slashing and it keeps growing back.</p><p>'My advice for land owners is to ensure they do the work ' do it in time and don't wait for fire restrictions.'</p><p>Mr Ebbels said the authority fire safety was important heading into fire season, but just as vital while the temperature was lower. 'We're in a state of readiness all year round,' he said. 'The authority is 365 days a year, seven days and 24 hours a day.</p><p>He said fire season preparations had already commenced. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIMMER-4133761</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIMMER2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KKV-8M41-JD67-102P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386181</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"381\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wimmera Mail Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>August 31, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He stands stoutly, with his spade and his ranger's hat, on signs that keep you up to date with the fire risk on any given day. He's America's icon of fire safety, and he'll always let you know whether it's considered safe to go down in the woods today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Few fictional creatures are so respected and beloved. Except, as it turns out, Smokey is not entirely fictional.</p><p>On the way through south-eastern New Mexico, a little speck on the map grabs my attention. The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/SFD/SmokeyBear/SmokeyBearPark.html\">Smokey Bear Historical State Park</url> lies in the middle of the forested, mountainous country more readily associated with Billy The Kid.</p><p>But this is where the real Smokey comes from, and a small visitor centre tells his tale.</p><p>In 1950, a massive wildfire was raging through the Lincoln National Forest, with 17,000 acres ablaze and many firefighters trapped in the inferno. Then one of them found a little bear cub \u2013 no more than a few months old \u2013 clinging to an aspen tree. He was separated from his mother, and had badly burned paws. The photos \u2013 which are almost unimaginably cute \u2013 went first to the local papers, and then nationwide. The bear was flown to Santa Fe, then nursed back to health. The game warden who rescued him, Ray Bell, decided to name his patient after the bear from the fire prevention posters.</p><p>Those posters first made an appearance in 1944, when the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Campaign was putting out wartime ads to save timber by preventing unnecessary fires.

Yet Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio told The Weekly Times \"we are below the statewide residual risk targets we have set\".</p><p>Ms D'Ambrosio refused to answer questions on whether a residual risk of 80 per cent was acceptable in Victoria's most populous bushfire zone. Across the state, the FFMVic's 2017-18 report shows it spent $107.8 million to burn or treat 74,825ha, at a cost of $1421/ha, a huge rise on previously reported costs of $30-$300/ha in 2003.</p><p>\" Continued Page 4 \" From Page 1 The treated area is a fraction of the 390,000ha annual fuel reduction target set by the 2009 Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission, which called on the State Government to treat a \"5 per cent minimum of public land\".</p><p>The Royal Commission was scathing in its criticism of the former Bracks Labor Government's Department of Sustainability and Environment for only setting a target of 130,000ha in the lead-up to Black Saturday.</p><p>Yet the Andrews Government abandoned hectare-based targets in 2015, opting for a computer modelled measure of residual risk - the simulated difference between impacts of a fire with maximum fuel loads versus one with reduced fuel loads resulting from controlled burns and past wildfires.</p><p>One of Australia's leading bushfire scientists, Phil Cheney said residual risk was a \"load of bulls---\". As the former head of CSIRO's bushfire research unit, Dr Cheney said residual risk was a measure developed \"by people with no on-ground experience\" running computer algorithms they \"think are true\". \"If you look at risk, what you can control, fuel load is the only thing that matters,\" he said. Dr Cheney said numerous investigations had called for greater effort and resources being put into fuel reduction burns. Those include: The 1939 Bushfires Royal Commission: \"Justice Stretton said the amount of prescribed burning done by the then Forests Commission was 'ridiculously inadequate' because of a staff shortage and a tardy recognition of the importance of preventive measures\".</p><p>The 2002-03 Victorian Bushfires inquiry calling for an annual optimum area for prescribed burning and routine public reporting of areas treated.</p><p>The 2008 Environment and Natural Resources Committee reporting: \"A minimum average of 5 per cent of the public land estate, comprising 7.7 million hectares, should be adopted as the annual prescribed burning target by DSE\".</p><p>The 2009 Royal Commission stating it was: \"concerned that the State has maintained a minimalist approach to prescribed burning despite a number of recent official or independent reports and inquiries, all of which have recommended increasing the prescribed burning program\".</p><p>Former Forests NSW chief silverculturist and author of Firestick Ecology Vic Jurskis said the biggest concern was that fuel loads were now higher than they were prior to Black Saturday. \"Fuel (loads) increase much faster after a high intensity fire,\" Mr Jurskis said. \"It turns green fuels into dry fuel, more litter and fallen timber and you end up with a solid wall of three-dimensional fuel.\" In a prophetic warning, the 2009 Royal Commission's final report warned: \"The State has allowed the forests to continue accumulating excessive fuel loads. \"Not dealing with this problem on a long-term and programmed basis means that fuel levels continue to increase, adding to the intensity of bushfires that inevitably eventuate and placing firefighters and communities at greater future risk.\"</p><p>\" Editorial, Page 16\" Rule's View, Page 17</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-6b6365fcfc1011e89d9f6fee7266549843f5983edc6e2ab771d62a46dc36c87a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY1-5T31-F0JP-W4PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 12, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Then one of them found a little bear cub \u2013 no more than a few months old \u2013 clinging to an aspen tree. He was separated from his mother, and had badly burned paws. The photos \u2013 which are almost unimaginably cute \u2013 went first to the local papers, and then nationwide. The bear was flown to Santa Fe, then nursed back to health. The game warden who rescued him, Ray Bell, decided to name his patient after the bear from the fire prevention posters.</p><p>Those posters first made an appearance in 1944, when the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Campaign was putting out wartime ads to save timber by preventing unnecessary fires. A bear was picked as a mascot instead of the proposed squirrel or owl as it was one of the few creatures big enough to put out a fire in roughly the same way that a human would. The ranger's hat was chosen as a sign of trustworthy authority, and the spade was picked as the best tool for putting out campfires properly.</p><p>By 1946, artist Rudy Wendelin had been appointed as the official caretaker of the Smokey Bear image.

The smell can be blamed on burn-offs being conducted across the state. Up to 100 burns are planned for parks and forests over the coming weeks by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. Near Melbourne, controlled burns are planned in Point Cook, Eltham, Frankston North and Derrimut. Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Stephanie Rotarangi said up to 100 burns were either underway, being patrolled or scheduled.</p><p>2 BALWYN NORTH Police are warning residents to be aware of Greek Easter celebrations which will force some road closures in the Balwyn North region over the Easter long weekend. An evening procession will be conducted along Macedon Ave and move east to Doncaster Rd and around to The Moor which will see roads closed from 9.30-10.30pm on Friday. On Saturday it is also expected that there will be road closures in Macedon Ave as church goers attending the midnight service are expected to spill into the street from 11.45pm-12.15am. Police have asked residents to be aware of people in the area and avoid driving through if possible.</p><p>3 CAMBERWELL A 39-year-old man from Camberwell has been charged over a number of alleged commercial burglaries around the region. The man was allegedly discovered breaking into a staff area at a business on April 3 and attempting to steal cash from handbags. It is alleged the staff were forced to let the man go after he became agitated prior to police arriving but police found him a short distance away. The man has been remanded in custody to appear in court at a later date.</p><p>4 HAWTHORN EAST A 41-year-old Bundoora man has been charged with burglary offences after being arrested following a call from the public about a suspected loiterer in Wiseman St on April 2. It is alleged the man had smashed a bedroom window and stole cash and jewellery before attempting to leave the scene. Police patrolling the area in response to the call located the man nearby.</p><p>5 BALWYN High end cars including Mercedes Benz's and BMW's were stolen from a car yard in Whitehorse Rd overnight on March 28-29.

Firefighters managed to gain control of that blaze within an hour.</p><p>Throughout the day, Victorians were on edge as emergency alerts swung from evacuation messages to notices that it was too late to leave. The status of some fires was downgraded, but almost none have been declared under control.</p><p>Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp said it was going to be a challenging week for firefighters across the state.</p><p>\"We know that these conditions will continue for the next couple of days. We will then see some further milder weather for the state as a whole and possibly some rain on Wednesday. But we can't afford to become complacent,\" he said.</p><p>\"Unless you've got a really, really good reason to be there - please just stay away from fire-affected areas.\"</p><p>Fires were bearing down on the town of Dargo, in East Gippsland, but an emergency warning was downgraded about 5.30pm, allaying fears two fires near the town would merge into one large blaze.</p><p>Firefighters were braced for a severe thunderstorm that could roll over Gippsland and produce more lightning and spark new blazes.</p><p>At least seven properties have been destroyed in the huge Bunyip State Park blaze, and at least another two lost to the Yinnar bushfire.</p><p>Fortunately, the warnings for the two fires were also downgraded yesterday.</p><p>But authorities are expecting to uncover many more property losses once they are able to better access the burnt areas today.</p><p>The Bunyip fire rolled south through more than 12,000 hectares over the weekend and through several hamlets including Tonimbuk, destroying several homes. On Sunday night, a wind change pushed the fire north and back on itself.</p><p>Other major fires burning in the state included a 17,000-hectare blaze in Licola, in the state's east, where embers and ash were blowing around the hamlet.</p><p>In Wilsons Promontory, south-east of Melbourne, 3000 people have been evacuated.</p><p>The popular national park will be closed to campers for the upcoming Labour Day long weekend due to a growing bushfire in the hills.</p><p>Dozens of schools and childcare centres across the state's east were closed yesterday, with many due to remain shut today.</p><p>Health alerts have also been issued, with smoke from the bushfires contributing to poor air quality in Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley. Air quality in Morwell South and Churchill was classified as \"unhealthy for all groups\".</p><p>More than 500 people visited five emergency relief centres, with many people sleeping on blow-up mattresses as they waited for updates about their homes and properties.</p><p>Both mayor Graeme Moore and Andrew Clarke, owner of Jinks Creek Winery, said they believed that the fire's ferocity was due to the government's failure to sufficiently backburn the Bunyip State Park.</p><p>Mr Clarke said he had been \"on the government's back for ages\" to burn nearby land. Cr Moore said state and federal planning overlays prevented the council from doing it themselves</p><p>A Forest Fire Management Victoria spokesman said the department was \"burning smarter, rather than focusing on a number of hectares target.</p><p>\"In some areas, this may mean less planned burns - in other areas it may mean more\".</p><p>However, the organisation admitted that no planned burns had been done recently due to \"unfavourable weather conditions\".</p><p>Police confirmed the worst for teacher Elke Frank. Her family's 32-year-old home was destroyed by the Yinnar South blaze.</p><p>Ms Frank was able to grab a bag pre-packed with videos, photo albums and documents on her way out on Saturday night, but she didn't think it would be the last time she would see her house.</p><p>Later that night, Ms Frank's son saw photos on Facebook showing their home had been gutted.</p><p>\"It was a shock,\" Ms Frank said. \"It's just a pile of black rubble...

The status of some fires was downgraded, but almost none have been declared under control.</p><p>Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp said it was going to be a challenging week for firefighters across the state.</p><p>\"We know that these conditions will continue for the next couple of days. We will then see some further milder weather for the state as a whole and possibly some rain on Wednesday. But we can't afford to become complacent,\" he said.</p><p>\"Unless you've got a really, really good reason to be there - please just stay away from fire affected areas.\"</p><p>Fires were bearing down on the town of Dargo, in East Gippsland, but an emergency warning was downgraded about 5.30pm, allaying fears two fires near the town would merge into one large blaze.</p><p>Firefighters were braced for a severe thunderstorm that could roll over Gippsland and produce more lightning and spark new blazes.</p><p>At least seven properties have been destroyed in the huge Bunyip State Park blaze, and at least another two lost to the Yinnar bushfire. </p><p>Fortunately, warnings for the two fires were also downgraded on Monday.</p><p>But authorities are expecting to uncover many more property losses once they are able to better access the burnt areas on Tuesday.</p><p>The Bunyip fire rolled south through more than 12,000 hectares over the weekend and through several hamlets including Tonimbuk, destroying several homes. On Sunday night, a wind change pushed the fire north and back on itself.</p><p>Other major fires burning in the state included a 17,000-hectare blaze in Licola, in the state's east, where embers and ash were blowing around the hamlet.</p><p>In Wilsons Promontory, south-east of Melbourne, 3000 people have been evacuated. The popular national park will be closed to campers for the upcoming Labour Day long weekend due to a growing bushfire in the hills.</p><p>Dozens of schools and childcare centres across the state's east were closed on Monday, with many due to remain shut on Tuesday.</p><p>Health alerts have also been issued, with smoke from the bushfires contributing to poor air quality in Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley. Air quality in Morwell South and Churchill was classified \"unhealthy for all groups\".</p><p>More than 500 people visited five emergency relief centres, with many people sleeping on blow-up mattresses as they waited for updates about their homes and properties.</p><p>Both Mayor Graeme Moore and Andrew Clarke, owner of Jinks Creek Winery, said they believed the fire's ferocity was due to the government's failure to sufficiently backburn the Bunyip State Park.</p><p>Mr Clarke said he had been \"on the government's back for ages\" to burn nearby land. Cr Moore said state and federal planning overlays prevented the council from doing it themselves</p><p>A Forest Fire Management Victoria spokesman said the department was \"burning smarter, rather than focusing on a number of hectares target. In some areas, this may mean less planned burns - in other areas it may mean more\".</p><p>However, the organisation admitted that no planned burns had been done recently due to \"unfavourable weather conditions\".</p><p>Police confirmed the worst for teacher Elke Frank. Her family's 32-year-old home was destroyed by the Yinnar South blaze.</p><p>Ms Frank was able to grab a bag pre-packed with videos, photo albums and documents on her way out on Saturday night, but she didn't think it would be the last time she would see her house.</p><p>Later that night, Ms Frank's son saw photos on Facebook showing their home had been gutted.</p><p>\"It was a shock,\" Ms Frank said. \"It's just a pile of black rubble??? There's nothing there.\"</p><p>Police then called on Sunday afternoon confirming the loss.</p><p>Ms Frank said it was heartbreaking for her, her partner and her three children to lose decades' worth of memories and belongings.</p><p>\"My partner had more than 2000 books he'd collected. My son had just moved back so he had all this stuff. They're all devastated,\" she said.</p><p>\"We were always just hoping it wasn't going to happen.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> - With Simone Fox Koob, Sophie Aubrey</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520101302</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJN-FHV1-JBJ7-N4YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><timeReceived>07:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It confirms the strength of the relationship between climate drivers such as El Ni\u00f1o, climate change, and the Australian bushfire season. It also demonstrates that a few milder bushfire seasons do not mean climate change isn't happening.</p><h>Hot, dry, windy conditions spell fire trouble</h><p>The prerequisites for a severe bushfire season are high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds that coincide with long periods of low rainfall.</p><p>These weather ingredients are used to calculate an area's fire danger rating, using the Forest Fire Danger Index. The index produces a score reflecting the severity of fire weather on a given day, where zero represents minimal fire danger, 50 represents conditions where a fire ban may be issued, and 100 is considered potentially catastrophic.</p><p>Loss of </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2013.09.013\">Link to Image</url>and<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=WF08175\">Link to Image</url></p><p> most often occurs on days when the index is high in a particular area. But strong seasonal fire weather doesn't always translate to high-impact fires. Other factors in play include terrain, vegetation, ignition and the weather on the day.</p><p>In our research, we analysed the strength of the worst fire weather conditions to understand the relative severity of fire weather during different seasons and years, in relation to various climate drivers.</p><h>Why is fire weather so different every year?</h><p>In Australia, the year-to-year changes in climatic conditions are largely driven by three factors: the </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=enso\">Link to Image</url>the<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=iod\">Link to Image</url>, and the<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=sam\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Each of these climate drivers involves either changes to sea surface temperatures, wind movements, or both. They can all can affect temperature and rainfall patterns across the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia.</p><p>Our research confirmed that across the continent over more than four decades, climate drivers have affected the variability of Australia's fire weather.</p><p>Of these drivers, the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation is the most influential. Weather during an El Ni\u00f1o phase is typically hot and dry, leading to worse seasonal bushfire conditions.</p><p>The positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole often coincides with El Ni\u00f1o and exacerbates its effects. This phase generally results in lower than average rainfall across southern Australia.</p><p>But when these two climate modes are in a negative phase, our research confirms that Australia often experiences more rain and milder bushfire conditions.</p><p>The modes evolve over many months and their effects on fire weather persist for several seasons. Their state during winter and spring is a strong indicator for the rest of the fire season for much of Australia.</p><p>The Southern Annular Mode refers to the north-south movement of strong westerly winds in parts of the Southern Hemisphere. When the mode is in a prolonged negative phase, fire weather conditions in Australia are worse - particularly in NSW. This effect is pronounced in winter and spring and means less rainfall and strong westerly winds.</p><p>The 2019 winter saw a persistent negative Southern Annular Mode, as did the 2013 and 2018 winter and spring seasons. There was a strong El Ni\u00f1o event and positive Indian Ocean Dipole in 2015. Australia's bushfire season started earlier than usual in each of these years.</p><p>The converse is also true. In 2011 a strong La Ni\u00f1a (the opposite of an El Ni\u00f1o) resulted in milder bushfire seasons, as did the negative Indian Ocean Dipole of 2016.</p><h>Climate change is a culprit too</h><p>Long-term climate change in Australia is an undeniable reality. The </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Link to Image</url></p><p> report for Australia notes strong land surface temperature increases and a 10-20% decline in cool season rainfall across southern Australia since the 1970s. These changes are closely associated with increasing human greenhouse gas emissions, as well as natural variability.</p><p>The changed conditions has led to an average increase in the severity of seasonal bushfire weather across Australia - especially in southern parts of the continent. The increased severity affects all seasons but in particular spring, which means that, on average, the bushfire season is starting earlier.</p><h>Pulling it all together</h><p>Our research has made clear that climate modes bring large and rapid swings to the fire weather, while human-induced climate change gradually increases background fire weather conditions. The trend generally means an earlier start to the bushfire seasons than in the past.</p><p>Climate change is definitely playing a role in producing the earlier start to bushfire seasons and overall more extreme seasons, particularly in southeastern Australia. However, the natural variations in climate modes continue to play a key role, meaning we should not expect every bushfire season to be worse than the last as a result of climate change.</p><p>Similarly, a few milder bushfire seasons among a string of record high seasons does not mean that climate change should be dismissed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By CHRIS LUCAS a senior research scientist from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and SARAH HARRIS from the Country Fire Authority.

tomorrow.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria Far South West acting district manager Wesley Burns said fire risk conditions were high with the hot and windy conditions coming at a time \"when the

Of the 517 hectares treated, more than half was done in the past four years.</p><p>\"Despite these activities, the fire at the weekend was intense and burnt through these areas,\" it said. \"The fire was wind-driven and blew embers well ahead of the main fire front.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock said multiple studies - particularly since the devastating Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria in 2009 - had shown broadscale planned burns were less effective in suppressing fire activity than work much closer to homes and other buildings.</p><p>Creating a so-called \"defensible space\", extending about 40 metres from residences, was critical, he said. Depending on the area, further work out to a couple of kilometres would also help.</p><p>Hazard-reduction burning thinking has evolved. Victoria, for instance, has shifted from setting annual quotas of areas to be burned to a more risk-based approach targeting specific areas of concern, as used in NSW.</p><p>Climate change has also seen a reduction in cool-season rainfall in both south-west and south-east Australia, two regions that are naturally bushfire-prone.</p><p>In addition to an increase in the number of days with high fire danger, the bushfire season has extended outside summer months, particularly into spring, researchers have said.</p><p>One side-effect is the available opportunity to conduct fire reduction is shrinking, resulting in the need to concentrate burning activities. These often happen on weekends, when volunteers are more likely to be free.</p><p>Those busy periods then draw public complaints about air pollution because the same conditions that make such burning relatively low risk - such as dry, still days - also allow smoke to settle over nearby populated regions including the Sydney basin.</p><p>Ecologists also raise concerns about the impact of hazard-reduction burns, particularly if done too often, can have on key habitat.</p><p>Large trees that are home to many marsupials, birds and lizards, are often susceptible to flames that can penetrate cracks or holes in trunks, and destroy them from within.</p><p>Professor Bradstock said early evidence suggested that embers carried by the high winds travelled some distance before settling on Tathra homes and igniting them.</p><p>He noted that several clusters of properties were destroyed, indicating house-to-house propagation.</p><p>The increasing tendency to pack in houses almost fence-to-fence on the outskirts of town and cities in areas known to have fires could mean \"we are setting ourselves up\" for such propagation events, he said.</p><p>Sunday's forest fire danger index was about 55 for the NSW south coast. While possibly the highest for this late in the season, it was a record for March, the Bureau of Meteorology said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520012707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX8-8W31-DY19-C4H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Keep treatment close at hand, research warns, as storm-induced surprise attacks are on the rise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Research to be presented at a lung health conference in Canberra today warns of a \"hidden and significant population susceptible to thunderstorm asthma\".</p><p>More people are vulnerable to unexpected - and severe - asthma attacks than previously thought, it says. And Australia - but particularly Victoria - must brace for the next pollen season.</p><p>Nine people died and more than 8500 needed emergency care after a freak weather event last November combined unusually high pollen counts with hot winds and sudden downpours in Victoria.</p><p>The outcome resulted in an explosion of tiny allergen particles that caused widespread sudden and unpredicted asthma attacks.</p><p>About half of the victims were simply unaware they were even at risk of asthma. \"It is essential that we invest more research into this phenomenon and educate our health services and public to take preventive and preparedness measures,\" says Thoracic Society for Australia and New Zealand president Professor Peter Gibson.</p><p>The study involved more than 500 healthcare workers in Victoria. Half said they suffered asthma-like symptoms during the thunderstorms. Most had their own treatments at hand. Few sought medical care. One had to be hospitalised.</p><p>But the big reveal, the report says, was that 37 per cent of those surveyed said they had no prior history of asthma. And yet they suffered intense attacks during the storm.</p><p>Lead researcher Dr Daniel Clayton-Chubb says people with a history of hayfever brought about by exposure to the likes of rye grass or mould appear to have been most prone to the sudden-onset asthma attack, unlike those who react to cats or dust mites.</p><p>\"The key message from our work is that anyone with hayfever should ensure that they have ready access to quick acting asthma treatments such as bronchodilators at all times, but particularly in pollen season or if thunderstorms are predicted,\" he said. \"Severe thunderstorm asthma symptoms can strike rapidly and without warning.\" And it doesn't matter whether you are indoors or outside. The tiny allergen particles can reach almost anywhere.</p><p>Researcher Professor Guy Marks says the best advice is to be prepared, even if you have not previously had an asthma attack.</p><p>\"In areas at risk of thunderstorm epidemics people who 'wheeze and sneeze' during spring should take regular inhaled corticosteroids during this time to reduce their risk of experiencing severe attacks during thunderstorms,\" he says.</p><p>A variety of environmental conditions can also trigger such attacks, ranging from thunderstorms to forest fire. Influenza outbreaks could also produce similar outcomes.</p><p>\"Epidemics of acute respiratory illness can occur unpredictably and have the capacity to spread rapidly over a wide area,\" he says.\"We need to develop cap-acity within the health system to respond rapidly.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-GeelongAdvertiser20170328Geelong3000243894943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N60-3T01-JD3N-542X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Geelong Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 28, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000125</classCode><className>ASTHMA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFJO</classCode><className>HAY FEVER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001481</classCode><className>RESPIRATORY DISORDERS &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">Incidents of aged timber railway sleepers catching fire on the Warrnambool train line are becoming more frequent, a CFA leader says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">District six operations officer Mark Gunning said CFA crews had responded to a small number of fires near Stonyford and a significant number around Boorcan and Noorat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Gunning said it appeared the fires were originating in old wooden sleepers from passing trains.</p><p>\"A lot of the spots require crews to walk in due to the terrain and that means carrying knapsacks to extinguish small fires,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Gunning said the CFA wanted to see preventative steps put in place to stop a serious incident occurring and had contacted relevant authorities.</p><p>A V/Line spokeswoman said sleeper fires were something they took very seriously.</p><p>\"V/Line immediately reports any fires or smouldering sleepers to the CFA and works with them, as part of any investigation into the cause,\" she said.</p><p>\"We have a strong working relationship with the CFA across regional Victoria and we want to ensure this continues.</p><p>\"Safety is our number one priority and we regularly complete maintenance works on the line.\"</p><p>There have been 14 reported instances of sleepers smouldering on the Warrnambool corridor this summer, with five of those have been in the Terang and Camperdown area.</p><p>Saturday has been declared a day of total fire ban in the south-west and firefighters and firefighting aircraft will be on standby across the region.</p><p>Hot and windy weather is forecast for the district with temperatures expected to reach up to 33 degrees in Warrnambool on Saturday with winds up to 40 kilometres per hour throughout the region, gusting up to 65 kilometres per hour.</p><p>No fires can be lit or be allowed to remain alight in the open air tomorrow.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria Far South West acting district manager Wesley Burns said fire risk conditions were high with the hot and windy conditions coming at a time \"when the forests and parks are already very dry, as we have had less than average rainfall over the last three months.\"</p><p>\"On Sunday, the temperature is expected to drop into the twenties, with the strong winds continuing, and the Fire Danger Rating to be high.\"</p><p>\"In preparation for the weather on Saturday, an inter-agency Incident Management Team (IMT) will be in place at the Incident Control Centre in Heywood, covering the Far South West District.\"</p><p>The Country Fire Authority will also have incident control centres set up at Warrnambool and Colac on Saturday.</p><p>Mr Burns said having an IMT at Heywood in place on Saturday meant the team could quickly provide any necessary information to the community about incidents that might arise.</p><p>\"All information delivered by an IMT is timely, relevant and tailored to assist community members make informed decisions about their safety,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're urging anyone going camping this weekend, especially on Saturday, to stay informed about the weather and to be observant of what is happening around you when you are in the bush.</p><p>\"We strongly urge the community to consider the value of visiting local forests or parks during periods of high and extreme heat as they can be extremely dangerous under these conditions.</p><p>\"Before heading out, make sure you plan ahead and have access to all the information you need.</p><p>\"That includes campfires and all barbecues, including solid and liquid fuel barbecues, as well as unconventional heat sources such as rotisseries and portable grills.</p><p>\"Don't let your campfire become a bushfire,\" Mr Burns said.</p><p>A day of Total Fire Ban has also

stop a serious incident occurring and had contacted relevant authorities.</p><p>A V/Line spokeswoman said sleeper fires were something they took very seriously.</p><p>\"V/Line immediately reports any fires or smouldering sleepers to the CFA and works with them, as part of any investigation into the cause,\" she said.</p><p>\"We have a strong working relationship with the CFA across regional Victoria and we want to ensure this continues.</p><p>\"Safety is our number one priority and we regularly complete maintenance works on the line.\"</p><p>There have been 14 reported instances of sleepers smouldering on the Warrnambool corridor this summer, with five of those have been in the Terang and Camperdown area.</p><p>Saturday has been declared a day of total fire ban in the south-west and firefighters and firefighting aircraft will be on standby across the region.</p><p>Hot and windy weather is forecast for the district with temperatures expected to reach up to 33 degrees in Warrnambool on Saturday with winds up to 40 kilometres per hour throughout the region, gusting up to 65 kilometres per hour.</p><p>No fires can be lit or be allowed to remain alight in the open air tomorrow.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria Far South West acting district manager Wesley Burns said fire risk conditions were high with the hot and windy conditions coming at a time \"when the forests and parks are already very dry, as we have had less than average rainfall over the last three months.\"</p><p>\"On Sunday, the temperature is expected to drop into the twenties, with the strong winds continuing, and the Fire Danger Rating to be high.\"</p><p>\"In preparation for the weather on Saturday, an inter-agency Incident Management Team (IMT) will be in place at the Incident Control Centre in Heywood, covering the Far South West District.\"</p><p>The Country Fire Authority will also have incident control centres set up at Warrnambool and Colac on Saturday.</p><p>Mr Burns said having an IMT at Heywood in place on Saturday meant the team could quickly provide any necessary information to the community about incidents that might arise.</p><p>\"All information delivered by an IMT is timely, relevant and tailored to assist community members make informed decisions about their safety,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're urging anyone going camping this weekend, especially on Saturday, to stay informed about the weather and to be observant of what is happening around you when you are in the bush.</p><p>\"We strongly urge the community to consider the value of visiting local forests or parks during periods of high and extreme heat as they can be extremely dangerous under these conditions.</p><p>\"Before heading out, make sure you plan ahead and have access to all the information you need.</p><p>\"That includes campfires and all barbecues, including solid and liquid fuel barbecues, as well as unconventional heat sources such as rotisseries and portable grills.</p><p>\"Don't let your campfire become a bushfire,\" Mr Burns said.</p><p>A day of Total Fire Ban has also been declared on Saturday in the Mallee, Wimmera, Northern Country, North Central and Central (includes Melbourne and Geelong) district(s) of Victoria.</p><p>For more information on campfire safety visit: <url

The grass grows inside the lake and around the Clear Lake Reserve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Parks Victoria describes fairy grass as \"a native blown grass which colonises in damp, bare areas and germinates as soon as temperature and moisture levels are suitable\".</p><p>Clear Lake is home to about 40 residents and the town has faced problems with fairy grass since the late 1980s.</p><p>Resident Trevor Watson has lived in the town his whole life and said the problem subsided when the grass was burned off.</p><p>\"The first year it got really bad, there was still water in the lake and the grass all around the tree line. We burned around the trees. Then the next year the lake dried up and we burned inside it,\" he said.</p><p>Related: Clear Lake fairy grass influx causes fire concerns</p><p>Parks Victoria, the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, the Country Fire Authority and Clear Lake residents co-ordinated the burn-off.</p><p>\"From then on we didn't have a problem with the fairy grass until 2015 when it came back. When Parks Victoria slash it, all it's doing is putting the seeds back on the floor of the lake,\" Mr Watson said.</p><p>Residents Jen and Craig Giggins said their house was inundated with fairy grass a few weeks ago, and most residents had experienced the same situation.</p><p>Mrs Giggins said the grass was \"more than eight feet high\" in some areas.</p><p>\"It's heartbreaking. It gets into all the sheds, the chicken coops, up the fences, over the air-conditioners. It comes into your house and is impossible to weed out of the garden,\" Mrs Giggins said.</p><p>\"We only just finished cleaning up our place from the last time it happened and then six weeks later it was back.\"</p><p>Mr Giggins said Parks Victoria had not contacted residents about conducting further assessments since its November assessment.</p><p>Related: Opinions split over fairy grass solutions</p><p>\"Parks Victoria keep telling us that they are monitoring the situation. We have all contracted Parks Victoria individually about different problems,\" Mr Giggins said.</p><p>\"Every year the fairy grass season rolls around and they just seem to ignore it. We keep getting told it's a huge fire risk, but nothing gets done.\"</p><p>In 2002 a build up of fairy grass caught on fire at Dock Lake Reserve, which threatened people who were at the reserve playing sport. About 225 hectares of land and the Taylors Lake Football Clubrooms were destroyed.</p><p>Clear Lake farmer Lachie Wilson said he was concerned about the fire danger risk of fairy grass at his property.</p><p>\"On the most recent Total Fire Ban day (on January 29) when it was more than 40 degrees and there were 50km/h winds blowing straight out the lake, if a pilot light or powerline had sparked then you have no break between the grass and the house. The grass is very combustible and can move around so easily,\" he said.</p><p>\"There are paddocks around here that are covered in fairy grass. I don't know how we're going to go about sowing in them. It was getting into the headers last time and were overheating.\"</p><p>Parks Victoria area chief ranger Zoe Wilkinson said fairy grass had appeared at many lakes and waterway across the Wimmera this summer.</p><p>\"This summer, Parks Victoria has been in regular contact with some of the people living near Clear Lake about the impact of fairy grass blowing from the lake-bed and onto their properties,\" she said.</p><p>\"It is a difficult grass to manage, as treatments such as herbicide and burning have been found to result in an increased density of the fairy grass in later seasons because the treatment also removes competing vegetation.</p><p>\"Local evidence suggests the best treatment is to allow the natural process of vegetation succession with minimal human intervention. Importantly, Clear Lake also contains registered Aboriginal heritage sites which must be protected when considering any treatment of this native grass.\"</p><p>She said Forest Fire Management Wimmera would assess the Clear Lake fairy grass as part of its fuel management strategy for 2019-20, alongside the CFA and Parks Victoria.</p><p>\"These will include the local community in these conversations,\" she said.</p><p>While you're with us, you can now receive updates straight to your inbox twice weekly from the Wimmera Mail-Times.
