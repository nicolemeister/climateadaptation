I have helped build massive dehydrators as well as structural fabrications, like beams for houses and construction sites.\"</p><p>\"There is a lot of sexism in the area although I think there are a lot of employers and a lot of people out there that are willing to employ women and give them a go,\" Ms Larkham said.</p><p>After completing her apprenticeship she now has her sights set on becoming a Paramedic, using the scholarship to fund her travel expenses for practical work in Queensland as well as textbooks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MERNWW-doc6z2z72z2rqo1caa0kn2m</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MERNWW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RS8-5DV1-F0J6-J543-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390592</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We are a community that sees the CFA as the most important organisation in town.\" Noojee CFA's community engagement plan is an excellent blueprint. It includes education in schools, a community bushfire exercise once every five years, individual property assessments for landowners, an annual All Emergencies All Communities day and ongoing awareness campaigns aimed at visitors.</p><p>Community safety co-ordinator and first lieutenant Ken Hitchcock developed the plan, which runs to 2022, and about 15 active CFA volunteer members work tirelessly to deliver it.</p><p>Mr Hitchcock organised the All Emergencies All Communities event, which brought together the CFA, SES, Victoria Police, Ambulance Victoria, Forest Fire Management, Baw Baw Shire, Parks Victoria, Vic Forests and the local Lion's Club on November 4 to help people with their pre-fire season planning.</p><p>\"The CFA expects each brigade to have an open day,\" Mr Hitchcock said. \"I just thought it would be easier to have it as a one-stop shop, so the community could come and ask questions and get answers from the right people.\" He said the other important event in the plan was the Community Bushfire Exercise, which evolved out of a community fire drill held in 2011 in the aftermath of Black Saturday.</p><p>The all-day workshop teaches people about fire behaviour, the local risk and developing fire plans and was most recently held in 2015. The next is scheduled for 2020.</p><p>Much of the community plan is informed by the shortcomings of Black Saturday, when Noojee did not burn, but the Bunyip Fire roared dangerously close.</p><p>\"During Black Saturday I decided to defend my home, but I would never do it again,\" said Mr Hitchcock, who moved to the area about 15 years ago and joined the Noojee Brigade soon after.</p><p>His fire plan had been to evacuate his children to a safer property at Neerim North. But it was not safe enough. By 5pm on Black Saturday that property was under ember attack.</p><p>\"They were at the top of a hill, surrounded by farmland. I thought they would be better - and they weren't,\" he said.</p><p>\"Next time I would evacuate my family far beyond where I did last time. I would make sure they were safe, all the way at Southgate, and I would carry out my CFA duties.</p><p>\"The Noojee property will have to be left to chance.\" His advice to others is to take part in all the free education services the CFA provides, be ready to leave early and have insurance.</p><p>Resident Wendy is acutely aware a future blaze is not an \"if\" scenario, but a \"when\".</p><p>\"Noojee has not burned since 1939,\" she said. \"If there is any fire burning in Victoria, I keep tabs, especially when it is hot and windy. If it was a certain distance, or if I lost contact, I'd pack up and go.\"Also if it was a 43C day and windy - fire or no fire - I would leave.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-15e492301cf011e980b36b3dc287cfb9cbab2818a36a449a833260965d97d72f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7Y-WGM1-F0JP-W079-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSII</classCode><className>PRIVATE LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001938</classCode><className>EDUCATION &amp; TRAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N610000CC</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Tasmania's East Coast is already experiencing record dry conditions with the lowest rainfall ever recorded between June and October.</p><p>The TFS has already battled one large bushfire this season with a blaze near St Helens taking more than a week to bring under control.</p><p>But it is not all doom and gloom with the report championing the emergence of state and local governments as climate leaders.</p><p>The report shows 92 per cent of energy used in Tasmania comes from renewable sources and our solar and wind sectors are growing.The CCA said local councils were also taking the issue of climate change seriously.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-HobartMercury20171109Hobart13000351818819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PX5-HBY1-F0JP-W070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Hobart Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 9, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001842</classCode><className>WIND ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001466</classCode><className>ALTERNATIVE &amp; RENEWABLE ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001878</classCode><className>SOLAR ENERGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX460</classCode><className>HOBART, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The facts are that the World Meteorological Organisation has stated that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the degree of warming during the past four years being particularly exceptional.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The facts are that increasing temperatures have seen a consistent increase in the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index, as forecast in 2009 by Professor Ross Bradstock at the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong. This risk was supported by the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO in last year's State of the Climate report. The unprecedented fire behaviour we are experiencing was called out by the collective brains trust of many of the nation's former emergency services chiefs in April.</p><p>The facts are, Australia negotiated one of the lowest greenhouse reduction targets of any first world nation under the Paris Agreement. Yet under the Coalition government we have had emissions increases for the past four years.</p><p>T. Daly, Kingsford, NSW</p><p>I am 86. I have a degree in science and forestry, worked in forestry for nearly 40 years, experienced the 1967 southern Tasmanian bushfires in which 62 people died and other big fires in wet rainforests in North West Tasmania. In my book, Chris Kenny's analysis of bushfires in Australia was spot on. It ought to be compulsory reading in every high school in Australia.</p><p>Bert Witte, Kingston, Tas</p><p>Southeast Australia is yet again threatened with blackouts this summer, further demonstrating that renewables should never have been given carte blanche to exploit the grid without any responsibility for reliability or storage (\"Blackouts risk to force states' hand on coal\", 19/11).</p><p>The irresponsibility of governments of establishing energy policy on virtue signalling rather than proper engineering/economic analysis is showing itself in the form of unaffordable electricity prices, unreliability of supply and ugly environmental repercussions. Quite the opposite of what is required to address drought mitigation, the growing power needs of urban centres and the challenges of climate change adaptation.</p><p>Ron Hobba, Camberwell, Vic</p><p>In a bid to ensure reliability, Energy Minister Angus Taylor is demanding the states source more power from coal, gas and hydro. Good luck with Victoria. Hazelwood coal-fired power station, which provided a quarter of the state's electricity, was shut down, the future of Yallourn is under a cloud, there is a ban on gas exploration and a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. In 2018, the last coal plant in South Australia was blown up and in NSW Liddell is destined for the scrapheap by 2023.</p><p>Taylor was touted as the nation's great hope for keeping the lights on. Unless he does more than reading the riot act to the states, blackouts and high power prices will continue.</p><p>Dale Ellis, Innisfail, Qld</p><p>We hear again today of more coal-fired generating capacity being closed down years ahead of its use-by date. No doubt the catastrophists will see this as a victory. Don't they read the facts? Coal (and to a lesser extent gas) generators need to keep their turbines spinning 24 hours a day to be prepared for the next drop in wind speed or cloud that obscures the sun. They get paid only for the periods they are required to despatch power into the system to provide backup for unreliable renewables. They get paid little or nothing for being on stand by, yet need to consume huge amounts of fuel to do so. With the table so stacked against them, it's a wonder any are still in business.</p><p>K.

So far this year, out-of-control burn-offs and unregistered burn-offs have already caused unnecessary call-outs to for brigades,\" Mr Brittain said.</p><p>\"You should not burn off when winds are high or high winds are forecast - not only on the day of your burn but for the days afterwards. For information about burn-off restrictions specific to your area, consult your local council.\"</p><p>He said once the Fire Danger Period came into effect, the CFA had a zero-tolerance approach to any fires that had started from negligent behaviour.</p><p>\"Expect any fire you start to be fully investigated by CFA and Victoria Police,\" he said.</p><p>Last month the CFA issued a haystack fire warning to growers after a spate of haystack fires last season.</p><p>CFA District 17 commander Lindsay Barry said haystack fires were always a major concern for the CFA.</p><p>\"There was a significant increase in haystack fires last year, from stand alone bales to huge piles of bales worth thousands of dollars,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Barry said high rainfalls earlier in the year meant there was more growth in paddocks.</p><p>\"The amount of hay that is being cut will of course make a big impact on how many haystack fires we have. It's looking like there will be less hay cut this year,\" he said.</p><p>CFA crews attended 83 haystack fires last season across the state, with many occurring in western Victoria. Since 2008, the CFA has responded to more than 1500 haystack fires.</p><p>About the Fire Danger Period: THE CFA does issue permits for certain situations during the FDP. However, there are very strict conditions attached to these permits and the liability sits with the permit holder to ensure they always act safely.</p><p>During the Fire Danger Period, fires cannot be lit in the open air without a written permit from CFA or a Municipal Fire Prevention Officer.</p><p>A written permit is required to burn off grass, undergrowth, weeds or other vegetation during the Fire Danger Period. This permit may be issued by the Municipal Fire Prevention Officer or the CFA District Office.</p><p>Lighting a fire in the open without a permit is an offence and can bring a penalty of over $19,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment. Barbecues and fires for cooking and warmth do not require a permit, but must be lit in properly constructed fireplaces.</p><p>The use of an incinerator, chainsaw/lawn mower, welding/grinding equipment and vehicles that come in contact with vegetation and machinery with an internal combustion/heat engine are permitted provided conditions are followed.</p><p>Mr Brittain said more information on the Fire Danger Period was available on the CFA's website.</p><p>While you're with us, you can now receive updates straight to your inbox twice weekly from the Wimmera Mail-Times.

Total fire bans were also issued in those areas - the earliest bans of the season in almost a decade, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS).</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology's NSW severe weather manager Simon Louis said the strong winds and dry conditions combined to cause very-high to severe fire danger across the Illawarra.</p><p>The lack of recent rainfall and \"very dry fuels\" also contributed to the severe fire danger conditions, Mr Louis said. \"We haven't had a fire weather warning for the Illawarra in August since 2009, and that again comes back to the very dry lead-in we've had to this season and the very dry state that the fuels are in,\" he said.</p><p>While major fires burned in the Nowra and Ulladulla areas, fallen power lines did spark a blaze off Mount Brandon Road at Jerrara, west of Kiama, just before 9am.</p><p>RFS and Fire and Rescue NSW crews worked quickly to protect properties as gusty winds fanned the flames.</p><p>RFS district officer David Hitchens described the wind as \"quite severe\". \"Winds that are above 100km/h ... from multiple directions [makes it] very hard to contain a fire and the crews that were here today [Wednesday] did an extremely good job to do that,\" Mr Hitchens said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the wild winds saw NSW State Emergency Service (SES) crews respond to about 65 jobs across the Illawarra and South Coast on Wednesday. More than 30 of the jobs, most of which were for roof damage and fallen trees and branches, were in the Illawarra. The remainder stretched across the Shoalhaven, as far south as Milton.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ILMYAU-doc71gsvciw6t38ohb1jaa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ILMYAU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1W-FSC1-JD34-V0RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314241</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"442\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Illawarra Newspapers Holding Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Illawarra Mercury</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 16, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

For bushfires, scientists look at the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index, developed in the 1960s by CSIRO scientist A.G. McArthur to forecast how weather would affect fire behaviour.</p><p>As the name suggests, the gauge examines the risks to woodlands from fire using a combination of rainfall or drought conditions along with predicted wind speeds, temperature and humidity.</p><p>Typically, winter and spring see the highest ratings on this fire danger index in the north and these move southward as spring makes way for summer.</p><p>Define catastrophic</p><p>Fire and emergency authorities started to review response plans in 2008 to adapt to \"growing intensity and severity of recent bushfire experiences across the country\".</p><p>Then Black Saturday's bushfires erupted in Victoria on February 7, 2009, leaving 173 people dead. That event \"brought into sharp focus the possibility that the current legislation, systems, practices and processes to support effective community safety outcomes may no longer match the increasing levels of risk and expectations\", a bushfire warning taskforce report noted.</p><p>The highest fire danger rating was set as \"catastrophic\" for index readings of 100 or more - In Victoria, they are dubbed Code Red. The basic message was boiled down to: \"For your survival, leaving is the best option.\"</p><p>The dire assessment is because some fires on such days are likely to become \"uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving\" and \"there is a very high likelihood that people in the path of the fire will die or be injured\", the taskforce said.</p><p>Melbourne reached an index reading of about 150 on Black Saturday, according to Ross Bradstock, director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong.</p><p>For Sydney to exceed 100 on the index could be a first, at least for the Observatory Hill and Sydney Airport sites, where the weather is measured.</p><p>Climate change role</p><p>Yes, there is a link between climate change and the prevalence and severity of fires. In fact, the research is \"old hat\", says Professor Bradstock. \"The research has all been done. We don't need to keep doing it.\"</p><p>As the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO pointed out in last year's latest State of the Climate report, the number of the most extreme 10 per cent of fire weather days based on the fire danger index \"has increased in recent decades across many regions of Australia, especially in southern and eastern Australia\".</p><p>\"There has been an associated increase in the length of the fire weather season,\" it said. \"Climate change, including increasing temperatures, is contributing to these changes.\"</p><p>In general, one consequence for fire authorities is that the fire season is getting longer. In eastern Australia, that means fire risks start to increase earlier in the spring and last longer into the autumn. The window for hazard-reduction burning is shifting into winter - if it's not too damp to do it.</p><p>Is this unusual?</p><p>Depending on where you are, very unusual. NSW, for instance, could see a million hectares burned so far this fire season within days - if it hasn't already done so. That is about the same as the past three fire seasons combined - and summer is yet to arrive.</p><p>Rainfall deficiencies - or what most of us call \"drought\" - are already the worst on record for northern NSW and parts of southern Queensland.</p><p>And it has also been hot. Of particular concern is predicted heat for the very dry areas around big population centres such as Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong.</p><p>Temperatures are likely to reach the mid to high 30s today at a time when moisture levels in plants - a gauge of how quickly they will burn if fire breaks out - are tracking below those of the big fire season of 2013 in the Sydney area, and the worst since 2002.</p><p>Professor Bradstock published research in 2009 predicting the fire danger index would track to 2030 and 2050, using CSIRO data from 2007. \"The current predictions [for Sydney on November 12] are beyond what we predicted back in 2007,\" he says. \"That's not good.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc77xg3e44aki1er5ngbzk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGD-SD11-F0J6-J1WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

On Sunday alone, the CFA attended fires at Smythes Creek, Ross Creek and Bung Bong to name just a few.</p><p>Duty Officer Gavin Hope said while full-time farmers were generally aware of when restrictions apply, there were concerns with some hobby farmers.</p><p>\"Sometimes you see smoke in the air and think it must be okay to start burning off, so we do sometimes see issues,\" he said.</p><p>\"At this time of the year, a lot of the fires are probably branches and twigs. If you drive around, you will see piles getting ready to burn.</p><p>\"We do occasionally have people try and tell us that restrictions are off, but there's plenty of signage around and all you have to do is check media reports and they are there.\"</p><p>Mr Hope said it had been an incredibly busy season, which had seen constant big fires.</p><p>\"There's been quite a few decent jobs in the Ballarat district,\" he said. \"At the start we had Buninyong, then we had Scarsdale, Hepburn, Haddon and Bunkers Hill and Mount Clear.</p><p>\"Plus obviously we've had plenty of cars and house fires, and many car accident rescues.</p><p>\"Hopefully now the bushfires will die off in someway, but obviously as it cools down we now get more house fires, people drying clothes, things like that and slippery roads can lead to more accidents.\"</p><p>Forest Fire Management Midlands District Manager Jasmine Filmer said this year's season had problematic in that there hadn't been the string of still, warm days needed to complete every planned burn.</p><p>\"We've had a couple of burns around Ballarat, we've also done some burning in the Wombat State Forest, Trentham Racecourse Road, Blackwood, Albion track.</p><p>\"This time last year we had finished, but the forecast rainfall this week has probably put an end to burns int he Wombat, but we still hope to get in some burns around Beaufort and in Anakie.</p><p>\"For (planned burns) around Smythesdale and Linton we are going to need some good drying days in the next few weeks, but this week does look unfavourable.\"</p><p>Ms Filmer said agencies would get together this week to plan for the next few years.</p><p>She said said it was hard to predict whether some burns could be completed in spring as weather was not as usually settled as the autumn months.</p><p>Mr Hope said even when the fire danger period comes off, people wishing to burn should still heed fire safety practices.</p><p>\"Don't leave fires unattended, make sure you keep an eye on them and make sure they are fully out,\" he said.</p><p>\"There is still dry soil, so it's important to keep an eye on the wind conditions, you never know when something can spring up.\"</p><p>He said while fires would generally be out in country areas, he warned there could be a lot more smoke around once restrictions were off, with people suffering breathing difficulties to be aware of the possibly of poor air quality.</p><p>Have you signed up to The Courier's daily newsletter and breaking news emails?

The reality is more bushfires will erupt this summer - be it through lightning, power line failure, negligence or criminal idiocy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Off the back of three years of record-low rainfall, the risk of a treacherous season is racing closer, and there is absolutely no room for complacency or failure to properly prepare.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The horror fires sweeping large parts of Queensland and New South Wales at present are a salient reminder of just how dire things can quickly get.</p><p>According to the Australian Seasonal Bushfire Outlook, Victoria's Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) - based on temperatures and average rainfall - has increased by 50 per cent since 1950, with 2018-19 the fourth highest warning level on record. The outlook, developed by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre and the Bureau of Meteorology, also warns of \"severe levels of underlying dryness persisting in soils and heavy forest fuels, along with higher abundance of dead fuel components and higher flammability of live vegetation\".</p><p>For the first time ever, greater Sydney was yesterday classified as facing \"catastrophic\" danger and fire risks are today forecast to elevate again across northern states.</p><p>Victoria has deployed 370 firefighters and specialists to NSW and another 36 to Queensland to assist with the current fires that have killed three people and destroyed more than 150 properties.</p><p>In Victoria, a total fire ban was declared for the Mallee yesterday and fire restrictions have been imposed in parts of Gippsland.</p><p>Above-normal bushfire conditions have been designated from the coast and hinterland forests of East Gippsland, extending into West Gippsland and the Great Dividing Range.</p><p>Emergency authorities have also warned of high risk that ash forests in the Central Highlands and Otways may dry out at faster rates than expected in coming weeks and months.</p><p>While winter rains have been effective in some parts of western Victoria, the east and northeast regions will be hot spots for fire.</p><p>Emergency Management Victoria has an increased fleet of 50 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, including a mix of water bombing, supervision and air intelligence assets at its disposal, with access to a further 100 in emergency situations. Two air tankers can each carry up to 15,000 litres of water, foam or retardant and two air cranes, capable of carrying 7500 litres of water will be strategically positioned across the state. To illustrate the elevated threat levels of recent years, firefighting aircraft were deployed 2455 times last fire season in Victoria - an increase of 11 per cent on the previous year. But, while air support has been bolstered, the government's politicisation of the fire services has eroded surge capacity within the Country Fire Authority.</p><p>While the CFA's chief officer Steve Warrington argued capacity remains stable, the agency's annual report said more than 1000 volunteers had left the service in the past year. In September, the Herald Sun revealed the CFA had again missed its targets, with 34,380 volunteers, the fewest since 2006. With the high chances of Victoria's rural fire services facing significant tests this summer, it is vital volunteer surge capacity be addressed and protected.</p><p>Tech response to abuse FOR decades, the wider community and authorities lacked focus on the issue of domestic violence and protecting victims.</p><p>In suburban homes, behind closed doors, partners and children have been subject to hidden violence and abuse. Sometimes, the result has been tragically lethal. Often, the result has been damaging long-term.</p><p>Thankfully, greater attention is now being imposed, following the Royal Commission into Family Violence and education initiatives, including the Herald Sun's Take a Stand campaign.</p><p>But making real inroads into reporting and responding to family violence, identifying risks, ensuring victims and children are given absolute priority in safety, and adopting preventive measures, are all areas for further work.</p><p>Change has begun, including the bolstering of Victoria Police's specialist services and dedicated lawyers within the criminal justice system to respond to DV cases.</p><p>The digital frontier is the latest aspect to receive attention, and reform is needed when it comes to stalking and online intrusion.</p><p>As reported in today's newspaper, police are looking at options to generate early-warning identifiers and better respond to online harassment. Assistant Commissioner Dean McWhirter said it was critical for police to \"keep ahead of the game\" when it came to new apps and technologies that can be used to continue abuse or stalk. One option to be assessed is a Tasmanian trial of GPS trackers for domestic abusers.If the starting and end point is protection, whatever technologies that can be deployed, should be.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-2ad976d600ea11eaabd0976ef01a58115a633044ffac74f3dff812295bc02574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGF-DF81-F0JP-W3VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

warning Australians to expect more extreme weather events as climate change worsens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Temperatures rose across South Australia on Wednesday with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting a maximum of 38 degrees for Port Lincoln.</p><p>This is around the mark for Port Lincoln's highest temperature for 2016 which was 38.5 on December 26 and higher than the maximum for February last year, which was 32.7 on February 23.</p><p>The temperature is expected to remain in the 30s today with a forecast of 32 degrees.</p><p>Cummins reached 42 at about 12.30pm with 18 per cent humidity while Tumby Bay was cooler reaching about 30 at noon with 64 per cent humidity.</p><p>According to the Climate Council of Australia report released yesterday, Cranking Up the Intensity: Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events, Australia is experiencing hotter and longer heatwaves with increased bushfire risk as fire seasons are lasting longer.</p><p>It said the Forest Fire Danger Index may increase across southern Australia, including coastal regions by seven per cent by 2030 and by 30 per cent by 2090 under a high emissions scenario.</p><p>As well as hot conditions the report has linked climate change to extreme storm events, including the storm that affected South Australia in September last year, which took out power across the state, including Port Lincoln.</p><p>It states the oceans are warming, especially at the surface, which is driving higher evaporation rates and the warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour.</p><p>The report said the one per cent increase in global temperatures, together with increasing evaporation had lead to a seven per cent increase in water vapour in the atmosphere.</p><p>The report said the burning of fossil fuels was linked to the temperature rises with Australia set to miss its target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction in emissions by the year 2030.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

On Sunday alone, the CFA attended fires at Smythes Creek, Ross Creek and Bung Bong to name just a few.</p><p>Duty Officer Gavin Hope said while full-time farmers were generally aware of when restrictions apply, there were concerns with some hobby farmers.</p><p>\"Sometimes you see smoke in the air and think it must be okay to start burning off, so we do sometimes see issues,\" he said.</p><p>\"At this time of the year, a lot of the fires are probably branches and twigs. If you drive around, you will see piles getting ready to burn.</p><p>\"We do occasionally have people try and tell us that restrictions are off, but there's plenty of signage around and all you have to do is check media reports and they are there.\"</p><p>Mr Hope said it had been an incredibly busy season, which had seen constant big fires.</p><p>\"There's been quite a few decent jobs in the Ballarat district,\" he said. \"At the start we had Buninyong, then we had Scarsdale, Hepburn, Haddon and Bunkers Hill and Mount Clear.</p><p>\"Plus obviously we've had plenty of cars and house fires, and many car accident rescues.</p><p>\"Hopefully now the bushfires will die off in someway, but obviously as it cools down we now get more house fires, people drying clothes, things like that and slippery roads can lead to more accidents.\"</p><p>Forest Fire Management Midlands District Manager Jasmine Filmer said this year's season had problematic in that there hadn't been the string of still, warm days needed to complete every planned burn.</p><p>\"We've had a couple of burns around Ballarat, we've also done some burning in the Wombat State Forest, Trentham Racecourse Road, Blackwood, Albion track.</p><p>\"This time last year we had finished, but the forecast rainfall this week has probably put an end to burns int he Wombat, but we still hope to get in some burns around Beaufort and in Anakie.</p><p>\"For (planned burns) around Smythesdale and Linton we are going to need some good drying days in the next few weeks, but this week does look unfavourable.\"</p><p>Ms Filmer said agencies would get together this week to plan for the next few years.</p><p>She said said it was hard to predict whether some burns could be completed in spring as weather was not as usually settled as the autumn months.</p><p>Mr Hope said even when the fire danger period comes off, people wishing to burn should still heed fire safety practices.</p><p>\"Don't leave fires unattended, make sure you keep an eye on them and make sure they are fully out,\" he said.</p><p>\"There is still dry soil, so it's important to keep an eye on the wind conditions, you never know when something can spring up.\"</p><p>He said while fires would generally be out in country areas, he warned there could be a lot more smoke around once restrictions were off, with people suffering breathing difficulties to be aware of the possibly of poor air quality.</p><p>Have you signed up to The Courier's daily newsletter and breaking news emails?

native wedge-tailed eagles in north-east Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The carcasses of four eagles have been discovered in the Black Range State Forest, near Yea, by Forest Fire Management Victoria crews conducting a routine patrol.</p><p>All four eagles had been shot.</p><p>The latest discovery brings the total of wedge-tailed eagles that have been found shot or poisoned in the same area during recent years to 20.</p><p>Last year alone the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) located eight eagles that had been killed by poison within a 25-metre radius of each other near the Yea area.</p><p>DELWP's spokesman, Darren Skelton, said authorities were very concerned about the deliberate and cruel attacks on native wildlife.</p><p>\"It's concerning for the community to know that there are people out there who are intentionally killing these wonderful birds,\" he said.</p><p>Wedge-tailed eagles are Australia's largest bird of prey.</p><p>Mr Skelton said the eagles could sometimes be targeted by farmers who fear for the safety of newborn lambs, but he said eagles were only a minimal threat to young livestock.</p><p>\"What we know is that wedge-tailed eagles are far more likely to get a feed off road kill or other species than they are off lambs,\" he said.</p><p>Wedge-tailed eagles are protected under the Wildlife Act 1975 and deliberately hunting or killing the birds carries a penalty of around $8,000, or up to six months' imprisonment.</p><p>\"We know most people admire and value eagles and the role they play in the local environment as well as contributing to our state's biodiversity, \" DELWP senior wildlife officer, Leigh Murray, said.</p><p>\"This type of activity is definitely not acceptable.\"</p><p>DELWP is calling on the community to help gather information about the eagles' deaths in an attempt to prosecute the offenders.</p><p>Information can be provided anonymously by phoning DELWP's Customer Service Centre on 136 186 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Mr Miller said an operation on Christmas night went well, and he remains in the hospital's burns unit recovering.</p><p>\"They're just trying to figure out a plan because my wife is 39 weeks pregnant. We're trying to figure out if I can get to Horsham and get closer to see her if she does happen to go into labour,\" he said.</p><p>\"I couldn't believe it. A truck started the fire and we had no idea how that happened.

It's not something I would ever want anyone to experience.</p><p>\"Because I haven't had to have skin grafts, the (recovery) time frame is probably going to be a bit longer.

Typically, they are dead plant material, such as leaves, grass, bark and twigs thinner than 6mm thick, and live plant material thinner than 3mm thick.\" The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning has spent months trying to block The Weekly Times' access to fuel load maps, repeatedly refusing to release data.</p><p>In August last year DELWP staff stated: \"The fuel load data is only published to Business Level Data (an internal system)\".</p><p>After repeated delays, emails and calls DELWP came back almost 12 months later stating \"this information is not something that DELWP typically provides and the department has some concerns with this information being made publicly accessible\".</p><p>Ultimately The Weekly Times lodged a Freedom of Information request for five years of data for the whole state, but cut back the request to one map after DELWP demanded $1294.80 to process the request.</p><p>The 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission's recommended that the department \"specify the characteristics of fire management zones - including burn size, percentage area burnt within the prescribed burn, and residual fuel loading\".</p><p>But as it stands DELWP's Forest Fire Management Victoria division publishes data only on residual risk, which is derived from a computer model, which gives no detail on fuel loads, which were used in the past.</p><p>\" Continued Page 4 \" Editorial, Page 16 \" Rule's View Page 17 \" From Page 1 Opposition emergency services spokesman Brad Battin said the Andrews Government's \"attempt to hide information that has a direct impact on community safety\" should concern all who live in high fire-danger areas.</p><p>\"The only reason the Victorian Labor Government would hide this important data is they have failed to meet their targets to protect Victoria this fire season,\" Mr Battin said.</p><p>\"With levels of fuel at extreme, a predicted dry and hot summer and a reduction in volunteer firefighters we can only say not only has (Premier) Daniel Andrews made you less safe, he now will do anything to hide the truth from you.\" In 2010 the Black Saturday Royal Commission recommended the \"state fund and commit to implementing a long-term program of prescribed burning based on an annual rolling target of 5 per cent minimum of public land\", equal to 385,000ha annually. But the Andrews Government abandoned hectare-based targets in 2015, opting for a computer modelled measure of residual risk - the simulated difference between impacts of a fire with maximum fuel loads versus one with reduced fuel loads resulting from controlled burns and past wildfires.</p><p>Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the Government was using a risk-reduction target to focus its fuel-management strategies on areas that would have the greatest impact. \"Using this target does not necessarily mean we are burning less, or burning more - it means we are burning smarter.\" The model has been roundly condemned by Australia's leading bushfire scientists. The Weekly Times has previously reported the former head of CSIRO's bushfire research unit Phil Cheney has branded residual risk a \"load of bulls-\", arguing \"fuel load is the only thing that matters\".</p><p>HAVE YOUR SAY Should the Government reveal the fire risk?theweeklytimes.com.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-d34d4cb4f90d11e990dee5ef1e6dd98332da715d63a2f8a5ef561da660a121a7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCN-T031-F0JP-W1V9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DB1O</classCode><className>RESIDUAL FUEL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And for the emergency services, one of those learnings was how we as a sector ... connect with our communities,\" he said.</p><p>The day began with rain and hail in the area, which Mr Warrington acknowledged was \"quite bizarre\" on a day of preparing for fire.</p><p>Debra Abbott, the deputy emergency management commissioner at Emergency Management Victoria, said the exercise was vital before heading into what was <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-28/bushfire-outlook-not-good-news-but-will-we-heed-the-warnings/11434778\">forecast to be a hot, dry summer</url>.</p><p>\"Plan for summer, because if the fire's on your doorstep, that's too late,\" she said.</p><p>'No-one wants to die'</p><p>Bushfire season started early this year and several <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-10-10/two-people-dead-in-nsw-bushfires/11589026\">devastating fires have torn through Queensland and New South Wales</url> - including a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-10-26/fires-at-emergency-level-near-darawank-and-mount-george/11642876\">bushfire threatening homes in northern NSW</url> as the fire drill took place in Victoria.</p><p>\"We are watching what's happening in Queensland and New South Wales, we currently have crews on the ground in New South Wales supporting them at the moment, so if that's a reflection to what's occurred, then yes [that is concerning],\" Mr Warrington said.</p><p>\"We live in one of the worst bushfire-prone areas in the world. Victorians know that. We've got a long, long history of significant bushfires where significant life is lost, property is lost. Every year there will be some sort of property loss.</p><p>\"That's what we live in. People need to acknowledge that and be prepared for it.\"</p><p>Residents were told at 12:30pm that they should evacuate and around 50 people left their homes for the evacuation centre in Powelltown.</p><p>The towns only have one road in and one road out, which Powelltown resident Jennifer Shaw said was a concern.</p><p>\"There can be one way in and one way out [so] I just wanted it to be a real exercise,\" Ms Shaw said.</p><p>\"It's prompted me to do everything that I can to be safe in a situation and assisting my neighbours as well.\"</p><p>Julie Horner said she had packed an emergency kit containing six bags of food, woollen blankets, bed linen, three days of clothes - \"you name it\" - and she said she had packed it.</p><p>\"I've timed myself to see how long it would take to pack the car... and so now I know I just need half an hour and I'm out,\" she said.</p><p>\"No-one wants to die... no one wants to be burnt.\"</p><p>Residents told to plan as if 'the emergency services don't exist'</p><p>At the nearby pub, it was business as usual, with the staff there deciding not to participate but to keep running the shop.</p><p>However, pub worker Tracy Connors said the exercise had made her think about her fire plan, given she lives on a small block near town.</p><p>\"We're definitely the sort of people to evacuate,\" she said.</p><p>Powelltown does have a fire bunker, which was manned during the drill by Ronald Gribble from Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>But he said it should only be used as a place of last resort during an emergency.</p><p>\"You could fit the whole town in here if you had to but it wouldn't be comfortable,\" he said.</p><p>The CFA's Mr Warrington said the day was about encouraging people to come up with a plan and be prepared to leave quickly when necessary.</p><p>\"You will not get someone knocking on your door,\" he warned.</p><p>\"Plan as if the fire services, the emergency services don't exist, and if we turn up, it's a bonus.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

species as this massive tree here [Prefect], just 500 years younger,\" he said.</p><p>But a fire scientist at the University of Tasmania, Professor David Bowman, warned that climate change could bring more dry lightning strikes, like the ones that caused the blazes over summer.</p><p>\"The environment these trees [are] in is going to be dryer and warmer and more fire prone because of more lightning-ignited bushfires,\" he said.</p><p>\"So what we have to do is intervene in the field to provide fire breaks, change fuel, maybe irrigate do all sorts of radical interventions.\"</p><p>Ms

And for the emergency services, one of those learnings was how we as a sector ... connect with our communities,\" he said.</p><p>The day began with rain and hail in the area, which Mr Warrington acknowledged was \"quite bizarre\" on a day of preparing for fire.</p><p>Debra Abbott, the deputy emergency management commissioner at Emergency Management Victoria, said the exercise was vital before heading into what was <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-28/bushfire-outlook-not-good-news-but-will-we-heed-the-warnings/11434778\">forecast to be a hot, dry summer</url>.</p><p>\"Plan for summer, because if the fire's on your doorstep, that's too late,\" she said.</p><p>'No-one wants to die'</p><p>Bushfire season started early this year and several <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-10-10/two-people-dead-in-nsw-bushfires/11589026\">devastating fires have torn through Queensland and New South Wales</url> - including a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-10-26/fires-at-emergency-level-near-darawank-and-mount-george/11642876\">bushfire threatening homes in northern NSW</url> as the fire drill took place in Victoria.</p><p>\"We are watching what's happening in Queensland and New South Wales, we currently have crews on the ground in New South Wales supporting them at the moment, so if that's a reflection to what's occurred, then yes [that is concerning],\" Mr Warrington said.</p><p>\"We live in one of the worst bushfire-prone areas in the world. Victorians know that. We've got a long, long history of significant bushfires where significant life is lost, property is lost. Every year there will be some sort of property loss.</p><p>\"That's what we live in. People need to acknowledge that and be prepared for it.\"</p><p>Residents were told at 12:30pm that they should evacuate and around 50 people left their homes for the evacuation centre in Powelltown.</p><p>The towns only have one road in and one road out, which Powelltown resident Jennifer Shaw said was a concern.</p><p>\"There can be one way in and one way out [so] I just wanted it to be a real exercise,\" Ms Shaw said.</p><p>\"It's prompted me to do everything that I can to be safe in a situation and assisting my neighbours as well.\"</p><p>Julie Horner said she had packed an emergency kit containing six bags of food, woollen blankets, bed linen, three days of clothes - \"you name it\" - and she said she had packed it.</p><p>\"I've timed myself to see how long it would take to pack the car... and so now I know I just need half an hour and I'm out,\" she said.</p><p>\"No-one wants to die... no one wants to be burnt.\"</p><p>Residents told to plan as if 'the emergency services don't exist'</p><p>At the nearby pub, it was business as usual, with the staff there deciding not to participate but to keep running the shop.</p><p>However, pub worker Tracy Connors said the exercise had made her think about her fire plan, given she lives on a small block near town.</p><p>\"We're definitely the sort of people to evacuate,\" she said.</p><p>Powelltown does have a fire bunker, which was manned during the drill by Ronald Gribble from Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>But he said it should only be used as a place of last resort during an emergency.</p><p>\"You could fit the whole town in here if you had to but it wouldn't be comfortable,\" he said.</p><p>The CFA's Mr Warrington said the day was about encouraging people to come up with a plan and be prepared to leave quickly when necessary.</p><p>\"You will not get someone knocking on your door,\" he warned.</p><p>\"Plan as if the fire services, the emergency services don't exist, and if we turn up, it's a bonus.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Fire authorities say there is no time to waste. They're urging families to sit down - today - and work out what they would do in the event of a bushfire.</p><p>And experts say authorities need to prepare for a new normal in which bushfires rage across the country year-round, potentially coinciding with other natural disasters such as cyclones and floods.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do we all need a bushfire plan?</emphasis></p><p>The need for a bushfire survival plan is a no-brainer for people living on fire-prone land - near the bush, coastal scrub, grasslands or paddocks. But city-dwellers should also keep the possibility of bushfires in mind when planning holidays and weekends away, says Rural Fire Service spokesman Ben Shepherd.</p><p>\"Quite often we spend weeks or months organising a holiday but we won't spend an extra 40 minutes just discussing what we might do in the event that a bushfire threatens us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Mount Victoria, 2013.</emphasis></p><p>\"Many people believe it won't happen to them or they try and make a decision at the last minute, and unfortunately that's when lives can be lost.\"</p><p>As urban sprawl continues to creep into bushfire zones, experts warn that more people may need to plan for a bushfire in their backyard.</p><p>Sydney, for instance, has peri-urban areas where the suburbs encroach on national parks, such as around Lane Cove and Cronulla, says Dale Dominey-Howes, Professor of Hazard and Disaster Risk Sciences at the University of Sydney. Even in parts of the city's inner west, there are pockets that could be vulnerable to catching fire, he says.</p><p>Should I stay or should I go?</p><p>Ask people what their plan is if a bushfire threatens and chances are they will say \"leave\". But while leaving is certainly the right decision for most, and the only option recommended on days with extreme and catastrophic fire danger, it's not a fireproof plan, says Inspector Shepherd.</p><p>Why? Because fire won't always give you that choice.</p><p>The three main questions to think about when devising your plan are:</p><p>But you also need to consider the \"what-ifs\" and have a Plan B.</p><p>\"We do see a number of people say their decision is to leave,\" says Inspector Shepherd. \"But what if they can't leave, or what if their route is cut, or what if we're not together as a family unit? Does everybody in the household know what they're going to do?\"</p><p>Picture a typical Saturday morning, Inspector Shepherd suggests. \"I might go 'Hey, I might duck into town and grab the papers or grab a coffee'. What happens if the fire starts then and the kids are home alone? Do they know what to do?\"</p><p>NSW fire authorities have launched a website - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.myfireplan.com.au/\">myfireplan.com.au</url> - to help families talk through what they can do and work out a \"fireproof\" survival plan. Families are also encouraged to visit their local fire station and talk through any questions.</p><p><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>https://youtu.be/cCCJHm2QKuQ</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do the fire ratings mean?</emphasis></p><p>We've all seen the roadside fire danger rating dial, to which catastrophic was added after Black Saturday in 2009. It's based on the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) which takes in forecast conditions - temperature, humidity, wind speed and dryness of the landscape.</p><p>When it's \"catastrophic\", no home can withstand the severity of the fire and people are encouraged to leave fire-prone areas before any fire has started.</p><p>At \"extreme\", it's only possible to defend homes that have been built to withstand fire.</p><p>At \"severe\", only if a home is well prepared and the homeowner is physically and mentally capable of defending it should they consider staying.</p><p>That's not to say firefighting is a walk in the park at lower levels, Inspector Shepherd warns. More homes have been lost in NSW at \"very high\" and \"severe\" fire danger than \"extreme\" and \"catastrophic\" days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Londonderry, 2016.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If you're staying, what do you need to have in place? </emphasis></p><p>A lot of people do choose to stay and defend their homes when the bushfire level is \"very high\" or \"severe\" and, if they are well prepared, Inspector Shepherd says, they are welcome to do so. But what does being well prepared involve? It's not just about having clean gutters, although that's a good start.</p><p>You also need to be prepared to continue firefighting from inside as the fire impacts.</p><p>People often ask if they should take shelter in the bathroom. The answer is no, Inspector Shepherd says. You need to be able to move around the house and put out any fires inside. You'll lose electricity, and then water, which is why you'll need the bath and sinks filled so you can keep putting fires out. You also need to be able to escape any room you're in.</p><p>Sound stressful? \"It can be scary, it can be hard to breathe, the embers will be flying through the air and starting fires potentially around you. It will be loud. There will be potentially sirens and helicopters and flames,\" says Inspector Shepherd.</p><p>\"What we don't want to see you do is choose to stay and defend, and at the last minute think, I can't do this and try to leave.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Bundeena, 2018. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you do if you're stuck elsewhere?</emphasis></p><p>There are few sentences more ominous than the bushfire emergency warning alert that states: \"It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire impacts.\"</p><p>So what do you do if you're caught?</p><p>Inspector Shepherd says your best chance of survival is sheltering in a building and fighting the fire from inside.</p><p>If you're caught in a car, you'll need to try to position it away from the fire front and away from trees. Put your hazard lights on and sound the horn in case other vehicles are nearby. Turn off the engine and close the windows. Lie down below window level and cover yourself with a blanket to protect from radiant heat. A grass fire might take a couple of minutes to pass. A forest fire could take between seven and 10 minutes.</p><p>Avoid being caught on foot at all costs - but if you are, make sure you are covered and try to find a rock, log or ditch to shield yourself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Bundeena, 2018.</emphasis></p><p>How do people die in a bushfire?</p><p>It's not necessarily the flames. If you're caught in the path of the fire, chances are it's the radiant heat that will kill you - which is why solid buildings are the safest place to shelter.</p><p>The heat emitted by a bushfire can be more than 1000 degrees, in the worst conditions and, depending on the vegetation being burnt as the fire roars through, it can radiate 50-100 metres around the fire front.</p><p>In a disaster such as Black Saturday, radiant heat would have been responsible for dozens of deaths. It is strong enough to set vehicles alight, and can kill people who think they are safe sheltering in pools and waterways, but who make the fatal error of breathing in superheated air.</p><p>While the deaths on Black Saturday made radiant heat Victoria's biggest bushfire killer, in NSW - which has not seen bushfire deaths on the same scale - the biggest killer in bushfiresis heart attacks.</p><p>\"People can't underestimate the stress a large bushfire can have on an individual,\" says Inspector Shepherd. \"It is hot, it is stressful, you will be exerting yourself running around. It is a real risk, not just for us but the general public as well.\"</p><p>Other major causes of death during bushfires are falling trees and branches, vehicle accidents which tend to occur due to poor visibility from smoke, and poisoning from toxic gases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Mount Victoria, 2013.</emphasis></p><p>What's the role of firefighters?</p><p>\"Fighting fires is everyone's job\", says Tony Johnson, the acting Assistant Commissioner of Queensland Fire and Emergency Service.</p><p>\"We've got a lot of volunteers and limited resources. It's a shared responsibility for managing fire and the landscape and bushfire.\"</p><p>The NSWRFS is powered by more than 70,000 volunteers, QFES has about 42,000, Victoria's Country Fire Association has almost 35,000, South Australia's Country Fire Service about 13,500, Tasmania has 5000 and Western Australia has about 2300. But they are already increasingly stretched.</p><p>Professor Dominey-Howes says it's only a matter of time before Australia experiences a \"summer of discontent\", with \"tropical cyclones in the north, bushfires in the central region, floods elsewhere, in multiple states and territories at the same time, really stretching the national workforce.\"</p><p>\"I am personally of the view that eventually we may need to look at ways to increase the capability of emergency services, and that might be a case for conscripting people in.\"</p><p>In the meantime, he suggests getting involved with your local volunteer fire service.</p><p>\"That way, you're contributing to your community, getting to know other people, and you'll grow skills and knowledge that you'll take back to your home and share with your family and your network.\"</p><p><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>https://youtu.be/pdRCxIZYeDw</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520180647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1V-0SN1-DY19-C3TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1523\"/><timeReceived>08:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

What can you do now to prepare?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rainforest burning. In September. If ever there was an omen of the bushfire season ahead and a sign of the new normal, it would be the loss of 17 homes in Queensland's Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast in the first two weeks of spring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bushfire crisis that's hit south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales so early in the season has devastated those communities - and it's a wake-up call to residents across Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Peregian Springs, 2019. </emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The drought has left subtropical rainforests tinder-dry, and the summer ahead promises more of the same. Fire authorities say there is no time to waste. They're urging families to sit down - today - and work out what they would do in the event of a bushfire.</p><p>And experts say authorities need to prepare for a new normal in which bushfires rage across the country year-round, potentially coinciding with other natural disasters such as cyclones and floods.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do we all need a bushfire plan?</emphasis></p><p>The need for a bushfire survival plan is a no-brainer for people living on fire-prone land - near the bush, coastal scrub, grasslands or paddocks. But city-dwellers should also keep the possibility of bushfires in mind when planning holidays and weekends away, says Rural Fire Service spokesman Ben Shepherd.</p><p>\"Quite often we spend weeks or months organising a holiday but we won't spend an extra 40 minutes just discussing what we might do in the event that a bushfire threatens us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Mount Victoria, 2013.</emphasis></p><p>\"Many people believe it won't happen to them or they try and make a decision at the last minute, and unfortunately that's when lives can be lost.\"</p><p>As urban sprawl continues to creep into bushfire zones, experts warn that more people may need to plan for a bushfire in their backyard.</p><p>Sydney, for instance, has peri-urban areas where the suburbs encroach on national parks, such as around Lane Cove and Cronulla, says Dale Dominey-Howes, Professor of Hazard and Disaster Risk Sciences at the University of Sydney. Even in parts of the city's inner west, there are pockets that could be vulnerable to catching fire, he says.</p><p>Should I stay or should I go?</p><p>Ask people what their plan is if a bushfire threatens and chances are they will say \"leave\". But while leaving is certainly the right decision for most, and the only option recommended on days with extreme and catastrophic fire danger, it's not a fireproof plan, says Inspector Shepherd.</p><p>Why? Because fire won't always give you that choice.</p><p>The three main questions to think about when devising your plan are:</p><p>But you also need to consider the \"what-ifs\" and have a Plan B.</p><p>\"We do see a number of people say their decision is to leave,\" says Inspector Shepherd. \"But what if they can't leave, or what if their route is cut, or what if we're not together as a family unit? Does everybody in the household know what they're going to do?\"</p><p>Picture a typical Saturday morning, Inspector Shepherd suggests. \"I might go 'Hey, I might duck into town and grab the papers or grab a coffee'. What happens if the fire starts then and the kids are home alone? Do they know what to do?\"</p><p>NSW fire authorities have launched a website - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.myfireplan.com.au/\">myfireplan.com.au</url> - to help families talk through what they can do and work out a \"fireproof\" survival plan. Families are also encouraged to visit their local fire station and talk through any questions.</p><p><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>https://youtu.be/cCCJHm2QKuQ</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do the fire ratings mean?</emphasis></p><p>We've all seen the roadside fire danger rating dial, to which catastrophic was added after Black Saturday in 2009. It's based on the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) which takes in forecast conditions - temperature, humidity, wind speed and dryness of the landscape.</p><p>When it's \"catastrophic\", no home can withstand the severity of the fire and people are encouraged to leave fire-prone areas before any fire has started.</p><p>At \"extreme\", it's only possible to defend homes that have been built to withstand fire.</p><p>At \"severe\", only if a home is well prepared and the homeowner is physically and mentally capable of defending it should they consider staying.</p><p>That's not to say firefighting is a walk in the park at lower levels, Inspector Shepherd warns. More homes have been lost in NSW at \"very high\" and \"severe\" fire danger than \"extreme\" and \"catastrophic\" days.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Londonderry, 2016.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If you're staying, what do you need to have in place? </emphasis></p><p>A lot of people do choose to stay and defend their homes when the bushfire level is \"very high\" or \"severe\" and, if they are well prepared, Inspector Shepherd says, they are welcome to do so. But what does being well prepared involve? It's not just about having clean gutters, although that's a good start.</p><p>You also need to be prepared to continue firefighting from inside as the fire impacts.</p><p>People often ask if they should take shelter in the bathroom. The answer is no, Inspector Shepherd says. You need to be able to move around the house and put out any fires inside. You'll lose electricity, and then water, which is why you'll need the bath and sinks filled so you can keep putting fires out. You also need to be able to escape any room you're in.</p><p>Sound stressful? \"It can be scary, it can be hard to breathe, the embers will be flying through the air and starting fires potentially around you. It will be loud. There will be potentially sirens and helicopters and flames,\" says Inspector Shepherd.</p><p>\"What we don't want to see you do is choose to stay and defend, and at the last minute think, I can't do this and try to leave.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Bundeena, 2018. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you do if you're stuck elsewhere?</emphasis></p><p>There are few sentences more ominous than the bushfire emergency warning alert that states: \"It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire impacts.\"</p><p>So what do you do if you're caught?</p><p>Inspector Shepherd says your best chance of survival is sheltering in a building and fighting the fire from inside.</p><p>If you're caught in a car, you'll need to try to position it away from the fire front and away from trees. Put your hazard lights on and sound the horn in case other vehicles are nearby. Turn off the engine and close the windows. Lie down below window level and cover yourself with a blanket to protect from radiant heat. A grass fire might take a couple of minutes to pass. A forest fire could take between seven and 10 minutes.</p><p>Avoid being caught on foot at all costs - but if you are, make sure you are covered and try to find a rock, log or ditch to shield yourself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Bundeena, 2018.</emphasis></p><p>How do people die in a bushfire?</p><p>It's not necessarily the flames. If you're caught in the path of the fire, chances are it's the radiant heat that will kill you - which is why solid buildings are the safest place to shelter.</p><p>The heat emitted by a bushfire can be more than 1000 degrees, in the worst conditions and, depending on the vegetation being burnt as the fire roars through, it can radiate 50-100 metres around the fire front.</p><p>In a disaster such as Black Saturday, radiant heat would have been responsible for dozens of deaths. It is strong enough to set vehicles alight, and can kill people who think they are safe sheltering in pools and waterways, but who make the fatal error of breathing in superheated air.</p><p>While the deaths on Black Saturday made radiant heat Victoria's biggest bushfire killer, in NSW - which has not seen bushfire deaths on the same scale - the biggest killer in bushfiresis heart attacks.</p><p>\"People can't underestimate the stress a large bushfire can have on an individual,\" says Inspector Shepherd. \"It is hot, it is stressful, you will be exerting yourself running around. It is a real risk, not just for us but the general public as well.\"</p><p>Other major causes of death during bushfires are falling trees and branches, vehicle accidents which tend to occur due to poor visibility from smoke, and poisoning from toxic gases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Above: Mount Victoria, 2013.</emphasis></p><p>What's the role of firefighters?</p><p>\"Fighting fires is everyone's job\", says Tony Johnson, the acting Assistant Commissioner of Queensland Fire and Emergency Service.</p><p>\"We've got a lot of volunteers and limited resources. It's a shared responsibility for managing fire and the landscape and bushfire.\"</p><p>The NSWRFS is powered by more than 70,000 volunteers, QFES has about 42,000, Victoria's Country Fire Association has almost 35,000, South Australia's Country Fire Service about 13,500, Tasmania has 5000 and Western Australia has about 2300. But they are already increasingly stretched.</p><p>Professor Dominey-Howes says it's only a matter of time before Australia experiences a \"summer of discontent\", with \"tropical cyclones in the north, bushfires in the central region, floods elsewhere, in multiple states and territories at the same time, really stretching the national workforce.\"</p><p>\"I am personally of the view that eventually we may need to look at ways to increase the capability of emergency services, and that might be a case for conscripting people in.\"</p><p>In the meantime, he suggests getting involved with your local volunteer fire service.</p><p>\"That way, you're contributing to your community, getting to know other people, and you'll grow skills and knowledge that you'll take back to your home and share with your family and your network.\"</p><p><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>https://youtu.be/pdRCxIZYeDw</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520180647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1V-0SN1-DY19-C3T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1523\"/><timeReceived>08:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Those who adhere strictly to the conventional wisdoms of the metropolitan Elite are labelled \"Progressives\". Those fighting against elite privilege are dismissed pejoratively as anti-establishment \"Firebrands\". Surely this is all back to front.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Surely the metropolitan elitists - the main beneficiaries of the postmodern economy - should be labelled \"conservative\". As time goes by we might even start to call them \"Traditionalists\". Those fighting establishment privilege should surely be labelled \"Progressive\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like elites throughout history, the postmodern elite seek to weave a cloak of virtue around them to conceal the nakedness of their self-interest. Like elites throughout history, they seek to demonise any who threaten that self-interest. Stephen Morris, Coorparoo, Queensland</p><p>The reason for lying</p><p>Donald Trump says he doesn't have a problem with what Michael Flynn did, but that he lied about it. The reason Flynn lied was because Trump should have had a problem with it.</p><p>Stuart McArthur, Fitzroy North</p><p>Many faces of addiction</p><p>Swimmer Grant Hackett may be the current face of alcohol and drug addiction, but for the past decade my son has been that face in our family. Hackett may have the finances to access the private rehabilitation system, but he will find that while it is keen to accept his many readmissions to inpatient programs, the vital missing link is the discharge planning and community support.</p><p>As a psychiatric nurse who is now retired, I know there is no financial incentive to provide outreach support. Addiction causes many problems; currently I am supporting my son through \"airbnb\" accommodation as that does not require a bond. Just another hidden aspect of the homelessness crisis.</p><p>Name and address withheld</p><p>Gratuitous analysis</p><p>So Grant Hackett was in hiding? Not to worry. The national media came to the rescue, putting out an All Points Bulletin. Find Hackett, he's out there somewhere. Why would he hide? Oh, he's got problems - let's broadcast some gratuitous health and personality analysis, well meant or not, based on hearsay. That should help him. Just get the public - those vicarious devourers of his achievements as a superb athlete - to flush him out. And they can get to enjoy the humiliating spectacle. Anyway, who does he think he is, a private individual? He gave that up long ago, wouldn't you say?</p><p>Michael Wold, Parkdale</p><p>Not a good look, Jeff</p><p>Jeff Kennett and the board of Seven West Media went public on the deal struck with Amber Harrison because they believed it favoured their case. They'd hardly endorse the release of deals with former employees who were treated unfairly.</p><p>Kennett says the previous board was generous partly because it had Ms Harrison's welfare in mind. Now, given the release by Kennett of so much detail of the case, it would appear there has been a breach of confidentiality and a disregard for Ms Harrison's welfare. It is not a good look for the chairman of Beyond Blue - playing the corporate bully.</p><p>As for CEO Tim Worner ... A true professional would not be having relationships with employees. End of story.</p><p>Gavin Butler, Eaglehawk</p><p>We are played for fools</p><p>They take energy away from Australians and sell it overseas for greater profit. Then they claim prices are rising because we have a shortfall in energy. (And reducing consumption doesn't make much difference to the bill. Ever tried it?) Then they say we need more fracking and coal-fired power, regardless of the damage done to our health or the environment. Rich corporations and individuals, commentators and most politicians are playing us for idiots.</p><p>Pamela Manikas, Ivanhoe</p><p>Beyond the party room</p><p>While I agree with Vivienne Player that we need politicians of vision (Letters, 12/2), I believe the problem is that we don't choose our elected representatives. The only federal MP I know of who is chosen by her electorate is Cathy McGowan in Indi. The major parties put up candidates from the toadies hanging around party leaders or dodgy union officials. There is a lack of respect in Parliament both to each other and to the people generally on both sides, which makes people reach out to those newcomers who they believe will make a difference.</p><p>Michael Nolan, Capel Sound</p><p>A leader for our times</p><p>Just when it appeared that the state government and the AFL had separately but finally and completely sold out to gambling interests all that remained of their integrity, along comes Premiership captain Easton Wood to inject some reason, integrity and balance (\"Top Dog takes a stand on betting\", 12/2). Our city and our AFL appear to be, more than ever before, in the hands of the self-interested money men whose influence is steadily destroying our social fabric. Easton Wood, you are a leader for the ages.</p><p>Ian Haines, Hawthorn East</p><p>Diversion works</p><p>Conservative commentators and politicians should read Farrah Tomazin's brilliant article \"Building bridges for troubled youth\" (News, 12/2), which tells the story of a young man becoming trapped in criminal lifestyle. Fortunately, he took part in YMCA's Bridge Project, which provides intensive support, training and job opportunities and it changed his life.</p><p>Jesuit Social Services provides many other programs such as diversion and bail housing services, all designed to stop young people getting caught up in the criminal justice system. Tomazin makes the telling point that \"such programs are often drowned out by tough-on-crime rhetoric underpinning Victoria's law-and-order debate\". Sadly that's so true. Shock jocks don't want to hear that properly funded rehabilitation and diversion programs work.</p><p>Father Kevin Burke, Eltham</p><p>Vengeful public</p><p>Youth crime plummets, but a vengeful public and knee-jerking pollies want it to get worse. Ruth Hudnott and Richard Polkinghorn point to two examples (Letters, 12/2). Force under-25s to go without welfare for four weeks, force out an innovative educator, and offer insufficient assistance to damaged, mentally ill and marginalised kids. History clearly shows there is likely only one outcome - increased crime. Get serious, hold an independent evidence-based inquiry, and do what needs to be done to actually reduce crime.</p><p>Lex Borthwick, Burwood</p><p>Money down drain</p><p>It seems that spending $40 million to prop up the ASH sawmill in Heyfield is pouring money down the drain (News, 12/2). We've known for a long time that the logging industry is reliant on a finite resource, so why waste scarce funding on delaying the inevitable? Let's invest now in a long-term, sustainable future - creating the Great Forest National Park could be a tourism boon to the area, create 750 new full-time jobs and even bring in $70 million revenue each year. It's a no-brainer!</p><p>It seems clear there are more jobs and a stronger economic and environmental future created by protecting our forests than logging them.</p><p>Violette Snow, Preston</p><p>Skilled bushmen</p><p>How many baristas does it take to put out a forest fire? How many ecotourism workers will be fighting the next inevitable major forest fire?</p><p>Forestry workers and their machinery have always played a significant role in fighting fires. Without forestry workers, the forests north of Toolangi would have burned in February 2009, as would have much of Melbourne Water catchments east of Warburton. Without the skilled bushmen operating machinery built for forest work, we would be expecting Forest Management Victoria to fight the next major forest fire with one arm tied.</p><p>Why destroy forestry and precious country-based employment? Use state forests and existing national parks for ecotourism to generate additional employment, not replacement employment. Victoria needs its forestry workers.</p><p>Rob Caddell, Tallangatta</p><p>And on the other hand</p><p>I was hopelessly confused after reading Ben Groundwater's article promoting Canada (\"Borderline Choice\", Traveller, 12/2). He describes Winnipeg's Festival du Voyageur as \"perhaps the best\" of Canada's winter celebrations (in fact, the heading of the paragraph is \"Don't Miss\"). Then, in the very next sentence, he says: \"Don't even think about visiting Winnipeg in the winter months.\"</p><p>John Howes, Rowville</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc6tplqio1i0pu51qu2jt</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MX1-T1R1-JD34-V45P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1363\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 19, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPIO</classCode><className>ADDICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000066</classCode><className>ALCOHOL ABUSE &amp; ADDICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000863</classCode><className>HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001644</classCode><className>SUBSTANCE ABUSE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N621399MG</classCode><className>NURSES &amp; NURSING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN5F</classCode><className>ON DEMAND SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N621399MG</classCode><className>NURSES &amp; NURSING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DN9V</classCode><className>VACATION RENTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Over 25 years, the gasfield is expect to produce more than 430,000 tonnes of the material.</p><p>The EPA had demanded Santos state where the waste would go, noting it had \"the potential to create a large point of source of salt in the environment if not disposed of appropriately\", and that the company's response \"did not provide the details requested\".</p><p>\"The EPA expects that many, if not all, landfill facilities in the local government area will not have the capacity to receive the quantity of salt (and other waste) generated by the project,\" the agency said.</p><p>The watchdog's other concerns include whether the proposed water monitoring capacity was sufficient to detect changes in water quality, and inadequate assessment of fugitive emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane.</p><p>The use of just four months' of ambient air monitoring for nitrogen dioxide and ozone was also \"not general practice in NSW\", the EPA said.</p><p>A Santos spokeswoman said the company would only take the salt \"to a facility licensed for this purpose\". The project would also produce 48 tonnes a day, less than half the salt being produced by AGL's Liddell and Bayswater power stations.</p><p>\"Santos has already advised the EPA that it will do further work on its Water Monitoring Plan prior to project determination,\" she said, noting it was also working with the EPA to address fugitive emissions worries.</p><p>The drawn-out process has prompted some analysts to doubt the project will ever win approval, not least because of the prospect that proposed gas import terminals will undermine its economic viability.</p><p>The RFS' concerns include the possibility that CSG could provide \"a pathway for fire to the underground coal seam\", and a demand that \"no gas flaring shall be undertaken on extreme and/or catastrophic fire weather days\".</p><p>Santos had also failed to address \"the risk to firefighters, with respect to managing and extinguishing a forest fire in the state forests\", the RFS said. Much of the proposed gasfield sits within the Pilliga State Forest.</p><p>The Santos spokeswoman said it was \"simply not possible for underground coal ignition to occur as a result of CSG development\".</p><p>\"It is untrue that there is any increased risk of fire spreading or increased danger to firefighters arising from the presence of [CSG] infrastructure,\" she said, adding the company already had a bushfire management plan developed in consultation with the RFS.</p><p>Lock the Gate alliance co-ordinator Georgina Woods said it was \"shocking for Santos to dismiss RFS' concerns\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc71xmp9qovg194106hhq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T8W-5V01-JD34-V0VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"505\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
