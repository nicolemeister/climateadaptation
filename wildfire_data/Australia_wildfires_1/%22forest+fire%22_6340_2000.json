If the weather conditions remain favourable over the coming days, crews will be backburning to manage the spread of the fire in the area, she said.</p><p>A fire at Mount Buffalo merged with a fire at Abbeyard on Friday, and now spans an area greater than 69,000 hectares.</p><p>The eastern side of the Mount Buffalo fire grew on Saturday night as it moved downhill into the Buckland Valley.</p><p>An emergency warning for residents of Buckland, Dandongadale and Mount Buffalo, advising them to leave before it became too dangerous to do so, was downgraded on Sunday morning.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said on Sunday that the forecast for this week was \"fairly benign\" and fire services were currently most concerned about the Abbeyard fire.</p><p>\"Even though there are fairly benign weather conditions today, this is another reminder that we have a fairly active fire out there and people need to stay across conditions in their local areas,\" he said.</p><p>Bill Slade, a firefighter from Forest Fire Management died while fighting a blaze in Omeo, near the Alpine National Park, Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp confirmed on Saturday night.</p><p>It brings the Victorian death toll from the bushfires to four.</p><p>Meanwhile, 15 fires continued to burn across East Gippsland on Sunday night, with 918,000 hecatares in the region destroyed.</p><p>While the bulk of the state's firefighting efforts will now turn to reinforcing containment lines and burning areas of bush that haven't yet been touched by nearby fires, but could catch alight at any moment, authorities are quick to remind Victorians that the fire threat is far from over.</p><p>\"This is a very valuable window for us. It's the first one of that length we've seen,\" Emergency Management Victoria's state control centre spokesman Luke Hegarty said on Sunday.</p><p>\"With the right resources, we can do some really good work on protection of communities and critical assets.</p><p>\"We're also looking at longer term containment of these fires. That's something we haven't been able to get really stuck into with some of these fires.\"</p><p>Spotters took to the skies on Sunday in a bid to scan the perimeter of the fires and measure how much land has been burnt in Victoria and assess the damage to homes and properties.</p><p>According to Emergency Management Victoria's State Control Centre more than 1.35 million hectares have been burnt across the state. More than 3147 damage assessments had been carried out and 288 residential and 431 non-residential structures have been damaged or destroyed by fires.</p><p>Temperatures in East Gippsland will climb into the low 30s by Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology is also predicting a chance of lightning, storms and heavy rainfall from Wednesday until the weekend.</p><p>\"While it is getting warmer, the winds are light and humidity is increasing, hence why we're getting storms. Those conditions generally suppress fire danger,\" senior forecaster Richard Russell said.</p><p>\"Over East Gippsland and the state's north east, there's a risk of some thunderstorms from Wednesday right through to Saturday. They won't be dry thunderstorms, there will be some rain.</p><p>\"There is a risk of flash flooding. The biggest concern is if there's heavy rainfall on land that's burnt and near trees that have been destroyed, there's nothing to hold it, and on steep slopes you can have land slips.\"</p><p>Smoke is expected to blow back into Melbourne on Monday, and may settle across the city until Wednesday.</p><p>Chief fire officer from Forest Fire Management, Chris Hardman, said it was likely they would be fighting these fires for months.</p><p>\"We need to be really clear - unless we get really significant rain, an east coast low or the tail of a cyclone in northern Australia which will drop 150 millimetres of rain on these fires, we will be in this for the long haul,\" he said.</p><p>\"We don't know when that will occur but we will be working on fires right through to the end of February, into March and possibly beyond.</p><p>\"The other important thing to understand, on average in January we get 400 new bushfire ignitions every year. We can expect, as these dry lightning storms continue moving across the state, that we will get new ignitions in other parts of Victoria.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">With Simone Fox Coob</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520227079</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYM-WMJ1-DY19-C4FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><timeReceived>10:27 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

latest victim of the blazes in Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bill Slade, 60, was working on containing a fire in the Anglers Rest area near Omeo when he was killed by a falling tree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a significant loss for the Forest Fire Management Victoria family and for the Victorian community as a whole,\" Chris Hardman, chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV), said.</p><p>Mr Slade worked for 40 years in firefighting and with Parks Victoria and he battled the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983.</p><p>He is survived by his wife Carol, daughter Steph and son Ethan.</p><p>Victoria Police will investigate the matter and prepare a report for the coroner.</p><p>\"Bill was a much-loved colleague, friend and member of the Wonthaggi community,\" Matthew Jackson, the chief executive of Parks Victoria, said.</p><p>\"He will be sorely missed by Parks Victoria, and our thoughts are with his family, wife Carol, children Ethan and Steph and colleagues and community during this deep tragedy.\"</p><p>Mr Jackson said Mr Slade was a field services officer at Parks Victoria who had mentored many of his colleagues.</p><p>\"At 60 years of age, working as an arduous firefighter, Bill has been one of our most experienced, long-serving and fittest firefighters,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Jackson said he had the \"privilege\" of honouring Mr Slade for his40 years in the field late last year.</p><p>Garry Cook, deputy chief officer at the CFA, said the news was going to be tough on a lot of people.</p><p>\"Everybody goes out to work and to protect lives and property and we want everybody to come home, and when somebody doesn't it's tragic news, it's very, very sad,\" he said.</p><p>\"We feel for the family, we feel for the colleagues, and we feel for everybody in the emergency services sector who are really feeling this tragic loss today.\"</p><p>Those sentiments were echoed by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who sent his condolences to Mr Slade's family and his colleagues.</p><p>\"[He] was muchloved and he will be missed,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think this shows us this is still a very, very dangerous environment.\"</p><p>Bronwyn Hunter grew up in the small community of Bass, east of Melbourne, where Mr Slade lived and was a family friend.</p><p>She was shocked to learn of his death and said he was a \"very good family man\" who had recently been awarded a life membership in the local footy club.</p><p>\"For years he's fought fires and every time there was a fire somewhere, we knew Billy would be there helping fight it,\" she said.</p><p>\"The reality is ... these people are putting their lives on the line and unfortunately it was someone that we knew.</p><p>It takes the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-08/bushfires-death-toll-rises-in-victoria/11852752\">state's bushfire death toll to four,</url> including Mat Kavanagh, another FFMV employee who was killed in a road crash on Friday, January 3.</p><p>Mr Kavanagh was remembered for his \"friendly and welcoming nature, his passion for the environment and nature and his love of fly-fishing\".</p><p>Authorities said he was doing the \"incredibly critical work\" of putting out unattended fires on the day he died.</p><p>Buchan man Mick Roberts was the first victim of the bushfire emergency, while Maramingo Creek timber worker Fred Becker was confirmed dead last weekend.</p><p>Premier heads to fire grounds</p><p>Mr Andrews travelled to Orbost and met up with ADF crews working to clear trees from the Princes Highway around Bellbird Creek.</p><p>He announced a $14.4 million program to help every person affected by the fires to get the information and services they need to recover and start rebuilding their lives.</p><p>The money will be used to provide financial counselling, personal support and mental health assistance.</p><p>\"I don't want them [fire victims] to have to wade through endless paperwork,\" he said.</p><p>\"We need to make sure we are providing that dedicated support to make this difficult process as easy as it possibly can be.\"</p><p>Fire investigations</p><p>Mr Andrews also announced that the Inspector-General of Emergency Management, a body set up after Victoria's 2009 royal commission into bushfires, would be conducting an investigation into the fires still burning in Victoria's east and north-east.</p><p>Prime Minister <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-12/bushfire-royal-commission-proposal-to-go-to-cabinet-morrison/11860954\">Scott Morrison is considering establishing a royal commission into the fires.</url></p><p>Mr Andrews said he discussed the idea with Mr Morrison and that he expected the royal commission would probably be more focused on a nationallycoordinated effort to fight fires.</p><p>Hundreds of homes have been destroyed during the crisis, and more than 1.3 million hectares of land has been burnt.</p><p>Milder conditions this week have granted a reprieve for firefighters and emergency authorities, but huge blazes continue to burn in East Gippsland, the Upper Murray area and the state's Alpine region.</p><p>The CFA's deputy chief officer, Stephanie Rotarangi, said the next three or four days will be crucial.</p><p>\"We are still seeing high levels of [fire] activity in the north-east and here in Gippsland. However, we'll be out there backburning and looking to consolidate those [containment] lines,\" she said.</p><p>Humanitarian packs a 'boost' for firefighters, evacuees</p><p>Charity group Operation Angel has travelled to the Tallangatta relief centre to hand out humanitarian packs to firefighters.</p><p>Organiser Jacqueline Pascarl said the firefighters were often mobilised at short notice.</p><p>\"They haven't got toothbrushes, deodorant, ladies don't have sanitary items, hair ties. So this is a boost. They're all really happy to receive them,\" she said.</p><p>The charity has assembled more than 10,000 packs in ziplock bags, each containing a personal message from a child expressing their gratitude for the work being done by firefighters.</p><p>\"It's been extraordinary.

continues</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A \"much-loved\" father of two with decades of firefighting experience has been identified as the latest victim of the blazes in Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bill Slade, 60, was working on containing a fire in the Anglers Rest area near Omeo when he was killed by a falling tree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a significant loss for the Forest Fire Management Victoria family and for the Victorian community as a whole,\" Chris Hardman, chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV), said.</p><p>Mr Slade worked for 40 years in firefighting and with Parks Victoria and he battled the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983.</p><p>He is survived by his wife Carol, daughter Steph and son Ethan.</p><p>Victoria Police will investigate the matter and prepare a report for the coroner.</p><p>\"Bill was a much-loved colleague, friend and member of the Wonthaggi community,\" Matthew Jackson, the chief executive of Parks Victoria, said.</p><p>\"He will be sorely missed by Parks Victoria, and our thoughts are with his family, wife Carol, children Ethan and Steph and colleagues and community during this deep tragedy.\"</p><p>Mr Jackson said Mr Slade was a field services officer at Parks Victoria who had mentored many of his colleagues.</p><p>\"At 60 years of age, working as an arduous firefighter, Bill has been one of our most experienced, long-serving and fittest firefighters,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Jackson said he had the \"privilege\" of honouring Mr Slade for his40 years in the field late last year.</p><p>Garry Cook, deputy chief officer at the CFA, said the news was going to be tough on a lot of people.</p><p>\"Everybody goes out to work and to protect lives and property and we want everybody to come home, and when somebody doesn't it's tragic news, it's very, very sad,\" he said.</p><p>\"We feel for the family, we feel for the colleagues, and we feel for everybody in the emergency services sector who are really feeling this tragic loss today.\"</p><p>Those sentiments were echoed by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who sent his condolences to Mr Slade's family and his colleagues.</p><p>\"[He] was muchloved and he will be missed,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think this shows us this is still a very, very dangerous environment.\"</p><p>Bronwyn Hunter grew up in the small community of Bass, east of Melbourne, where Mr Slade lived and was a family friend.</p><p>She was shocked to learn of his death and said he was a \"very good family man\" who had recently been awarded a life membership in the local footy club.</p><p>\"For years he's fought fires and every time there was a fire somewhere, we knew Billy would be there helping fight it,\" she said.</p><p>\"The reality is ... these people are putting their lives on the line and unfortunately it was someone that we knew.\"</p><p>It takes the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-08/bushfires-death-toll-rises-in-victoria/11852752\">state's bushfire death toll to four,</url> including Mat Kavanagh, another FFMV employee who was killed in a road crash on Friday, January 3.</p><p>Mr Kavanagh was remembered for his \"friendly and welcoming nature, his passion for the environment and nature and his love of fly-fishing\".</p><p>Authorities said he was doing the \"incredibly critical work\" of putting out unattended fires on the day he died.</p><p>Buchan man Mick Roberts was the first victim of the bushfire emergency, while Maramingo Creek timber worker Fred Becker was confirmed dead last weekend.</p><p>Premier heads to fire grounds</p><p>Mr Andrews travelled to Orbost and met up with ADF crews working to clear trees from the Princes Highway around Bellbird Creek.</p><p>He announced a $14.4 million program to help every person affected by the fires to get the information and services they need to recover and start rebuilding their lives.</p><p>The money will be used to provide financial counselling, personal support and mental health assistance.</p><p>\"I don't want them [fire victims] to have to wade through endless paperwork,\" he said.</p><p>\"We need to make sure we are providing that dedicated support to make this difficult process as easy as it possibly can be.\"</p><p>Fire investigations</p><p>Mr Andrews also announced that the Inspector-General of Emergency Management, a body set up after Victoria's 2009 royal commission into bushfires, would be conducting an investigation into the fires still burning in Victoria's east and north-east.</p><p>Prime Minister <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-12/bushfire-royal-commission-proposal-to-go-to-cabinet-morrison/11860954\">Scott Morrison is considering establishing a royal commission into the fires.</url></p><p>Mr Andrews said he discussed the idea with Mr Morrison and that he expected the royal commission would probably be more focused on a nationallycoordinated effort to fight fires.</p><p>Hundreds of homes have been destroyed during the crisis, and more than 1.3 million hectares of land has been burnt.</p><p>Milder conditions this week have granted a reprieve for firefighters and emergency authorities, but huge blazes continue to burn in East Gippsland, the Upper Murray area and the state's Alpine region.</p><p>The CFA's deputy chief officer, Stephanie Rotarangi, said the next three or four days will be crucial.</p><p>\"We are still seeing high levels of [fire] activity in the north-east and here in Gippsland. However, we'll be out there backburning and looking to consolidate those [containment] lines,\" she said.</p><p>Humanitarian packs a 'boost' for firefighters, evacuees</p><p>Charity group Operation Angel has travelled to the Tallangatta relief centre to hand out humanitarian packs to firefighters.</p><p>Organiser Jacqueline Pascarl said the firefighters were often mobilised at short notice.</p><p>\"They haven't got toothbrushes, deodorant, ladies don't have sanitary items, hair ties. So this is a boost. They're all really happy to receive them,\" she said.</p><p>The charity has assembled more than 10,000 packs in ziplock bags, each containing a personal message from a child expressing their gratitude for the work being done by firefighters.</p><p>\"It's been extraordinary. We've had hundreds of people every day turning up at our centre to donate or volunteer, car-loads full,\" Ms Pascarl said.</p><p>The packs also include donated cutlery.</p><p>\"We also have people bringing their metal cutlery to us from their chic dining rooms saying we have a dinner party once a year if we're lucky,\" Ms Pascarl said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-TOPNWS11860722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYM-6YJ1-DXX7-H400-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><timeReceived>10:55 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 11, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia:VIC:Omeo 3898</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Shepparton 3630</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Wodonga 3690</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Mildura 3500</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Horsham 3400</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Bendigo 3550</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Ballarat 3350</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Warrnambool 3280</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Sale 3850</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Melbourne 3000</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Fires:Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp;

He said that while the RFS had predicted the fire season was going to be severe because of the drought, they did not see the scale of the disaster that occurred between July 2019 and March 2020.</p><p>\"The season was without doubt one of the most catastrophic on record,\" Mr Casselden said. \"A statewide state of emergency was declared by the Premier three times.\" He added that \"in some cases traditional methods of firefighting proved unsuccessful\".</p><p>In his opening address, Mr Casselden reeled off the stocktake of destruction across over 5.52 million hectares of the state.</p><p>The fires destroyed 2476 houses, three schools, 284 -facilities and 5559 outbuildings with damage caused to another 1034 homes, 196 facilities and 2017 outbuildings.</p><p>The insurance losses were $1.88 billion. The ecological disaster took a toll on native wildlife and national forest with more than 800 million animals estimated to have died, Mr Casselden said.</p><p>More than 330 threatened species and 33 threatened ecosystems were in the path of the fires with more than 25 per cent of koala habitat in fire-affected areas.</p><p>In Eurobodalla LGA, 510 houses were destroyed, 465 in Bega LGA, 286 in Shoalhaven LGA, 193 in the Snowy Valley Council area and 168 in Clare Valley LGA.</p><p>Most of the fires began from lightening strikes with the fire in the Wollombi -National Park that burned for eight weeks being the biggest fire with a single ignition point in Australian history.</p><p>At the same time, the -inquest will hear about the many instances of kindness, selflessness and bravery during the fires and the resilience of the communities who have rebuilt, Mr Casselden said.</p><p>\"Evidence will be received by the court where strategic back burning is directly linked to the cause of the fire or the case of death,\" he said.</p><p>\"Across the state the fire agencies had challenges communicating with each other and you will hear evidence where it is directly linked to the cause and direction of the fire or the cause and manner of death.\" He did not elaborate on exact examples.</p><p>LIVES LOST IN BLACK SUMMER OCTOBER 9, 2019 Bob Lindsay, 77, and Gwen Hyde, 68, Coongbar NEWLYWEDS Bob Lindsay and Gwen Hyde perished side-by-side trying to save their isolated property in Deadman Creek Rd at Coongbar.</p><p>NOVEMBER 8, 2019 Vivian Chaplain, 69, Diehard The Wytaliba resident stayed behind to protect animals. \"There's fire everywhere,\" she told a relative by phone.</p><p>NOVEMBER 8, 2019 George Nole, 85, Diehard The electronics genius was found dead in his burnt-out car.

China's trade restrictions on Australian wine had also caused pain for some growers, he said.</p><p>Robert Walters, who owns Place of Changing Winds vineyard near Mount Macedon, hired a lawyer in the hope of halting the controlled burns and will investigate further action if his crop is damaged. One of the controlled burns set to go ahead in the next 10 days will take place about three kilometres from his vineyard.</p><p>He is concerned the department's actions will imperil long-term investment in the region, which is renowned for its pinot noir and chardonnay.</p><p>\"No one is going to invest the millions of dollars it takes to establish vineyards if there is the risk of smoke taint every year due to controlled burns,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Walters, who has owned his vineyard for 10 years, said that the timing of the controlled burns had only become a problem in recent years, and they previously happened less often and at different times of the year.</p><p>He said the situation had made wine growers incredibly stressed as they approached harvest.</p><p>\"We are hoping for no weather disasters and this type of pressure is sending people over the edge. People aren't sleeping.\"</p><p>Attwoods Wines owner Troy Walsh said so many elements of winemaking were already out of his control, which made the controlled burns hard to take.</p><p>\"As a winemaker you have the risk of frosts and other weather events, but when it's something we can control that can affect us, that's hard to take.\"</p><p>Smoke taint involves compounds from smoke penetrating grape skins, which can lead to an unpleasant, smoky taste in wine.</p><p>Smoke taint from the 2019-20 bushfires caused about $120million of damage to wineries in north-east Victoria and also devastated vineyards in the Hunter Valley and Adelaide Hills regions, with many winemakers destroying their fruit.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria acting chief fire officer Allyson Lardner said the strategic burn would protect local communities around the Wombat Forest area and reduce the risk of future bushfires.</p><p>\"Current conditions make this an ideal time for the burn,\" she said, pointing out that the area didn't burn as efficiently and effectively as it became damp ahead of winter.</p><p>\"We have been in ongoing communication with those who are managing vineyards in the region. We are confident the current weather and wind conditions are suitable to minimise any possible impacts on growers.\"</p><p>She said the agency worked to minimise the impact from smoke.</p><p>\"Smoke from a bushfire has far greater impact on vineyards than smoke from a planned burn,\" Ms Lardner said.</p><p>Professor Ian Porter of La Trobe University, who is investigating how much smoke will cause tainted fruit in a vineyard, travelled to the Macedon Ranges on Friday to rig up smoke detectors.</p><p>In the past six years, his team has monitored 40 controlled burns near vineyards and so far they haven't noticed any issues with smoke taint, which is generally caused by heavy, fresh smoke as opposed to haze. He said when controlled burns were conducted in still conditions, smoke dissipated into the atmosphere and steered clear of vineyards.</p><p>\"There are a lot of issues involved,\" he said.</p><p>\"There is bushfire safety, tourism and wine growing. It's a really hard balancing act.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7eogeagom38crnlnlr7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6239-05D1-JD34-V0JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 27, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N111332MM</classCode><className>GRAPE VINEYARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001843</classCode><className>WINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N312130MM</classCode><className>WINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000068</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N722400CC</classCode><className>DRINKING PLACES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

On Thursday, a landscape management burn of about 140 hectares was conducted 11-kilometres north of Raglan.</p><p>From Macedon to the Daylesford - Hepburn Springs corridor to around Ballarat and at Mt Cole, approximately 10 further planned burns will be carried out across the district in the coming months.</p><p>FFMVic's Deputy Chief Fire Officer in the Grampians, Tony English, said the majority of the burns were being undertaken to reduce bushfire risk.</p><p>Fuel reduction burns aim to reduce the spread and intensity of future bushfires so it is easier for firefighters to contain a fire before it impacts people, property and the environment.</p><p>\"Reducing fuel levels near communities and assets, public infrastructure or across larger forested areas [will] reduce the spread of bushfires,\" he said.</p><p>Many of those planned for the Wombat Forest area are of the highest state priority to reduce fire risk.</p><p>The largest burn is planned near North Blackwood, on the northern edge of the Wombat Forest. At 1200 hectares, it could take three or four days to complete.</p><p>\"It is one of the highest priority burns in the state as it reduces risk to communities including Gisborne, Woodend and Bullengarook and surrounds,\" Deputy Chief Fire Officer English said.</p><p>While most burns will be ignited by ground crews using hand-held drip torches for ignition and patrolled using four-wheel drive ultralight tankers and large fire tankers, FFMVic may use aerial ignition at North Blackwood.</p><p>\"For this burn we may use aerial ignition if the conditions are suitable which involves the use of aerial incendiaries (similar to table-tennis balls) dropped from a helicopter.</p><p>\"These operations are managed by an accredited FFMVic incendiary operations supervisor.\"</p><p>Cultural burns are also planned to be conducted with Wadawurrung Traditional Owners at Skipton and in the You Yangs Regional Park, while an ecological burn will be completed near Lethbridge to provide habitat for local fauna species.</p><p>Exactly when the burns are undertaken will be dependent on weather conditions.</p><p>\"FFMVic always works closely with the Bureau of Meteorology to assess weather conditions - such as humidity, temperature, and wind speed - and will only carry out burns when conditions are suitable,\" Deputy Chief Fire Officer English said.</p><p>Planned burning is one of the fuel management strategies employed by FFMVic to reduce the risk of bushfire.</p><p>It has also been conducting mulching works around towns including Daylesford, Hepburn Springs and Smythesdale - these works can be carried out year-round, when conditions are not suitable for planned burning.</p><p>Last week the Country Fire Authority's Assistant Chief Fire Officer for District 15, Eddie Lacko, reminded the community not to be complacent despite it being a milder than normal summer.</p><p>\"Although we've had some cooler and milder temperatures we did have a bit of a heatwave which might not be the last.</p><p>\"We could still get those high temperatures and strong northerly winds which will dictate fire behaviour so we're not taking our foot off the throttle yet.\"</p><p>He encouraged community members to remain vigilant about fire preparedness, to keep up-to-date with the weather forecast and warnings and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency.</p><p>Though the fire danger period will remain in place, the CFA will begin to issue schedule 13 permits for farmers to undertake stubble or crop burns from next week.</p><p>For all the latest information about planned burns visit: ffm.vic.gov.au/plannedburns, download the VicEmergency app or call the VicEmergency hotline on 1800 226 226.</p><p>Facebook has banned news from its platform.

nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the oldest original, operational fire stations in Victoria is in danger of closing unless urgent funding can be found to save it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Golden Square Fire Station in Bendigo, Central Victoria, is 110 years old and, according to Brigade Captain Bryan Greenwood, needs to be replaced with a new building.</p><p>Captain Greenwood says the building's age means it has several \"issues\".</p><p>It is home to five vehicles, one of which is too big to be stored inside, and 20 of its 60 members are currently operational and store their firefighting gear at the station.</p><p>However, the dilapidated building has several cracks in the brickwork, peeling paintwork, inadequate changing facilities and last weekend heavy rain damaged the roof, causing it to fall in, making the building almost uninhabitable.</p><p>\"When I got the phone call to say that it had happened, let's just say there were a few choice words,\" Captain Greenwood said.</p><p>\"CFA (Country Fire Authority) has got to go through their maintenance regime and start to organise companies to come in, so at this stage we've just cordoned off the area and we're not able to use it.</p><p>\"If we have anything more serious happen then we could potentially, I would imagine, we would have to be relocated.\"</p><p>He said the brigade has been trying to secure funding from the State Government and the CFA for a new building for about 25 years.</p><p>\"We were promised money back in 2006,\" he said.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, at the time the party that promised the money didn't get in, and since then its just been a continual backwards and forwards between the parliament and CFA.\"</p><p>A suitable site the 'sticking point'</p><p>Captain Greenwood said one of the difficulties with replacing the station was a lack of land in the area.</p><p>\"The hard part is trying to find somewhere suitable for us,\" he said.</p><p>\"Golden Square is a pretty fast-growing suburb with not much land left in it big enough to house a fire station.\"</p><p>That is something that is echoed by State Member for Bendigo West Maree Edwards.</p><p>\"The sticking point has and seems to continue to be the procurement either by lease or purchase of a suitable site for a new station,\" Ms Edwards said.</p><p>\"Several parcels of land have been identified by the CFA in the past but proven to be not suitable or not easily acquired.\"</p><p>Captain Bryan Greenwood said the vacant plots of land big enough for a new fire station were largely owned by either the City of Greater Bendigo or Forest Fire Management Victoria, but it was often geography or the landscape that meant the sites were unsuitable.</p><p>\"Given Golden Square's history with mining, some of those [sites] are contaminated with mining products and some just aren't suitable due to maybe having a creek through them,\" he said.</p><p>Ms Edwards said the State Government had earmarked more than $12.6 million for new CFA stations, equipment and training, and she would continue to advocate for a new building for the Golden Square Fire Brigade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

His name was Benjamin, the thylacine, Ben, the last Tasmanian Tiger - only we didn't know that when he was captured and put in a zoo in 1933.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In grainy black-and-white footage at the time, Benjamin paces his enclosure, yawning and baring his jaws. He lies down, he sniffs the concrete. At one point (off-screen) he even gives the cameraman a cheeky bite on the bum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He died three years later, locked out of his backroom shelter one freezing night, just weeks after his species was at last granted protected status in Tasmania following decades of hunting. Eventually, the world came to realise that Benjamin really was the last of Australia's great striped marsupial. But, when he died, they saw only an animal too damaged to be preserved in a museum. His body was tossed in a dumpster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Benjamin's story now haunts ecologist Euan Ritchie as he maps accelerating extinction rates around the world. \"What a perfect metaphor,\" he says. \"Benjamin died of neglect and then we threw him out. These species took millions of years to evolve and now they're disappearing by the thousands because we don't care enough. It's like going into a museum and lighting all of its precious paintings on fire.\"</p><p>Paleontologist Michael Archer is also haunted by the story. But he has a plan to make sure Benjamin is not the last thylacine. Archer isn't one of Australia's infamous Tasmanian Tiger hunters, the ones who trek into the bush convinced they may yet find a survivor of the extinct species. Though he has diligently DNA-tested suspected thylacine excrement sent in by such \"spotters\", Archer says sightings always turn out to be \"fascinating bullshit\".</p><p>Instead, he is part of the \"de-extinction club\": a growing group of scientists working to harness genetic engineering and cloning to reach into the past - and resurrect extinct animals. Top of the list are the thylacine and the woolly mammoth. Archer and others say the unnatural pace of climate change and habitat destruction mean bringing back key species may now be the only way to stop ecosystems from collapsing. Harvard University's renowned geneticist George Church, himself working to return the mammoth to the Arctic tundra, says reviving some species could even help combat the effects of global warming. But others, such as Ritchie, warn that it might put the wild in jeopardy all over again, or pull vital focus from the urgent work underway to save those species we do have left.</p><p>So how does de-extinction work? Would a woolly mammoth cooked up in a lab be a real mammoth or just a funny-looking elephant? How do we choose which species get a second chance? And is there any dino DNA left to get us to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis></p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.84%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/2e403c5ebd3e66039ec904e5b5d37ab772be9968\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Illustration: Matt Davidson </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why bring back extinct animals?</emphasis></h><p>There's a story humans tell of saving animals in an ark - two of each kind to survive a great catastrophe. Today, the great catastrophe is here, at least for wildlife. Humans are burning through the planet's resources with an unprecedented appetite, changing the climate, concreting over the wild. Archer says extinction rates are as high as they were during the Cretaceous period, when 75 per cent of species, including the dinosaurs, were wiped from the map. In half a century, the World Wildlife Fund calculates, we have lost more than half of the planet's biodiversity. \"We've now entered the planet's sixth mass extinction event,\" Ritchie says. \"And, ultimately, humans need these ecosystems to survive, too. They're our life support system.\"</p><p>Archer argues that conventional conservation efforts \"aren't cutting the mustard\" and the time has come for extraordinary intervention - an ark of sorts. \"Normally, nature fills the vacancies from a big extinction event like this. But we're not leaving any room for that this time. So we're really in uncharted territory. And we have to be smart.\"</p><p>For some scientists, being smart means conserving sperm, egg and tissue samples from endangered species in cryogenically frozen arks, the same way conservationists might keep breeding pairs in captive populations, in case they can one day be returned to the wild. For Archer and others, being smart means using technology not just to slow down extinction but to reverse it.</p><p>Of course, unlike Noah, you will need more than two of a species to bring it back. If de-extinction is to mean more than a few curiosities in a lab or a zoo, scientists recommend a gene pool of at least 50 to 1000 animals to start. And you need to make sure that both the species and the wild you're sending them back into can cope with their return. And that's even before we get to the technology itself.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you \"de-extinct\" something?</emphasis></h><p>It's not quite enough to thaw a frozen mammoth from a block of ice. Scientists need either tissue to clone an animal or enough of its DNA, its genetic blueprint, to engineer it. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis>, that source code came from a preserved mosquito with a belly full of dinosaur blood. In real life, that wouldn't actually be enough DNA to rebuild a dinosaur (the little molecule is hardy enough to survive at crime scenes but, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11555\">about 1.5 million years, it's too decayed to read</url> anymore). Still, carcasses of mammoths and Neanderthals preserved in the icy permafrost at the top of the world, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00436-x\">some of them a million years old</url>, have yielded enough of their genetic code for scientists such as Church to rebuild, and edit. Even the mysterious virus behind the deadly Spanish flu of 1918 was recreated in a lab from the frozen lungs of one of its victims, unearthed from an icy grave in Alaska.</p><p>\"No-one's advocating for the de-extinction of viruses, of course,\" Church says. \"But there's a lot more possible than we first imagined.\"</p><p>Since the development of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/curing-cancer-designer-babies-supersoldiers-how-will-gene-editing-change-us-20210511-p57qqt.html\">better gene-editing tools such as CRISPR</url> (which borrows the precision of ancient bacteria immune systems to find and edit specific genes), Archer says museum collections, too, have become \"the flavour of the month\". \"Suddenly everyone wants to go in and sample shrivelled toes [for] the DNA.\"</p><p/><p>Scientists are even learning how to wind back the clock on a living animal's family tree, searching for dormant genes switched off over their evolution, such as a tail or bigger teeth, to help revive extinct ancestors, gene by gene. That's how the paleontologist who inspired Michael Crichton's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> in the first place, Jack Horner, is hoping to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-re-not-running-out-of-dinosaurs-why-is-there-a-boom-in-finding-fossils-20200217-p541j2.html\">build a dinosaur</url> from its decidedly less scaly descendant: the chicken. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction, after all.</p><p>\"Genes even older than [those of] the dinosaurs can be brought back, too,\" Church says. \"But it's limited. It's hard to reconstruct a [species'] entire genome that way. It's not like you have a 3D printer where you say, 'Print out this organism' because the rules are way more powerful than that. They're more mysterious. And the question is always, why do it?\"</p><p>Horner himself says he'd be looking to turn on only a few lost traits in his dino-chicken (\"the claws, teeth, arms, scales and the tail to keep the fourth-graders happy\"). Already, a beak has become a snout in chicken embryos. The tail has proven the most difficult but in recent months \"we've made headway understanding how [it] evolved from dinosaur to bird\". Even so, Horner's chickenosaurus wouldn't really be an extinct animal. \"It'd be a new kind of dinosaur-like bird,\" he says.</p><p>Church himself has viable DNA of his mammoth but will still need to pair it with the genome of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to try to bring it back (he sometimes calls the project the \"mammophant\").</p><p>Likewise, Ben Novak at the genetic rescue and de-extinction group Revive &amp; Restore has big plans to re-engineer and breed an extinct line of North American bird known as the passenger pigeon using existing flocks (he's even done some experiments on birds at the CSIRO's secure lab in Melbourne). And Archer plans to turn to the Tasmanian devil as a template to recreate the Tasmanian tiger, after the thylacine's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0417-y\">genome was at last sequenced</url> from DNA found in a specimen at the Melbourne Museum.</p><p>These animals, if they ever come blinking and growling to life in the lab, will be hybrids of the past and the present. But there is a way to bring back an \"100 per cent extinct animal\", Archer says, and that's cloning.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You can clone </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">extinct </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">animals?</emphasis></h><p>More than 20 years after Dolly the sheep became the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, the technique is yet to be perfected, but Archer says it's not quite the horror show people imagine. While the sci-fi nightmare of cloned humans never materialised, livestock can be cloned to preserve breeding lines, and celebrities and millionaires fork out upwards of $40,000 to clone beloved pets.</p><p>Some conservationists are also turning to the technique to stop inbreeding in dwindling wildlife populations. In late 2020, Novak teamed up with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to clone a critically endangered black-footed ferret from the frozen cells of a ferret who died in 1988. The clone, named <url normalizedValue=\"https://usfws.medium.com/the-curious-life-of-elizabeth-ann-618e8d828448\">Elizabeth Ann, is now a healthy six-month-old</url> who is fond of tearing apart paper bags, barking at anyone who invades her personal space, and has \"three times more genetic variation in her little body than any other [black-footed] ferret on the planet,\" Novak says.</p><p>Of course, to clone an animal, the cell you are using must still be intact - alive, in a sense. That makes cloning an extinct species almost impossible. But it has happened. In 2003, scientists in Spain cloned an extinct mountain goat known as the Pyrenean ibex from the frozen tissue of the last of its species, Celia.</p><p>To clone, you take the egg of a suitably similar host animal, say, a domestic goat, and suck out the DNA-packed nucleus within, replacing it with that of the animal in line for resurrection, in this case, Celia the ibex. Then you hit it with a Frankstein-esque jolt of electricity to fuse the egg and nucleus, and you implant that new egg in a surrogate mother (another goat). If all goes to plan, the DNA will tell the egg to grow an ibex instead. In this case, a baby ibex did arrive but she lived for just 10 minutes, born with a fatal lung defect scientists say can be typical of the species, clone or not.</p><p>The experiment was never tried again because by then the Spanish government had released goats into the mountains to replace the ibex, and so the team despaired they were too late. The ibex had lost its habitat. It had effectively gone extinct twice.</p><p>Archer hopes there will be a happier ending for the gastric-brooding frog, an extinct Australian species he's been working to clone since a colleague discovered some intact tissue cells \"miraculously still tucked away at the back of an old university freezer\". This frog first caught the eye of medical researchers for its bizarre ability to turn its stomach into a womb and vomit up its babies. \"Nothing else in nature can do that,\" Archer says. But before it could be studied, in the mid-1980s, it vanished. Then in 2013, Archer's team had a breakthrough. The extinct frog's DNA began to replicate when it was implanted in donor frog eggs. Under the microscope, the team watched the embryos start to develop with growing excitement.</p><p>\"But suddenly it just stopped,\" Archer says. The team believes the problem lies not with the DNA, but with their technique for cloning amphibians. \"We hit the same wall when we tried a living frog's DNA. We just need to get one [species] back, one of these [de-extinction] projects over the line, and people will see we're not making monsters.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does bringing back a mammoth have to do with climate change?</emphasis></h><p>OK, so <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> probably won't happen but what about a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pleistocene Park</emphasis> for the king of that Ice Age, the woolly mammoth? These towering herbivores were hunted to extinction by early humans some 10,000 years ago, the very last of them surviving on Arctic islands until 4000 years ago. But the mammoth is still the closest genetic relative to the now endangered Asian elephant. \"Even closer than the African elephant,\" Church says.</p><p>He believes resurrecting the mammoth's ancient genes could stop the Asian elephant from following it into extinction. Splicing in traits that helped the mammoth thrive in the Arctic could open up crucial new habitat, as land-clearing and poaching closer to the equator increasingly whittle down their numbers. Endangered species are already relocated, with varying success, by conservationists, and their genes managed via breeding programs to protect diversity. </p><p/><p>Church estimates that editing in about 40 to 100 mammoth genes, chiefly around cold resistance, will be enough to allow Asian elephants to thrive up north. Separate projects have edited about that number in pigs, for different traits, and Church says they are now breeding whole generations of healthy, engineered animals.</p><p>In the case of his mammophant, the team would grow the animal in an artificial womb to avoid any risk to the endangered elephant they would otherwise have to use as a surrogate. That means there's an extra hurdle to scale - growing a mammal artificially, all the way from fertilisation to birth, hasn't been done before. Church expects to crack the problem in about five years, in mice first, which have a faster gestation period than elephants (20 days versus 22 months). \"Then it'll probably take another five to adapt it to larger animals and then we can see how it scales up for the mammoth.\"</p><p>If it works, he already has a place to put the herd. Since the '90s, a group of Russian scientists has been transforming a huge swathe of land in Siberia back to the grasslands that mammoths and other large animals once roamed. It really is called Pleistocene Park and, with the mammoth's help, some think it could actually slow climate change. Grasslands can absorb more carbon than forests, and mammoths rip down trees and create this tundra as they go. But, more importantly, their heavy feet also trample snow cover, stopping it from acting as insulation and so allowing the permafrost to be chilled by the icy Arctic winds. In theory, Church says this should help slow its thaw, which eventually threatens to release <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00659-y\">more carbon and methane than the atmosphere holds today</url>.</p><p>But Ritchie questions why you would bring back a mammoth, a creature of the Ice Age, to a rapidly warming world? \"You're not going to have herds of thousands of mammoths in time to have a real impact on the permafrost, given how fast it's melting now with climate change,\" he says. \"You'll just end up with an elephant that can't handle the heat, and probably, a freak show. We have to think very carefully about how the world is going to be when we consider what to bring back.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happens when we put an extinct animal back in the wild?</emphasis></h><p>There's not much point resurrecting a species if it will face the same threat of extinction soon after, like the Pyrenean ibex muscled out of its mountains. And de-extinction proponents stress that animals should fill an empty ecological niche too. When wolves were hunted out of Yellowstone National Park in the United States, elk numbers exploded. With no predator to keep them in check, they tore up the grasses and rivers. Suddenly, the beavers had vanished too. \"And when they brought the wolves back, 70 years later, the ecosystem was restored,\" Church says.</p><p>Of course, for this more classical \"rewilding\" to work with a resurrected animal, it needs to act the way its ancestor did. But not everything is encoded in genes. How will an engineered mammophant, for example, learn to migrate across the Arctic tundra as mammoths once did if there's no parent to show it the way? And what if cutting and pasting together species' genomes, in this case of elephant and mammoth or thylacine and Tasmanian devil, interferes with other natural instincts?</p><p>These are problems Archer ponders a lot. \"You could even have two sets of instructions [in the DNA] that are contradictory,\" he says. \"But don't forget that the mammoth is a kind of specialised elephant, so most of the genome is already the same. Tasmanian devils, too, are close enough to thylacines, even though they're smaller.\" For his part, he believes \"we'll have 99 per cent original behaviours in resurrected species\". Most behaviour really is gene-deep in animals, he says, even the strange case of the gastric-brooding frog swallowing its fertilised eggs. \"No frog teaches another frog to do anything, they're on their own from the moment they're a tadpole.\"</p><p>In the case of a resurrected thylacine, there won't be much to compare it to. There are few records of how the marsupial lived, so some ecologists warn not enough is known to bring it back safely. Archer is quick to point out that the thylacine vanished from Tasmania only 90 years ago, and from the mainland at the same time as the devil (which is itself being considered for reintroduction over the Bass Strait) some 3200 years ago. \"We know what it's going to do. It's going to become the king of beasts [in Australia] again.\"</p><p>But consider the case of the passenger pigeon that Novak hopes to bring back to North America. One hundred and fifty years ago, they were the most abundant bird on the planet. And, though they numbered as many as six billion, Novak says there were only three or four flocks flying the world at any one time. When they moved from forest to forest, they came in like a hurricane or a forest fire, breaking branches, destroying canopies and forcing those woods into regeneration cycles.</p><p>\"No other birds do this,\" Novak says. \"They were ecosystem engineers. Some of the restoration we thought fire did to the landscape we've now shown the birds did.\" Novak argues the forest needs them back. He and his team have sequenced the pigeon's genome and compared it to its closest living relative, the bandtailed pigeon. Of the 25-million-odd genes where they differed, Novak has identified about 30 that could be particularly significant in making a pigeon behave like a passenger pigeon, such as disease resistance and, potentially, extra-social behaviour.</p><p>So here's his plan: Novak imagines a carefully controlled release, first on a netted reserve with nesting baskets packed into dense trees, encouraging the birds to breed in colonies and, to fool them into thinking they are already part of a much bigger flock, with speakers blasting pigeon calls and coos. If the birds gang up as planned, they would be fitted with GPS trackers and set free, by the thousand or so.</p><p/><p>With enough funding, which Novak ballparks at about $US25 million, he thinks he could create a live passenger pigeon in the lab within seven years using CRISPR. Parallel work focused on breeding shows it would only take a few more years to build up a healthy sustainable population of 10,000 birds or so. That won't be enough to make a dent in forests the way the sky-darkening flocks of the last century did. Still, Novak says, it's a start. </p><p>But does that mean that monster pigeon swarms will start descending on cities like New York? Historically, Novak says, the birds stayed clear of urban centres as there was not enough food. \"The bigger their flocks get, the more they will stay remote, near tree cover.\" And, if things do get out of hand, he says we already know what to do: it was just a few decades of hunting that wiped out those billions of birds in the first place.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What if we crash the ecosystems we're trying to save? </emphasis></h><p>But suppose passenger pigeon flocks really are too much for American forests already scarred by record wildfires. Or that bizarre little frog becomes the next cane toad. Some have even wondered whether ancient viruses, entangled in the DNA of long-dead species, could be reawakened (cue the buzzing mammoth carcass in the TV sci-fi thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fortitude</emphasis>).</p><p>Archer, who himself was the first ecologist to <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/everyone-agreed-cane-toads-would-be-a-winner-for-australia-19881\">sound the alarm on the danger of cane toads in Australia</url>, says the <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/how-mountain-pygmy-possum-can-be-saved-climate-change\">fossil record can offer important clues</url> as to how an ecosystem will fare with a reintroduced species. When he ventured into the Tasmanian bush with one of the last people to see thylacines in the wild, he found their habitat was broadly unchanged since the 1930s. Peter Ward, in his 90s on the hike, had trapped and hunted the tigers as a boy with his father and brother, back when there was a bounty on the marsupials' head (due to now-debunked fears that thylacines were eating livestock). At the end of the track, Ward's family hut was still there, just as he'd left it, tins of food still on the shelf. \"Tears came into his eyes,\" Archer says. \"He even remembered what they sounded like. He said they'd make this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">yip yip yip </emphasis>sound as they circled the hut at night. The forest hasn't moved on.\"</p><p>Novak says ecosystems are not a house of cards. \"When they have the right pillars - our keystone species like predators and pollinators and herds - then they're more like a tower that an earthquake wobbles, but it doesn't collapse.\"</p><p>Besides, Church adds, the larger the animal, the easier a reintroduction is to reverse. Just as feral goats were removed from the Galapagos Islands, rounding up wayward mammoths wouldn't be impossible.</p><p>But while thylacines could help with Australia's feral cat problem, as dingoes do on the mainland, Archer says it's not quite a wolves-in-Yellowstone situation. \"They're not going to be chasing the big animals.\" In Tasmania, where there are no dingoes, thylacines would be competing for smaller prey with the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, it might put pressure on the quoll too. These are both endangered species themselves, and so the thylacine's impact would have to be closely monitored, Archer says, released as a trial in fenced areas first.</p><p>\"But 99 per cent of the time, with some careful planning, what happens is what you intend. This is the part of conservation we already know how to do well.\"</p><p/><p>Indeed, for all the focus on worst-case scenarios, Novak says he could only find one instance of a conservation reintroduction backfiring, after a<url normalizedValue=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.394\">nalysing more than a century of US \"rewildings\"</url>: when moving some endangered water birds into a wetland in 1988 caused others in the area to die off.</p><p>In America, regulators have now green-lit the world's first release of a de-extinct species: a chestnut tree. Once the most abundant on the continent, the towering tree has been genetically engineered to survive the imported fungus that wiped it out eight decades ago. Some Native American tribes have even agreed to replant it on native land. Regulating the chestnut's return was no easy task and Novak hopes it will now be a guiding light for future de-extinctions, though he admits \"mammoths and pigeons are a whole different ball game to trees\".</p><p>But, just as gene-editing can bring back life, it can also end it. Gene drives hold awesome power to accelerate evolution and take out feral populations by spreading edits that disadvantage or kill a pest species quickly. Scientists have even proposed such an approach to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/environment/conservation/scientists-want-to-alter-rodent-genes-to-prevent-mice-plagues-20210521-p57tvx.html\">tackle the mouse plague gripping Australia's east</url>. Novak says gene drives must be used carefully, but \"sometimes the risk of doing nothing, whether that's gene drives or de-extinction ... is actually a lot worse\".</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will de-extinction help conservation? Or are we playing God?</emphasis></h><p>For scientists eyeing de-extinction projects, there are a lot of vacancies out in the wild in need of filling. Novak says the technologies being developed will benefit existing endangered species too as their gene pools narrow, from the black-footed ferret to the northern white rhino, pictured below. \"The passenger pigeons and the mammoths, they're our moon shots,\" he says. \"This is never going to replace traditional conservation.\"</p><p>But others worry that critical funding will be taken away from on-the-ground recovery efforts and shunted into pie-in-the-sky de-extinction projects. Australia has some of the world's highest extinction rates but spends a tenth of what the US does on conservation efforts. De-extinction, if proven to work, will still carry a higher price tag than traditional conservation. At this late hour, Ritchie says, funnelling more funding into proven methods is a safer bet.</p><p>Novak understands the concern but says funding for de-extinction projects so far generally comes from sources not already investing in conservation, such as big tech. \"We've tried hard [at Revive &amp; Restore] to get money from new places like biotech companies, even Facebook.\" Since the not-for-profit was founded by conservationist Stewart Brand in 2012, Novak says about 90 per cent of the funding it's raised has been spent on genetic rescue, such as their work with ferrets, not de-extinction. With the birth of Elizabeth Ann, he says those projects are advancing enough that they might begin to compete with traditional conservation. \"But in conservation, we always fight for funding to re-introduce this species or that one. It's always triage.\"</p><p>Archer, who says money for his own frog project comes primarily from people interested in the technology rather than the frog, stresses that forcing a choice between de-extinction and conservation will crush innovation. In Australia, where life has evolved over the past 50 million years cut off from the other continents, he says the case for de-extinction is especially strong. \"We have this added responsibility because our animals just don't exist anywhere else. We're a whole distinct branch of the global genome.\"</p><p>Ritchie recalls the story of an Australian naturalist who took a taxidermied northern quoll into parts of the Northern Territory where it had vanished. \"A local Aboriginal woman just held it, crying, when she saw it again. It was one of her totemic species, and that pain, that loss, was still so strong.\"</p><p>Archer and Church say de-extinction could help end the doom and gloom of conservation, turning it around from an unwinnable war into something that could capture the public's attention (and perhaps real funding). But will the path there be littered with ghastly mistakes, animals trapped in awful lives because of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/curing-cancer-designer-babies-supersoldiers-how-will-gene-editing-change-us-20210511-p57qqt.html\">editing blunders</url></p><p>\"Genetic power's the most awesome force the world has ever seen but you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun,\" Jeff Goldblum's character Dr Ian Malcolm warns in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park.</emphasis></p><p>\"How can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?\" counters the park's creator John Hammond, played by Richard Attenborough.</p><p>Like Benjamin the thylacine, many of the species we have lost in the past century or two also died of the cold - of our indifference, our cruelty, our thoughtlessness.

His name was Benjamin, the thylacine, Ben, the last Tasmanian Tiger - only we didn't know that when he was captured and put in a zoo in 1933.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In grainy black-and-white footage at the time, Benjamin paces his enclosure, yawning and baring his jaws. He lies down, he sniffs the concrete. At one point (off-screen) he even gives the cameraman a cheeky bite on the bum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He died three years later, locked out of his backroom shelter one freezing night, just weeks after his species was at last granted protected status in Tasmania following decades of hunting. Eventually, the world came to realise that Benjamin really was the last of Australia's great striped marsupial. But, when he died, they saw only an animal too damaged to be preserved in a museum. His body was tossed in a dumpster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Benjamin's story now haunts ecologist Euan Ritchie as he maps accelerating extinction rates around the world. \"What a perfect metaphor,\" he says. \"Benjamin died of neglect and then we threw him out. These species took millions of years to evolve and now they're disappearing by the thousands because we don't care enough. It's like going into a museum and lighting all of its precious paintings on fire.\"</p><p>Paleontologist Michael Archer is also haunted by the story. But he has a plan to make sure Benjamin is not the last thylacine. Archer isn't one of Australia's infamous Tasmanian Tiger hunters, the ones who trek into the bush convinced they may yet find a survivor of the extinct species. Though he has diligently DNA-tested suspected thylacine excrement sent in by such \"spotters\", Archer says sightings always turn out to be \"fascinating bullshit\".</p><p>Instead, he is part of the \"de-extinction club\": a growing group of scientists working to harness genetic engineering and cloning to reach into the past - and resurrect extinct animals. Top of the list are the thylacine and the woolly mammoth. Archer and others say the unnatural pace of climate change and habitat destruction mean bringing back key species may now be the only way to stop ecosystems from collapsing. Harvard University's renowned geneticist George Church, himself working to return the mammoth to the Arctic tundra, says reviving some species could even help combat the effects of global warming. But others, such as Ritchie, warn that it might put the wild in jeopardy all over again, or pull vital focus from the urgent work underway to save those species we do have left.</p><p>So how does de-extinction work? Would a woolly mammoth cooked up in a lab be a real mammoth or just a funny-looking elephant? How do we choose which species get a second chance?

Today, the great catastrophe is here, at least for wildlife. Humans are burning through the planet's resources with an unprecedented appetite, changing the climate, concreting over the wild. Archer says extinction rates are as high as they were during the Cretaceous period, when 75 per cent of species, including the dinosaurs, were wiped from the map. In half a century, the World Wildlife Fund calculates, we have lost more than half of the planet's biodiversity. \"We've now entered the planet's sixth mass extinction event,\" Ritchie says. \"And, ultimately, humans need these ecosystems to survive, too. They're our life support system.\"</p><p>Archer argues that conventional conservation efforts \"aren't cutting the mustard\" and the time has come for extraordinary intervention - an ark of sorts. \"Normally, nature fills the vacancies from a big extinction event like this. But we're not leaving any room for that this time. So we're really in uncharted territory. And we have to be smart.\"</p><p>For some scientists, being smart means conserving sperm, egg and tissue samples from endangered species in cryogenically frozen arks, the same way conservationists might keep breeding pairs in captive populations, in case they can one day be returned to the wild. For Archer and others, being smart means using technology not just to slow down extinction but to reverse it.</p><p>Of course, unlike Noah, you will need more than two of a species to bring it back. If de-extinction is to mean more than a few curiosities in a lab or a zoo, scientists recommend a gene pool of at least 50 to 1000 animals to start. And you need to make sure that both the species and the wild you're sending them back into can cope with their return. And that's even before we get to the technology itself.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you \"de-extinct\" something?</emphasis></h><p>It's not quite enough to thaw a frozen mammoth from a block of ice. Scientists need either tissue to clone an animal or enough of its DNA, its genetic blueprint, to engineer it. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis>, that source code came from a preserved mosquito with a belly full of dinosaur blood. In real life, that wouldn't actually be enough DNA to rebuild a dinosaur (the little molecule is hardy enough to survive at crime scenes but, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11555\">about 1.5 million years, it's too decayed to read</url> anymore). Still, carcasses of mammoths and Neanderthals preserved in the icy permafrost at the top of the world, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00436-x\">some of them a million years old</url>, have yielded enough of their genetic code for scientists such as Church to rebuild, and edit. Even the mysterious virus behind the deadly Spanish flu of 1918 was recreated in a lab from the frozen lungs of one of its victims, unearthed from an icy grave in Alaska.</p><p>\"No-one's advocating for the de-extinction of viruses, of course,\" Church says. \"But there's a lot more possible than we first imagined.\"</p><p>Since the development of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/curing-cancer-designer-babies-supersoldiers-how-will-gene-editing-change-us-20210511-p57qqt.html\">better gene-editing tools such as CRISPR</url> (which borrows the precision of ancient bacteria immune systems to find and edit specific genes), Archer says museum collections, too, have become \"the flavour of the month\". \"Suddenly everyone wants to go in and sample shrivelled toes [for] the DNA.\"</p><p/><p>Scientists are even learning how to wind back the clock on a living animal's family tree, searching for dormant genes switched off over their evolution, such as a tail or bigger teeth, to help revive extinct ancestors, gene by gene. That's how the paleontologist who inspired Michael Crichton's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> in the first place, Jack Horner, is hoping to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-re-not-running-out-of-dinosaurs-why-is-there-a-boom-in-finding-fossils-20200217-p541j2.html\">build a dinosaur</url> from its decidedly less scaly descendant: the chicken. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction, after all.</p><p>\"Genes even older than [those of] the dinosaurs can be brought back, too,\" Church says. \"But it's limited. It's hard to reconstruct a [species'] entire genome that way. It's not like you have a 3D printer where you say, 'Print out this organism' because the rules are way more powerful than that. They're more mysterious. And the question is always, why do it?\"</p><p>Horner himself says he'd be looking to turn on only a few lost traits in his dino-chicken (\"the claws, teeth, arms, scales and the tail to keep the fourth-graders happy\"). Already, a beak has become a snout in chicken embryos. The tail has proven the most difficult but in recent months \"we've made headway understanding how [it] evolved from dinosaur to bird\". Even so, Horner's chickenosaurus wouldn't really be an extinct animal. \"It'd be a new kind of dinosaur-like bird,\" he says.</p><p>Church himself has viable DNA of his mammoth but will still need to pair it with the genome of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to try to bring it back (he sometimes calls the project the \"mammophant\").</p><p>Likewise, Ben Novak at the genetic rescue and de-extinction group Revive &amp; Restore has big plans to re-engineer and breed an extinct line of North American bird known as the passenger pigeon using existing flocks (he's even done some experiments on birds at the CSIRO's secure lab in Melbourne). And Archer plans to turn to the Tasmanian devil as a template to recreate the Tasmanian tiger, after the thylacine's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0417-y\">genome was at last sequenced</url> from DNA found in a specimen at the Melbourne Museum.</p><p>These animals, if they ever come blinking and growling to life in the lab, will be hybrids of the past and the present. But there is a way to bring back an \"100 per cent extinct animal\", Archer says, and that's cloning.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You can clone </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">extinct </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">animals?</emphasis></h><p>More than 20 years after Dolly the sheep became the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, the technique is yet to be perfected, but Archer says it's not quite the horror show people imagine. While the sci-fi nightmare of cloned humans never materialised, livestock can be cloned to preserve breeding lines, and celebrities and millionaires fork out upwards of $40,000 to clone beloved pets.</p><p>Some conservationists are also turning to the technique to stop inbreeding in dwindling wildlife populations. In late 2020, Novak teamed up with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to clone a critically endangered black-footed ferret from the frozen cells of a ferret who died in 1988. The clone, named <url normalizedValue=\"https://usfws.medium.com/the-curious-life-of-elizabeth-ann-618e8d828448\">Elizabeth Ann, is now a healthy six-month-old</url> who is fond of tearing apart paper bags, barking at anyone who invades her personal space, and has \"three times more genetic variation in her little body than any other [black-footed] ferret on the planet,\" Novak says.</p><p>Of course, to clone an animal, the cell you are using must still be intact - alive, in a sense. That makes cloning an extinct species almost impossible. But it has happened. In 2003, scientists in Spain cloned an extinct mountain goat known as the Pyrenean ibex from the frozen tissue of the last of its species, Celia.</p><p>To clone, you take the egg of a suitably similar host animal, say, a domestic goat, and suck out the DNA-packed nucleus within, replacing it with that of the animal in line for resurrection, in this case, Celia the ibex. Then you hit it with a Frankstein-esque jolt of electricity to fuse the egg and nucleus, and you implant that new egg in a surrogate mother (another goat). If all goes to plan, the DNA will tell the egg to grow an ibex instead. In this case, a baby ibex did arrive but she lived for just 10 minutes, born with a fatal lung defect scientists say can be typical of the species, clone or not.</p><p>The experiment was never tried again because by then the Spanish government had released goats into the mountains to replace the ibex, and so the team despaired they were too late. The ibex had lost its habitat. It had effectively gone extinct twice.</p><p>Archer hopes there will be a happier ending for the gastric-brooding frog, an extinct Australian species he's been working to clone since a colleague discovered some intact tissue cells \"miraculously still tucked away at the back of an old university freezer\". This frog first caught the eye of medical researchers for its bizarre ability to turn its stomach into a womb and vomit up its babies. \"Nothing else in nature can do that,\" Archer says. But before it could be studied, in the mid-1980s, it vanished. Then in 2013, Archer's team had a breakthrough. The extinct frog's DNA began to replicate when it was implanted in donor frog eggs. Under the microscope, the team watched the embryos start to develop with growing excitement.</p><p>\"But suddenly it just stopped,\" Archer says. The team believes the problem lies not with the DNA, but with their technique for cloning amphibians. \"We hit the same wall when we tried a living frog's DNA. We just need to get one [species] back, one of these [de-extinction] projects over the line, and people will see we're not making monsters.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does bringing back a mammoth have to do with climate change?</emphasis></h><p>OK, so <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> probably won't happen but what about a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pleistocene Park</emphasis> for the king of that Ice Age, the woolly mammoth? These towering herbivores were hunted to extinction by early humans some 10,000 years ago, the very last of them surviving on Arctic islands until 4000 years ago. But the mammoth is still the closest genetic relative to the now endangered Asian elephant. \"Even closer than the African elephant,\" Church says.</p><p>He believes resurrecting the mammoth's ancient genes could stop the Asian elephant from following it into extinction. Splicing in traits that helped the mammoth thrive in the Arctic could open up crucial new habitat, as land-clearing and poaching closer to the equator increasingly whittle down their numbers. Endangered species are already relocated, with varying success, by conservationists, and their genes managed via breeding programs to protect diversity. </p><p/><p>Church estimates that editing in about 40 to 100 mammoth genes, chiefly around cold resistance, will be enough to allow Asian elephants to thrive up north. Separate projects have edited about that number in pigs, for different traits, and Church says they are now breeding whole generations of healthy, engineered animals.</p><p>In the case of his mammophant, the team would grow the animal in an artificial womb to avoid any risk to the endangered elephant they would otherwise have to use as a surrogate. That means there's an extra hurdle to scale - growing a mammal artificially, all the way from fertilisation to birth, hasn't been done before. Church expects to crack the problem in about five years, in mice first, which have a faster gestation period than elephants (20 days versus 22 months). \"Then it'll probably take another five to adapt it to larger animals and then we can see how it scales up for the mammoth.\"</p><p>If it works, he already has a place to put the herd. Since the '90s, a group of Russian scientists has been transforming a huge swathe of land in Siberia back to the grasslands that mammoths and other large animals once roamed. It really is called Pleistocene Park and, with the mammoth's help, some think it could actually slow climate change. Grasslands can absorb more carbon than forests, and mammoths rip down trees and create this tundra as they go. But, more importantly, their heavy feet also trample snow cover, stopping it from acting as insulation and so allowing the permafrost to be chilled by the icy Arctic winds. In theory, Church says this should help slow its thaw, which eventually threatens to release <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00659-y\">more carbon and methane than the atmosphere holds today</url>.</p><p>But Ritchie questions why you would bring back a mammoth, a creature of the Ice Age, to a rapidly warming world? \"You're not going to have herds of thousands of mammoths in time to have a real impact on the permafrost, given how fast it's melting now with climate change,\" he says. \"You'll just end up with an elephant that can't handle the heat, and probably, a freak show. We have to think very carefully about how the world is going to be when we consider what to bring back.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happens when we put an extinct animal back in the wild?</emphasis></h><p>There's not much point resurrecting a species if it will face the same threat of extinction soon after, like the Pyrenean ibex muscled out of its mountains. And de-extinction proponents stress that animals should fill an empty ecological niche too. When wolves were hunted out of Yellowstone National Park in the United States, elk numbers exploded. With no predator to keep them in check, they tore up the grasses and rivers. Suddenly, the beavers had vanished too. \"And when they brought the wolves back, 70 years later, the ecosystem was restored,\" Church says.</p><p>Of course, for this more classical \"rewilding\" to work with a resurrected animal, it needs to act the way its ancestor did. But not everything is encoded in genes. How will an engineered mammophant, for example, learn to migrate across the Arctic tundra as mammoths once did if there's no parent to show it the way? And what if cutting and pasting together species' genomes, in this case of elephant and mammoth or thylacine and Tasmanian devil, interferes with other natural instincts?</p><p>These are problems Archer ponders a lot. \"You could even have two sets of instructions [in the DNA] that are contradictory,\" he says. \"But don't forget that the mammoth is a kind of specialised elephant, so most of the genome is already the same. Tasmanian devils, too, are close enough to thylacines, even though they're smaller.\" For his part, he believes \"we'll have 99 per cent original behaviours in resurrected species\". Most behaviour really is gene-deep in animals, he says, even the strange case of the gastric-brooding frog swallowing its fertilised eggs. \"No frog teaches another frog to do anything, they're on their own from the moment they're a tadpole.\"</p><p>In the case of a resurrected thylacine, there won't be much to compare it to. There are few records of how the marsupial lived, so some ecologists warn not enough is known to bring it back safely. Archer is quick to point out that the thylacine vanished from Tasmania only 90 years ago, and from the mainland at the same time as the devil (which is itself being considered for reintroduction over the Bass Strait) some 3200 years ago. \"We know what it's going to do. It's going to become the king of beasts [in Australia] again.\"</p><p>But consider the case of the passenger pigeon that Novak hopes to bring back to North America. One hundred and fifty years ago, they were the most abundant bird on the planet. And, though they numbered as many as six billion, Novak says there were only three or four flocks flying the world at any one time. When they moved from forest to forest, they came in like a hurricane or a forest fire, breaking branches, destroying canopies and forcing those woods into regeneration cycles.</p><p>\"No other birds do this,\" Novak says. \"They were ecosystem engineers. Some of the restoration we thought fire did to the landscape we've now shown the birds did.\" Novak argues the forest needs them back. He and his team have sequenced the pigeon's genome and compared it to its closest living relative, the bandtailed pigeon. Of the 25-million-odd genes where they differed, Novak has identified about 30 that could be particularly significant in making a pigeon behave like a passenger pigeon, such as disease resistance and, potentially, extra-social behaviour.</p><p>So here's his plan: Novak imagines a carefully controlled release, first on a netted reserve with nesting baskets packed into dense trees, encouraging the birds to breed in colonies and, to fool them into thinking they are already part of a much bigger flock, with speakers blasting pigeon calls and coos. If the birds gang up as planned, they would be fitted with GPS trackers and set free, by the thousand or so.</p><p/><p>With enough funding, which Novak ballparks at about $US25 million, he thinks he could create a live passenger pigeon in the lab within seven years using CRISPR. Parallel work focused on breeding shows it would only take a few more years to build up a healthy sustainable population of 10,000 birds or so. That won't be enough to make a dent in forests the way the sky-darkening flocks of the last century did. Still, Novak says, it's a start. </p><p>But does that mean that monster pigeon swarms will start descending on cities like New York? Historically, Novak says, the birds stayed clear of urban centres as there was not enough food. \"The bigger their flocks get, the more they will stay remote, near tree cover.\" And, if things do get out of hand, he says we already know what to do: it was just a few decades of hunting that wiped out those billions of birds in the first place.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What if we crash the ecosystems we're trying to save? </emphasis></h><p>But suppose passenger pigeon flocks really are too much for American forests already scarred by record wildfires. Or that bizarre little frog becomes the next cane toad. Some have even wondered whether ancient viruses, entangled in the DNA of long-dead species, could be reawakened (cue the buzzing mammoth carcass in the TV sci-fi thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fortitude</emphasis>).</p><p>Archer, who himself was the first ecologist to <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/everyone-agreed-cane-toads-would-be-a-winner-for-australia-19881\">sound the alarm on the danger of cane toads in Australia</url>, says the <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/how-mountain-pygmy-possum-can-be-saved-climate-change\">fossil record can offer important clues</url> as to how an ecosystem will fare with a reintroduced species. When he ventured into the Tasmanian bush with one of the last people to see thylacines in the wild, he found their habitat was broadly unchanged since the 1930s. Peter Ward, in his 90s on the hike, had trapped and hunted the tigers as a boy with his father and brother, back when there was a bounty on the marsupials' head (due to now-debunked fears that thylacines were eating livestock). At the end of the track, Ward's family hut was still there, just as he'd left it, tins of food still on the shelf. \"Tears came into his eyes,\" Archer says. \"He even remembered what they sounded like. He said they'd make this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">yip yip yip </emphasis>sound as they circled the hut at night. The forest hasn't moved on.\"</p><p>Novak says ecosystems are not a house of cards. \"When they have the right pillars - our keystone species like predators and pollinators and herds - then they're more like a tower that an earthquake wobbles, but it doesn't collapse.\"</p><p>Besides, Church adds, the larger the animal, the easier a reintroduction is to reverse. Just as feral goats were removed from the Galapagos Islands, rounding up wayward mammoths wouldn't be impossible.</p><p>But while thylacines could help with Australia's feral cat problem, as dingoes do on the mainland, Archer says it's not quite a wolves-in-Yellowstone situation. \"They're not going to be chasing the big animals.\" In Tasmania, where there are no dingoes, thylacines would be competing for smaller prey with the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, it might put pressure on the quoll too. These are both endangered species themselves, and so the thylacine's impact would have to be closely monitored, Archer says, released as a trial in fenced areas first.</p><p>\"But 99 per cent of the time, with some careful planning, what happens is what you intend. This is the part of conservation we already know how to do well.\"</p><p/><p>Indeed, for all the focus on worst-case scenarios, Novak says he could only find one instance of a conservation reintroduction backfiring, after a<url normalizedValue=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.394\">nalysing more than a century of US \"rewildings\"</url>: when moving some endangered water birds into a wetland in 1988 caused others in the area to die off.</p><p>In America, regulators have now green-lit the world's first release of a de-extinct species: a chestnut tree. Once the most abundant on the continent, the towering tree has been genetically engineered to survive the imported fungus that wiped it out eight decades ago. Some Native American tribes have even agreed to replant it on native land. Regulating the chestnut's return was no easy task and Novak hopes it will now be a guiding light for future de-extinctions, though he admits \"mammoths and pigeons are a whole different ball game to trees\".</p><p>But, just as gene-editing can bring back life, it can also end it. Gene drives hold awesome power to accelerate evolution and take out feral populations by spreading edits that disadvantage or kill a pest species quickly. Scientists have even proposed such an approach to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/environment/conservation/scientists-want-to-alter-rodent-genes-to-prevent-mice-plagues-20210521-p57tvx.html\">tackle the mouse plague gripping Australia's east</url>. Novak says gene drives must be used carefully, but \"sometimes the risk of doing nothing, whether that's gene drives or de-extinction ... is actually a lot worse\".</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will de-extinction help conservation? Or are we playing God?</emphasis></h><p>For scientists eyeing de-extinction projects, there are a lot of vacancies out in the wild in need of filling. Novak says the technologies being developed will benefit existing endangered species too as their gene pools narrow, from the black-footed ferret to the northern white rhino, pictured below. \"The passenger pigeons and the mammoths, they're our moon shots,\" he says. \"This is never going to replace traditional conservation.\"</p><p>But others worry that critical funding will be taken away from on-the-ground recovery efforts and shunted into pie-in-the-sky de-extinction projects. Australia has some of the world's highest extinction rates but spends a tenth of what the US does on conservation efforts. De-extinction, if proven to work, will still carry a higher price tag than traditional conservation. At this late hour, Ritchie says, funnelling more funding into proven methods is a safer bet.</p><p>Novak understands the concern but says funding for de-extinction projects so far generally comes from sources not already investing in conservation, such as big tech. \"We've tried hard [at Revive &amp; Restore] to get money from new places like biotech companies, even Facebook.\" Since the not-for-profit was founded by conservationist Stewart Brand in 2012, Novak says about 90 per cent of the funding it's raised has been spent on genetic rescue, such as their work with ferrets, not de-extinction. With the birth of Elizabeth Ann, he says those projects are advancing enough that they might begin to compete with traditional conservation. \"But in conservation, we always fight for funding to re-introduce this species or that one. It's always triage.\"</p><p>Archer, who says money for his own frog project comes primarily from people interested in the technology rather than the frog, stresses that forcing a choice between de-extinction and conservation will crush innovation. In Australia, where life has evolved over the past 50 million years cut off from the other continents, he says the case for de-extinction is especially strong. \"We have this added responsibility because our animals just don't exist anywhere else. We're a whole distinct branch of the global genome.\"</p><p>Ritchie recalls the story of an Australian naturalist who took a taxidermied northern quoll into parts of the Northern Territory where it had vanished. \"A local Aboriginal woman just held it, crying, when she saw it again. It was one of her totemic species, and that pain, that loss, was still so strong.\"</p><p>Archer and Church say de-extinction could help end the doom and gloom of conservation, turning it around from an unwinnable war into something that could capture the public's attention (and perhaps real funding).

His name was Benjamin, the thylacine, Ben, the last Tasmanian Tiger - only we didn't know that when he was captured and put in a zoo in 1933.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In grainy black-and-white footage at the time, Benjamin paces his enclosure, yawning and baring his jaws. He lies down, he sniffs the concrete. At one point (off-screen) he even gives the cameraman a cheeky bite on the bum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He died three years later, locked out of his backroom shelter one freezing night, just weeks after his species was at last granted protected status in Tasmania following decades of hunting. Eventually, the world came to realise that Benjamin really was the last of Australia's great striped marsupial. But, when he died, they saw only an animal too damaged to be preserved in a museum. His body was tossed in a dumpster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Benjamin's story now haunts ecologist Euan Ritchie as he maps accelerating extinction rates around the world. \"What a perfect metaphor,\" he says. \"Benjamin died of neglect and then we threw him out. These species took millions of years to evolve and now they're disappearing by the thousands because we don't care enough. It's like going into a museum and lighting all of its precious paintings on fire.\"</p><p>Paleontologist Michael Archer is also haunted by the story. But he has a plan to make sure Benjamin is not the last thylacine. Archer isn't one of Australia's infamous Tasmanian Tiger hunters, the ones who trek into the bush convinced they may yet find a survivor of the extinct species. Though he has diligently DNA-tested suspected thylacine excrement sent in by such \"spotters\", Archer says sightings always turn out to be \"fascinating bullshit\".</p><p>Instead, he is part of the \"de-extinction club\": a growing group of scientists working to harness genetic engineering and cloning to reach into the past - and resurrect extinct animals. Top of the list are the thylacine and the woolly mammoth. Archer and others say the unnatural pace of climate change and habitat destruction mean bringing back key species may now be the only way to stop ecosystems from collapsing. Harvard University's renowned geneticist George Church, himself working to return the mammoth to the Arctic tundra, says reviving some species could even help combat the effects of global warming. But others, such as Ritchie, warn that it might put the wild in jeopardy all over again, or pull vital focus from the urgent work underway to save those species we do have left.</p><p>So how does de-extinction work? Would a woolly mammoth cooked up in a lab be a real mammoth or just a funny-looking elephant? How do we choose which species get a second chance? And is there any dino DNA left to get us to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis></p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.84%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/2e403c5ebd3e66039ec904e5b5d37ab772be9968\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Illustration: Matt Davidson </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why bring back extinct animals?</emphasis></h><p>There's a story humans tell of saving animals in an ark - two of each kind to survive a great catastrophe. Today, the great catastrophe is here, at least for wildlife. Humans are burning through the planet's resources with an unprecedented appetite, changing the climate, concreting over the wild. Archer says extinction rates are as high as they were during the Cretaceous period, when 75 per cent of species, including the dinosaurs, were wiped from the map. In half a century, the World Wildlife Fund calculates, we have lost more than half of the planet's biodiversity. \"We've now entered the planet's sixth mass extinction event,\" Ritchie says. \"And, ultimately, humans need these ecosystems to survive, too. They're our life support system.\"</p><p>Archer argues that conventional conservation efforts \"aren't cutting the mustard\" and the time has come for extraordinary intervention - an ark of sorts. \"Normally, nature fills the vacancies from a big extinction event like this. But we're not leaving any room for that this time. So we're really in uncharted territory. And we have to be smart.\"</p><p>For some scientists, being smart means conserving sperm, egg and tissue samples from endangered species in cryogenically frozen arks, the same way conservationists might keep breeding pairs in captive populations, in case they can one day be returned to the wild. For Archer and others, being smart means using technology not just to slow down extinction but to reverse it.</p><p>Of course, unlike Noah, you will need more than two of a species to bring it back. If de-extinction is to mean more than a few curiosities in a lab or a zoo, scientists recommend a gene pool of at least 50 to 1000 animals to start. And you need to make sure that both the species and the wild you're sending them back into can cope with their return. And that's even before we get to the technology itself.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you \"de-extinct\" something?</emphasis></h><p>It's not quite enough to thaw a frozen mammoth from a block of ice. Scientists need either tissue to clone an animal or enough of its DNA, its genetic blueprint, to engineer it. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis>, that source code came from a preserved mosquito with a belly full of dinosaur blood. In real life, that wouldn't actually be enough DNA to rebuild a dinosaur (the little molecule is hardy enough to survive at crime scenes but, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11555\">about 1.5 million years, it's too decayed to read</url> anymore). Still, carcasses of mammoths and Neanderthals preserved in the icy permafrost at the top of the world, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00436-x\">some of them a million years old</url>, have yielded enough of their genetic code for scientists such as Church to rebuild, and edit. Even the mysterious virus behind the deadly Spanish flu of 1918 was recreated in a lab from the frozen lungs of one of its victims, unearthed from an icy grave in Alaska.</p><p>\"No-one's advocating for the de-extinction of viruses, of course,\" Church says. \"But there's a lot more possible than we first imagined.\"</p><p>Since the development of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/curing-cancer-designer-babies-supersoldiers-how-will-gene-editing-change-us-20210511-p57qqt.html\">better gene-editing tools such as CRISPR</url> (which borrows the precision of ancient bacteria immune systems to find and edit specific genes), Archer says museum collections, too, have become \"the flavour of the month\". \"Suddenly everyone wants to go in and sample shrivelled toes [for] the DNA.\"</p><p/><p>Scientists are even learning how to wind back the clock on a living animal's family tree, searching for dormant genes switched off over their evolution, such as a tail or bigger teeth, to help revive extinct ancestors, gene by gene. That's how the paleontologist who inspired Michael Crichton's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> in the first place, Jack Horner, is hoping to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-re-not-running-out-of-dinosaurs-why-is-there-a-boom-in-finding-fossils-20200217-p541j2.html\">build a dinosaur</url> from its decidedly less scaly descendant: the chicken. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction, after all.</p><p>\"Genes even older than [those of] the dinosaurs can be brought back, too,\" Church says. \"But it's limited. It's hard to reconstruct a [species'] entire genome that way. It's not like you have a 3D printer where you say, 'Print out this organism' because the rules are way more powerful than that. They're more mysterious. And the question is always, why do it?\"</p><p>Horner himself says he'd be looking to turn on only a few lost traits in his dino-chicken (\"the claws, teeth, arms, scales and the tail to keep the fourth-graders happy\"). Already, a beak has become a snout in chicken embryos. The tail has proven the most difficult but in recent months \"we've made headway understanding how [it] evolved from dinosaur to bird\". Even so, Horner's chickenosaurus wouldn't really be an extinct animal. \"It'd be a new kind of dinosaur-like bird,\" he says.</p><p>Church himself has viable DNA of his mammoth but will still need to pair it with the genome of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to try to bring it back (he sometimes calls the project the \"mammophant\").</p><p>Likewise, Ben Novak at the genetic rescue and de-extinction group Revive &amp; Restore has big plans to re-engineer and breed an extinct line of North American bird known as the passenger pigeon using existing flocks (he's even done some experiments on birds at the CSIRO's secure lab in Melbourne). And Archer plans to turn to the Tasmanian devil as a template to recreate the Tasmanian tiger, after the thylacine's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0417-y\">genome was at last sequenced</url> from DNA found in a specimen at the Melbourne Museum.</p><p>These animals, if they ever come blinking and growling to life in the lab, will be hybrids of the past and the present. But there is a way to bring back an \"100 per cent extinct animal\", Archer says, and that's cloning.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You can clone </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">extinct </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">animals?</emphasis></h><p>More than 20 years after Dolly the sheep became the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, the technique is yet to be perfected, but Archer says it's not quite the horror show people imagine. While the sci-fi nightmare of cloned humans never materialised, livestock can be cloned to preserve breeding lines, and celebrities and millionaires fork out upwards of $40,000 to clone beloved pets.</p><p>Some conservationists are also turning to the technique to stop inbreeding in dwindling wildlife populations. In late 2020, Novak teamed up with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to clone a critically endangered black-footed ferret from the frozen cells of a ferret who died in 1988. The clone, named <url normalizedValue=\"https://usfws.medium.com/the-curious-life-of-elizabeth-ann-618e8d828448\">Elizabeth Ann, is now a healthy six-month-old</url> who is fond of tearing apart paper bags, barking at anyone who invades her personal space, and has \"three times more genetic variation in her little body than any other [black-footed] ferret on the planet,\" Novak says.</p><p>Of course, to clone an animal, the cell you are using must still be intact - alive, in a sense. That makes cloning an extinct species almost impossible. But it has happened. In 2003, scientists in Spain cloned an extinct mountain goat known as the Pyrenean ibex from the frozen tissue of the last of its species, Celia.</p><p>To clone, you take the egg of a suitably similar host animal, say, a domestic goat, and suck out the DNA-packed nucleus within, replacing it with that of the animal in line for resurrection, in this case, Celia the ibex. Then you hit it with a Frankstein-esque jolt of electricity to fuse the egg and nucleus, and you implant that new egg in a surrogate mother (another goat). If all goes to plan, the DNA will tell the egg to grow an ibex instead. In this case, a baby ibex did arrive but she lived for just 10 minutes, born with a fatal lung defect scientists say can be typical of the species, clone or not.</p><p>The experiment was never tried again because by then the Spanish government had released goats into the mountains to replace the ibex, and so the team despaired they were too late. The ibex had lost its habitat. It had effectively gone extinct twice.</p><p>Archer hopes there will be a happier ending for the gastric-brooding frog, an extinct Australian species he's been working to clone since a colleague discovered some intact tissue cells \"miraculously still tucked away at the back of an old university freezer\". This frog first caught the eye of medical researchers for its bizarre ability to turn its stomach into a womb and vomit up its babies. \"Nothing else in nature can do that,\" Archer says. But before it could be studied, in the mid-1980s, it vanished. Then in 2013, Archer's team had a breakthrough. The extinct frog's DNA began to replicate when it was implanted in donor frog eggs. Under the microscope, the team watched the embryos start to develop with growing excitement.</p><p>\"But suddenly it just stopped,\" Archer says. The team believes the problem lies not with the DNA, but with their technique for cloning amphibians. \"We hit the same wall when we tried a living frog's DNA. We just need to get one [species] back, one of these [de-extinction] projects over the line, and people will see we're not making monsters.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does bringing back a mammoth have to do with climate change?</emphasis></h><p>OK, so <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> probably won't happen but what about a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pleistocene Park</emphasis> for the king of that Ice Age, the woolly mammoth? These towering herbivores were hunted to extinction by early humans some 10,000 years ago, the very last of them surviving on Arctic islands until 4000 years ago. But the mammoth is still the closest genetic relative to the now endangered Asian elephant. \"Even closer than the African elephant,\" Church says.</p><p>He believes resurrecting the mammoth's ancient genes could stop the Asian elephant from following it into extinction. Splicing in traits that helped the mammoth thrive in the Arctic could open up crucial new habitat, as land-clearing and poaching closer to the equator increasingly whittle down their numbers. Endangered species are already relocated, with varying success, by conservationists, and their genes managed via breeding programs to protect diversity. </p><p/><p>Church estimates that editing in about 40 to 100 mammoth genes, chiefly around cold resistance, will be enough to allow Asian elephants to thrive up north. Separate projects have edited about that number in pigs, for different traits, and Church says they are now breeding whole generations of healthy, engineered animals.</p><p>In the case of his mammophant, the team would grow the animal in an artificial womb to avoid any risk to the endangered elephant they would otherwise have to use as a surrogate. That means there's an extra hurdle to scale - growing a mammal artificially, all the way from fertilisation to birth, hasn't been done before. Church expects to crack the problem in about five years, in mice first, which have a faster gestation period than elephants (20 days versus 22 months). \"Then it'll probably take another five to adapt it to larger animals and then we can see how it scales up for the mammoth.\"</p><p>If it works, he already has a place to put the herd. Since the '90s, a group of Russian scientists has been transforming a huge swathe of land in Siberia back to the grasslands that mammoths and other large animals once roamed. It really is called Pleistocene Park and, with the mammoth's help, some think it could actually slow climate change. Grasslands can absorb more carbon than forests, and mammoths rip down trees and create this tundra as they go. But, more importantly, their heavy feet also trample snow cover, stopping it from acting as insulation and so allowing the permafrost to be chilled by the icy Arctic winds. In theory, Church says this should help slow its thaw, which eventually threatens to release <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00659-y\">more carbon and methane than the atmosphere holds today</url>.</p><p>But Ritchie questions why you would bring back a mammoth, a creature of the Ice Age, to a rapidly warming world? \"You're not going to have herds of thousands of mammoths in time to have a real impact on the permafrost, given how fast it's melting now with climate change,\" he says. \"You'll just end up with an elephant that can't handle the heat, and probably, a freak show. We have to think very carefully about how the world is going to be when we consider what to bring back.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happens when we put an extinct animal back in the wild?</emphasis></h><p>There's not much point resurrecting a species if it will face the same threat of extinction soon after, like the Pyrenean ibex muscled out of its mountains. And de-extinction proponents stress that animals should fill an empty ecological niche too. When wolves were hunted out of Yellowstone National Park in the United States, elk numbers exploded. With no predator to keep them in check, they tore up the grasses and rivers. Suddenly, the beavers had vanished too. \"And when they brought the wolves back, 70 years later, the ecosystem was restored,\" Church says.</p><p>Of course, for this more classical \"rewilding\" to work with a resurrected animal, it needs to act the way its ancestor did. But not everything is encoded in genes. How will an engineered mammophant, for example, learn to migrate across the Arctic tundra as mammoths once did if there's no parent to show it the way? And what if cutting and pasting together species' genomes, in this case of elephant and mammoth or thylacine and Tasmanian devil, interferes with other natural instincts?</p><p>These are problems Archer ponders a lot. \"You could even have two sets of instructions [in the DNA] that are contradictory,\" he says. \"But don't forget that the mammoth is a kind of specialised elephant, so most of the genome is already the same. Tasmanian devils, too, are close enough to thylacines, even though they're smaller.\" For his part, he believes \"we'll have 99 per cent original behaviours in resurrected species\". Most behaviour really is gene-deep in animals, he says, even the strange case of the gastric-brooding frog swallowing its fertilised eggs. \"No frog teaches another frog to do anything, they're on their own from the moment they're a tadpole.\"</p><p>In the case of a resurrected thylacine, there won't be much to compare it to. There are few records of how the marsupial lived, so some ecologists warn not enough is known to bring it back safely. Archer is quick to point out that the thylacine vanished from Tasmania only 90 years ago, and from the mainland at the same time as the devil (which is itself being considered for reintroduction over the Bass Strait) some 3200 years ago. \"We know what it's going to do. It's going to become the king of beasts [in Australia] again.\"</p><p>But consider the case of the passenger pigeon that Novak hopes to bring back to North America. One hundred and fifty years ago, they were the most abundant bird on the planet. And, though they numbered as many as six billion, Novak says there were only three or four flocks flying the world at any one time. When they moved from forest to forest, they came in like a hurricane or a forest fire, breaking branches, destroying canopies and forcing those woods into regeneration cycles.</p><p>\"No other birds do this,\" Novak says. \"They were ecosystem engineers. Some of the restoration we thought fire did to the landscape we've now shown the birds did.\" Novak argues the forest needs them back. He and his team have sequenced the pigeon's genome and compared it to its closest living relative, the bandtailed pigeon. Of the 25-million-odd genes where they differed, Novak has identified about 30 that could be particularly significant in making a pigeon behave like a passenger pigeon, such as disease resistance and, potentially, extra-social behaviour.</p><p>So here's his plan: Novak imagines a carefully controlled release, first on a netted reserve with nesting baskets packed into dense trees, encouraging the birds to breed in colonies and, to fool them into thinking they are already part of a much bigger flock, with speakers blasting pigeon calls and coos. If the birds gang up as planned, they would be fitted with GPS trackers and set free, by the thousand or so.</p><p/><p>With enough funding, which Novak ballparks at about $US25 million, he thinks he could create a live passenger pigeon in the lab within seven years using CRISPR. Parallel work focused on breeding shows it would only take a few more years to build up a healthy sustainable population of 10,000 birds or so. That won't be enough to make a dent in forests the way the sky-darkening flocks of the last century did. Still, Novak says, it's a start. </p><p>But does that mean that monster pigeon swarms will start descending on cities like New York? Historically, Novak says, the birds stayed clear of urban centres as there was not enough food. \"The bigger their flocks get, the more they will stay remote, near tree cover.\" And, if things do get out of hand, he says we already know what to do: it was just a few decades of hunting that wiped out those billions of birds in the first place.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What if we crash the ecosystems we're trying to save? </emphasis></h><p>But suppose passenger pigeon flocks really are too much for American forests already scarred by record wildfires. Or that bizarre little frog becomes the next cane toad. Some have even wondered whether ancient viruses, entangled in the DNA of long-dead species, could be reawakened (cue the buzzing mammoth carcass in the TV sci-fi thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fortitude</emphasis>).</p><p>Archer, who himself was the first ecologist to <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/everyone-agreed-cane-toads-would-be-a-winner-for-australia-19881\">sound the alarm on the danger of cane toads in Australia</url>, says the <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/how-mountain-pygmy-possum-can-be-saved-climate-change\">fossil record can offer important clues</url> as to how an ecosystem will fare with a reintroduced species. When he ventured into the Tasmanian bush with one of the last people to see thylacines in the wild, he found their habitat was broadly unchanged since the 1930s. Peter Ward, in his 90s on the hike, had trapped and hunted the tigers as a boy with his father and brother, back when there was a bounty on the marsupials' head (due to now-debunked fears that thylacines were eating livestock). At the end of the track, Ward's family hut was still there, just as he'd left it, tins of food still on the shelf. \"Tears came into his eyes,\" Archer says. \"He even remembered what they sounded like. He said they'd make this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">yip yip yip </emphasis>sound as they circled the hut at night. The forest hasn't moved on.\"</p><p>Novak says ecosystems are not a house of cards. \"When they have the right pillars - our keystone species like predators and pollinators and herds - then they're more like a tower that an earthquake wobbles, but it doesn't collapse.\"</p><p>Besides, Church adds, the larger the animal, the easier a reintroduction is to reverse. Just as feral goats were removed from the Galapagos Islands, rounding up wayward mammoths wouldn't be impossible.</p><p>But while thylacines could help with Australia's feral cat problem, as dingoes do on the mainland, Archer says it's not quite a wolves-in-Yellowstone situation. \"They're not going to be chasing the big animals.\" In Tasmania, where there are no dingoes, thylacines would be competing for smaller prey with the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, it might put pressure on the quoll too. These are both endangered species themselves, and so the thylacine's impact would have to be closely monitored, Archer says, released as a trial in fenced areas first.</p><p>\"But 99 per cent of the time, with some careful planning, what happens is what you intend. This is the part of conservation we already know how to do well.\"</p><p/><p>Indeed, for all the focus on worst-case scenarios, Novak says he could only find one instance of a conservation reintroduction backfiring, after a<url normalizedValue=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.394\">nalysing more than a century of US \"rewildings\"</url>: when moving some endangered water birds into a wetland in 1988 caused others in the area to die off.</p><p>In America, regulators have now green-lit the world's first release of a de-extinct species: a chestnut tree. Once the most abundant on the continent, the towering tree has been genetically engineered to survive the imported fungus that wiped it out eight decades ago. Some Native American tribes have even agreed to replant it on native land. Regulating the chestnut's return was no easy task and Novak hopes it will now be a guiding light for future de-extinctions, though he admits \"mammoths and pigeons are a whole different ball game to trees\".</p><p>But, just as gene-editing can bring back life, it can also end it. Gene drives hold awesome power to accelerate evolution and take out feral populations by spreading edits that disadvantage or kill a pest species quickly. Scientists have even proposed such an approach to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/environment/conservation/scientists-want-to-alter-rodent-genes-to-prevent-mice-plagues-20210521-p57tvx.html\">tackle the mouse plague gripping Australia's east</url>. Novak says gene drives must be used carefully, but \"sometimes the risk of doing nothing, whether that's gene drives or de-extinction ... is actually a lot worse\".</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will de-extinction help conservation? Or are we playing God?</emphasis></h><p>For scientists eyeing de-extinction projects, there are a lot of vacancies out in the wild in need of filling. Novak says the technologies being developed will benefit existing endangered species too as their gene pools narrow, from the black-footed ferret to the northern white rhino, pictured below. \"The passenger pigeons and the mammoths, they're our moon shots,\" he says. \"This is never going to replace traditional conservation.\"</p><p>But others worry that critical funding will be taken away from on-the-ground recovery efforts and shunted into pie-in-the-sky de-extinction projects. Australia has some of the world's highest extinction rates but spends a tenth of what the US does on conservation efforts. De-extinction, if proven to work, will still carry a higher price tag than traditional conservation. At this late hour, Ritchie says, funnelling more funding into proven methods is a safer bet.</p><p>Novak understands the concern but says funding for de-extinction projects so far generally comes from sources not already investing in conservation, such as big tech. \"We've tried hard [at Revive &amp; Restore] to get money from new places like biotech companies, even Facebook.\" Since the not-for-profit was founded by conservationist Stewart Brand in 2012, Novak says about 90 per cent of the funding it's raised has been spent on genetic rescue, such as their work with ferrets, not de-extinction. With the birth of Elizabeth Ann, he says those projects are advancing enough that they might begin to compete with traditional conservation. \"But in conservation, we always fight for funding to re-introduce this species or that one. It's always triage.\"</p><p>Archer, who says money for his own frog project comes primarily from people interested in the technology rather than the frog, stresses that forcing a choice between de-extinction and conservation will crush innovation. In Australia, where life has evolved over the past 50 million years cut off from the other continents, he says the case for de-extinction is especially strong. \"We have this added responsibility because our animals just don't exist anywhere else. We're a whole distinct branch of the global genome.\"</p><p>Ritchie recalls the story of an Australian naturalist who took a taxidermied northern quoll into parts of the Northern Territory where it had vanished. \"A local Aboriginal woman just held it, crying, when she saw it again. It was one of her totemic species, and that pain, that loss, was still so strong.\"</p><p>Archer and Church say de-extinction could help end the doom and gloom of conservation, turning it around from an unwinnable war into something that could capture the public's attention (and perhaps real funding). But will the path there be littered with ghastly mistakes, animals trapped in awful lives because of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/curing-cancer-designer-babies-supersoldiers-how-will-gene-editing-change-us-20210511-p57qqt.html\">editing blunders</url></p><p>\"Genetic power's the most awesome force the world has ever seen but you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun,\" Jeff Goldblum's character Dr Ian Malcolm warns in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park.</emphasis></p><p>\"How can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?\" counters the park's creator John Hammond, played by Richard Attenborough.</p><p>Like Benjamin the thylacine, many of the species we have lost in the past century or two also died of the cold - of our indifference, our cruelty, our thoughtlessness.

His name was Benjamin, the thylacine, Ben, the last Tasmanian Tiger - only we didn't know that when he was captured and put in a zoo in 1933.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In grainy black-and-white footage at the time, Benjamin paces his enclosure, yawning and baring his jaws. He lies down, he sniffs the concrete. At one point (off-screen) he even gives the cameraman a cheeky bite on the bum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He died three years later, locked out of his backroom shelter one freezing night, just weeks after his species was at last granted protected status in Tasmania following decades of hunting. Eventually, the world came to realise that Benjamin really was the last of Australia's great striped marsupial. But, when he died, they saw only an animal too damaged to be preserved in a museum. His body was tossed in a dumpster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Benjamin's story now haunts ecologist Euan Ritchie as he maps accelerating extinction rates around the world. \"What a perfect metaphor,\" he says. \"Benjamin died of neglect and then we threw him out. These species took millions of years to evolve and now they're disappearing by the thousands because we don't care enough. It's like going into a museum and lighting all of its precious paintings on fire.\"</p><p>Paleontologist Michael Archer is also haunted by the story. But he has a plan to make sure Benjamin is not the last thylacine. Archer isn't one of Australia's infamous Tasmanian Tiger hunters, the ones who trek into the bush convinced they may yet find a survivor of the extinct species. Though he has diligently DNA-tested suspected thylacine excrement sent in by such \"spotters\", Archer says sightings always turn out to be \"fascinating bullshit\".</p><p>Instead, he is part of the \"de-extinction club\": a growing group of scientists working to harness genetic engineering and cloning to reach into the past - and resurrect extinct animals. Top of the list are the thylacine and the woolly mammoth. Archer and others say the unnatural pace of climate change and habitat destruction mean bringing back key species may now be the only way to stop ecosystems from collapsing. Harvard University's renowned geneticist George Church, himself working to return the mammoth to the Arctic tundra, says reviving some species could even help combat the effects of global warming. But others, such as Ritchie, warn that it might put the wild in jeopardy all over again, or pull vital focus from the urgent work underway to save those species we do have left.</p><p>So how does de-extinction work? Would a woolly mammoth cooked up in a lab be a real mammoth or just a funny-looking elephant? How do we choose which species get a second chance?

Today, the great catastrophe is here, at least for wildlife. Humans are burning through the planet's resources with an unprecedented appetite, changing the climate, concreting over the wild. Archer says extinction rates are as high as they were during the Cretaceous period, when 75 per cent of species, including the dinosaurs, were wiped from the map. In half a century, the World Wildlife Fund calculates, we have lost more than half of the planet's biodiversity. \"We've now entered the planet's sixth mass extinction event,\" Ritchie says. \"And, ultimately, humans need these ecosystems to survive, too. They're our life support system.\"</p><p>Archer argues that conventional conservation efforts \"aren't cutting the mustard\" and the time has come for extraordinary intervention - an ark of sorts. \"Normally, nature fills the vacancies from a big extinction event like this. But we're not leaving any room for that this time. So we're really in uncharted territory. And we have to be smart.\"</p><p>For some scientists, being smart means conserving sperm, egg and tissue samples from endangered species in cryogenically frozen arks, the same way conservationists might keep breeding pairs in captive populations, in case they can one day be returned to the wild. For Archer and others, being smart means using technology not just to slow down extinction but to reverse it.</p><p>Of course, unlike Noah, you will need more than two of a species to bring it back. If de-extinction is to mean more than a few curiosities in a lab or a zoo, scientists recommend a gene pool of at least 50 to 1000 animals to start. And you need to make sure that both the species and the wild you're sending them back into can cope with their return. And that's even before we get to the technology itself.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you \"de-extinct\" something?</emphasis></h><p>It's not quite enough to thaw a frozen mammoth from a block of ice. Scientists need either tissue to clone an animal or enough of its DNA, its genetic blueprint, to engineer it. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis>, that source code came from a preserved mosquito with a belly full of dinosaur blood. In real life, that wouldn't actually be enough DNA to rebuild a dinosaur (the little molecule is hardy enough to survive at crime scenes but, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11555\">about 1.5 million years, it's too decayed to read</url> anymore). Still, carcasses of mammoths and Neanderthals preserved in the icy permafrost at the top of the world, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00436-x\">some of them a million years old</url>, have yielded enough of their genetic code for scientists such as Church to rebuild, and edit. Even the mysterious virus behind the deadly Spanish flu of 1918 was recreated in a lab from the frozen lungs of one of its victims, unearthed from an icy grave in Alaska.</p><p>\"No-one's advocating for the de-extinction of viruses, of course,\" Church says. \"But there's a lot more possible than we first imagined.\"</p><p>Since the development of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/curing-cancer-designer-babies-supersoldiers-how-will-gene-editing-change-us-20210511-p57qqt.html\">better gene-editing tools such as CRISPR</url> (which borrows the precision of ancient bacteria immune systems to find and edit specific genes), Archer says museum collections, too, have become \"the flavour of the month\". \"Suddenly everyone wants to go in and sample shrivelled toes [for] the DNA.\"</p><p/><p>Scientists are even learning how to wind back the clock on a living animal's family tree, searching for dormant genes switched off over their evolution, such as a tail or bigger teeth, to help revive extinct ancestors, gene by gene. That's how the paleontologist who inspired Michael Crichton's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> in the first place, Jack Horner, is hoping to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-re-not-running-out-of-dinosaurs-why-is-there-a-boom-in-finding-fossils-20200217-p541j2.html\">build a dinosaur</url> from its decidedly less scaly descendant: the chicken. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction, after all.</p><p>\"Genes even older than [those of] the dinosaurs can be brought back, too,\" Church says. \"But it's limited. It's hard to reconstruct a [species'] entire genome that way. It's not like you have a 3D printer where you say, 'Print out this organism' because the rules are way more powerful than that. They're more mysterious. And the question is always, why do it?\"</p><p>Horner himself says he'd be looking to turn on only a few lost traits in his dino-chicken (\"the claws, teeth, arms, scales and the tail to keep the fourth-graders happy\"). Already, a beak has become a snout in chicken embryos. The tail has proven the most difficult but in recent months \"we've made headway understanding how [it] evolved from dinosaur to bird\". Even so, Horner's chickenosaurus wouldn't really be an extinct animal. \"It'd be a new kind of dinosaur-like bird,\" he says.</p><p>Church himself has viable DNA of his mammoth but will still need to pair it with the genome of its closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to try to bring it back (he sometimes calls the project the \"mammophant\").</p><p>Likewise, Ben Novak at the genetic rescue and de-extinction group Revive &amp; Restore has big plans to re-engineer and breed an extinct line of North American bird known as the passenger pigeon using existing flocks (he's even done some experiments on birds at the CSIRO's secure lab in Melbourne). And Archer plans to turn to the Tasmanian devil as a template to recreate the Tasmanian tiger, after the thylacine's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0417-y\">genome was at last sequenced</url> from DNA found in a specimen at the Melbourne Museum.</p><p>These animals, if they ever come blinking and growling to life in the lab, will be hybrids of the past and the present. But there is a way to bring back an \"100 per cent extinct animal\", Archer says, and that's cloning.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You can clone </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">extinct </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">animals?</emphasis></h><p>More than 20 years after Dolly the sheep became the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, the technique is yet to be perfected, but Archer says it's not quite the horror show people imagine. While the sci-fi nightmare of cloned humans never materialised, livestock can be cloned to preserve breeding lines, and celebrities and millionaires fork out upwards of $40,000 to clone beloved pets.</p><p>Some conservationists are also turning to the technique to stop inbreeding in dwindling wildlife populations. In late 2020, Novak teamed up with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to clone a critically endangered black-footed ferret from the frozen cells of a ferret who died in 1988. The clone, named <url normalizedValue=\"https://usfws.medium.com/the-curious-life-of-elizabeth-ann-618e8d828448\">Elizabeth Ann, is now a healthy six-month-old</url> who is fond of tearing apart paper bags, barking at anyone who invades her personal space, and has \"three times more genetic variation in her little body than any other [black-footed] ferret on the planet,\" Novak says.</p><p>Of course, to clone an animal, the cell you are using must still be intact - alive, in a sense. That makes cloning an extinct species almost impossible. But it has happened. In 2003, scientists in Spain cloned an extinct mountain goat known as the Pyrenean ibex from the frozen tissue of the last of its species, Celia.</p><p>To clone, you take the egg of a suitably similar host animal, say, a domestic goat, and suck out the DNA-packed nucleus within, replacing it with that of the animal in line for resurrection, in this case, Celia the ibex. Then you hit it with a Frankstein-esque jolt of electricity to fuse the egg and nucleus, and you implant that new egg in a surrogate mother (another goat). If all goes to plan, the DNA will tell the egg to grow an ibex instead. In this case, a baby ibex did arrive but she lived for just 10 minutes, born with a fatal lung defect scientists say can be typical of the species, clone or not.</p><p>The experiment was never tried again because by then the Spanish government had released goats into the mountains to replace the ibex, and so the team despaired they were too late. The ibex had lost its habitat. It had effectively gone extinct twice.</p><p>Archer hopes there will be a happier ending for the gastric-brooding frog, an extinct Australian species he's been working to clone since a colleague discovered some intact tissue cells \"miraculously still tucked away at the back of an old university freezer\". This frog first caught the eye of medical researchers for its bizarre ability to turn its stomach into a womb and vomit up its babies. \"Nothing else in nature can do that,\" Archer says. But before it could be studied, in the mid-1980s, it vanished. Then in 2013, Archer's team had a breakthrough. The extinct frog's DNA began to replicate when it was implanted in donor frog eggs. Under the microscope, the team watched the embryos start to develop with growing excitement.</p><p>\"But suddenly it just stopped,\" Archer says. The team believes the problem lies not with the DNA, but with their technique for cloning amphibians. \"We hit the same wall when we tried a living frog's DNA. We just need to get one [species] back, one of these [de-extinction] projects over the line, and people will see we're not making monsters.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does bringing back a mammoth have to do with climate change?</emphasis></h><p>OK, so <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park</emphasis> probably won't happen but what about a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pleistocene Park</emphasis> for the king of that Ice Age, the woolly mammoth? These towering herbivores were hunted to extinction by early humans some 10,000 years ago, the very last of them surviving on Arctic islands until 4000 years ago. But the mammoth is still the closest genetic relative to the now endangered Asian elephant. \"Even closer than the African elephant,\" Church says.</p><p>He believes resurrecting the mammoth's ancient genes could stop the Asian elephant from following it into extinction. Splicing in traits that helped the mammoth thrive in the Arctic could open up crucial new habitat, as land-clearing and poaching closer to the equator increasingly whittle down their numbers. Endangered species are already relocated, with varying success, by conservationists, and their genes managed via breeding programs to protect diversity. </p><p/><p>Church estimates that editing in about 40 to 100 mammoth genes, chiefly around cold resistance, will be enough to allow Asian elephants to thrive up north. Separate projects have edited about that number in pigs, for different traits, and Church says they are now breeding whole generations of healthy, engineered animals.</p><p>In the case of his mammophant, the team would grow the animal in an artificial womb to avoid any risk to the endangered elephant they would otherwise have to use as a surrogate. That means there's an extra hurdle to scale - growing a mammal artificially, all the way from fertilisation to birth, hasn't been done before. Church expects to crack the problem in about five years, in mice first, which have a faster gestation period than elephants (20 days versus 22 months). \"Then it'll probably take another five to adapt it to larger animals and then we can see how it scales up for the mammoth.\"</p><p>If it works, he already has a place to put the herd. Since the '90s, a group of Russian scientists has been transforming a huge swathe of land in Siberia back to the grasslands that mammoths and other large animals once roamed. It really is called Pleistocene Park and, with the mammoth's help, some think it could actually slow climate change. Grasslands can absorb more carbon than forests, and mammoths rip down trees and create this tundra as they go. But, more importantly, their heavy feet also trample snow cover, stopping it from acting as insulation and so allowing the permafrost to be chilled by the icy Arctic winds. In theory, Church says this should help slow its thaw, which eventually threatens to release <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00659-y\">more carbon and methane than the atmosphere holds today</url>.</p><p>But Ritchie questions why you would bring back a mammoth, a creature of the Ice Age, to a rapidly warming world? \"You're not going to have herds of thousands of mammoths in time to have a real impact on the permafrost, given how fast it's melting now with climate change,\" he says. \"You'll just end up with an elephant that can't handle the heat, and probably, a freak show. We have to think very carefully about how the world is going to be when we consider what to bring back.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happens when we put an extinct animal back in the wild?</emphasis></h><p>There's not much point resurrecting a species if it will face the same threat of extinction soon after, like the Pyrenean ibex muscled out of its mountains. And de-extinction proponents stress that animals should fill an empty ecological niche too. When wolves were hunted out of Yellowstone National Park in the United States, elk numbers exploded. With no predator to keep them in check, they tore up the grasses and rivers. Suddenly, the beavers had vanished too. \"And when they brought the wolves back, 70 years later, the ecosystem was restored,\" Church says.</p><p>Of course, for this more classical \"rewilding\" to work with a resurrected animal, it needs to act the way its ancestor did. But not everything is encoded in genes. How will an engineered mammophant, for example, learn to migrate across the Arctic tundra as mammoths once did if there's no parent to show it the way? And what if cutting and pasting together species' genomes, in this case of elephant and mammoth or thylacine and Tasmanian devil, interferes with other natural instincts?</p><p>These are problems Archer ponders a lot. \"You could even have two sets of instructions [in the DNA] that are contradictory,\" he says. \"But don't forget that the mammoth is a kind of specialised elephant, so most of the genome is already the same. Tasmanian devils, too, are close enough to thylacines, even though they're smaller.\" For his part, he believes \"we'll have 99 per cent original behaviours in resurrected species\". Most behaviour really is gene-deep in animals, he says, even the strange case of the gastric-brooding frog swallowing its fertilised eggs. \"No frog teaches another frog to do anything, they're on their own from the moment they're a tadpole.\"</p><p>In the case of a resurrected thylacine, there won't be much to compare it to. There are few records of how the marsupial lived, so some ecologists warn not enough is known to bring it back safely. Archer is quick to point out that the thylacine vanished from Tasmania only 90 years ago, and from the mainland at the same time as the devil (which is itself being considered for reintroduction over the Bass Strait) some 3200 years ago. \"We know what it's going to do. It's going to become the king of beasts [in Australia] again.\"</p><p>But consider the case of the passenger pigeon that Novak hopes to bring back to North America. One hundred and fifty years ago, they were the most abundant bird on the planet. And, though they numbered as many as six billion, Novak says there were only three or four flocks flying the world at any one time. When they moved from forest to forest, they came in like a hurricane or a forest fire, breaking branches, destroying canopies and forcing those woods into regeneration cycles.</p><p>\"No other birds do this,\" Novak says. \"They were ecosystem engineers. Some of the restoration we thought fire did to the landscape we've now shown the birds did.\" Novak argues the forest needs them back. He and his team have sequenced the pigeon's genome and compared it to its closest living relative, the bandtailed pigeon. Of the 25-million-odd genes where they differed, Novak has identified about 30 that could be particularly significant in making a pigeon behave like a passenger pigeon, such as disease resistance and, potentially, extra-social behaviour.</p><p>So here's his plan: Novak imagines a carefully controlled release, first on a netted reserve with nesting baskets packed into dense trees, encouraging the birds to breed in colonies and, to fool them into thinking they are already part of a much bigger flock, with speakers blasting pigeon calls and coos. If the birds gang up as planned, they would be fitted with GPS trackers and set free, by the thousand or so.</p><p/><p>With enough funding, which Novak ballparks at about $US25 million, he thinks he could create a live passenger pigeon in the lab within seven years using CRISPR. Parallel work focused on breeding shows it would only take a few more years to build up a healthy sustainable population of 10,000 birds or so. That won't be enough to make a dent in forests the way the sky-darkening flocks of the last century did. Still, Novak says, it's a start. </p><p>But does that mean that monster pigeon swarms will start descending on cities like New York? Historically, Novak says, the birds stayed clear of urban centres as there was not enough food. \"The bigger their flocks get, the more they will stay remote, near tree cover.\" And, if things do get out of hand, he says we already know what to do: it was just a few decades of hunting that wiped out those billions of birds in the first place.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What if we crash the ecosystems we're trying to save? </emphasis></h><p>But suppose passenger pigeon flocks really are too much for American forests already scarred by record wildfires. Or that bizarre little frog becomes the next cane toad. Some have even wondered whether ancient viruses, entangled in the DNA of long-dead species, could be reawakened (cue the buzzing mammoth carcass in the TV sci-fi thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fortitude</emphasis>).</p><p>Archer, who himself was the first ecologist to <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/everyone-agreed-cane-toads-would-be-a-winner-for-australia-19881\">sound the alarm on the danger of cane toads in Australia</url>, says the <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/how-mountain-pygmy-possum-can-be-saved-climate-change\">fossil record can offer important clues</url> as to how an ecosystem will fare with a reintroduced species. When he ventured into the Tasmanian bush with one of the last people to see thylacines in the wild, he found their habitat was broadly unchanged since the 1930s. Peter Ward, in his 90s on the hike, had trapped and hunted the tigers as a boy with his father and brother, back when there was a bounty on the marsupials' head (due to now-debunked fears that thylacines were eating livestock). At the end of the track, Ward's family hut was still there, just as he'd left it, tins of food still on the shelf. \"Tears came into his eyes,\" Archer says. \"He even remembered what they sounded like. He said they'd make this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">yip yip yip </emphasis>sound as they circled the hut at night. The forest hasn't moved on.\"</p><p>Novak says ecosystems are not a house of cards. \"When they have the right pillars - our keystone species like predators and pollinators and herds - then they're more like a tower that an earthquake wobbles, but it doesn't collapse.\"</p><p>Besides, Church adds, the larger the animal, the easier a reintroduction is to reverse. Just as feral goats were removed from the Galapagos Islands, rounding up wayward mammoths wouldn't be impossible.</p><p>But while thylacines could help with Australia's feral cat problem, as dingoes do on the mainland, Archer says it's not quite a wolves-in-Yellowstone situation. \"They're not going to be chasing the big animals.\" In Tasmania, where there are no dingoes, thylacines would be competing for smaller prey with the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, it might put pressure on the quoll too. These are both endangered species themselves, and so the thylacine's impact would have to be closely monitored, Archer says, released as a trial in fenced areas first.</p><p>\"But 99 per cent of the time, with some careful planning, what happens is what you intend. This is the part of conservation we already know how to do well.\"</p><p/><p>Indeed, for all the focus on worst-case scenarios, Novak says he could only find one instance of a conservation reintroduction backfiring, after a<url normalizedValue=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.394\">nalysing more than a century of US \"rewildings\"</url>: when moving some endangered water birds into a wetland in 1988 caused others in the area to die off.</p><p>In America, regulators have now green-lit the world's first release of a de-extinct species: a chestnut tree. Once the most abundant on the continent, the towering tree has been genetically engineered to survive the imported fungus that wiped it out eight decades ago. Some Native American tribes have even agreed to replant it on native land. Regulating the chestnut's return was no easy task and Novak hopes it will now be a guiding light for future de-extinctions, though he admits \"mammoths and pigeons are a whole different ball game to trees\".</p><p>But, just as gene-editing can bring back life, it can also end it. Gene drives hold awesome power to accelerate evolution and take out feral populations by spreading edits that disadvantage or kill a pest species quickly. Scientists have even proposed such an approach to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/environment/conservation/scientists-want-to-alter-rodent-genes-to-prevent-mice-plagues-20210521-p57tvx.html\">tackle the mouse plague gripping Australia's east</url>. Novak says gene drives must be used carefully, but \"sometimes the risk of doing nothing, whether that's gene drives or de-extinction ... is actually a lot worse\".</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will de-extinction help conservation? Or are we playing God?</emphasis></h><p>For scientists eyeing de-extinction projects, there are a lot of vacancies out in the wild in need of filling. Novak says the technologies being developed will benefit existing endangered species too as their gene pools narrow, from the black-footed ferret to the northern white rhino, pictured below. \"The passenger pigeons and the mammoths, they're our moon shots,\" he says. \"This is never going to replace traditional conservation.\"</p><p>But others worry that critical funding will be taken away from on-the-ground recovery efforts and shunted into pie-in-the-sky de-extinction projects. Australia has some of the world's highest extinction rates but spends a tenth of what the US does on conservation efforts. De-extinction, if proven to work, will still carry a higher price tag than traditional conservation. At this late hour, Ritchie says, funnelling more funding into proven methods is a safer bet.</p><p>Novak understands the concern but says funding for de-extinction projects so far generally comes from sources not already investing in conservation, such as big tech. \"We've tried hard [at Revive &amp; Restore] to get money from new places like biotech companies, even Facebook.\" Since the not-for-profit was founded by conservationist Stewart Brand in 2012, Novak says about 90 per cent of the funding it's raised has been spent on genetic rescue, such as their work with ferrets, not de-extinction. With the birth of Elizabeth Ann, he says those projects are advancing enough that they might begin to compete with traditional conservation. \"But in conservation, we always fight for funding to re-introduce this species or that one. It's always triage.\"</p><p>Archer, who says money for his own frog project comes primarily from people interested in the technology rather than the frog, stresses that forcing a choice between de-extinction and conservation will crush innovation. In Australia, where life has evolved over the past 50 million years cut off from the other continents, he says the case for de-extinction is especially strong. \"We have this added responsibility because our animals just don't exist anywhere else. We're a whole distinct branch of the global genome.\"</p><p>Ritchie recalls the story of an Australian naturalist who took a taxidermied northern quoll into parts of the Northern Territory where it had vanished. \"A local Aboriginal woman just held it, crying, when she saw it again. It was one of her totemic species, and that pain, that loss, was still so strong.\"</p><p>Archer and Church say de-extinction could help end the doom and gloom of conservation, turning it around from an unwinnable war into something that could capture the public's attention (and perhaps real funding). But will the path there be littered with ghastly mistakes, animals trapped in awful lives because of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/curing-cancer-designer-babies-supersoldiers-how-will-gene-editing-change-us-20210511-p57qqt.html\">editing blunders</url></p><p>\"Genetic power's the most awesome force the world has ever seen but you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun,\" Jeff Goldblum's character Dr Ian Malcolm warns in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurassic Park.</emphasis></p><p>\"How can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?\" counters the park's creator John Hammond, played by Richard Attenborough.</p><p>Like Benjamin the thylacine, many of the species we have lost in the past century or two also died of the cold - of our indifference, our cruelty, our thoughtlessness.

But why can't someone wet a line for a couple of hours by themselves? at a local spot?\" Liberal Democrat MPs Tim Quilty and David Limbrick also want a review of the ban, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:shannon.deery@news.com.au\">shannon.deery@news.com.au</email> EDITORIAL, PAGE 26</p><p>OUTDOOR PURSUITS YES Walking Jogging Running Yoga (at home) NO Golf Fishing Spear fishing Footy Soccer Cricket Netball Baseball Softball Lawn Bowls Basketball Touch Football Squash Boxing Surfing Cycling (in groups) IN DOUBT Swimming Horse Riding Mountain Biking Rock Climbing Billiards Archery Kayaking Tennis Table TennisSkiing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-d1d7427e748f11eaaf4953007c7a75bb7de9c5c51516bef30249d098bfe0587f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJY-7NR1-JD3N-50NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"486\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001614</classCode><className>SPORT FISHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X5D</classCode><className>FOOD SAFETY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOZB</classCode><className>SOCIAL DISTANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DST0</classCode><className>SPORTS TOURISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp;

By 5.20pm it was burning at emergency level, having crossed the Molonglo River to threaten residents in Beard and Oaks Estate.</p><p>The next morning a tree at the old Duntroon dairy farm blew on to power lines, ignited a second fire in the Pialligo area, which merged with the redwood forest fire to become the Beard fire. It was finally extinguished on Thursday evening this week, after eight days.</p><p>An ACT government spokesperson said the Canberra Region Beekeepers had \"self-reported that they were involved in the ignition of the fire whilst undertaking bee surveillance activities around the Canberra Airport\".</p><p>The beekeepers had worked closely and cooperated with the government and the Emergency Services Agency since the fire, and WorkSafe ACT was now investigating, the spokesperson said.</p><p>The hive is believed to be on Defence land although that remains unconfirmed. A Defence spokesperson said a hive was maintained near the airport as part of a national bee pest surveillance program administered by Plant Health Australia, the national plant biosecurity coordinator.</p><p>The hives are part of a network near airports and sea ports around the country that provide an early warning system of bee pests at entry points to Australia. Hives are tested every two months for pests including varroa mites, according to online material. The early warning system also includes \"catch boxes\" to attract any exotic bees that have made their way into the country.</p><p>The hives are maintained by hobby beekeepers.</p><p>The ACT government spokesperson said the government had minimal contact with the Canberra beekeepers who ran the program, other than collecting samples and organising the analysis. There was no contractual arrangement between the ACT government and the beekeepers, and no regulatory obligation for the ACT to be part of the national bee surveillance program.</p><p>Canberra Region Beekeepers president Dermot Asis Sha'Non said he had been asked to refer inquires to Plant Health Australia. Plant Health Australia referred inquires to the ACT Emergency Services Agency.</p><p>No one has provided background on the nature of the Canberra operation, nor the arrangements under which the Canberra beekeepers maintain the hive, nor the authority under which the hive operates in the forest. Nor has anyone specified the hive location.</p><p>The bees are believed to have died with the hive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7959g0i5sq114cnyfiqa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4K-1KJ1-JD34-V01D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"479\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Public criticism centred on the length of time taken to mobilise Commonwealth resources to help state emergency services.</p><p>Mr Morrison set a breakneck reporting deadline of August 31, arguing the inquiry must lead to \"practical action\" ahead of the next fire season, which in 2019 began in August in northern NSW.</p><p>Former NSW Fire and Rescue NSW Commissioner Greg Mullins and former interstate counterparts identified holes in federal disaster arrangements that the commissioners may be able to address in their recommendations.</p><p>Mr Mullins said the climate change enemy had \"gone nuclear\", which required a \"step change in how we coordinate the insufficient resources we have to deal with this threat\".</p><p>A \"huge gap in the natural disaster space\" opened up in 2018 when Emergency Management Australia was moved from the federal Attorney-General's office to the newly-created Home Affairs Department, Mr Mullins said. EMA co-ordinates national support for state emergency agencies.</p><p>The head of EMA \"no longer has direct access to the Prime Minister or the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet\", Mr Mullins said. \"There needs to be that instant access so that decisions can be fast and made at the top, and I don't see that now. I know particularly during the bushfires it was too slow and too late.\"</p><p>Former Victorian chief fire officer Gary Morgan said while EMA remained a \"good organisation\" it lacked crucial bushfire expertise, with about a dozen people advising the agency but only \"one forest fire person on that committee\".</p><p>Deficient bushfire input was \"probably about egos and people who have been appointed to roles as more in the managerial or in the non-forestry skills side\", he said. Mr Morgan is the current Institute of Foresters fire management committee chairman.</p><p>According to former ACT Emergency Services Commissioner Major General Peter Dunn, a current resident of Conjola on the NSW south coast, \"non-existent\" evacuation plans left people <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/i-just-feel-lost-rebuilding-after-a-firestorm-20200109-p53q36.html\">flinging themselves into Lake Conjola</url> as the Currowan fire bore down on the Conjola Park hamlet, where 89 homes and three lives were lost to the flames.</p><p>\"The evacuation was totally unplanned and it was chaotic and what I can say is that we were very, very lucky that there were not a lot more injuries, indeed deaths ... during that evacuation,\" Mr Dunn told the commission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520298043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6095-10G1-DY19-C2YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><timeReceived>05:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

There has been insufficient attention to proactive prevention of bushfires. This 2020 Royal Commission fails to deliver authoritative information on proven actions and promising improvements to prevent dangerous bushfires.</p><p>In the absence of a separate inquiry on proactive cost-effective bushfire mitigation, policy should be informed by the findings of the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission and other inquiries, where critical aspects of bushfire mitigation were dealt with professionally. </p><p>The VBRC was supported by expert panels and evidence from fire behaviour experts and focused reasonably well on the causal factors of bushfires and the critical success factors for effective bushfire mitigation - reduce fuel load, prepare firebreaks, ensure good fireground access, early detection, rapid initial attack, effective and unencumbered suppression.</p><p>Counsel Assisting's 'Draft Propositions' ignore substantive research and practical experience already available on fire mitigation, the best experts on proactive fire mitigation were not called to give evidence and their submissions have been largely ignored. </p><p>Council Assisting clearly needed better assistance.</p><p>The RC failed to learn valuable lessons from examining South West Western Australia as a case study in \"best practise\" and Victoria as a case study in \"worst practise\", and learn from the differences. </p><p>Victoria's disastrous bushfire outcomes could have been accurately predicted by the \"Sneeuwjagt curve\" which has been known for decades and shows that wildfire loss can be reduced by increasing the amount of low intensity prescribed burning. </p><p>There is a case for seeking funding specifically for skill formation in fire mitigation, based on adapting and applying what is already known.</p><p>If the success of Bushfire CRC's, particularly the BNHCRC, is judged on effectiveness, that is their ability to reduce destructive bushfires and loss of life, then the CRC's have been an unmitigated failure. </p><p>A less centralised model for the new CRC should be considered where the scientists are embedded within the land management and fire management agencies to ensure focus, relevance and uptake of research. </p><p>A research model like this helped deliver the successful WA \"best practise\" fire mitigation regimen.</p><p>An assessment of Victoria's forest fire management agency indicates systemic organisational issues, (like we have witnessed with the management of COVID-19 in Victoria), have contributed to the poor fire outcomes, including the four megafires in 2003, 2006-07, 2009 and 2019-20:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRONG</emphasis> fire mitigation strategy - insufficient proactive bushfire mitigation, over reliance on reactive disaster management, \"interface\" rather than more \"landscape\" fuel reduction;</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRONG</emphasis> organisational structure - Fire mitigation within a poorly focused conglomerate department, doomed to fail

I know particularly during the bushfires it was too slow and too late.\"</p><p>Former Victorian chief fire officer Gary Morgan said while EMA remained a \"good organisation\" it lacked crucial bushfire expertise, with about a dozen people advising the agency but only \"one forest fire person on that committee\".</p><p>Deficient bushfire input was \"probably about egos and people who have been appointed to roles as more in the managerial or in the non-forestry skills side\", he said. Mr Morgan is the current Institute of Foresters fire management committee chairman.</p><p>Former ACT Emergency Services commissioner Major General Peter Dunn, a current resident of Conjola on the NSW south coast, said \"non-existent\" evacuation plans left people flinging themselves into Lake Conjola as the Currowan fire bore down on the Conjola Park hamlet, where 89 homes and three lives were lost to the flames.</p><p>\"The evacuation was totally unplanned and it was chaotic and what I can say is that we were very, very lucky that there were not a lot more injuries, indeed deaths ... during that evacuation,\" Mr Dunn told the commission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7bbpysozbie1m3vvemp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6096-0PP1-F0J6-J2GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

The relationship between fire weather and site slope and aspect had long been established in terms of fire severity, but this study triangulated those with other factors including \"time since previous major disturbance\", which, in most cases, means time since logging.</p><p>Using data from 995,000 hectares of the 2019-20 Victorian bushfires, the study analysed wet, dry and lowland forest, old growth, late mature, previously burned and previously logged forest. They wanted to further determine the probability of crowns of trees being burned or scorched - an indicator of fire severity.</p><p>The \"best fitting model\" for crown burn and scorch was found to be a three-way complex interaction: fire weather, forest type and time since major disturbance.</p><p>And when it came to time since disturbance - or logging - a finding appeared to emerge. Fire severity peaked in forests aged 10 to 40 years.</p><p>\"Such elevated risks of high-severity fire in stands of relatively young forest are of key concern. This is because the nominal rotation age for logging is 80 years,\" the study reads.</p><p>\"Given relationships between fire severity and time since previous major disturbance for some forest types and under some fire weather conditions, we suggest that stands managed for timber production near settlements may be at increased risk of high fire severity.</p><p>\"This is because clearcut logging resets stand age to zero, after which there is a subsequent period of increased probability of high-severity fire, particularly under extreme fire weather conditions.\"</p><p>Forests younger than 10 years, and those progressively older than 40 - particularly old growth into the hundreds of years - were seen as presenting a significantly reduced fire severity risk.</p><p>While the study occurred in Victoria, Dr Lindenmayer believed there were relevant findings for Tasmania where there has been a comparative research gap.</p><p>Both states carry out logging in eucalyptus regnan forest - known as mountain ash in Victoria and swamp gum in Tasmania, common in the North-East and Styx Valley. One factor - long argued by environmental groups in Tasmania - is the even age at which regrowth occurs following harvesting which leaves sections of uniform forest in that 10 to 40-year-old window.</p><p>Dr Lindenmayer said Tasmania needed to properly investigate the risks, but had concerns about growing links between research bodies and the forestry sector that could stifle the independence of studies.</p><p>His latest study built upon similar research in this area by himself and other ecologists - the vast majority of which is heavily disputed by the forestry industry and various research bodies.</p><p>Their back-and-forth has continued in recent years.</p><p>In July, Professor Rod Keenan from the University of Melbourne co-authored another paper, published in Australian Forestry, rebutting Dr Lindenmayer's studies and public commentary on forestry activity.</p><p>This paper stated that wet eucalypt forest - similar to that found in Tasmanian logging areas - was only 3 per cent of the area burnt in the 2019-20 Victorian bushfires.</p><p>It cited a paper which disputed the relationship between past logging and fire severity, instead stating that topography and fire weather were the most dominant factors.</p><p>\"Analysis indicated an overwhelming dominance of broad spatial factors (mostly topographic), followed by fire weather (expressed as Forest Fire Danger Index), as the factors driving complete scorch or the consumption of forest canopies in natural and plantation forests,\" the paper reads.</p><p>\"The drivers of severe canopy damage were broadly the same across the three study regions. Recent harvest status, in combination with or separate from recent burning, was ranked low in importance as a driver of fire severity in each region.\"</p><p>A study of Victoria's 2003 alpine fires by Keenan's co-authors \"found no link between timber harvesting and bushfire extent or severity, with these fires driven almost entirely by weather conditions, slope, aspect, fuel levels, atmospheric stability and the scale of the fire\".</p><p>The Keenan paper went on to cite government inquiries after the bushfires, including an assertion that the timber industry provides increased firefighting capacity, and that the phasing out of native forestry could reduce this capacity.</p><p>The Australian Forest Products Association used the paper as conclusive evidence there was \"scientific consensus\" that logging was \"not to blame\" for the severity of the bushfires.</p><p>When asked about Dr Lindenmayer's latest co-authored study, Sustainable Timber Tasmania also pointed to the Keenan paper. STT did not respond to questions about how it factors in bushfire risk in post-harvest, regrowth forest.</p><p>In turn, Dr Lindenmayer was critical of these studies.</p><p>In Victoria, the case against native forest harvesting prompted the government to transition away from the practice by 2030.</p><p>But in Tasmania, STT maintains a legislated requirement to make 137,000 cubic metres of \"high quality eucalypt sawlogs and veneer logs\" available per year, although it routinely falls short of this target.</p><p>And the debate around logging and bushfire severity reached a flashpoint last year when forestry groups demanded an investigation into a research paper that found unlogged forests were less flammable than logged forests, focusing on a bushfire in the Huon Valley.</p><p>The paper had been retracted due to its use of incorrectly categorised geographic data from the Tasmanian Government.</p><p>The University of Tasmania complied with the industry's request for an investigation, but it ultimately cleared the two conservation scientists of research misconduct.</p><p>One of the two researchers, Dr Jennifer Sanger, said the entire episode was a demonstration of the power of forestry industry bodies.</p><p>\"Being subjected to a research misconduct investigation is serious. It's the kind of thing that destroys careers,\" she said. \"Scientists retract papers all the time, so we were concerned when the university listened to a lobby group.\"</p><p>She said Dr Lindenmayer's latest paper supported her findings.</p><p>\"A lot of the research that David Lindenmayer does is in wet eucalypt forests and we have the same forest types, so this is relevant,\" Dr Sanger said. \"Victoria is warmer and drier in certain parts, so it's a good example of what Tasmania could look like in 10 to 20 years time.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVOCE-doc7heqp97to066s9lglc6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVOCE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63J2-CTV1-JD34-V081-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386051</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advocate (Burnie)</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 6, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climatic disasters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Research</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forestry hunt</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

It burnt gently through grasslands and connected up with other fires lit on the forest floor to create a mosaic effect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This fire was lit by Dja Dja Wurrung people, including employees of Forest Fire Management Victoria, and their non-Aboriginal colleagues. It was the area's first cultural burn in 170 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a momentous day, says Trent Nelson, the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation chairperson.</p><p>In the years since cultural burning had been used, the landscape had become degraded and \"sick\". The region, which includes the towns of Daylesford, Bendigo and Boort, used to be cloaked in box-ironbark forests but is now one of the most profoundly altered landscapes in Victoria, where agriculture, settlement and mining have left ecosystems fragmented.</p><p>Nelson learnt cultural burning - known as djandak wii or \"country fire\" - from his father, who learnt from his father before him. \"We don't make it really, really hot, we burn cool. It's a lot slower than planned burns.\"</p><p>In the wake of last summer's catastrophic bushfires, there is heightened national interest in the role of Aboriginal cultural burning. What is it, and how does it work? And can it reduce the threat of fires in an era of climate change?</p><p>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this article contains names of people who have died.</p><p>What is cultural burning?</p><p>For at least 65,000 years, Aborigines have used cultural land-management practices - including fire - to care for country (the term used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to describe family origins, ownership and associations with particular areas).</p><p>Cultural burns are done by Indigenous custodians, or people given their guidance. The use of fire is specific to each location, its animals and flora and their cultural value.</p><p>There are many interconnected objectives, which include protecting cultural or natural assets by maintaining the health of surrounding country, ceremony, habitat protection and fuel reduction. But fuel reduction - targeted burning to reduce the amount or density of foliage - is often not the primary objective.</p><p>Indigenous land management was critical to preventing catastrophic bushfires, the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements was told in 2020, but Aboriginal voices had been ignored. \"Cultural land management is not an add-on or an enhancement, it's not a practice that can simply be grafted onto the regime of non-Indigenous land managers,\" Euahlayi man and Australian National University researcher Bhiamie Eckford-Williamson said.</p><p>He told the commission that short-term funding was a barrier to Aboriginal land management: \"It is not possible for groups to develop, to recruit, train and retain staff to maintain that corporate memory, to build relationships with non-Indigenous land-management agencies over time, if their funding is not secure.\"</p><p>Most Australian wildfires occur in the northern tropical savanna, and most cultural burning also occurs in northern Australia.</p><p>In Western Australia, for example, the Great Western Woodlands, 16 million hectares of temperate woodland, heathland and mallee, are cared for in part by the Ngadju Nation and the Ngadju Rangers Group. The Ngadju undertake cultural burns at a certain time - when the grass is green or when rain is coming. In the warmer seasons, the fire must be started in the morning before the sea breezes rise.</p><p>In early colonial artwork, letters and journals, there is considerable evidence of Aboriginal use of fire. In 1836, naturalist Charles Darwin visited Sydney and commented on the sparsity of the trees and the prevalence of grasslands, much of which is now thick scrub: \"The extreme uniformity in the character of the Vegetation, is the most remarkable feature in the landscape of the greater part of New</p><p>S. Wales. Everywhere we have open woodland, the ground being partially covered with a most thin pasture.\"</p><p>The use of \"prescribed\" or \"hazard-reduction burning\" is the process of applying fire to a predetermined area to achieve a desired outcome - usually the mitigation of bushfires.</p><p>While there are some crossovers between the two practices, cultural burning may also be used to clear important pathways or manage vegetation around significant sites. But where fire is a concern, it may be possible to use cultural burning where prescribed burning is unsafe - because of the warming climate, it is becoming challenging to find time when prescribed burns can be safely lit.</p><p>How does cultural burning work?</p><p>Most cultural burns use \"cool\" fires - smaller, low-intensity fires - which reduce the risk of extreme, high flames that can burn whole trees and forest canopies. Protecting the canopy is considered paramount in cultural burning because it holds many precious resources - insects, birds' nests, bats and shade. And canopy removal fundamentally alters the surrounding ecosystem - sunlight breaks through and dries out the soil.</p><p>Unlike hazard-reduction burns, where lines of fire can create walls of flame, cultural burning tends to use spot ignitions, creating a mosaic of fires and allowing wildlife to escape.</p><p>Oliver Costello, a Bundjalung man from the Northern Rivers region of NSW and chief executive of the Firesticks Alliance, gives the example of a burn near Guyra in NSW where Banbai rangers used cultural burning around an art site that contained a painting of an echidna, a Banbai totem.</p><p>The fire encouraged the growth of native grasses and reduced the density of vegetation so that echidnas could move around the area more easily. Rangers saw more evidence of echidnas after burning and more growth of a local endangered species, the black grevillea.</p><p>\"The country has a culture and we're a part of that culture. When you apply the right fire to that culture, you're maintaining your identity with country, maintaining the land,\" Costello says.</p><p>How do you learn cultural burning?Despite European colonisation and land theft, Aboriginal cultural lore and knowledge of burning practices remain across Australia. A revival is being led through initiatives such as the Firesticks Alliance, an Indigenous-led network that does training, on-ground cultural burning and scientific monitoring of its ecological effects.</p><p>Costello learnt from his stepfather, a senior Dalabon man from Arnhem Land. When his stepfather died, Costello realised how much knowledge had gone with him. It motivated Costello to go to university and focus on Indigenous knowledge systems.</p><p>\"In NSW land management, no one was using cultural burning methodology and protocols,\" he says.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Firesticks Alliance has organised fire workshops in Cape York with Dr Tommy George, a Kuku Thaypan elder. George and his brother, Dr George Musgrave, (now both deceased) were granted honorary doctorates for their knowledge of fire management and ecology. Workshops such as those held on the south coast of NSW and on Yorta Yorta country at Barmah on the Murray River draw participants from around the country.</p><p>Firesticks Alliance practitioners burn on private and public land, including in NSW national parks. Since the 2019-20 summer bushfires, the alliance has fielded a huge increase in inquiries from private landholders and public land-management agencies. One landowner in NSW credits cultural burning with saving structures on his remote property during the Gospers Mountain fire.</p><p>Is cultural burning effective?</p><p>There is a small but growing body of Western academic research on cultural burning and it chimes with what Aboriginal experts have always known. For example, scientists analysing data on fire-scarred land in northern Australia on behalf of the Nature Conservancy found that early dry-season cultural burning reduced the extent of destructive late-season fires by about 30 per cent compared with the four years before the burning program began.</p><p>In Victoria, there have been more than a dozen cultural burns on Dja Dja Wurrung country, and Trent Nelson says there has been healthy plant and grass regeneration, including kangaroo grass and yam daisy.</p><p>Cultural burning is being brought into Victoria's burning program in addition to \"fuel management\" done by Forest Fire Management Victoria. They will be conducted in areas nominated by traditional owners, who will lead the burns.</p><p>Can it help against climate-fuelled bushfires?</p><p>Aboriginal people were devastated to see the damage wrought by last summer's catastrophic bushfires, says Costello. \"We're really sad because people haven't been listening to us,\" he says. \"We have been saying this is going to happen: this country is really thick and it will burn.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has argued hazard-reduction burns are at least as important as cutting carbon emissions in Australia's fight against bushfires, although the Climate Council and federal opposition say this is a distraction from the government's lack of action on climate change.</p><p>Analysis from forest scientists at the University of Melbourne found hazard-reduction burns had little to no effect in slowing the severe fires that devastated more than 5 million hectares across NSW. It would be best used around assets to protect them in less intense fires, the research found.</p><p>Former Victorian emergency management commissioner Craig Lapsley describes cultural burning as a \"holistic land-management strategy\" and says last summer's bushfires showed that land-management agencies need to test new approaches.</p><p>Costello wants land-management agencies to support the Firesticks Alliance to develop a national mentoring program so there can be 100 skilled cultural fire practitioners nationwide. \"We are drawing on the oldest, living knowledge system around fire and it works for us,\" he says. \"But you also need to share some of the resources and power you have.\"</p><p>In the News and Over To You will return on January 16.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7dvn5dzi6ft11dg1dk5y</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61NB-KW61-F0J6-J3VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

It is 7am and I have to myself the streets of San Francisco, on which to re-enact the high-speed pursuit from the 1968 classic Bullitt, the greatest car chase in the history of cinema. In 10 minutes and 53 seconds Steve McQueen and stunt driver Bill Hickman delivered a paean to the engineering technology that, for better or worse, freed America. The Ford Mustang represented righteousness, while the Dodge Charger was a more powerful servant of evil. Both were gas-guzzling planet killers with an average fuel consumption of about 7km per litre and the carbon emissions of twin Chinese cities. The fact that I am chasing their ghosts in a hybrid that could outperform them is a sign the great American road trip is finally going green.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Until now the big hire companies have shunned electric and hybrid vehicles, limiting the low-emission options to their luxury ranges. When I was planning this trip there wasn't a green car of any colour available anywhere in California. The peer-to-peer car-sharing platform Turo had a Tesla, but it was in Alaska.</p><p>All that is about to change. In October Hertz announced it had placed a $5.7bn order for 100,000 Tesla Model 3s. It was a decision forced as much by climate concerns - it came a month after research by Yale University revealed 58 per cent of Americans were either alarmed or concerned - as it was by the need to meet the corporate social-responsibility goals of its big clients. Its competitors Avis and Enterprise have little choice but to follow suit, and with the first deliveries scheduled for this year, your next American road trip could be fully electric.</p><p>Will the infrastructure exist to support such low-carbon, clean-conscience travel, though? I am on a mission to find out, but on the day I arrive in San Francisco I still don't have a ride. Rental companies have sold their fleets to survive the pandemic and their lots are empty. As for an electric or hybrid, I am California dreaming, says the guy at -Enterprise.</p><p>Then comes news a hybrid is available. All I have to do is deliver it to the Los Angeles motor show, which is how I end up driving down SR-1, aka the Pacific Coast Highway, in a $378,600 factory-fresh Bentley Bentayga.</p><p>America's, and arguably the world's, most scenic drive, the highway runs for 726km from San Francisco to Los Angeles. If you're a purist, sticking to the ocean all the way, it's a little longer and a little weirder. It starts in a neighbourly way in Santa Cruz County, with pick-ups full of bearded fishermen and barefoot children with surfboards. It gets twisted and dramatic at Big Sur, then rolls through market gardens and ranchland to the slow-mo freeways of LA.</p><p>Charging points, some paid and others free, seem more numerous than Starbucks branches, with 350 and counting on SR-1, according to the lobby group Plug In America. Bear in mind that in 1920, when Ford sold 1.4 million cars, there were 15,000 petrol stations in the US. By 1930 there were more than 100,000. America catches up fast.</p><p>Range anxiety soothed, I fire up Boys of Summer and sit back to enjoy a drive that feels like a sun-bleached, salt-crusted dream. The road soars above beach after surf-battered beach, creeping coyly beneath the stumbling Santa Lucia Mountains, vaulting steep canyons and snaking gleefully across the vast, flat farmlands where workers from Central America labour like Steinbeck's Joad family.</p><p>Work on the highway began in earnest in 1919, when convicts from San Quentin and Folsom were pressed into construction crews, earning a few cents a day to scrape, hack, dig and blast a road along the coast in defiance of climate, topography and geology.</p><p>It was declared complete in 1937. Some 85 years later it's a potholed, crumbling, two-lane anachronism, a souvenir of an era in which America thought it could build anything it wanted anywhere it damn well liked - including the boundary of two tectonic plates - with only determination, dynamite and cheap labour. That arrogance and ambition, at its apogee at the Bixby Creek Bridge, somehow enhances the astonishing beauty of the coastline. This thin white line, as insignificant and fragile as a lost ribbon, provides a human reference point in a mighty wilderness.</p><p>It's a wilderness you must explore. More than 400,000ha of land are protected here, and 2200sq km of ocean lie within marine conservation areas. Humpback whales can be seen from the road from April to December. Grey whales head north in the autumn and south in the spring. Sea otters play in the kelp forests off remote beaches, and in Monterey, where you should stay at the waterfront Portola Hotel and Spa, you'll be kept awake by the sound of a thousand sea lions.</p><p>There are hundreds of kilometres of well-maintained trails, ranging from short strolls through redwood cathedrals to spectacular slogs such as the Cone Peak Trail, a 34km round trip that hikes high above the Pacific to the 1571m summit of America's highest coastal mountain. And there are, by my count, 134 beaches, ranging from primordial Pfeiffer, with its tree-trunk driftwood, to the fishing camps at Half Moon Bay, and from the wild country surf at Sand Dollar to San Simeon, where two-tonne, 5m-long elephant seals have colonised the sands.</p><p>The few towns you'll encounter haven't got a hope against such outstanding natural beauty, but at least they know. Santa Cruz beats Monterey; Carmel-by-the-Sea is unspeakably twee; Santa Barbara is shopping, surfing and - especially in the seaside suburb of Montecito - ladies lunching.</p><p>A spot worth a night or two is Avila Beach in San Luis Obispo County. It lies at the foot of the oak-shaded See Canyon, where winding lanes lead to vineyards specialising in oaky pinot noirs and crisp chardonnays. They make cider there too, while down at the shore it's so purely small-town, surf-bum SloCal that it looks like the setting for a David Lynch movie, in a good way. Stay at the hacienda-style Avila La Fonda, just back from the pier. From here you have a choice of routes. With the pretty stuff behind them, most tourists pick up the 101 just before Pismo Beach and chase it all the way to Hollywood. It's more interesting, though, to stick with SR-1, because this is where the weirdness begins. You'll drive through fruit-picking towns such as Guadalupe, where there are strawberry fields for ever; past Vandenberg air base - headquarters of Space Force - and Oxnard, home of the superb Mullin Automotive Museum, where, with all due respect to Bentley, the exquisite 1937 Talbot-Lago T150 proves they don't design cars like they used to.</p><p>The last stretch, through Ventura County, is the spookiest, especially when the fog is rolling in. The road crawls like a guilty dog along the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, a few metres above the Pacific shore, and for a few, lonely kilometres it feels as though you're on the ledge at the edge of the world: America on the left, emptiness on the right. Then you roll into LA, and you wonder if anyone ever truly believed that a city of 7.6 million fossil-fuelled vehicles could not have a catastrophic effect on the environment.</p><p>The LA sky looks like the ceiling of a 1970s backstreet boozer; its air quality the second worst in America; and the freedom-giving engineering technology that the Pacific Coast Highway was built to serve is now an agent of its doom, its emissions causing the climate change that is tearing the road apart. Rising temperatures in California have increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. In 2021 about 8835 wildfires burnt more than a million hectares of the state. They left scars, weakening slopes and making it easier for heavy rains to trigger landslides. In 2017, two such slides closed the highway for 14 months.</p><p>In January 2021 it was closed, this time for three months, after mud and rock punched 45m of road into the sea. In December rock falls closed the road in Santa Monica County and as I write in late January 2022, the highway is closed again because of what meteorologists have called a \"surreal\" winter forest fire north of Bixby Creek.</p><p>Gary Griggs, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at University of California Santa Cruz, wonders how long America's most scenic highway can survive this onslaught. \"Projections for the future include hotter, drier summers with more frequent wildfires, more concentrated winter rainfall and more frequent landslides,\" he says. \"We may reach the point when SR-1 will not be economically feasible to repair.\" So if you want to drive the PCH, ask your tour operator to let you do it in an electric car. And come sooner rather than later, because America's most beautiful road won't be here forever.</p><p>Chris Haslam was a guest of Visit California and Cox &amp; Kings. visitcalifornia.com THE TIMES</p><p>IN THE KNOW Cox &amp; Kings has a 16-night self-drive Classic California tour from San Diego to San Francisco that includes Napa Valley, Death Valley and Yosemite National Park.

It\u2019s 35 degrees in Athens and even for a self-confessed heat lover, it\u2019s starting to feel a little uncomfortable.\u00a0  But it\u2019s not her personal discomfort that most concerns Myrivili, Athens\u2019 chief heat officer and the first-- and so far only -- person to hold such a job in Europe. Memories of the forest fires that licked around the edges of the city just weeks after she took up her new post last summer are fresh in her mind -- she describes the scenes then as \u201cdystopian\u201d -- and she is worried about a recurrence. This, more than the sweltering muggy air, is what\u2019s keeping her up at night.  \u201cI\u2019m scared of a long heatwave, a long dry spell with very high temperatures because that ignites the fires much easier and it also creates problems for my city that have to do with economics. If we keep having these heatwaves in July and August, how is that going to affect the main source of income and wealth, which is tourism?\u201d she tells me.  \u201cI\u2019m worried about what the rising heat means for poor people who cannot afford cooling; what it means for the trees that are either burning or not able to establish themselves; what it means for biodiversity in general and how we are weakening our capacity to have a healthier environment and city to live in.\u201d  Athens, one of the world\u2019s oldest named cities with a recorded history stretching back around 3400 years, is today a poster child for the effects of climate change in an urban area. One of Europe\u2019s most densely populated cities, with nearly 4 million inhabitants, it is becoming too hot, too dry and, for some people, too dangerous during the summer. And it has few financial resources to help it cope after the economic crisis that followed the 2008 global crash and the pandemic.\u00a0  Last summer, during Greece\u2019s worst heatwave in 30 years, wildfires destroyed around 300,000 acres of forest and bushland. Apocalyptic images of orange skies, burning villages and people taking shelter on beaches as flames crept closer to horrified Europeans. The prime minister called it the \u201cgreatest ecological disaster in decades\u201d.  And probably not a one-off. Already, Romanian and Bulgarian firefighters have arrived in Greece as part of a 200-strong European force to provide backup in case of a repeat. And the deadly fire season has already started -- in June, a blaze on Greece\u2019s second-largest island, Evia, raged out of control and a village was evacuated while a fire also broke out in the Schisto Korydallou suburb of Athens in June.\u00a0  Myrivili\u2019s job -- funded by the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Resilience Center of the Atlantic Council, a United States-based think tank, and supported by Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance (EHRA) -- is to help Athens and its people adapt to the extreme weather caused by temperatures that now regularly exceed 40 degrees during the summer months. She is also supposed to spread her expertise to other European cities -- because Greece is not alone.\u00a0  This summer, Italy is experiencing its worst drought in 70 years, with fears of serious shortages of water for drinking and irrigation in the north of the country. Levels in the river Po have sunk so low that decades-old shipwrecks are resurfacing. In a dramatic demonstration of what higher temperatures mean, a huge chunk of ice snapped off a glacier on the Marmolada peak in the Dolomites in early July, triggering an avalanche that killed at least 11 people.  Portugal declared an eight-day state of emergency in early July, with temperatures predicted to rise as high as 43 degrees, causing a heightened risk of wildfires. Days later thousands of firefighters and dozens of aircraft were locked in a battle against 125 fires burning across the country. Spain, France, Romania and others are also suffering drought conditions and fires as Europe struggles to adapt to a new climate reality.\u00a0  While the earth\u2019s surface was nearly 1.2 degreese warmer than pre-industrial levels last year, Europe\u2019s temperature rise was more than 2 degrees, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). A new continent-wide record was set in Sicily last year when temperatures hit 48.8 degrees. <url normalizedValue=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/peseta-projects/jrc-peseta-iv/human-mortality-extreme-heat-and-cold_en\">A study for the EU</url>\u00a0found that even if global warming is capped at 1.5 degrees -- which is unlikely given current commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions -- hot weather is projected to kill about 30,000 Europeans a year, compared to around 3000 today. If temperatures rise by 3 degrees that would be 90,000 deaths from extreme heat per year by 2100.  And that\u2019s without looking at extreme weather in the form of floods, like those that killed hundreds of people in Germany and Belgium last summer.  Myrivili, who served as Athens\u2019 deputy mayor for urban nature and climate resilience from 2014-2019, grew up in Athens but says the heat is different now and lasts for longer -- that\u2019s true across the world too as heatwaves start earlier, last longer and are more severe.\u00a0  \u201cI\u2019m very worried about what the next few decades will be like,\u201d says Myrivili. \u201cI like heat but I find it kind of unbearable when the heat falls over the city and it\u2019s really oppressive, a very oppressive state of being.\u201d\u00a0  Cities are warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe, partly because of the heat-trapping materials found in these urban heat islands, so called because they magnify heat impacts compared to the countryside where there is more vegetation.  \u201cGlass, cement, concrete, steel: all of these attract heat and they store it and usually they radiate it in the night, which is the dangerous part because that\u2019s when the body needs to rest and to lower its temperature, and if it is not able to do that it can be really dangerous,\u201d Myrivili says. The most vulnerable include older people and young children -- who have more difficulty regulating their body temperature -- as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, the disabled and those who must work in hot conditions. Extreme temperatures can also mean water and power shortages, crop failures and more accidents at work due to people sleeping badly.\u00a0  And then, of course, there are the fires. According to a recent paper by Dr. Matthew Jones of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia, the fire season in the European Mediterranean has been increasing in length and intensity -- in 1979, the Mediterranean fire season was 23 days long on average. By 2019, this had more than doubled to 52 days in the year.\u00a0  Climate change \u201cis loading the dice in favour of more extreme fires\u201d across the region, said Jones. The European Forest Fire Information System found that in 16 of 21 countries for which it has available data, the number of fires experienced this year is already in excess of the annual average. For instance, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia have all already recorded more than 20 times the average number of fires, while in Romania, the yearly average has already been exceeded 15 times, with 734 fires and counting.\u00a0  Although there has been a downward trend in burnt areas globally, \u201cthere\u2019s no guarantee that the situation will stay the same\u201d, says Jones. \u201cRather, the impacts of climate change could be felt more strongly in future as we see more substantial shifts to fire weather extremes\u201d.\u00a0  For Myrivili, it all starts with heat. She divides her job into three parts -- she needs to raise awareness, prepare people and the city for higher temperatures, and also work on redesign. She has already presided over the creation of a categorisation system for heatwaves to allow cities to be better prepared. The system, which attempts to impose a kind of order on a phenomenon long viewed as idiosyncratic, was drawn up by scientists in the Arsht-Rockefeller Resilience Center and is also being used in Spain\u2019s Seville and four cities in the United States.\u00a0  The scientists used data on temperatures, atmospheric pressure, mortality, humidity and other parameters to create an algorithm allowing them to categorise heatwaves -- as a one, two or three. The categorisation is part of a series of policies designed to help people prepare more effectively for the increasingly common heatwaves.\u00a0  \u201cWe have put in an early warning system where we have different messaging, especially for the most vulnerable populations,\u201d Myrivili says. \u201cWe have also created a hotline where people can find what to do and we\u2019ve been working very closely with the International Federation of the Red Cross.\u201d  Myrivili\u2019s team has also developed an app that allows users to assess their personalised risk from heat, based on geographical location, health data, age, gender and other characteristics. It also features a map to show the nearest cool space and a function to show the coolest routes from point A to point B. Milan and Rotterdam are also using similar apps.\u00a0  Collaboration with other cities is part of Myrivili\u2019s job and she has counterparts in Miami in Florida, Freetown in Sierra Leone, Santiago in Chile, Monterrey in Mexico and Melbourne in Australia. She has also collaborated with officials from New York and the Australian Red Cross on training.\u00a0  \u201cIt\u2019s good to have chief heat officers because they can advocate and bring together the different aspects of the city to create a more resilient environment \u2026 because as someone said recently, we can\u2019t air-condition our way out of this problem,\u201d she said.\u00a0  To slow global warming, greenhouse gases must be cut and particularly in cities, which are responsible for 70% of these gases worldwide. The challenge is to do this while adapting to the already rising temperatures and redesigning urban areas to have more porous surfaces, more nature, more water. This is a particular challenge in built-up, densely populated Athens.\u00a0  \u201cIt has tonnes of cement and asphalt and the green areas are very unequally distributed,\u201d Myrivili says. \u201cWe have already mapped out where the hottest neighbourhoods are and we need to make radical changes there. Another problem is that most of the public spaces have been dedicated to cars, either moving or parked, and this is something that really has to shift, because we have to get cars out of Athens.\u201d  The issue of social equity is also important to Myrvili, who notes that poorer people will not be able to afford to turn their air conditioning on, even if they have it, as fuel and electricity prices continue to spike because of the war in Ukraine. And then one gets sucked into the vicious circle of more air conditioning globally creating more emissions, and therefore higher temperatures.\u00a0  \u201cWe are expecting an enormous rise in the number of air conditioners in the next decades and I\u2019m worried that when we talk about specific targets for mitigation of emissions we\u2019re not really thinking about the demand for energy and how much it\u2019s going to spike because of rising demand for air conditioning,\u201d she says,\u00a0  \u201cWe have to quickly think up innovative ways to sustainably cool cities \u2026 this is why it\u2019s a race and it\u2019s not easy but already cities are starting to move that way so we are not at point zero. Already we see a lot of cities that are using nature-based solutions, and green and blue infrastructure, and creating cooler corridors that move air around and use water more \u2026 cities are starting but it\u2019s the beginning and we have to move faster and create more radical experiments of how to bring nature into cities, like moving away from tree lines and tree-lined streets and (instead) digging out streets and creating real forests with soil that is able to support the biodiversity we need in the soil.\u201d\u00a0  This kind of radical change, though, requires sustained public pressure and while the concern is there, it is not yet translating into concrete action. Myrivili cites a recent survey carried out in Athens that showed 63% of those surveyed were worried that extreme heat was going to negatively affect their welfare and personal lives. And while there have been positive changes -- a ministry of climate crisis and civil protection was created as a result of last summer\u2019s fires -- she says people must start demanding more.\u00a0  \u201cPeople are very conscious of [the danger] but they don\u2019t translate that yet into a demand towards the politicians. I don\u2019t hear people saying \u2018you guys have to do something about this because we are dying here, we are losing our jobs\u2019. So politicians don\u2019t feel the need to address these things because they don\u2019t get a sense from the people that this is something they will appreciate.\u201d  All these issues can seem overwhelming, Myrivili admits, but she cannot indulge in fatalism.\u00a0  \u201cGenerally I\u2019m an optimist; I\u2019ll take any small incremental change and I\u2019ll push for more urgent and dramatic ones but I don\u2019t think we can just say this is too big for us to deal with. We have to chip, chip away at it ... if that\u2019s all we can do for now, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do \u2026 we don\u2019t have the luxury to stop and be overwhelmed by the problem.\u201d  Because Athens will have to change. Radically. And it\u2019s not the only city facing a full-scale reimagining for a hotter world.\u00a0  \u201cWe need a whole new paradigm of design for our cities. And it shouldn\u2019t be architects or urban planners leading this but landscape architects \u2026 this whole thing is about how we can make cities that are more fun and delightful to be in so there\u2019s a positive aspect \u2026 everything we can do to make cities less hot is perfectly linked to how we make cities more fun and more delightful to live in.\u201d\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Additional reporting was provided by Alex McDonald</emphasis>. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YF-GNW1-JD6R-T548-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2291\"/><timeReceived>10:37:04 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 18, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

We've invested effort in educating people we've come across in the forest, and some discretion in the issuing of fines.</p><p>\"Having said that, we treat firewood theft very seriously, and have secured a number of prosecutions each year, and there is anecdotal evidence of wood being taken from parks.\"</p><p>With demand for wood in the coups growing rapidly, Mr English said staff within the government departments are continually assessing how future needs may have an impact on supply, and on the environment.</p><p>\"Basically despite our work on age and distribution of trees, some of coups do run out of supply before the season ends; and there is a question about sustainability there, with increasing population and increasing demand,\" he said.</p><p>LISTEN: Don't miss The Courier's first podcast, 'Off The Record'. Episode one reflects on the tragic death of beloved footballer Lachie Poulter, speaking to those closest to him</p><p>\"We need to do more work on that. We need the community to buy into that, because the illegal taking of wood is impacting on everyone's capacity to take wood legally, because it puts so much pressure on the forest.\"</p><p>Ballarat is one area which is actively encouraging population growth, and similarly the firewood supply for Ballarat is also one of the most threatened, with reticulated gas limited to certain areas and the price of electrical heating soaring to unaffordable highs.</p><p>\"There's a real need to invest time and effort in understanding sustainability,\" Mr English says, \"and it's on our radar.\"</p><p>Any information the community may have about the illegal removal of firewood for sale can be reported to DELWP on 136 186.</p><p>Concession card holders who rely only on firewood for home heating may be eligible for the non-mains energy concession.

Life for this Aussie schoolboy will never be the same again YOUNG Aussie actor Finn Little is about to undertake a team bonding activity with Hollywood superstar Angelina Jolie and he's more than a little starstruck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the start of shooting imminent for the film of his career, alongside Jolie, she suggests they go air-softing (skirmish with plastic projectiles) to get to know each other better.</p><p>\"I thought, 'Wow, that's amazing, and then she rocked up in full black and a tactical vest and just the biggest gun,\" Little says, smiling as he mimics the Lara Croft actor's intimidating arrival.</p><p>\"She was so ready. I feel like she was too prepared to shoot me.\" Back in Australia two years later, Little is a quiet, unassuming schoolboy begrudgingly waiting to start the second term of Year 10, clinging onto his final days of holidays by adventuring outside or walking his golden retriever, Chef.</p><p>Unlike most restless teenagers, his reluctance to return to the classroom comes from an insatiable desire to be back on a film set, escaping into another world rather than sitting in lessons.</p><p>Little has become relatively well-known as an actor since he filmed the title role in Storm Boy in 2017 when he was 11. But life is about to change. Next week, Hollywood survival thriller Those Who Wish Me Dead, in which he co-stars with Jolie, will be released in Australia and the United States.</p><p>Little is a relative newcomer to US audiences, and this is expected to be the breakthrough role to put his name up in lights.</p><p>Little spent three months filming the blockbuster, his first role in the US, in mid-2019, following stints filming Storm Boy, Sony Pictures' miniseries Reckoning, which is airing now on Channel 7, and movie Angel of Mine alongside another haul of big-name stars including Noomi Rapace and Luke Evans.</p><p>IT'S an unusual life, and Little's peers have -become accustomed to his chair at school being inexplicably empty for a week or two as he's away working on another secret project. He remains diligent with his schoolwork and ensures his -assignments drop punctually into his teachers' inboxes.</p><p>Little lives in northern Brisbane with his mother Catherine Kidd and his older sister Mackenzie, 16. The siblings did local eisteddfods together when they were young, an activity their mother hoped would build their confidence.</p><p>Little's life is foreign to most teenagers. His agents in Australia and the US send through auditions and Kidd helps him -record his self-tapes after school or at weekends - \"or if we're a little cheeky, it's before school\", Little says with a laugh to his mother.</p><p>His brother, Coby, 18, who lives out of home, is constantly trying to guess the next project because his little brother keeps him in the dark \"just to mess with him\".</p><p>He's away too often to do many organised -activities, so he spends his spare time climbing trees, playing basketball in the park, going fishing, walking Chef or hanging with a friend - anything outdoors.</p><p>\"There are times when I wish I had a normal kind of life, but my life is still pretty normal right now \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I don't think I will ever really regret it because I'm happy with what I do, because of where I go and who I meet. It's definitely interesting.</p><p>\"I don't want to have a normal life. I want to do something that helps someone.\" AFTER Little showed promise in eisteddfods, his mother signed him and his sister to an acting agency and he began picking up roles in TV commercials and short films from age five. At 10 he won the acting lottery, landing the title role in Storm Boy, Shawn Seet's acclaimed adaptation of the Colin Thiele novel, which saw him filming alongside Jai Courtney and Geoffrey Rush.</p><p>Little flew to Los Angeles with his mother in May, 2019, to do a callback audition for Those Who Wish Me Dead, with Jolie in a back room of Bron Studios.</p><p>\"That's Maleficent,\" Little recalls thinking, referencing Jolie's Disney character, when the megastar walked out to introduce herself to him and the two other hopeful actors.</p><p>\"It was a very emotional scene between me and her, and I was actually really nervous. I was thinking, 'I want this so bad', and I just kept going over it and over it. Then I finally got in there and I thought, 'I'm just going to sort of go for it'.\" In the film he stars as teenage murder witness Connor Casserly, who finds himself pursued by twin assassins in the Montana wilderness with a survival expert, Hannah Faber (Jolie), tasked with protecting him, and a forest fire threatening them all. It's directed by Taylor Sheridan, writer of Sicario.</p><p>\"I'm excited for what else is to come,\" says Little. \"I want to be an actor when I'm older. I like travelling and I just like acting because it's a way to express myself and be in someone else's shoes. It's sort of an escape. I feel like I can escape from the real world a bit.\" THOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD HITS CINEMAS ON THURSDAY</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-ae5ebf34a6ed11eb8bb52dbf64b1f50637a6d5b042e8e626a3fbe0741b8ec516</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62MC-3D31-JD3N-52VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Weekend Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 8, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000022</classCode><className>ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001691</classCode><className>TEACHING &amp; TEACHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DSC2</classCode><className>TEAM BUILDING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N512100CC</classCode><className>MOVIE &amp; VIDEO INDUSTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A4XT</classCode><className>MOVIE FILMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A4WK</classCode><className>BEGINNING OF FILMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009TR4</classCode><className>ANGELINA JOLIE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In prehistoric times the plant grew widely across eastern Australia but progressively disappeared until its only habitat became four small patches in a narrow gorge just 100km from Sydney.</p><p>Despite efforts to protect pines from outside contamination, its discovery led to the introduction of a deadly pathogen called Phytophthora through the boots of intrepid explorers, causing root rot in several of the original trees that could be up to thousands of years old.</p><p>The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service has started another colony of young Wollemi pines in a top-secret location in the Blue Mountains to ensure the survival of the original species, although successfully cloned seeds mean that the iconic pine has shot up in many places, including in London's Kew Gardens where it was planted by acclaimed naturalist Sir David Attenborough.Parts of central NSW received rain on Wednesday and more was expected across the state on Thursday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-67c95c2a377a11eaa997dac3eb3a4a188c9553d15ac0335bb7fb16ebbd3505ab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0B-B751-F0JP-W4V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Ms Muller also has a private reason to reboot her community. Family members lost homes and livelihoods in the fire that swept over the divide to Belowra early on New Year's Eve.</p><p>Ms Muller's grandparents are the artist David and Val Byard. Her step-grandparents are farmers Keith and Debbie Dance. Ms Muller purchased her current business from Mrs Dance.

The ferocious Badja Forest Fire would also claim the life of their neighbour Colin Burns.

nitf:lede=\"true\">HUNDREDS of firefighters are working to stop more than a dozen fires from hitting Victorian communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About 1500 personnel are strengthening containment lines while cooler weather provides a much-needed reprieve from extreme fire danger.</p><p>But Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said the 17 fires still burning could \"take a run\" and \"impact communities, life and property\".</p><p>\"We currently have 1500 firefighters who are out on the ground now who are working to do what they can to put in place measures to minimise the next impact of the fires,\" Ms Neville said.</p><p>\"Unless we have substantial rain there will be further impact from these fires in East Gippsland and also in the northeast.</p><p>\"The work that is being done this week, while we can, will play a really big role in trying to minimise the impact on communities, life and property going forward.\" Ms Neville added: \"I wish I could say this was over but we still have a long way to go.\" The state government yesterday confirmed 1.4 million hectares had been burnt, with 353 homes destroyed or damaged and more than 500 outbuildings also hit.</p><p>An emergency warning was issued at 6.04pm yesterday for residents near Tamboon to \"act immediately to survive\", with seven \"watch and act\" messages across the state.</p><p>A string of road blocks also remained in place, with the Princes Hwy closed east of -Orbost and the Monaro Hwy closed from Cann River to the NSW border.</p><p>But Ms Neville said clearing the Princes Hwy - the key route in and out of isolated holiday town Mallacoota - was a \"number one priority\". \"It is a critical part of the work being done by the Australian Defence Force and Forest Fire Management and some of our Vic Forest contractors as well,\" Ms Neville said.</p><p>Defence personnel have been helping fire-affected areas such as Orbost with felling dangerous trees.</p><p>Major General Jake Ellwood said local services in the East Gippsland area were becoming exhausted and defence personnel were there to help however they could.</p><p>Firefighters were also being rotated off the front line more quickly as heavy smoke shrouded large areas of the state.</p><p>\"We have a situation where under normal circumstances, of which this is not, if there was a firefront other firefighters from other areas would come in and support,\" Major General Ellwood said.</p><p>\"But of course, with the scale of the fires and the scale of the effort required, they are not getting the same reinforcement.\" A total of 5600 Defence personnel, including 2800 reservists, were yesterday on the ground across the country.</p><p><email

immediate tax relief, as a veteran firefighter killed while on duty is remembered as a hero.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state government is promising a raft of tax breaks, with businesses and residents whose properties were destroyed or substantially damaged exempt from their 2020 land tax.</p><p>Properties that were less severely damaged will be considered on a case-by-base basis.</p><p>Land tax will be also waived on eligible properties used as free accommodation, while up to $55,000 will be slashed from stamp duty for those who decide not to rebuild in their local community and instead buy elsewhere.</p><p>People who lost cars can receive up to $2100 in ex-gratia relief from the duty on up to two replacement vehicles.</p><p>Treasurer Tim Pallas said: \"The last thing people need to worry about when they are rebuilding after bushfires is the next tax bill coming in.\" It comes as Bill Slade, 60, was yesterday remembered as a much-loved friend and selfless firefighter with more than four decades of service to Parks Victoria and Forest Fire Management.</p><p>He was killed by a falling tree while working to contain a fire edge at Angler's Rest near Omeo on Saturday, taking the state's bushfire death toll to four.</p><p>\"He was wonderful, there wasn't a soul that didn't love him,\" niece Rachel Coyne said. \"He was hardworking and adored his family.\" The Wonthaggi man is survived by his wife Carol, and children Ethan, 22, and Steph, 20.</p><p>When not fighting fires, Mr Slade was tending to his beef farm and supporting his local football club, Kilcunda Bass, of which he was a lifetime member.</p><p>His brother-in-law, Les Hender, said you \"couldn't get a better friend\". \"He made all his mates look bad because he was so perfect,\" Mr Hender said.</p><p>After joining the organisation at just 17-years-old, Mr Slade was presented with 40- year service recognition to Parks Victoria in November.</p><p>CEO Matthew Jackson said presenting the award to him \"was an honour\". \"It was a privilege,\" Mr Jackson said.</p><p>He said it was important Mr Slade's legacy as a mentor and his commitment to the community \"will go on\" after his death.</p><p>Mr Jackson said Mr Slade's remarkable career included his service in the Ash Wednesday bushfires and key involvement in the fox eradication program in Phillip Island.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews yesterday called for a national co-ordinated response to bushfire disasters, saying that it was the best way forward as such tragedies appear to become \"the new normal\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

These fires sent huge amounts of smoke across the Hunter in December and January during westerly winds.</p><p>The notorious Wollemi fire, known as the Gospers Mountain blaze, set a record for being the biggest forest fire in Australian history.</p><p>A government spokesperson said the Google mapping was created to \"detect how badly the tree canopy has burnt by measuring the change in the colour of vegetation before and after a fire\".</p><p>The mapping was helping decision makers, ecologists and researchers in their \"assessments and response efforts to the recent fires\".</p><p>Additional fire-severity mapping was being done to guide conservation work and \"ecological reconstruction\".</p><p>National Parks Association Hunter branch president Ian Donovan said \"extensive areas were burnt in the Yengo and Wollemi national parks\".</p><p>\"There's the potential with these big fires that there'd be local extinctions of species in particular areas,\" Mr Donovan said.</p><p>It could be difficult for some species to \"recolonise back into those areas\".</p><p>\"It's hard to predict what the long-term effects are in Wollemi and so on. It's a huge area of complexity. You can't just generalise - it's not just gum trees. There's a lot of variety in the landscape.</p><p>\"Different types of ecological communities will respond differently.\"</p><p>The government said the fire intensity and severity varied across fire grounds.</p><p>\"Pockets of unburnt or slightly burnt canopy provide refuges for a number of species during fires.</p><p>\"Long-term survival is more complex and depends on factors such as access to food, water and habitat recovery, which is affected by fire severity and future weather conditions.\"</p><p>The Google mapping shows how badly the tree canopy was burnt. It does not provide detailed data on the impact of fires on specific species. Map data had been compared with information and records for threatened species, species sightings and other modelling to \"inform a preliminary assessment of the impact of the fires on NSW biodiversity\".</p><p>Further assessments and surveys were being done to \"directly assess\" impacts on flora and fauna.</p><p>The government said it was planning for the long-term restoration and recovery of \"native animals, plants and landscapes across NSW\".</p><p>\"This includes protecting the remaining areas of unburnt habitat. The government will continue to update our response as we improve our understanding of the impacts of these unprecedented fires.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LITHMC-doc79j4eh03j9x10s2w1htz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LITHMC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBB-TJY1-F0J6-J02W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

People still need to monitor carefully.\"</p><p>Inspector White warned Nelligen could be affected again by the Clyde Mountain Fire, with Buckenbowra and Runnyford.</p><p>\"There is still fire in that area and there is potential for increasing fire, especially in unburned pockets.\"</p><p>Embers and spot fires remain a constant risk.</p><p>No accurate figure is yet available for property loss in the wider Nelligen area.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MOREXM-doc78pays6v4rp1kgu4m7o3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MOREXM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XX0-DMR1-F0J6-J24D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437517</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Moruya Examiner</publicationName><edition>Internet Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

These fires sent huge amounts of smoke across the Hunter in December and January during westerly winds.</p><p>The notorious Wollemi fire, known as the Gospers Mountain blaze, set a record for being the biggest forest fire in Australian history.</p><p>A government spokesperson said the Google mapping was created to \"detect how badly the tree canopy has burnt by measuring the change in the colour of vegetation before and after a fire\".</p><p>The mapping was helping decision makers, ecologists and researchers in their \"assessments and response efforts to the recent fires\".</p><p>Additional fire-severity mapping was being done to guide conservation work and \"ecological reconstruction\".</p><p>National Parks Association Hunter branch president Ian Donovan said \"extensive areas were burnt in the Yengo and Wollemi national parks\".</p><p>\"There's the potential with these big fires that there'd be local extinctions of species in particular areas,\" Mr Donovan said.</p><p>It could be difficult for some species to \"recolonise back into those areas\".</p><p>\"It's hard to predict what the long-term effects are in Wollemi and so on. It's a huge area of complexity. You can't just generalise - it's not just gum trees. There's a lot of variety in the landscape.</p><p>\"Different types of ecological communities will respond differently.\"</p><p>The government said the fire intensity and severity varied across fire grounds.</p><p>\"Pockets of unburnt or slightly burnt canopy provide refuges for a number of species during fires.</p><p>\"Long-term survival is more complex and depends on factors such as access to food, water and habitat recovery, which is affected by fire severity and future weather conditions.\"</p><p>The Google mapping shows how badly the tree canopy was burnt. It does not provide detailed data on the impact of fires on specific species. Map data had been compared with information and records for threatened species, species sightings and other modelling to \"inform a preliminary assessment of the impact of the fires on NSW biodiversity\".</p><p>Further assessments and surveys were being done to \"directly assess\" impacts on flora and fauna.</p><p>The government said it was planning for the long-term restoration and recovery of \"native animals, plants and landscapes across NSW\".</p><p>\"This includes protecting the remaining areas of unburnt habitat. The government will continue to update our response as we improve our understanding of the impacts of these unprecedented fires.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NHLDAU-doc79ilnpqd1k216j0cihtz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NHLDAU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB4-S591-JD34-V043-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314240</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newcastle Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NATIONAL PARKS &amp;
