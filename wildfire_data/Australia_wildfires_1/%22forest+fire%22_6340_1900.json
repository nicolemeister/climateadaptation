He will be sorely missed by Parks Victoria and our thoughts are with his family.\"</p><p>Mr Jackson said the Mr Slade had spent 40 years fighting fires and maintaining parks in the South Gippsland area.</p><p>\"As a field services officer, he was a mentor and mentored many staff who are today on the front line??? He was one of our most experienced, long serving and fittest firefighters.\"</p><p>Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp said it was a sad day, not just for the emergency services community but for all Victorians.</p><p>\"We get up every day to keep our community safe. When we get up to see something like this, it has a devastating effect on all our services,\" he said.</p><p>\"On behalf of emergency services family we extend our sincere condolences to Carol, Steph and Ethan. We have no real appreciation of how you are feeling at the moment, but we feel for you and we will be there to support you through this no matter what it takes.\"</p><p>The death follows that of another Forest Fires Management worker, Mat Kavanagh, who was on duty when he was killed in a car crash.</p><p>The 43-year-old had been working as part of the fire response when he and his colleague were involved in a collision with another car on the Goulburn Valley Highway. Mr Kavanagh was married with two children.</p><p>Mick Roberts, of Buchan, and Maramingo Creek man Fred Becker both died in the East Gippsland fires around New Year's Day.</p><p>Mr Hardman said Mr Slade was working as a member of a taskforce which was consolidating the fire edge in the fire ground within a forested environment.</p><p>\"Although they do have enormous experience with identifying hazardous trees, there are occasions where some of these tree failures can't be predicted. In this case, he was struck by trees while working to consolidate the fire edge.\"</p><p>He said it was a \"traumatic experience for everyone on that taskforce\".</p><p>Mr Slade started working for the organisation he was 17 years old. He was instrumental in the fox eradication program on Phillip Island and had been working in the Wonthaggi area for many decades.</p><p>Asked whether Mr Slade's death would prompt any change in practices, Mr Hardman said their policies were \"some of the world's best in terms of firefighting and safety\".</p><p>\"This is the worst day you can imagine, having to talk about a loss of another firefighter but practices and systems of work are best they can be,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Crisp said it was a reminder for those travelling in fire-ravaged areas to be careful near trees.</p><p>\"Sadly we see on a regular basis tree strikes do seriously injure and kill people at times,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is a tough time for everyone, I know when I was here in the State Control Centre last night, everyone was flat and this is a difficult time but we will work through this ... support each other, support the family and continue to do what we do very well and that's keep the community safe.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520227107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYJ-TY41-DY19-C0M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>11:27 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Now we are playing catch-up,\" he said. \"I keep telling people that the fires are just a symptom of a disease called climate change. Federal government has to take leadership here.\"</p><p>His words were echoed by Mr Waller, who said: \"What I am looking for is national leadership, and to be bold and far-sighted... looking 20, 30 years out to how we are going to adapt and adjust to this new climate regime.</p><p>\"I'm not seeing any signs of that and that's disappointing. It's testing the quality of our leadership.</p><p>Fire chiefs unite in message of crucial necessity to act now</p><p>\"If you look at some of the good governments, like Hawke's and Howard's ...they worked within the electoral cycle but they also were statesmanlike and looked far and did some profound things.</p><p>\"That's what I am looking for out of this - our leaders stand up and say it is a real challenge and rally us. The time is ripe for that.

As the University of Minnesota's Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy director Michael Osterholm said: \"This is one big forest fire that keeps burning and looking for wood to burn, and that happens to be humans. We have months and months to go with this virus yet.\" As countries everywhere seek to find the right balance of preventive measures that will keep infections from reaching runaway levels while trying to emerge from painful lockdowns and restart their economies, the extent of the challenge could not be clearer.</p><p>This is being seen particularly in the US, which already accounts for 2.6 million cases, 25 per cent of the global total. On just Friday and Saturday last week the country recorded 45,255 and 42,000 new cases, part of big surges across Florida, Texas, California and Arizona - states that have been in the forefront of reopening their economies and trying to get life back to normal. After initially dismissing coronavirus as \"flu\", the Trump administration can't even take much comfort from the fact the 128,437 deaths so far recorded at a rate of 388 per million in the world's richest and most well-resourced nation is behind Belgium's record of 840 deaths per million, Britain's 642 and Spain's 606. Faced with the new surge, states across the US are reversing their reopenings.</p><p>Confirmed infection rates are accelerating across Latin America, too, especially in Brazil, with 1.3 million cases and 57,000 deaths so far. India similarly looms as an enormous challenge, with its vast population of 1.3 billion barely tested yet health authorities already reporting 549,000 cases and 17,000 deaths. Cases in South Africa and across the African continent also are surging, with limited medical resources and little certainty about the pandemic's impact. Former British prime minister David Cameron has suggested the need for a new global virus surveillance organisation to anticipate and help countries deal with future pandemics. It's certainly true that COVID-19 and the World Health Organisation's gross mishandling of the initial outbreak show how ill-prepared the world is for the next pandemic. Mr Cameron's idea lacks convincing detail and it's not clear how it could deal with awkward geopolitical realities, but at least it's a useful reminder that surviving COVID-19 will by no means end the challenge of infectious diseases in a globalised age.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-362d651ab9e511ea95f04782a11f7f52048fbc799fa629bc51709f583205022e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607V-6831-F0JP-W3HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"445\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

It reveals 2019 was Australia's hottest year on record, with 33 days in which the national daily maximum average temperature exceeded 39C.</p><p>This total number of extremely hot days is \"more than the number observed from 1960 to 2018 combined, which totalled 24 days,\" the report states.</p><p>Dr Karl Braganza, from the Bureau of Meteorology, said there had also been a \"significant increase in the frequency of dangerous fire-weather days across Australia, particularly during spring and summer, leading to an earlier start to the southern fire season.\" CSIRO Climate Science Centre director Dr Jaci Brown said the report provided a \"sobering look ahead\".</p><p>\"Ten to 20 years from now, 2019 won't be unusual; in fact, we think of this decade being hot but this decade will be one of the coolest in the next hundred years,\" Dr Brown said.</p><p>This summer would be cooler than the last but Dr Brown said that was \"because we tend to get a dip in temperatures with La Nina\".</p><p>This year also was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a global decline in fossil-fuel emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide or CO2 but this had \"negligible impact\" on climate change overall.</p><p>Atmospheric CO2 levels continued to rise and fossil-fuel emissions remained the principal driver of this growth.</p><p>\"Another way to think about this is if you've been eating junk food for 10 years and then you go on a diet for one day, and you jump on the scales the next morning expecting to see some change, drop a dress size, it's not that simple,\" Dr Brown said.</p><p>\"This is about a very long-term change, so I think the big challenge for our children and grandchildren will be how to flatten this curve.\" The report reveals Australia has warmed on average by 1.44C, give or take 0.24C, which is far more specific than the 1C figure in the last report.</p><p>Most warming has occurred since 1950 and every decade since then has been warmer than the ones before.</p><p>The seven years from 2013 to 2019 all rank in the nine warmest years. Warming is observed in all months, day and night. Along with warming comes more frequent extreme events including bushfires.</p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Index combines temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind speed. Using this index to map the change in the number of dangerous fire days between two periods - July 1950 to June 1985, and July 1985 to June 2020, above - shows South Australia is among the hardest hit by fierce fire conditions now. This trend will continue. Global sea levels had risen by 25cm since 1880, and the oceans around Australia were acidifying and had warmed by around 1C since 1910, the experts found.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-6e9addf2248311eb80605e3ce145afbc6eadde3b156b73a9feb5fc1bbe01f48e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618V-2NX1-F0JP-W30W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Advertiser Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 13, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS4V</classCode><className>SEA LEVEL CHANGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DS5V</classCode><className>OCEAN HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000490</classCode><className>DIETING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DGXP</classCode><className>JUNK FOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DGXP</classCode><className>JUNK FOODS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

will be somewhat subdued, but are stopping short of urging primary producers to be complacent on the back of widespread rain across much of the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">High moisture levels are driving academics to predict a relatively mild fire season this month, but extreme records of rainfall in parts of Victoria have renewed calls for farmers to be vigilant about the dangers and consequences of grassfires - one of the biggest threats farmers could face this summer, experts warn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">University of Melbourne Professor Trent Penman, a bushfire risk modeller, said Victoria was \"certainly\" in a better position heading into December compared to the months leading up to the Black Summer fires in 2019/20.</p><p>\"There has been a substantial amount of that [rain] in most parts of the state so at this point we wouldn't expect any major forest fires,\" Professor Penman said.</p><p>\"The challenge comes as we move into summer and grass and cropland areas may become at risk if we don't continue to receive this rainfall.\"</p><p>A CSIRO study released this week has found climate change has driven Australia's bushfire incidents in the past three decades, revealing the average annual forest area burnt has risen 800 per cent in that time.</p><p>RELATED READING: Climate change driving 800pc rise in bushfire activity: CSIRO</p><p>The project analysed 30 years of satellite data and 90 years of ground-based datasets from climate and weather observations, and found parts of Australia were experiencing longer fire seasons leading into autumn and winter compared to 30 years ago.</p><p>\"There is always a chance we can get a fire if there is hot, dry and windy weather for a couple of weeks,\" Professor Penman said.</p><p>\"Areas could very easily switch on and that doesn't need to be widespread, it could be a local event.\"</p><p>He said it was important this year farmers were well prepared for a range of scenarios.</p><p>\"There is no fire season where people should sit back and relax so for everybody to continue to do their normal preparations and as they say, prepare for the worst and hope for the best really applies to this season,\" he said.</p><p>RELATED READING: Average spring fire season predicted despite deluge and wet conditions</p><p>Woolgrower Stephen Hill, Mount Mittamatite, believes he is well-placed heading into summer, but says his view could change quickly should the consistent rain stop.</p><p>Mr Hill's property, near Corryong in the north-east, was completely burnt by the Black Summer fires, however, he managed to save a vast majority of his superfine Merino and crossbred flocks.</p><p>\"My farm hadn't burnt in 70 years so there was an enormous fuel load there because we face an easterly aspect which means it's always pretty wet,\" he said.</p><p>\"You wouldn't believe it though because since having a burn, the pastures have really improved.</p><p>His property consists of cleared creek flats, undulating hills and steep mountain flanks still timbered.</p><p>\"We've had a pretty bloody handy season which always helps and any of the introduced perennial pastures rebounded well after the fires, and native pastures look better than what they were before the fires,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're still getting rain and we've got rain forecast this week so everything is still green but the problem is there are paddocks locked up for silage because it's been too wet to cut them.</p><p>\"If it stops raining and we have a month or six weeks of hot, dry weather then there will be a pretty big fuel load in paddocks and that's one of our biggest worries.\"</p><p>Latrobe University's Jim Radford, a principal fellow at the Research Centre for Future Landscapes, said the severity of the fire season would ultimately depend on how much rain the state would receive in summer.</p><p>He said a wet autumn, winter and spring for parts of Victoria had helped with a \"prolonged and profuse\" wildflower season, spurring on the growth of native grasses.</p><p>\"A wet spring and a wet summer will increase the amount of fuel, particularly in grasses, because they respond quickest to rainfall,\" Dr Radford said.</p><p>\"But if it continues to rain through summer, the fuel moisture remains high so even though there is a high fuel load and a lot of biomass, the risk wouldn't be as high as if we had a wet spring and then a dry summer.</p><p>\"Having said that, grasses can cure and dry very quickly so overall we might have a wet summer and it only takes a couple of weeks for grasses to dry out and that does pose an elevated fire risk.\"</p><p>Climate outlooks for summer indicate average rainfall for most of Victoria with generally warmer than average conditions in the west, and cooler than average conditions in the east of the state.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said the predicted rainfall combined with underlying moisture levels means there is a low likelihood of large-scale forest fires this year.</p><p>He said Victorian authorities conducted 470 burns last financial year, spanning more than 133,000 hectares of public land, and an additional 49 burns over 2000 hectares from July to the end of October.</p><p>Dr Caitlin Pfeiffer, a lecturer in Veterinary Epidemiology at the University of Melbourne, who specialises in effective fire preparation and practical actions for farmers, said it was important farmers had a fire plan in place to protect assets and livestock, regardless of the seasonal conditions.</p><p>She is leading a project funded by Meat &amp; Livestock Australia looking at bushfire preparation and recovery for red meat producers following the Black Summer fires.</p><p>The project involves 60 farmers, including 15 across north-east and eastern Victoria, who were affected by the 2019/20 fires.</p><p>\"Our study has shown that having a fire plan is one of the most important things you can do to protect your livestock,\" Dr Pfeiffer said.</p><p>\"Working out and identifying where abouts on the farm you would put those livestock if a fire were approaching is important, along with managing the vegetation.</p><p>\"Once you've decided where you'll put those livestock, grazing those areas down to reduce the fuel load is important because you don't want lots of dry standing pasture in those places.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But even worse, consideration of appropriate forest management, initial attack and prescribed burning is diminished to almost nothing.</p><p>If the final report, due at the end of October, continues on the present course, the likelihood of future extreme bushfires killing our people, and animals, will be officially sanctioned by the Prime Minister and his Liberal Party team.</p><p>Incredibly, the Royal Commission states \"three billion animals were killed or displaced\" by the 2019-20 bushfires. True, this occurs in all widespread high-intensity bushfires and unless we manage them to reduce the extent and intensity in the future there will be disastrous consequences for certain species of both animals and plants that may well lead to their extinction.</p><p>The solution to this problem has been known for decades starting formally with the 1939 Stretton Royal Commission.</p><p>In the 1960s, Western Australia began a program of environmentally sensitive and strategically planned hazard-reduction burns, which operated on five to 12 year cycles. These protected both the community and forest ecology.</p><p>Western Australia ultimately developed a high-tech version of the 40,000 year-old practice of Indigenous Australians, which reduce fuel loads to manageable levels. Their hazard-reduction burns are gentle, with a flame front you can step across.</p><p>The Royal Commission has not properly investigated the impact of current land management policies on forest fire suppression, particularly initial attack by dedicated forest firefighters. It has not mentioned those cases where fires were deflected or slowed by previously burnt areas.</p><p>Those who suggest bad bushfires are \"natural disasters\", effectively disenfranchise Aboriginal care for country.</p><p>Extreme bushfires are not \"natural disasters\", as the government claims. They are caused by government's negligence towards hazard-reduction. The evidence for this can be found in the journals of Australia's first European explorers, who repeatedly describe landscapes of open parkland that were being constantly burned by Indigenous Australians.</p><p>The 2019-20 bushfires were exactly what Indigenous Australians warned Europeans about.</p><p>In January Prime Minister Morrison accepted the buck stops with him. However, it is now becoming clear he is not interested in promoting skilled burning by trained people to achieve multiple objectives.</p><p>Deliberately reduced access, lack of resources and skilled personnel - - not climate change - are all making the task nearly impossible.</p><p>His Royal Commission is on a disaster course, talking climate change nonsense and pretending that extreme bushfires can be managed without appropriate prescribed burning, which would make our forests healthy and safe.</p><p>\" Phil Cheney is a respected bushfire scientist, David Packham is a renowned bushfire expert and Tim Malseed is the president of firestickestate.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-f14490cafbd611ea97b833072db05f82f405a84b423fc143875804ffa32f5d2d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WY-MJ41-F0JP-W1JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

It conjures that epic oil baron drama There Will Be Blood or the indie zombie drama The Dead Don't Die, but Taylor Sheridan's action crime thriller is sadly devoid of milkshake drinking or the walking dead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, it has the glamorous Angelina Jolie as a firefighter battling natural disasters and bad wigs to save a boy pursued by hitmen. That's a lot of adversity to endure in the short space of 100 minutes. But if anyone can do it, it's the original Lara Croft herself.</p><p>Angie is Hannah, a firefighter in Montana's rugged forest country who has been tasked to staff a lonely fire watch tower in a remote part of the state. She's probably been given the solo gig as some employer-mandated self-reflection time since a fire rescue the previous summer led to a few deaths that Hannah holds herself accountable for.</p><p>Crashing in on her isolation and self-pity is Connor (Finn Little), son of forensic accountant Owen (Jake Weber) who has uncovered the financial wrong-doings of some seriously powerful figures.</p><p>Hitmen Jack (Aiden Gillen) and Patrick (Nicholas Hoult) take out Owen's District Attorney boss and the boss's whole family, and when Owen sees this on the news he throws son Connor in the car, disconnects their mobiles, and heads for the remote safety of his police officer brother Ethan (Jon Bernthal) in the Montana countryside.</p><p>When they catch up with him, he gets Connor safely hidden with instructions to flee into the woods and to find an adult he can trust, and here his path crosses that of the anguished Hannah.</p><p>As a lightning strike has taken out her radio, Hannah and Connor flee on foot, but the two bad guys have set a forest fire to cover their tracks and limit the escape options for their prey.</p><p>You know this is a film its studio had big plans for when every character, even the relatively minor ones, are played by big names who should have have headlined films of they own. Aiden Gillen of the British Queer as Folk and better known as Little Finger from Game of Thrones is a well-cast and believable bad guy, but pairing him with the beautiful Nicholas Hoult, the cute kid from About a Boy who grew up hot to be Beast in X-Men and Peter in The Great, is terrifically unexpected casting.</p><p>Jon Bernthal of The Walking Dead and Punisher is a competent sheriff and even multi-hyphenate filmmaker Tyler Perry cameos as a bad guy. It's a little distracting to have such big names so under-used. Finn Little is a convincingly solid young performer and he holds his own against his older and more studied onscreen colleagues.</p><p>It's hard for the audience to disengage their notions and expectations when a star the calibre of Angelina Jolie is on the screen. Lara Croft was a perfect role for her - she's so cartoonish and over-the-top. But for the woman who fights for human rights at the United Nations and on war-torn front lines - the woman who was too good for Brad Pitt - to ask us to suspend disbelief and think of her as a fragile first responder not coping with life, it's just a bit too much to ask.</p><p>But even when we're seeing the fragility of Jolie's character, we're distracted by the three points of light her enormous brown eyes pick up from the camera, like a human anime character. For all the work the makeup team do slowly disheveling Hannah as the film progresses, with hair singed by fire and covered in cuts and bruises, she also has smashingly on-point eye makeup throughout. Still, I wouldn't want my Angelina to be represented any other way.</p><p>Director Taylor Sheridan pulls off some fantastic shots, with the film's final showdown the kind of clever work I expect film students will pull apart for years to come, but these moments aren't consistent.</p><p>He is a talented writer, notably of Sicario and Hell or High Water, but he and his co-writers Michael Koryta and Charles Leavitt take it all just a bit too seriously. It is based on the novel by Koryta and is something of a western in contemporary clothing.</p><p>The bushfire scenes, or forest fires if you're American, will be triggering for some for who this was real-life last summer, but they are well staged and designed by the film's production designers and CGI wizards.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7fs68td5n4l4sn48d8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62NR-MJ91-JD34-V21C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

These embers can land in your backyard and what should have needed hours to plan can be down to a matter of minutes.</p><p>Then the panic starts and the thinking goes out the window.</p><p>With much of the population wanting to live in forested areas, they need to fully understand how the amount of trees and bush with dry under growth all adds up to atomic radiant heat that spews out tonnes of hot embers which can leave people trapped.</p><p>As studies around the world have shown, 99 per cent of homes lost are lost through ember attacks.</p><p>Most people could look around and see things they never thought of, like dead grass 300 millimetres high near the front steps, or the open window with a curtain behind, the cardboard boxes sitting on the front verandah, the dog's bedding or cushions on deck chairs.</p><p>I have witnessed farmers that have ploughed around their house and shed yet leave two metres of dry grass that an ember can blow into.</p><p>As landholders we need to be self-sufficient and prepared such as our fore fathers were. They never had phones, fire trucks, helicopters or house insurance.</p><p>They looked out for themselves and prepared for the natural summer infernos. Now with more people living in the bush or towns right on the edge of major forest belts we need to be more vigilant and prepared.</p><p>The rule of thumb is no ground fire, no crown fire, so by removing all the dead grass and undergrowth around your home and sheds and having water pumps and hoses ready will give you a very good chance to help others save your home.</p><p>PHILL (DUSTY) CORDELL, Wauchope.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THLAND-doc799d1xm91xl1leq65lzy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THLAND2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y69-C571-F0J6-J037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385748</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Land</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The ADF will be just exactly what they are doing at the moment, helping us to plan for this particular operation,\" Mr Crisp said in the recording.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"At this stage we don't see a need for boots on the ground, so to speak.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He reiterated the decision in another meeting on March 28, after an ADF representative said the force was patrolling quarantine hotels in NSW.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"I've said it before but I'll say it again, at this particular point in time we certainly don't see the need for ADF boots on the ground in support of this operation,\" Mr Crisp said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Returned travellers began arriving in Victoria on March 29.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 On April 8, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Philip Gaetjens emailed Chris Eccles, the secretary of Victoria?s Department of Premier and Cabinet to again offer ADF assistance.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Referencing the NSW arrangement, Mr Gaetjens said: \"I am sure the Commonwealth would be willing to assist Victoria in a similar way if you wanted to reconsider your operating model\".<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Eccles replied: ?Thanks Phil\".<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 It wasn't until June 24 thatMr Crisp made a request for 850 defence personnel to replace private security.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The request,which had been prompted by the Department of Health and Human Services, was rescinded just a day later after the Department of Justice and Community Safety took over the program.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Crisp told the inquiry he wasn't opposed to the use of private security guards.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Based on my work experience, I've worked with a lot of private security and my thinking was, well-trained, well-supervised private security in this type of role would have been sufficient and effective,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 About 99 per cent of Victoria's second COVID-19 wave can be traced to outbreaks at the Rydges on Swanston and Stamford Plaza hotels.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In late May, when the virus first broke out of the hotels, 19 people in Victoria had died from COVID-19. The state's death toll is now 729.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Also due to appear at the inquiry on Tuesday isChris Eagle from Forest Fire Management Victoria, one of the key people involved in the program's day-to-day management.</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V8-6BP1-JC0X-K025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"500\"/><timeReceived>1:59 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Associated Press Pty.

xml:space=\"preserve\">\u00a0\u00a0Victoria's bushfire front could shift from the state's east to the west this summer without rain spurred by La Nina, as authorities also warn Melbourne isn't out of the woods.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 State emergency chiefs gathered to update the public on preparations for the 2020-21 season, after Monday's release of the Australian seasonal bushfire outlook for September to November.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 It found this season will be driven by different phenomena to the previous two, with an active La Nina likely to bring plenty of wet weather.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 With a 70 per cent likelihood of La Nina forming by the end of the year,a negative Indian Ocean Dipole also makes a wet spring more probable for Victoria and the rest of eastern Australia.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Emergency Management Victoria Commissioner Andrew Crisp acknowledged the outlook painted a \"very different picture\" to last year's quarterly update, which noted above-average fire conditions for eastern Victoria.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The forecast proved despairingly true as vast tracts of East Gippsland and Victoria's northeast were devastated by fires in December and January.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Even though it's been some time, it's probably etched in our brains and memories in relation to the impact on those particular communities,\" Mr Crisp told reporters on Monday.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We'll be thinking about them as we move into this particular summer.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 East Gippsland was poised for a reprieve this summer because of stronger winter rainfall, Mr Crisp said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But the Mallee, Wimmera and state's far southwest have not enjoyed the same levels of wet weather and will need more to eradicate someunderlying dryness.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It does present a risk as we move into summer,\" the EMV boss said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"However, there is a La Nina alert and so there's every indication we're going to see more rain.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"At this stage, it's pretty much a 'wait and see' in relation to what the summer and what the fire season will look like.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Forest Fire Management Victoria was undertaking planned burns in all three western regions on Monday, and neither rain nor COVID-19 will slow down hazard reduction plans this spring.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We will evolve the planned burn program to suit the year,\" FFMV chief fire officer Chris Hardman said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Whatever Mother Nature is throwing at us, it will open certain windows and close others.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Although grass and crop fires are set to feature during the early stage of the season, Mr Hardman said there was \"enormous potential\" for significant one-day bushfire events in Melbourne after a week of hot and dry weather.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Country Fire Authorityacting chief officer Garry Cook said their volunteers had been issued documentation on how to safely conduct planned burns and other activities amid the pandemic.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Cook said the CFA was consulting with the heads of NSW and SA's rural fire services to ensure border closures don't hamper responses to emergencies that fall on either side of states lines.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Three months out from summer, the EMV commissioner is urging people to download the VicEmergency app.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's never too early to start preparing,\" Mr Crisp said.</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

xml:space=\"preserve\">\u00a0\u00a0Victoria's bushfire front could shift from the state's east to the west this summer without rain spurred by La Nina, as authorities also warn Melbourne isn't out of the woods.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 State emergency chiefs gathered to update the public on preparations for the 2020-21 season, after Monday's release of the Australian seasonal bushfire outlook for September to November.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 It found this season will be driven by different phenomena to the previous two, with an active La Nina likely to bring plenty of wet weather.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 With a 70 per cent likelihood of La Nina forming by the end of the year,a negative Indian Ocean Dipole also makes a wet spring more probable for Victoria and the rest of eastern Australia.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Emergency Management Victoria Commissioner Andrew Crisp acknowledged the outlook painted a \"very different picture\" to last year's quarterly update, which noted above-average fire conditions for eastern Victoria.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The forecast proved despairingly true as vast tracts of East Gippsland and Victoria's northeast were devastated by fires in December and January.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Even though it's been some time, it's probably etched in our brains and memories in relation to the impact on those particular communities,\" Mr Crisp told reporters on Monday.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We'll be thinking about them as we move into this particular summer.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 East Gippsland was poised for a reprieve this summer because of stronger winter rainfall, Mr Crisp said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But the Mallee, Wimmera and state's far southwest have not enjoyed the same levels of wet weather and will need more to eradicate someunderlying dryness.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It does present a risk as we move into summer,\" the EMV boss said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"However, there is a La Nina alert and so there's every indication we're going to see more rain.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"At this stage, it's pretty much a 'wait and see' in relation to what the summer and what the fire season will look like.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Forest Fire Management Victoria was undertaking planned burns in all three western regions on Monday, and neither rain nor COVID-19 will slow down hazard reduction plans this spring.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We will evolve the planned burn program to suit the year,\" FFMV chief fire officer Chris Hardman said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Whatever Mother Nature is throwing at us, it will open certain windows and close others.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Although grass and crop fires are set to feature during the early stage of the season, Mr Hardman said there was \"enormous potential\" for significant one-day bushfire events in Melbourne after a week of hot and dry weather.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Country Fire Authorityacting chief officer Garry Cook said their volunteers had been issued documentation on how to safely conduct planned burns and other activities amid the pandemic.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Cook said the CFA was consulting with the heads of NSW and SA's rural fire services to ensure border closures don't hamper responses to emergencies that fall on either side of states lines.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Three months out from summer, the EMV commissioner is urging people to download the VicEmergency

It cost $292,000 and interviewed about 10,000 people in seven countries.</p><p>On average, a third of respondents told Austrade that their perceptions of Australia had improved following the bushfires, about half said their perceptions remained about the same and 20 per cent said their perceptions of Australia had dropped.</p><p>It found 53 per cent of respondents would buy Australian produce, down from 62 per cent in July 2019; 60 per cent would trade with Australia, down from 65 per cent; and 49 per cent would still travel to Australia, from 57 per cent.</p><p>University of Melbourne Asia Institute research fellow Melissa Conley Tyler said Australia's international reputation was a financial asset and \"negative perceptions have a real-world effect\".</p><p>\"You may ask what does it matter, who cares if the world doesn't like something we are doing?\" Ms Conley Tyler said. \"We have to remember that all those foreigners are constantly making decisions about where they travel, what they buy and where their kids study.\"</p><p>The election of Joe Biden to the US presidency puts further pressure on Australia to follow his lead with more ambitious policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change.</p><p>Australia's five largest export markets, covering 70 per cent of trade, will have net-zero targets for 2050 or 2060, including the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Britain.</p><p>\"Our reputation in protecting our wildlife is damaging our international reputation and reducing our economic opportunities,\" said the Wilderness Society policy manager Tim Beshara. \"The response has to be proper environmental reform, genuine climate action and vastly increased firefighting resources, not a social media campaign.\"</p><p>A group of five scientists from the Australian National University and Griffith University recently published a report warning that the 1 degree of warming globally had caused a \"substantial increase\" to the risks recorded in NSW, Victoria and Queensland.</p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) risk ratings are now off the charts due to long-term rainfall reduction over south-eastern Australia.</p><p>Australia saw record-high FFDI values in spring last year ahead of Black Summer, and on September 6 almost 60 per cent of the country experienced the highest fire danger rating on record for that location.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7dsl12x4460h3lwogb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61M2-STB1-JD34-V2G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">VICTORIA'S high country cattlemen have lashed out at the State Government, describing the current bushfire crisis gripping southeast Australia as avoidable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mountain Cattlemen's Association of Victoria president Bruce McCormack has accused Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Labor of having \"short memories\" in their management of fuel loads in the Alpine National Park and state parks in the lead-up to the fires.</p><p>\"We tried to warn everyone back in 2005 (when grazing cattle over summer in the Alpine National Park was banned by the-then Bracks Labor Government) that fire fuel loads would become unmanageable,\" Mr McCormack said. \"We pleaded with everyone, begged them to listen not just to us, but to the 150 years of bush management we had as evidence.</p><p>\"The Government consistently ignored our pleas - first for cattle to return, and then later that cool burning (over winter) wasn't being done on a large-enough scale.\" Merrijig-based Mr McCormack, who still runs cattle on a state forest lease in the King Valley but mustered most of them out last week because of fire risk, said cool winter burns to reduce fuel loads had been carried out by mountain cattlemen for generations.</p><p>\"I remember riding along with my grandfather through the bush, and him dropping matches as we rode through the snow gums,\" Mr McCormack said.</p><p>\"Those little fires started, and finished, in a matter of hours - and had to be perfectly timed with the weather.</p><p>\"They were true cool burns, done at the right time by the right people.\" Mr McCormack said cool burns were not enough, with many higher areas of the Alpine National Park \"totally unsuitable for prescribed burning\".</p><p>\"Above 1200m the authorities do not conduct prescribed burns - this means there is no way to reduce fuel above that altitude,\" he said.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said any suggestion authorities were \"not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is misinformed\".</p><p>He said authorities planned to burn 246,396ha of public land in 2018-19 \"but were unable to do so because it would have been unsafe\".A Victorian Government spokeswoman said there was no plans to reintroduce cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park to help reduce fuel loads.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

When you arrive at your campsite, be aware of your surroundings and camp at least 20 metres from any stream, lake or reservoir.</p><p>FOR ALL YOUR BREAKING NEWS, CLICK HERE</p><p>\"Trees can drop limbs, or entire trees can fall, without warning so do not set up your tent or park your car under trees. Be careful when picnicking near or under trees also. Observe all warning signs and stay well away from trees that appear to be dead or have dead branches.</p><p>\"Make sure you keep 1.5 metres away from other campers and campfires, the length of a sedan car is a good way to mark the distance.</p><p>\"All native plants and animals are protected. Do not cut down or damage standing trees or vegetation and please don't feed wildlife.</p><p>\"Always let someone know before you go. You can visit the Victoria Police website for a trip intention form in case of an emergency.\"</p><p>Mr English said it was also important to take all fire precautions seriously, especially after last year's horror bushfire season.</p><p>\"Know the campfire safety rules before you head out and stick to them. In national and state parks, campfires and barbecues may only be lit in the designated fireplaces provided and you must bring your own firewood.</p><p>\"Campers in state forests must build a trench at least 30 centimetres deep around campfires and can collect fallen wood less than a metre in length for their use.</p><p>CHECK OUT LOCAL SPORTS NEWS HERE</p><p>\"All campfires must never be left unattended and need to be extinguished with water, not soil, as fires can still smoulder under soil. If a fire is cool to touch, it is safe to leave,\" he said.</p><p>\"It is illegal to light a campfire on a day of Total Fire Ban, when fires are likely to spread rapidly and be difficult for firefighters to control.

There are usually no bins, so ensure you take your rubbish home - whatever you bring in to the forest, you must take out,\" he said.</p><p>Under the Forest Act 1958, on-the-spot fines of $496 can be issued to people breaching campfire safety rules. The maximum penalty for lighting a fire during a Total Fire Ban is $39,652, two years in jail or both.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIMFAR-doc7don68mjxh219btl6md0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIMFAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61JD-7RX1-F0J6-J4FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Wimmera Farmer</publicationName><edition>Internet Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 19, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>National parks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vacation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CA23</classCode><className>CAMPING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">A girl who wanted to bring a smile to people's faces by recreating a portrait of RFS Cobargo captain Mark Ayliffe has helped raise thousands of dollars at auction.</p><p>Ten-year-old Briella Perriotte from Campbelltown asked her mother for a copy of the photo taken by freelance photographer Sean Davey during Prime Minister Scott Morrison's visit to Cobargo so she could paint a version of it herself.</p><p>She said she felt compelled to help in some way.</p><p>\"I wanted to give the people who saw it a bit of hope, even if it was just a smile for one second,\" Briella said.</p><p>\"I wanted them to feel happy again.\"</p><p>After spending a few days painting the portrait, Briella approached her mother, Connie Perriotte, with the final piece and asked if she could sell it.</p><p>\"She wanted me to try and sell it for her for $2 so she could donate that money to the firefighters,\" Ms Perriotte said.</p><p>Ms Perriotte decided to share the image on her Facebook account where her friends on social media suggested she auction the painting off instead.</p><p>'Hopefully it helps'</p><p>The painting was auctioned off last night and sold for $1,300 with the funds going to Cobargo's Fire Brigade.</p><p>Copies of the original have also been sold for a total of $680, with $130 of that going to the Cobargo Fire Brigade as well.</p><p>The remainder of the funds went to bushfire-related charities of the buyer's choice.</p><p>In total, nearly $2,000 was raised - a steep jump from an initial $2 selling price.</p><p>The young artist hoped the funds will help support firefighters.</p><p>\"I just hope it will make a bit of a difference, even if it's a small change,\" she said.</p><p>\"Like getting them new shoes or more masks.\"</p><p>The Perriottes had no previous connection to Cobargo, but they wanted to help the town after it was severely impacted by the Badja Forest fire.</p><p>\"It's been really overwhelming and amazing this past week,\" Ms Perriotte said.</p><p>\"Hopefully it helps make some kind of a difference and it helps the people of Cobargo and surrounding areas know that the outside world know and that they do care.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Parks Victoria will work with Forest Fire Management Victoria to undertake additional heavy vegetation management works along the eastern boundary, which will include an additional 40m strip along Grubb Rd.</p><p>But Senator Sarah Henderson said there was deep concern in many regional communities about the fire risk posed by poor land management.</p><p>\"The State Government's failure to keep the Ocean Grove Nature Reserve clear of debris is of considerable concern,\" she said.</p><p>\"We are also seeing land management failures in other local reserves such as at Inverleigh and Bannockburn.</p><p>\"At this time of such a terrible bushfire emergency across Victoria, the State Government must be doing everything possible to keep communities safe.\" Fuel management at the Ocean Grove Nature Reserve has previously been undertaken using treatments such as mulching and planned burning.</p><p>Since 2006, extensive fuel reduction works using mechanical methods - such as mowing, slashing and mulching - have been carried out across about 40ha of the res-erve. An additional 13ha of mulching is planned for early 2020.Three ecological burns have been carried out in the reserve since 2006.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-93ac08ec372511eabd87973489f7a1f7f8a5a3b01efc5a9a8394688a34e153c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y09-H9D1-F0JP-W0NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Geelong Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DM7F</classCode><className>NEGATIVE POLITICAL NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They include the Macedon Ranges, Dandenongs and areas around the Great Dividing Range, including Victoria's north-east and East Gippsland.</p><p>CFA Chief Officer Jason Heffernan said people who left it too late or were not adequately prepared to defend their properties were risking their lives.</p><p>\"Leaving early means leaving the night before, or early in the morning of, a high-risk fire day,\" he said.</p><p>\"It means it's easier to make good, rational decisions and avoid panic, becoming trapped and risking serious injury or death. Waiting to leave means a drive that normally takes a few minutes could take hours, or you may not be able to get out at all.\"</p><p>The survey, conducted in April, also showed one-quarter of those in the \"wait and see\" group would do as much as they could to protect their property but leave if they felt threatened by fire.</p><p>One in 10 people from that group said they would wait for police or emergency services to tell them what to do. More than one-third of respondents said they would leave as soon as they were aware a fire could threaten their town or suburb.</p><p>Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-Operative Research Centre in Melbourne, said grass fires would be a particular risk this season.</p><p>\"The bushfire risk for summer is different to last season in Victoria, given the wetter conditions experienced during the year and the influence of La Nina,\" he said.</p><p>\"These conditions mean there has been strong grass growth, and now that summer is here that grass is drying out and causing a fire risk.\"</p><p>Grass fires could start quickly and spread rapidly, Dr Thornton warned.</p><p>He said people in high-risk fire areas should make a fire plan and discuss it with their families, including children, and account for pets and other animals.</p><p>\"People underestimate what it takes to do good fire preparation that is specific to their own circumstances,\" Dr Thornton said.</p><p>Professor Michael Clarke from the La Trobe University School of Life Sciences said that after a wet year, grass fires could be particularly concerning for suburbs on the urban fringe.</p><p>\"So the areas of risk are shifting a bit,\" he said.</p><p>Last Monday a grass fire threatened Mount Cottrell, Truganina and Chartwell in Melbourne's west.</p><p>Heavy rain can promote the growth of grass, which can dry out and burn quickly in short spells of hot weather. Fires in the bush will be less likely this year as a result of the rain, but Professor Clarke said a hot spell that lasts only four or five days could dry out the forests.</p><p>A state government report analysing Victoria's bushfire risk, released late on Friday, revealed that in 2019-20 there were 230,000 hectares of public land scheduled for fuel management. However, 130,000 hectares had been burnt by bushfires or were inaccessible to crews.</p><p>Forest Fire Management was able to burn about 37,000 hectares of public land and treated 17,000 hectares with mechanical means, the report said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520365210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61K0-8DX1-DY19-C003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><timeReceived>07:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
