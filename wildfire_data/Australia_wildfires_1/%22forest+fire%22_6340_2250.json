Even so, it will be impossible to include all the things that deserve attention. I should add that all of these works can viewed online at the Metropolitan Museum website, with high-quality images and insightful, accurate commentary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We may start with an early Crucifixion (c. 1420-23) by Fra Angelico, several years before Masaccio's work at the Brancacci Chapel. The figures do not yet have the solidity and firm stance that Masaccio introduces, but they are full of closely observed details and brimming with psychological life: there is a particularly interesting play of glances between the various characters. In the foreground, Christ's mother Mary has fainted from grief; she is attended by two holy women and Mary Magdalene in scarlet, while John, in blue and pink, weeps at the foot of the cross; the skull is that of Adam, whose original sin is redeemed by the death on the cross. </p><p>Nearby is another small painting, Giovanni di Paolo's Paradise (1445), inspired by part of Fra Angelico's Last Judgement (c. 1631), but the Sienese painter ignores the Florentine innovation of perspective in favour of an imaginary, tapestry-like space in which figures stand above rather than behind those in front of them. The composition is full of Dominicans, including Saint Dominic and Saint Thomas Aquinas, since the painting was part of a commission for that order, as well as other recognisable figures, such as Saint Augustine with his mother Monica in the centre. But above all Paradise is imagined as a place where those who loved each other in life - whether as parents, friends or lovers - will be reunited in joy. </p><p>The world of Piero di Cosimo's Hunting scene (c. 1495-1500) could not be more different. Piero, a complex and reclusive artist, is inspired by the Latin philosophical poem De Rerum natura, rediscovered in 1417 and first printed in 1473, in which its author Lucretius gives a comprehensive Epicurean and materialistic account of the world. One of the objects of the Epicureans was to banish the fear of the divine by demonstrating that the gods have no role in nature and take no interest in our conduct. </p><p>In this picture and its companion, The Return from the Hunt, also at the Met, Piero ponders the life of primitive man, as yet barely distinct from beast and still living in the company of fauns and centaurs. The forest fire raging in the background follows Lucretius's suggestion that early humans used fire to drive animals out of the woods and kill them, but it also acts as a metaphorical image of the extreme violence of the hunting and killing in the foreground. </p><p>Even animals attack each other in the frenzy, and on the lower right a dead man reminds us that we are not always victorious in the contest. </p><p>Death and hunting are again associated, but only by implication, in Titian's Venus and Adonis (1550s), a subject of which Titian and his workshop produced many variants. </p><p>The immediate source of the story, as often in the renaissance, is Ovid's Metamorphoses, a poetic compendium of mythology linked by the theme of transformation, but its origins are much older. The goddess is shown trying to dissuade her young lover from going to the hunt, where he will be killed by a boar. </p><p>The strange but memorable attitude of Venus is borrowed from a minor antique relief of Cupid and Psyche (the figure of Cupid seems to have inspired Michelangelo's figure of Christ in the Piet\u00e0 and, through this work, David's Death of Marat). </p><p>But the psychological tension of the composition is between the clinging female body and the active, departing male one, momentarily joined by an intense but ambiguous meeting of the eyes; while the pictorial magic arises from Titian's miraculous union of colour and tone, and his execution of the whole picture, figures and background, from almost the same palette. </p><p>Love is Caravaggio's theme too in one of the most important of his works to have been seen in Australia, albeit an early one, The Musicians (1597), which I last saw in the outstanding Caravaggio exhibition at the Scuderia del Quirinale in Rome in 2010 (reviewed here at the time). The picture was painted for Cardinal del Monte, one of the first to recognise the artist's talent, and includes what is generally accepted to be a self-portrait - the swarthier figure in the background, shown playing a cornet. </p><p>Although it would be anachronistic to call Caravaggio homosexual (or even bisexual), since such a category did not yet exist and the artist had relations with women as well, many of his early works are undeniably homoerotic and he seems - interestingly in view of Freud's ideas about narcissism - to have been attracted to boys who looked rather like himself. Here the connection is with the lutenist (possibly, as Keith Christiansen suggests, a castrato), and the cupid on the left binding together light and dark grapes is probably an allusion to the union of dark and fair; there is even a formal allusion in the way the two heads tilt towards each other. And the union of opposites was at the same time a familiar conception of musical harmony.</p><p>Two paintings by Rembrandt and Vermeer also have an allegorical character, and yet one is complex, explicit and programmatic, while the other is mysterious and hard to pin down. Rembrandt's late Flora (c. 1654) catches our attention by its very awkwardness,  the unusual profile view of the head at right angles to the torso. Titian's Flora (c. 1515), which the artist could have seen in Amsterdam, has been cited as an inspiration, but her frontal torso is more harmoniously matched with a head seen in the normal three-quarters view. Rembrandt, however, is probably referring to a profile drawing of his wife Saskia, who had died in 1642; Orpheus-like, he conjures her back to life as the symbol of springtime and renewal, and yet she forever gazes away into the distance, and this is what imbues the painting, in spite of its ostensibly happy subject, with a mood of solemnity and sadness. </p><p>Vermeer's Allegory of the Catholic Faith (c. 1670-72) uses a familiar device, the foreground curtain, to lead us into an interior space, here imagined as a private chapel, since public celebration of the mass was illegal at the time in Protestant Holland. The composition is filled with a repertory of religious symbols, from the chalice, reminding us of the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine of the Eucharist, to the apple on the ground recalling original sin. But Vermeer's acute sense of literal reality is such that we feel as if we are looking at an elaborate mise-en-sc\u00e8ne which never turns into a spiritual vision as in Italian baroque paintings. </p><p>One of the most important paintings in this exhibition, and again one of the most significant works by this artist to have been shown in Australia, is Nicolas Poussin's Saints Peter and John Healing the Lame Man (1655). As the museum notes, this is one of three great cityscape subjects painted at around the same time, the others being Christ and the woman taken in adultery (1653) and The Death of Sapphira (1654), both of which are in the Louvre. All of these works reflect a renewed meditation on Raphael, partly because two of them are drawn from the Acts of the Apostles, illustrated by Raphael in the Cartoons (Victoria and Albert Museum). </p><p>More deeply, however - and as I discussed at greater length in French Painting in the Golden Age (Thames &amp; Hudson 2003) - Poussin is here concerned with the action of what Christians would consider the Holy Spirit (pneuma hagion) and what he, in his more syncretistic and philosophical perspective, identified with the Stoic Logos, the reason or spirit that governs the cosmos. This Greek philosophical term had already been used by St John in the opening of his Gospel: \"In the beginning was the Word.\"</p><p>The other two paintings mentioned demonstrate the power of the Word to redeem in the first case and quite literally to bring death in the second (Sapphira's death is the consequence of her lie); and here, in the first miracle of the Apostles after Christ's death, Peter discovers that he, too, can become the instrument of the Word or Logos and heal a cripple, while John points to the celestial original of their power.</p><p>But there is more. It may seem strange that this important subject is dwarfed, in the middle ground, by apparently secondary figures in the foreground; but that is because they are not secondary after all: there are no accidents or oversights in Poussin's work. Look at the costumes: Peter is wearing the blue and yellow which are his standard colours in iconography; the young man on the right is wearing green and red, which are the colours of Saint Paul, and the point is made more emphatic by the overlapping of his figure with that of Peter. </p><p>This young man must be Saint Paul, who first appears as Saul a few chapters later in Acts, initially as an enemy of the Christians, before his famous conversion on the road to Damascus. But it is typical of Poussin's originality - as we see in his mythologies too - to adopt a more philosophical interpretation of the story: the real action of the Logos in this picture is not merely in healing the cripple, but in taking possession of the mind of Saul, who points towards the miracle while the old man on the right, departing with an appalled expression on his face, represents the mind that is impervious to the Word and remains trapped in darkness. </p><p>Thus this picture could perhaps better be titled The Conversion of Saint Paul, something which seems to have escaped all other Poussin scholars until now, and which I had not realised until I studied the picture closely in Brisbane. </p><p>And there is yet more: we may see in the figure of Paul an allusion to justification by faith, while the balancing figure on the left, giving alms to a poor woman, stands for justification by deeds; but in a final example of Poussin's extraordinary originality as a philosopher-painter, the focus is not on the giver of alms, who appears almost distracted, but on the recipient of the charity, who seems to experience a kind of epiphany as she receives not a material gift but the Word itself. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">European Masterpieces from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Gallery of Modern Art, until October 17.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-88567d89fc899034a44b1aa25a95bef1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6329-H531-DY66-519T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1756\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 2, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MCB (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>template-series-458e27db84c5814ede57aa8b6d10bc0d-midfooter-3</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>art</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001753</classCode><className>ARTS FESTIVALS &amp;

In the short term, most pundits agree that Trump's main motivation for cutting WHO funding was to deflect blame from his own bungled handling of COVID-19 on home soil. His <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-coronavirus-approval-rating-442a186f-0b10-467b-afb0-8ec408d8e349.html\">approval ratings</url> are at an all-time low and the US now has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">more cases</url> of coronavirus than any other country. </p><p>In the longer term, withdrawing from multilateral partnerships aligns with Trump's zero-sum worldview. As with <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/24/news/donald-trump-nato-spending/\">Nato</url>, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/business/trump-trade-war-wto.html\">World Trade Organization</url> and virtually every other international body, Trump feels that the US is getting a bad deal from its WHO contribution. And he bristles at the thought of foreign nations exploiting American generosity. </p><p>Former presidents have worked to develop, maintain and promote an Anglophone, dollar-backed international world order built on American values of capitalism, liberalism, democracy, integration and the transparent rule of law. This has fostered an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/we-enjoy-the-most-peaceful-period-on-earth-ever_b_57ab4b34e4b08c46f0e47130?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJ-nITOdRIWCMCTezN_XkHM7PHCk_fAkCeefxRvpEtdflAqiirefCmFl4zyjm1wVgTBUaNXECdkcgcqvrksLt19ROYH2475HHa8rTookRgtGzIcphwfbCegSZsja8g1a3ytqo22NrXYfkXelBwK3WLzQSNZtD4SXXdsPRZ_vB0LE\">unprecedented era</url> of peace, stability, international cooperation and integration of markets (as well as massive socioeconomic inequality) - projecting American soft power and allowing national firms to enter formerly closed markets. </p><p>In Trump's view, his predecessors were chumps who allowed other countries to abuse American generosity while flouting the rules: from Nato allies shirking their responsibilities to China's currency manipulation, intellectual property theft and disproportionate access to the WHO.</p><p>Yet defunding the WHO is a microcosmic act that illustrates the folly of Trump's \"America first\" approach. The sums involved are peanuts to the administration - less than it costs to run a large hospital. Yet the US gets enormous bang for its buck. Its citizens are over-represented among WHO leadership and technical staff, and as a member state, it has never been afraid to use its clout to veto documents and clauses that threaten its commercial interests. The WHO's irreplaceable work in sharing information and promoting science-based practice also benefits American citizens during the pandemic. </p><h>Eastward shift in power</h><p>Withdrawing from the international stage also leaves a superpower-sized leadership hole that only China can fill. If Trump wants the WHO to be more effective and less China-centric, then surely the remedy is more US engagement, not less.</p><p>Besides expediting the eastward shift of power, the bigger picture is that continued disengagement from lopsided international partnerships will hurt his base more than anyone else. It will lead to higher export tariffs, increasingly expensive imports, higher costs of living - and later on, geopolitical instability and weakened alliances. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52291654\">World leaders lined up</url> to condemn Trump's assault on multilateralism, sparking a rare moment of coordination in a pandemic hitherto marked by international fragmentation. Selfish, reckless or misguidedly patriotic - whatever your take on Trump's castigation, there is no denying that it couldn't come at a worse time for the fragile states depending on the WHO to guide them through this raging inferno. It seems this move will achieve the exact opposite of everything Trump has intended: a worse deal for ordinary US citizens, a weaker America and an ever more China-centric global order.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dr Luke Allen is a health policy researcher at the University of Oxford.

Someone's life could be on the line\", the video states that the attached penalty is severe.</p><p>Emma Pritchard, a firefighter at Clunes Fire Brigade, recently expressed her and other members' frustration in the form of a Facebook post on the brigade's page, that people being alerted to an incident through the VicEmergency app were subsequently choosing to show up to have a 'sticky beak'.</p><p>Ms Pritchard, who also acts in a Community Engagement role at the brigade, said that firefighters had noticed more people turning up on foot, on motorbikes or in cars to fires, including at the recent fast moving grass fire near the Clunes township on January 29.</p><p>Another recent example was the Hepburn fire a year ago, during which people travelled to strategic locations in order to get a bird's eye view of the fire, using the same roads emergency responders were utilising.</p><p>Mr Bigham said if the wind had changed causing the fire to change direction, those people could have been unwittingly caught in a potential impact zone.</p><p>If people receive alerts via the VicEmergency app before firefighters are paged, some can turn up at a fire scene before firefighters and other emergency services have a chance to set up roadblocks. Some people are even following fire trucks to incidents to see what unfolds.</p><p>Ms Pritchard said as firefighters arrive at a scene and try to work out the best source of entry, it is ideal to have the least amount of people in an area to reduce unnecessary congestion.</p><p>\"When we are on our way to a job we are thinking about so many different things and the last thing we need to be worrying about is that extra layer of who else we need to be concerned about and who else we need to protect,\" she said.</p><p>Using the recent grass fire at Albert Street as an example, she said it was particularly dangerous as people who did not need to be near the scene were blocking firefighter access to roads and causing unnecessary increased traffic as well as putting themselves in danger. She said the brigade had also experienced high traffic and people obviously driving by just to take a look when responding to an incident at Fairview, off the Maryborough Road.</p><p>She believes one reason for stickybeaks is that in an age of instant online information, people also want access to news relating to an emergency instantaneously. Ms Pritchard encouraged community members to play their part in an emergency situation and take responsibility for their own safety.</p><p>Mr Bigham said the app was a fantastic initiative designed to alert and educate the community about incidents to ultimately keep people safe and give them the opportunity to enact their fire plans.</p><p>Most incidents require a multi-agency response and are attended by the CFA, Ambulance Victoria, Forest Fire Management Victoria, Victoria Police and the State Emergency Service so there are already many people on scene.</p><p>\"We are all key responders and personnel in these types of incidents and so if we all take appliances, it is quite an increased dynamic and dangerous environment and yet we've got an increase in community members on the roads or in person on foot,\" Mr Bigham said. \"That adds to the potential for a collision or for an accident.

Someone's life could be on the line\", the video states that the attached penalty is severe.</p><p>Emma Pritchard, a firefighter at Clunes Fire Brigade, recently expressed her and other members' frustration in the form of a Facebook post on the brigade's page, that people being alerted to an incident through the VicEmergency app were subsequently choosing to show up to have a 'sticky beak'.</p><p>Ms Pritchard, who also acts in a Community Engagement role at the brigade, said that firefighters had noticed more people turning up on foot, on motorbikes or in cars to fires, including at the recent fast moving grass fire near the Clunes township on January 29.</p><p>Another recent example was the Hepburn fire a year ago, during which people travelled to strategic locations in order to get a bird's eye view of the fire, using the same roads emergency responders were utilising.</p><p>Mr Bigham said if the wind had changed causing the fire to change direction, those people could have been unwittingly caught in a potential impact zone.</p><p>If people receive alerts via the VicEmergency app before firefighters are paged, some can turn up at a fire scene before firefighters and other emergency services have a chance to set up roadblocks. Some people are even following fire trucks to incidents to see what unfolds.</p><p>Ms Pritchard said as firefighters arrive at a scene and try to work out the best source of entry, it is ideal to have the least amount of people in an area to reduce unnecessary congestion.</p><p>\"When we are on our way to a job we are thinking about so many different things and the last thing we need to be worrying about is that extra layer of who else we need to be concerned about and who else we need to protect,\" she said.</p><p>Using the recent grass fire at Albert Street as an example, she said it was particularly dangerous as people who did not need to be near the scene were blocking firefighter access to roads and causing unnecessary increased traffic as well as putting themselves in danger. She said the brigade had also experienced high traffic and people obviously driving by just to take a look when responding to an incident at Fairview, off the Maryborough Road.</p><p>She believes one reason for stickybeaks is that in an age of instant online information, people also want access to news relating to an emergency instantaneously. Ms Pritchard encouraged community members to play their part in an emergency situation and take responsibility for their own safety.</p><p>Mr Bigham said the app was a fantastic initiative designed to alert and educate the community about incidents to ultimately keep people safe and give them the opportunity to enact their fire plans.</p><p>Most incidents require a multi-agency response and are attended by the CFA, Ambulance Victoria, Forest Fire Management Victoria, Victoria Police and the State Emergency Service so there are already many people on scene.</p><p>\"We are all key responders and personnel in these types of incidents and so if we all take appliances, it is quite an increased dynamic and dangerous environment and yet we've got an increase in community members on the roads or in person on foot,\" Mr Bigham said. \"That adds to the potential for a collision or for an accident. That we really don't want.\"</p><p>Smythesdale Fire Brigade Captain Alwyn Parker, who has been involved with the CFA for 52 years, said he and his brigade had also noticed \"rubberneckers\" attending accident scenes and fires.</p><p>As fire scenes or road accidents are often investigated, he said with more feet on the ground, there was a potential for evidence to be compromised before crime scene or fire investigators arrive. Community members are urged to use more than one source of information in an emergency, such as the Vic Emergency app as well ABC Radio.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc796rixq9jhw183j54vz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y57-H6X1-JD34-V4CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 8, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

During the early years of my professional life it was expected that nurses would kowtow to, and quietly accept, the abusive behaviour of male medical staff. The throwing of instruments and packs in the operating theatre, rude and aggressive verbal abuse, intimidation and, in some cases, physical abuse were accepted by both junior and senior nurses who were completely disempowered to object. Nurses were always seen as fair game and expected to \"take it\". Thankfully many of the medical dinosaurs have gone and our sons are now leading the way in accepting nurses for their professionalism, knowledge and contribution as equal partners in the delivery of care</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kay Foster, South Yarra</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Make it jobs for the boys</p><p>Our (manly) Prime Minister thinks that there are women's problems to be solved, so he creates a parcel of (female) ministers responsible for doing the work. I believe they are men's problems, so he should give the jobs to the boys. Let's have (male) ministers who are responsible and accountable for the prevention of male violence, the elimination of male chauvinism, the abolition of rape, and the minimisation of sexist approaches to problem-solving.</p><p>Ray Wilson, Northcote</p><p>A misjudged comment</p><p>Liberal Party federal vice-president Teena McQueen demonstrates that being a woman in politics does not make you an exemplar of wisdom or charity. \"Senior Liberal 'said she would kill to be harassed\"' (The Age, 31/3). Luckily there are plenty of women who demonstrate these qualities. Just not in the Liberal Party. The old saw that it is a fine line between stupid and brave applies. It is just that Ms McQueen has not heard it.</p><p>Carmel Boyle, Alfredton</p><p>Please, it was a joke</p><p>The world has gone crazy when what was obviously a throwaway line from Teena McQueen requires front page reporting and a public apology. The likes of Bob Hope, Benny Hill et al will be turning in their graves. (Oops. That was a joke, I didn't mean it. Sorry.)</p><p>Barbara Abell, Essendon</p><p>Reality of harassment</p><p>Clearly Teena McQueen believes sexual harassment is something that happens only to pretty, young women. I always thought it had more to do with abuse of power and lack of respect rather than sex appeal.Emilio Bedin, Narre Warren</p><p>Changing the attitudes</p><p>Clearly Scott Morrison had difficulty separating the message from the media - \"PM has finally taken steps to show that he is listening\" (The Age, 30/3). Social media might be a means by which women can be abused and threatened, but it is the attitude behind it that needs to change if you want to stop the abuse. Prime Minister, whether advertising a barbecue via online or printed newspapers, you need to provide the steak, not just the sizzle.</p><p>Anne Rutland, Brunswick West</p><p>A $1 billion distraction</p><p>Scott Morrison's latest attempt to deflect scrutiny away from his government's poor performance in aged care and the treatment of women is to spend $1 billion on home-made guided missiles (The Age, 31/3). Another case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p><p>Chris Burgess, Port Melbourne</p><p>When the numbers matter</p><p>Lou Ferrari (Letters, 30/3) raises an interesting issue about whether numbers could impact on Scott Morrison's decision not to sack Andrew Laming. Couldn't the same ethics rationale be applied to Julia Gillard's refusal to sack Craig Thomson and Peter Slipper to maintain her numbers?</p><p>Pat Lyons, Melbourne</p><p>Enough of the toxicity</p><p>Much has been said about the toxic culture that has developed in our Parliament. Witness the vitriol often associated with Question Time and consider the model of respect that is projected from the top down. It is time for change.</p><p>Wayne Brewster, East Brighton</p><p>Time for accountability</p><p>Once again our Prime Minister sends his minions to attack the states and territories to distract from his government's failings. He did it during Victoria's long lockdown and now he does it again to cover up his bungling of the COVID vaccine rollout. Isn't it time for a little self-reflection on his government's failings - the vaccine rollout, treatment of women and continued support for a disgraced MP? Perhaps our Prime Minister should be looking for a suitable course to enrol in - Honesty, Accountability and Owning It, 101.</p><p>Bridget Meldrum, Middle Park</p><p>Legitimate questions</p><p>Why has the Victorian public been \"blindfolded\" by its media as to its Premier's recent accident?</p><p>There has been an absence of reporting about the property where the accident occurred, its rental value, if the steps were dangerous, possible liability by anyone, public liability insurance and whether the Premier will sue. A rumour mill has arisen to fill the vacuum, driven by an apparent compact of the media to ensure no detail arises within the public domain. We trust the Premier is recovering quickly, and without impediment.Peter Alexander,</p><p>South Yarra</p><p>Stranger than fiction</p><p>The bonuses paid to the train and tram companies (The Age, 31/3) reminded me of the Yes Minister episode that showed the paradox of a new hospital working better, and more cheaply and efficiently, when it was empty of patients.</p><p>Steven Sapountsis, Glen Iris</p><p>Focus on our children</p><p>Just days ago, Victoria's Commissioner for Children and Young People issued another damning report on the plight of abused children. There has been virtually no public commentary on it, while strong voices - for abused women, aged care, mental health, and more - speak out.</p><p>Governments cherry-pick responses to social issues. They inquire, they act reluctantly if at all. Children's voices, however, are likely to be the first drowned out as others, rightly, demand change.</p><p>The problem? There is no overall plan to deal with social need. As Australia embraces individualism, there is increased pressure on society's victims who, despite the evidence, continue to be blamed for their plight. It is unacceptable for there to be winners and losers among society's most needy as we recover from COVID-19, but this is a likely outcome. We must ensure children's needs are among the high priorities.</p><p>Dr Max and Dr Marg Liddell, Coburg</p><p>Sorry, Steve, but no</p><p>So, Steve Smith has let it be known he would like to reclaim the position of Australian Test captain (Sport, 31/3). Tell him he's dreamin'.Bruce Thomas,</p><p>St Kilda East</p><p>So many work so hard</p><p>Re the fees charged by an anaesthetist (Letters, 31/3). Many low-paid as well as under and unemployed people \"studied very hard for six years of high school\", worked double shifts or more and acquired experience in lieu of study at low pay rates over many years. Skills, risk, knowledge and experience are fair considerations in determining fees, including justifiably high ones, but years of study and long hours in the early years of training and beyond not so much. They apply to many people outside the medical profession. Also, these days, there is no guaranteed correlation between commitment to study and hours worked, and employability and its corresponding rewards - as any educated, experienced, hard-working and retrenched worker aged 50-plus, or unemployed university graduate, will attest.</p><p>Emma Borghesi, Mount Martha</p><p>The haves and have nots</p><p>An estimated 150,000 honest and hardworking Australians may lose their jobs with the ending of JobKeeper. Disgraced Liberal MP Andrew Laming, whose actions have been condemned by all, will keep his job until the next election (presumably about 12 months away) on a base backbencher's salary of more than $200,000 per annum. He also has been granted medical leave to undergo empathy training. Will those Australians who are losing their JobKeeper payments receive a further 12 months' salary and extended medical leave to undertake empathy training? Certainly not. Where is the justice?</p><p>David Baker, Parkdale</p><p>When too big is too much</p><p>What is it that makes anyone think population growth is good (The Age, 31/3)? Melbourne is catching up with Sydney. Scenic coastal areas are \"doing well\". But is a bigger Melbourne better? Is a bigger (more suburban) holiday spot better? At what point do you say enough is enough?</p><p>Peter Seligman, Brunswick</p><p>Please, read the science</p><p>About 85 per cent of East Gippsland was burnt in the 2019/2020 fires. This week Forest Fire Management Victoria is lighting remote, unburnt forests adjacent to the fire damage, killing already decimated species and increasing the vast area of flammable regrowth. Scientists have called for the remaining green refuges to be protected. But burning is now an industry in Victoria. The Victorian government urgently needs to read the science.</p><p>Rosalind Crisp, Orbost</p><p>Our much-loved Age</p><p>The recent cyber attack on Nine made me aware of how much I rely on The Age. It gives me guidance to restaurants, streaming, movies, books, live shows, galleries and cultural events. The standard of many of your journalists is high and seems even to be getting higher. The app is my first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Thank you to The Age.</p><p>Jennifer Storrie, Melbourne</p><p>Stop, you're killing me</p><p>A funny column, Danny Katz - \"Three actors lead Dave and I to a fabricated finale\" (Opinion, 29/3).

With the blue sky gone and the green forest blackened, it truly looks like hell on earth.</p><p>But from the dust of those barren fire grounds, the most remarkable Australian spirit has arisen.</p><p>I have been privileged to meet ordinary people who have lived through extraordinary times and they have banded together and supported one another in a way that upholds a deeper Aussie tradition.</p><p>I have heard stories of people putting their own lives at risk to warn and help their neighbours evacuate; stories of those who have lost their own homes opting to stay in their communities and continue helping others in need.</p><p>I have been so very proud of our own CFA members, who have dropped everything to heed the call for help on the eastern fire fronts.</p><p>To see the Warrnambool tanker sitting proudly in the East Gippsland Swan Reach base camp, 600km from home, just shows the dedication of our people and their staunch commitment to serve and protect communities that are so far from their own.</p><p>In the picturesque hamlet of Wairewa, I met the local CFA captain, who went house to house the night the fire tore through, collecting residents and gathering them in the community hall.</p><p>The CFA generator was set up to give them power and the fire truck stood guard, protecting all inside. While they lost nearly half the homes in their town, the actions of the Wairewa brigade certainly saved lives that night.</p><p>Cobungra in the northeast has a similar story to tell, where a single truck and a handful of volunteers defended the township from the alpine fire front. While several homes were lost, everyone survived and the damage could have been far worse.</p><p>THE extraordinary generosity of Victorians has been such that relief centres were overwhelmed with donated goods. When the call went out to instead donate money, millions upon millions of dollars poured in to worthy causes supporting relief efforts, injured wildlife and our own CFA brigades.</p><p>My CFA members and I have also been incredibly touched by numerous messages of support and thanks from the community. But we are just one part of an incredible inter-agency response including Forest Fire Management Victoria, other emergency services, charities, councils, government departments and community groups that are all deserving of your praise and gratitude.</p><p>On behalf of that entire collective, I would like to extend our own thanks to the communities who have welcomed us, supported us and followed our directions.</p><p>This team effort has been running solidly for exactly two months today, since the East Gippsland fires started on November 21. I wish I could say it's nearly over but unfortunately we are not even halfway through our usual Victorian fire season.</p><p>We need our communities to stick with us, to remain vigilant and continue checking local conditions and warnings.</p><p>We have been through a lot together but it's not over yet.</p><p>Climate change is increasing the frequency, severity and timing of dangerous bushfire weather conditions. Our fire seasons are longer and events such as drought are combining with extreme heat to create the conditions we are now battling in the east of the state.</p><p>We used to focus on January to March as our highest-risk period, but we are now seeing significant fires taking off in November and sometimes continuing through to April. So there is potentially a way to go yet.</p><p>But as we creep towards Australia Day and its different meanings to many people, I reflect upon the ancient nature of this land, our proud indigenous cultures and their own remarkable interactions with fire.</p><p>I think about what it is that brings Australians together when the going gets tough. At times like these it's clear that a uniting spirit has been forged in flames, which will burn on long after these fires are extinguished.STEVE WARRINGTON IS THE CHIEF OFFICER AND CEO OF THE CFA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-fa1f360a3b1511ea9ebeb43f0ebb14895a7e87f96d504e7dc896ee68964aba7a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1C-C751-JD3N-50N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We are among the many authors who contributed.</p><p>It's an important record of the magnitude and speed of changes to global climate, drawing on the latest data from across the fields of climate science. </p><h>A record year</h><p>Global average temperatures in 2019 were 1.1? above pre-industrial levels. Only 2016 was hotter, but that year came at the end of an extreme El Ni\u00f1o, which typically has a warming influence on global temperatures.</p><p>The last five years were the world's five warmest on record. Areas which were especially warm, with temperatures in 2019 more than 2? above average, included parts of Australia, Alaska and northern Russia, eastern Europe and southern Africa. Central North America was the only significant land area with below-average temperatures. </p><p>Human-driven climate change is predominantly caused by increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, the three most potent greenhouse gases, have continued to grow and are now, respectively, 147%, 259% and 123% of pre-industrial levels, measured in the year 1750.</p><p>Global emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels reached a record high of 36.6 billion tonnes, of which about half is absorbed by vegetation and oceans. </p><p>The Antarctic ozone hole was its smallest since 2002, after an unusually early spring breakdown of the Antarctic polar vortex following a <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-air-above-antarctica-is-suddenly-getting-warmer-heres-what-it-means-for-australia-123080\">sudden warming</url> in the polar stratosphere. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The air above Antarctica is suddenly getting warmer - here's what it means for Australia</emphasis></p><p>Many other indicators of large-scale climate change continued their long-term trends in 2019. These include the heat content of the global ocean - an important indicator because around 90% of warming generated by greenhouse gases from human activities is taken by the oceans. </p><p>In 2019, ocean heat content reached the highest levels since instrumental records began. Global mean sea level also reached new highs in 2019, while Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent was well below average.</p><p>Glacial mass declined for the 32nd consecutive year. In Switzerland, for example, glacier loss over the past five years has exceeded 10%, the highest rate of decline in more than a century. </p><h>Australia's fire and drought</h><p>The report confirms the ongoing drought in Australia and exceptional fire weather conditions late in the year were among the most significant global climate events last year.</p><p>2019 was Australia's warmest and driest year since national records began - the <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/weather-bureau-says-hottest-driest-year-on-record-led-to-extreme-bushfire-season-129447\">first time</url> both records have been broken in the same year.</p><p>In December, the monthly accumulated Forest Fire Danger Index - an indicator of severe fire weather - was the highest on record for any month in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the ACT. Some fires burned for longer than two months. </p><p>In January and February 2019, a dry summer in Tasmania contributed to fires in the normally moist western and central parts of the island - the second time in four years that fires burnt regions where historically such events were extremely rare.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The world may lose half its sandy beaches by 2100. It's not too late to save most of them</emphasis></p><p>The drought was strongly influenced by a very strong positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole - an oscillation of sea surface temperatures which affects the climate in Australia. A strong negative Southern Annular Mode - a climate driver which originates in Antarctica - brought westerly winds and dry conditions to the eastern states from September.</p><p>Australia was not the only nation affected by drought in 2019 - southern Africa, southeast Asia and central Chile were also significantly affected. In the Chilean capital Santiago, rainfall was more than 70% below average.</p><h>Heatwaves and cyclones</h><p>Two exceptional heatwaves affected Europe in the summer. France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom all had their highest recorded temperatures. Belgium and the Netherlands both reached 40? for the first time, and Paris reached a high of 42.6?.</p><p>Australia had extreme heatwaves both early and late in the year, and in South America, temperatures exceeded 30? as far south as Tierra del Fuego. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Rain has eased the dry, but more is needed to break the drought</emphasis></p><p>Tropical cyclones are amongst the most destructive weather phenomena in most years, and 2019 was no exception. The most severe cyclone impact was in  Mozambique and Zimbabwe, when Cyclone Idai hit in mid-March, killing more than 900 people.</p><p>Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest ever to affect land in the North Atlantic, caused massive destruction in the Bahamas, whilst Typhoon Hagibis led to exceptional flooding in Japan, and daily rainfall of more than 900 millimetres. The North Indian Ocean also had its most active cyclone season on record.</p><h>Looking to the future</h><p>Global climate projections show that under all scenarios, temperatures will continue to warm - and years such as 2019 will become the norm this decade. </p><p>The report is intended to inform decisions around the world on adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blair Trewin receives funding from the Bureau of Meteorology and the World Meteorological Organization.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pep Canadell receives funding from the National Environmental Science Program and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAUS-133056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD2-JRB1-DXP7-12HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><timeReceived>7:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Australia</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6070\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 10, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

Such a move would mean   Republicans retake control of the 50-50 Senate, ending President Biden's legislative agenda.</p><p>'New Kennedys'</p><p>Democratic heavies Vice-President Kamala Harris, a former California senator, and senator Elizabeth Warren have been campaigning in the Golden State in recent weeks, curtain-raisers for President   Biden's arrival for Newsom's final rally in Long Beach on Tuesday AEST.</p><p>Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor dubbed one of the \"new Kennedys\" by Harper's Bazaar when he was married to Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr's current girlfriend, is fighting to avoid being the second US governor to be recalled.</p><p>In 2003 former Democrat governor Gray Davis, a few months into his second term, was ousted by a recall vote, replaced by   actor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state's last Republican governor.</p><p>Newsom's own movie star looks have failed to inoculate the first-term governor against a small-business community enraged by the nation's longest lockdown, gig workers, and Republicans who've smelt vulnerability.</p><p>\"If you're going to tax people at a high rate, destroy small businesses, put hardworking blue-collar people on the street, and then brag about your $80bn budget surplus, I find that offensive,\" says Ram Duriseti, a 51-year-old emergency room physician living in the Bay Area.</p><p>Newsom's critics have furnished an exhaustive list of reasons to dump him, from high taxation, arbitrary rule, poor forest fire management, homelessness and unworkable industrial relations, persuasive enough to have attracted 2.1 million signatures, 600,000 more than needed under state law to trigger a recall vote.</p><p>\"He's the epitome of his hypocrisy, all 'do as I say not as I do',\" says Lydia Olson, a full-time Uber driver in the San Francisco Bay area, bristling at the Governor's decision to cut public servants' pay by 10 per cent but exempt his own.</p><p>\"And then there's the French Laundry,\" she exclaims, recounting what's become - almost everyone I spoke to in California brought it up - Newsom's signature blunder, being photographed at a high-end restaurant in Napa last November with pharmaceutical executives without a mask, flouting his own rules.</p><p>After weeks of steadily narrowing, the polls have drifted in Newsom's favour: 56 per cent of voters oppose the recall motion, and 42 per cent are in favour, according to the latest average of credible statewide polls published by Nate Silver. But it's not so simple where voting isn't compulsory.</p><p>About half of likely voters say they haven't decided how to vote yet or wouldn't vote for any of the replacement candidates on the recall ballot, according to a recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. </p><p>California is solidly Democrat, but motivated Republicans might be more likely to vote.</p><p>\"It's a bet on propensity,\" says Steve Haro, a veteran Democrat strategist and principal at Mehlman and Castagnetti, arguing the recall was a low-cost way for Republicans to destabilise the Governor.</p><p>\"It's a colossal waste of time and taxpayer dimes because the state is now stuck footing the bill for a frivolous election that should not have been triggered,\" Haro tells The Australian, referring to a $276m estimate for the total state and county costs for running the recall election.</p><p>Under California's recall rules, a new governor could be elected with a tiny number of votes. </p><p>The ballot has two separate questions, of which voters can answer either or both.</p><p>Should Newsom be recalled? And who should replace him, with a list of 46 hopefuls including Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender former gold medal-winning decathlete, and Larry Elder, a black American conservative talk-show host, to pick from.</p><p>A simple majority in favour of a yes vote would see Newsom replaced by the candidate who obtained the most votes, even if that were a piddling figure in a state of 40 million people.</p><p>'Not a coup'</p><p>Shannon Hile, 39, a volunteer for one of the Republican contenders, Kevin Kiley, bristles at the idea Republicans were behind the recall.</p><p>\"We made our own signs, bought our own banners; they didn't back us one bit, it's ridiculous they call this a Republican coup. They didn't even join in until we had enough signatures,\" she adds.</p><p>\"Everyone has their own reasons for signing; I'm a single mum and I was unable to work because I have a small child,\" she adds.</p><p>California has had the longest, strictest lockdown among US states, lasting with varying degrees of severity from March 2020 to June 2021. And, unlike other states, Newsom still hasn't ended a state of emergency order that allows him to govern by decree.</p><p>\"I've been in snow, rain, smoke; Covid held us back too, actually at some point we thought Newsom was shutting us down for so long to slow down the campaign,\" Hile says. </p><p>Almost 18 months since the pandemic began, more than 5 per cent of California's schools are still fully remote, according to the American Enterprise Institute's school tracker, a higher share than in any other US state.</p><p>At the 38 per cent of schools that have reintroduced face-to-face teaching five days a week, children over the age of two are still required to socially distance and wear a mask, even outside.</p><p>A perceived war on gig workers has put the Governor at odds with gig workers too. California passed \"assembly Bill 5\" in January 2020, which reclassified millions of independent contractors across California as \"employees\" in a radical rewrite of the state's industrial relations laws. Employers had to prove, with documentation, their contractors were not employees.</p><p>Tech giants Uber and Lyft later won exemptions for their drivers and delivery workers, but for thousands of other gig workers it meant unemployment in a state with a jobless rate of 7.6 per cent, more than two percentage points above the national average.</p><p>Recall votes aren't new to California, where they are easier to trigger than other states owing to progressive reforms going back to the early 1910s. But, while Schwarzenegger himself has drawn parallels between his own 2003 contest and Newsom's present political predicament, the state has grown only more staunchly Democratic since then. </p><p>Republican Elder </p><p>After Jenner's campaign fizzled - \"it feels a bit comical, is this really serious?\" says Duriseti - Elder became the de facto Republican frontrunner, eclipsing the more traditional Republican 36-year-old California assemblyman Kiley, who wrote a 200-page book in January outlining the case against Newsom.</p><p>Dubbed the \"black face of white supremacy\" by a Los Angeles Times columnist in August, Elder has been cast as a Trump-supporting extremist, despite a platform of reopening schools and curbing the state's notoriously high levels of homelessness and crime.</p><p>\"I love Trump but at the same time, at this point, it's a good thing he's letting California get on with it. We want everyone to look at this with clear eyes,\" says Republican volunteer Hile. </p><p>The former president did weigh in a few days later though, suggesting the verdict would be \"rigged\". \"Millions of millions of ballots will make this just another giant election scam,\" he said in a short statement on Monday afternoon (ET), remarks that have pleased the Newsom camp. </p><p>Leading Democrats, including Governor Newsom, failed to condemn a white woman wearing a gorilla mask who threw an egg at\u00a0Elder as he campaigned near Venice Beach in Los Angeles  last week.</p><p>\"Whatever your views on abortion, it properly terrorises the average Californian Democrat and, frankly, the average Californian moderate Republican,\" says Duriseti, referring to Texas's recent, highly controversial move to outlaw abortion after six weeks.</p><p>Kevin Paffrath, a 29-year-old real estate broker and the only Democrat brave enough to put his name on the ballot, says Elder's candidacy has been a godsend for Newsom. </p><p>\"He was just talking about Republicans taking your voting rights, which was boring; now they've got someone who they can paint as extreme,\" he says.</p><p>Donald Trump weighed in on Moday afternoon (ET), saying in a statement: \"Millions and millions of mail-in ballots will make this just another giant election scam, no different, but less blatant, than the 2020 presidential election scam!\" Coming less than 24 hours before Californians head to the polls to render their verdict on Newsom in a special election, the former president's comments could depress Republican turnout and further boost the Democratic incumbent's prospects.</p><p>\"Republicans have never had a coherent message,\" said Tyler Law, a Democratic operative in California. \"They have never made a coherent and simple case for why a Democratic governor elected in a landslide in an overwhelmingly Democratic state should be recalled and replaced by a conservative Republican. That's a tough case to make and they failed spectacularly at making it.\"</p><p>The bulk of experts believe Newsom will win. </p><p>\"The Dems have practised holding power in that state for a long time, gerrymandered, and have built advantages that can't be understated,\" says one veteran Democrat adviser in DC.</p><p>\"At the same time, the Republican fundraising apparatus has fallen apart and the Republican political class just moved out of California,\" he adds, preferring not to be named.</p><p>The state that catapulted Ronald Reagan, governor from 1967 to 1975, to national fame has become progressively more and more Democrat.</p><p>\"Basically, it started to shift after \"prop 187\" was passed in 1994, a measure that prohibited undocumented immigrants from being able to use public schools, and that enraged a lot of people,\" Haro explains.</p><p>Newsom is a smart politician, a survivor, and glamorous in a state famous for Hollywood, and he's not running against an Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p>\"Even if Elder won, the state legislature, 75 per cent Democrat, wouldn't let him govern properly, waiting until the next governor election in 2022,\" says Paffrath.</p><p>About seven million Californians have voted already via mail-in ballot; 34 per cent of them from Democrats and 30 per cent from Republicans. Whether enough of the 22 per cent of ballots sent in by independents are angry with Newsom remains to be seen.</p><p>Olson, who ferries Californians around for work daily, is quietly optimistic. </p><p>\"September 14th can't come soon enough, I say to them, and there's a lot of appreciative chuckling,\" she says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McGowan throws Weinstein grenade at Democrats </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Staff Reporters</emphasis></p><p>It's known as an \"October surprise\", when a bombshell allegation emerges ahead of a November US presidential election. And although it's September, and these are the final days before an election that concerns the state of California mostly, it's as you might expect from the home of Hollywood - a surprise has unfolded like a late-season twist in an HBO Max series. </p><p>Two days before Tuesday's deadline for Californians to decide whether to recall Governor </p><p>Gavin Newsom - ostensibly a backlash over his response to the Covid-19 pandemic but taking stock, to some extent, of the Democrats' tumultuous first 10 months in the White House - allegations have been levelled against his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. </p><p>Former actor and #MeToo campaigner Rose McGowan has accused the Governor's wife of trying to suppress McGowan's sexual assault claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. </p><p>On Sunday, McGowan aired the claims at a press conference in Los Angeles with Republican frontrunner Larry Elder, whom she endorsed as \"the better man\". Declaring she was \"no longer a Democrat\", McGowan said that in 2017 Newsom phoned to ask that she drop her claims against Weinstein. \"Gavin Newsom, you're facing a recall because you're a fraud, just like your wife,\" McGowan reportedly told the rally. The Newsom camp has branded the \"desperate\" allegations as \"outrageous and false\" . </p><p>Newsom, a documentary filmmaker and actor, has four children with the Governor. </p><p>It's hard to say whether McGowan's intervention will matter much. More than a third of California's active registered voters had reportedly cast their ballots by Saturday. While most pundits say Newsom should win comfortably, the outcome of the election depends on Democrat voters turning out to support the Governor.

Miki Perkins reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EXPLAINER</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A cool, gentle, creeping fire came to the bushland that surrounds the Tang Tang and Thunder swamps in Central Victoria, north of Bendigo. It burnt gently through grasslands and connected up with other fires lit on the forest floor to create a mosaic effect.</p><p>This fire was lit by Dja Dja Wurrung people, including employees of Forest Fire Management Victoria, and their non-Aboriginal colleagues in 2019. It was the first cultural burn in the area in 170 years. It was a momentous day, says Trent Nelson, the chairperson of the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation. In the years since cultural burning had been used, the landscape had become degraded and \"sick\". The region, which includes the towns of Daylesford, Bendigo and Boort, used to be cloaked in box-ironbark forests and woodlands but is now one of the most profoundly altered landscapes in Victoria, where agriculture, urban settlement and mining have left ecosystems fragmented. Nelson learnt cultural burning - known as \"djandak wii\", or \"country fire\" - from his father, who learnt from his father before him and other elders. \"We don't make it really, really hot, we burn cool. It's a lot slower than planned burns.\"</p><p>After last year's catastrophic summer bushfires, there is heightened national interest in the role of Aboriginal cultural burning, sometimes called traditional burning. How does it work? And can it reduce the threat of out-of-control fires in an era of climate change?</p><p>What is it?</p><p>For at least 65,000 years, Aboriginal people have used cultural land management practices - including the use of fire - to care for country (the term used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to describe family origins, ownership and associations with particular areas of Australia). Cultural burns are done by Indigenous custodians, or people given their permission and guidance. The use of fire is specific to each location, its animals and flora and their totemic and cultural value. There are many interconnected objectives: the protection of cultural or natural assets by maintaining the health of surrounding country, ceremony, habitat protection and fuel reduction. But fuel reduction - targeted burning to reduce the amount or density of foliage - is often not the primary objective.</p><p>Indigenous land management was critical to preventing catastrophic bushfires, the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements was told in 2020, but Aboriginal voices had been ignored. \"Cultural land management is not an add-on or an enhancement, it's not a practice that can simply be grafted onto the regime of non-Indigenous land managers,\" Euahlayi man and Australian National University researcher Bhiamie Eckford-Williamson told the commission.</p><p>He also said that short-term funding was a barrier to Aboriginal land management. \"It is not possible for groups to develop, to recruit, train and retain staff to maintain that corporate memory, to build relationships with non-Indigenous land management agencies over time, if their funding is not secure,\" he explained.</p><p>Most Australian wildfires occur in the northern tropical savanna, and most cultural burning also occurs in the NT, Queensland or Western Australia, according to the CSIRO.</p><p>In early-colonial art work, letters and journals, there is considerable historical evidence of Aboriginal use of fire. In 1836, naturalist Charles Darwin visited Sydney and commented on the sparsity of the trees and the prevalence of grasslands, much of which is now thick scrub: \"The extreme uniformity in the character of the vegetation is the most remarkable feature in the landscape of the greater part of New S. Wales. Everywhere we have open woodland, the ground being partially covered with a most thin pasture,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"Prescribed\" or \"hazard reduction\" burning is the process of applying fire to reduce the likelihood and severity of bushfires. While there are some crossovers between the two practices, cultural burning may also be used to clear important pathways or manage vegetation around significant sites.</p><p>How does it work?</p><p>Most cultural burns use \"cool\" fires - smaller, low-intensity fires - which reduce the risk of extreme, high flames that can burn whole trees and forest canopies. Protecting the canopy is considered paramount in cultural burning because it holds many precious resources - insects, bird nests, bats and shade. And canopy removal fundamentally alters the surrounding ecosystem - sunlight breaks through and dries out the soil. Unlike hazard-reduction burns, which can create walls of flame, cultural burning tends to use spot ignitions, creating a mosaic of fires that leaves space for wildlife to escape.</p><p>Oliver Costello, a Bundjalung man from the Northern Rivers region of NSW and chief executive of the Firesticks Alliance, gave the example of a burn near Guyra in NSW where Banbai rangers used cultural burning around an art site that contained a painting of an echidna, a Banbai totem.</p><p>The fire encouraged the growth of native grasses and reduced the density of vegetation so that echidnas could move around the area more easily and find food. Rangers saw more evidence of echidnas after burning, and more growth of a local endangered species, the black grevillea. \"The country has a culture and we're a part of that culture. When you apply the right fire to that culture, you're maintaining your identity with country, maintaining the land,\" Costello says.</p><p>How do you learn it?</p><p>A revival of Aboriginal knowledge of burning practices is being led through initiatives such as the Firesticks Alliance, an Indigenous-led network that does training, on-ground cultural burning and scientific monitoring of its ecological effects. Fire knowledge has been handed down through generations of Aboriginal families. Costello learnt from his stepfather, a senior Dalabon man from Arnhem Land, who knew how to use fire the traditional way. When his stepfather died, Costello realised how much knowledge had gone with him. It motivated Costello to go to university and focus on Indigenous knowledge systems and sustainability in an era of climate change. \"In NSW land management, no one was using cultural burning methodology and protocols, and no one was supporting people to burn their country,\" he says.</p><p>Over the past decade, the Firesticks Alliance has organised fire workshops in Cape York with Dr Tommy George, a Kuku Thaypan elder. George and his brother Dr George Musgrave (now both deceased) were granted honorary doctorates for their knowledge of fire management and ecology.</p><p>Firesticks Alliance practitioners burn on private and public land, including in NSW national parks. Since the 2019-20 summer bushfires, the alliance has fielded a huge increase in inquiries from private landholders and public land management agencies. One landowner in NSW credits cultural burning with saving structures on his remote bush property during the Gospers Mountain fire.</p><p>Does it work?</p><p>There is a small but growing body of Western academic research on cultural burning and it chimes with what Aboriginal experts have always known. For example, scientists analysing data on fire-scarred land in northern Australia on behalf of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental organisation, found that early dry-season cultural burning reduced the extent of destructive late-season fires by about 30 per cent compared with the four years before the burning program began.</p><p>In Victoria, traditional owners have also noticed a change. There have been more than a dozen cultural burns on Dja Dja Wurrung country, and Trent Nelson says there has been healthy plant and grass regeneration.The CSIRO has published a number of papers that find cultural burning delivers a range of social and economic benefits for Aboriginal people, including the protection of heritage, the retention of language and identity and career development opportunities.</p><p>Can it help against 'climate' bushfires?</p><p>Aboriginal people have been devastated to see the damage wrought by the catastrophic summer bushfires, says Oliver Costello. \"We have this knowledge about land management ... and we're really sad because people haven't been listening to us,\" he says. \"We have been saying this is going to happen: this country is really thick and it will burn.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has argued hazard reduction burns are at least as important as cutting carbon emissions in Australia's fight against bushfires, although the Climate Council and federal opposition say this is a distraction from the government's lack of action on climate change.</p><p>But analysis from forest scientists at the University of Melbourne found hazard reduction burns had little to no effect in slowing the severe fires that devastated more than 5 million hectares across NSW.</p><p>Former Victorian emergency management commissioner Craig Lapsley describes cultural burning as a \"holistic land management strategy\" and the huge summer bushfires showed that land management agencies needed new approaches.</p><p>\"I don't think we valued Indigenous people and what they believed as a long-term, well-tested strategy. I don't think we have taken that seriously,\" he says.</p><p>Costello wants land management agencies to support a Firesticks Alliance mentoring program so there can be 100 cultural fire practitioners nationwide. \"We are drawing on the oldest, living knowledge system around fire and it works for us,\" he says. \"But you also need to share some of the resources and power you have.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7dvm73j4cqr18vjo35qy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61NB-KW61-F0J6-J3YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

That's not the case at all.\"</p><p>But he said the scale of such a fire would make it difficult for firefighters to extinguish it.</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said while the rain falling across fire-affected areas was providing a sense of relief, she urged people to not become complacent.</p><p>\"It is only January 6,\" she said.</p><p>\"We have significant fires in the

9.</p><p>\"At this stage the Thursday, Friday do look like fire spike days,\" she said.</p><p>Authorities had hoped to fly about 300 people out of the fire-hit coastal town of Mallacoota today, but smoke has made this impossible.</p><p>The Navy ship HMAS Choules, which in recent days transported about 1,000 people out of the area by sea, today returned to Mallacoota to deliver supplies as well as heavy equipment that will be used to clear roads out of the town.</p><p>Crews are working to reopen sections of the Princes Highway and the Great Alpine Road, which have been closed for days due to the fires.</p><p>Across the state, 18 communities remain cut off, and relief efforts have not been able to get into two of these, Bendoc and Bonang in East Gippsland.</p><p>Mr Crisp said authorities had been in communication with the two communities and had been assured residents were safe, and the Defence Force would travel there as soon as possible.</p><p>Mr Andrews said more frequent and

Later, Currowan set of another front: the Morton fire around Bundanoon.</p><p>Currowan, which started in the Shoalhaven council area, made its way across the Southern Tablelands courtesy of a pyrocumulus cloud that formed over it earlier in the day.</p><p>By yesterday, the blaze had burnt out more than 281,000 hectares. On Saturday night, it spotted in the Morton National Park creating a new front, the Morton Fire, which tore a trail of destruction through Bundanoon and nearby communities.</p><p>That night, the RFS urged people in Bundanoon, Berrima, Wingello, Penrose, Exeter and Fitzroy Falls leave. Morton was expected to hit Bundanoon again yesterday as winds picked up, amid cooler temperatures.</p><p>Owner of the Wingello store, David Bruggerman, told the Sydney Morning Herald the fire \"roared like an approaching freight train\".</p><p>He had wanted to stay and defend his property but evacuated when flames hit his home and business. An RFS volunteer later told him the shop had been saved.</p><p>Further north, at Tallong, many residents had evacuated, following community meetings warning them of the impending threat. Residents living on Caoura Road were particularly vulnerable, given a fire that had spotted over the Shoalhaven into the gorge last Tuesday.</p><p>Crews had worked during the week building containment lines waiting for it to emerge from the national park. But it also spotted along Caoura Road and firefighters put in long nights dousing outbreaks.</p><p>But both Windellama and Tallong dodged the Currowan bullet on Saturday, despite earlier fears the southeast wind would push towards them, Bungonia and Marulan.</p><p>Yesterday, Southern Tablelands RFS operations officer, Lachlan Gilchrist said he was not aware of any property losses at Tallong. But with strengthening winds, the village wasn't out of the woods yet.</p><p>\"The Morton fire was evidence that the potential for spotting is extreme. It didn't take long for the fire to impact those communities and we remain concerned for Tallong. That's why we want people to remain vigilant, enact their bushfire plans and leave early,\" he said.</p><p>On Saturday night, police closed off Caoura Road at Kettle Lane due to poor visibility. The Hume Highway was also closed between Marulan and Sutton Forest due to fire but opened again by Sunday morning. Trains on the Southern Highlands line were suspended and people initially diverted to buses. But these also stopped when the highway was closed.</p><p>Bungonia blaze On Saturday, a fire that broke out the week earlier, 8km southeast of Bungonia, continued to burn.</p><p>Mr Gilchrist said while crews had made great inroads in containment work in calmer conditions during the week, winds picked it up and carried it towards the Currowan fire on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>\"It failed to join with Currowan because of the south-east winds but we are seeing spotting between them. There is no threat to property but that will change when it comes into open country (from national park),\" he said earlier yesterday.</p><p>\"Some people in the area are staying to defend properties and we encourage them not to do so because with our resources, we're struggling to provide enough protection.\"</p><p>Green Wattle Southern Tablelands RFS was bolstered by a strike team from Northern Beaches comprising 50 personnel and 11 vehicles on Saturday.</p><p>The team was stationed at Yass and all brigades were on standby.</p><p>They were needed as the Green Wattle fire hit emergency level at about 3pm.</p><p>\"There was a massive increase in fire behaviour and crews moved to property protection mode because we had to be careful about putting our personnel in there,\" Mr Gilchrist said later that afternoon.</p><p>\"The fire is burning southeast and crews are doing a good job of protecting property.\"</p><p>Residents around Wombeyan and Bullio were told to leave, if they hadn't already. They were issued the same advice early last Tuesday morning as wind picked it up and, in Rocklily Road resident Dianna Bisset's words, created a \"firestorm.\"</p><p>On Saturday, the fire moved quickly through the Mares Forest area. An aerial water bomber went to work and 20 crews hit the ground. Mr Gilchrist said it was too dangerous for personnel and they concentrated on property protection.</p><p>\"It was a very erratic night, as forecast with the southeast wind change,\" he said on Sunday.</p><p>\"It took a decent run and crews did a very good job containing it. That work will continue today, as will aviation support.\"</p><p>By early Sunday, Green Wattle hadn't hit Bannaby Road, as forecast, but was burning mainly in national park around Mares Forest and the Wombeyan Karst Reserve. Crews were keeping a close eye amid increasing fire activity and Mr Gilchrist said its emergence into open country would help property protection.</p><p>Meantime, more people flooded into an evacuation centre on Goulburn's Braidwood Road on Saturday, as conditions worsened. Exact numbers couldn't be verified by the time of going to print.</p><p>But leaving early was the right strategy in Mr Gilchrist's book.</p><p>\"These are as much weather systems as fire systems,\" Mr Gilchrist said.</p><p>\"...If it was a flash flood, they wouldn't be sitting on the riverbank... As the south coast fire demonstrated, these blazes can turn very quickly.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOPNWS-doc78tpobc6e9d1f6kqe61p</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5S-MNK1-F0J6-J3YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

No-one was injured.</p><p>\"The fact we've been able to pull back from the emergency warnings to watch and acts reflects the suppressed fire behaviour we're seeing at the moment,\" Mr Crisp said.</p><p>\"I say suppressed because it's not gone away.</p><p>\"It is there waiting for the next hot day, the next strong wind - whether that's the northerlies or the southerlies.</p><p>\"We know these fires will become dynamic and dangerous again.\"</p><p>All blazes could merge into 'mega-fire'</p><p>Mr Crisp said there was \"every chance\" fires burning near Corryong could join with blazes burning in the High Country, East Gippsland and across the border in NSW to form a \"megafire\".</p><p>\"It is mega in terms of area. Just because you've got a large area, it doesn't mean it's all fire: a lot of it is actually burnt out, so in some respects that's not such a bad thing.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean you're going to see 1.5-2.2 million hectares of burning bush. That's not the case at all.\"</p><p>But he said the scale of such a fire would make it difficult for firefighters to extinguish it.</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said while the rain falling across fire-affected areas was providing a sense of relief, she urged people to not become complacent.</p><p>\"It is only January 6,\" she said.</p><p>\"We have significant fires in the landscape.</p><p>\"We've got other parts of the state drying out as we speak.</p><p>\"So this is an opportunity for people to remain focused, listen to messages, listen to warnings.</p><p>\"I know this is really hard and I know it's taking a massive toll on communities affected.\"</p><p>'This is the new normal'</p><p>Ms Neville said she had lifted an order which had given police the power to compel people to leave their homes, allowing people to return - but she warned similar orders were likely later in the week.</p><p>A state of disaster declaration remains in place until January 9.</p><p>\"At this stage the Thursday, Friday do look like fire spike days,\" she said.</p><p>Authorities had hoped to fly about 300 people out of the fire-hit coastal town of Mallacoota on Monday, but smoke made this impossible.</p><p>The Australian Defence Force shared video online to show what its pilots had been up against.</p><p>The Navy ship HMAS Choules, which in recent days transported about 1,000 people out of the area by sea, returned to Mallacoota on Monday to deliver supplies as well as heavy equipment that will be used to clear roads out of the town.</p><p>Crews are working to reopen sections of the Princes Highway and the Great Alpine Road, which have been closed for days due to the fires.</p><p>Across the state, 18 communities remain cut off, and relief efforts have not been able to get into two of these, Bendoc and Bonang in East Gippsland.</p><p>Mr Crisp said authorities had been in communication with the two communities and had been assured residents were safe, and the Defence Force would travel there as soon as possible.</p><p>Mr Andrews said more frequent and severe fires made a standing bushfire recovery agency necessary.</p><p>\"As Ken said, this is the new normal,\" he said.</p><p>\"We hope not to see this sort of unprecedented fire activity every year, but we're going to see more and more fires.</p><p>\"And I think that probably means we're going to see more and more properties lost over time and we're going to be doing more and more rebuilding.\"</p><p>Mr Andrews said while the initial $50 million would start the agency's work, the recovery effort would cost \"many hundreds of millions of dollars\".</p><p>\"It won't be $50 million, it won't be $500 million, it will be a lot more than that, but that's what we have to do.\"</p><p>Mr Lay said he would look to local people in affected areas for advice.</p><p>\"What I've got absolute clarity about is that when issues happen in local communities, when disasters happen in local communities, the answers are generally in that community,\" he said.</p><p>\"They're going to be absolutely critical to this organisation and how we do our job going forward.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The other surrounding bush was not.</p><p>Local Nationals MP Tim Bull points to several examples of previously burnt land in his vast electorate where this summer's fires slowed or died out.</p><p>\"Fuel reduction burns are better for the environment and they allow us an opportunity when we have a large-scale fire in the landscape to hold it up,'' Mr Bull said.</p><p>After bushfires this summer burnt through 1.5 million hectares, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-07/fuel-reduction-burn-debate-rubbish-says-vic-fire-chief/11849522\">the issue of fuel reduction burns became a major political issue</url>.</p><p>The Opposition wants more fuel reduction burns to be completed in Victoria and since the summer's blazes has attacked the Government over fuel management.</p><p>The Government has consistently said that hazard reduction burns can play a role in fire management but the window to carry them out is getting smaller and smaller due to the changing climate and longer fire season.</p><p>Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria, said the planned burning near Orbost helped reduce the intensity of the fire.</p><p>\"Planned burning is one of many strategies employed and part of an integrated approach to protect life, property and the environment from the impact of bushfire,\" he said.</p><p>\"We conduct planned burns to help reduce the size, intensity and impact of future bushfires on communities and the environment.\"</p><p>Strong community support for more burns</p><p>In 2015, a controlled burn got out of control near Lancefield and properties were lost. It is an incident that has scared the Government.</p><p>When the ABC recently visited fire-affected communities around Sarsfield, Buchan and Lakes Entrance there was strong community support for increased fuel burns.</p><p>Countless times people made the argument that fire needed three ingredients - oxygen, ignition and fuel - but only the last of these was within people's control. If the Government could reduce the available fuel, that could only be a good thing, the argument went.</p><p>\"Locals understand that less fuel means less intense fire and it is a clear message that everyone gives but seems to be hard to get through to the authorities,'' secretary of the Orbost Chamber of Commerce Garry Squires said.</p><p>He accuses those authorities of having no experience in the bush.</p><p>An experienced firefighter, Mr Squires said the weather was changing.</p><p>\"It's about being smarter and adapting to the conditions. We have got to do more burning and be smarter when we do it,'' he said.</p><p>Burns less effective as fires become more severe</p><p>The Black Saturday royal commission recommended 5 per cent of public land be burnt every year but the Government abandoned that in favour of a \"targeted risk reduction\" program several years ago.</p><p>Experts agree that fuel reduction does play an important role in fire management but is growing increasingly ineffective as fires become more severe, more often.</p><p>\"The effectiveness reduces with the severity of the fire,'' Australian National University professor of environmental science Phil Gibbons said.</p><p>Professor Gibbons agreed that targeted burns were the most effective type of reduction fires and backed the Victorian Government's decision to scrap an annual target of burning 5 per cent of public land.</p><p>Professor Gibbons, who examined fires including Black Saturday, said Victoria was taking a \"sophisticated\" strategy of targeted burns near towns and assets.</p><p>\"This is much more effective than a blunt approach to area-based targets,'' he said.</p><p>\"The big thing we found with hazard reduction burns [is they] are best done near a town or asset.\"</p><p>Bushfire consultant Cormac Farrell said burns were a useful tool, especially when the hazard reduction burns were completed within 800 metres of urban areas or public assets.</p><p>\"But in terms of protecting towns and cities on those worst-case scenarios on those really bad days when the fire, the wind and heat are really pumping, we are finding it is able to burn over relatively bare ground,'' Mr Farrell said.</p><p>\"Not only are we losing the ability to do hazard reduction burning, the hazard reduction burning we can do is becoming less and less effective.\"</p><p>Hazard reduction burns 'no silver bullet'</p><p>Mechanical fuel management - slashing and physically removing scrub and grass - is also an increasing important tool given the shortened season.</p><p>Mr Bull acknowledged that when a fire was really raging, burns were ineffective.</p><p>\"It's not blowing 40 degrees and a hot northerly every day, but it may be the next day or day after that, when conditions are calm and we hit an area where the fire can be brought under control,'' he said.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath, governments <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-07/fuel-reduction-burn-debate-rubbish-says-vic-fire-chief/11849522\">were criticised for not doing enough fuel reduction burns, with some in the community arguing more should be done to stop fires.</url></p><p>Fire chiefs in both New South Wales and Victoria said fuel reduction burns were not a panacea.</p><p>CFA chief officer Steve Warrington said in January it was not a \"silver bullet\" solution.</p><p>\"Some of the hysteria that this will be the solution to all our problems is really just quite an emotional load of rubbish, to be honest,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Farrell said it was human nature to want to grasp onto a simple solution.</p><p>\"I wish there was a simple easy solution,'' Mr Farrell said.</p><p>\"There is no single method we use that is a magic bullet panacea, even resilient housing design has its limit, so we have to use a combination of methods.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

No-one was injured.</p><p>\"The fact we've been able to pull back from the emergency warnings to watch and acts reflects the suppressed fire behaviour we're seeing at the moment,\" Mr Crisp said.</p><p>\"I say suppressed because it's not gone away.</p><p>\"It is there waiting for the next hot day, the next strong wind - whether that's the northerlies or the southerlies.</p><p>\"We know these fires will become dynamic and dangerous again.\"</p><p>All blazes could merge into 'mega-fire'</p><p>Mr Crisp said there was \"every chance\" fires burning near Corryong could join with blazes burning in the High Country, East Gippsland and across the border in NSW to form a \"megafire\".</p><p>\"It is mega in terms of area. Just because you've got a large area, it doesn't mean it's all fire: a lot of it is actually burnt out, so in some respects that's not such a bad thing.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean you're going to see 1.5-2.2 million hectares of burning bush. That's not the case at all.\"</p><p>But he said the scale of such a fire would make it difficult for firefighters to extinguish it.</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said while the rain falling across fire-affected areas was providing a sense of relief, she urged people to not become complacent.</p><p>\"It is only January 6,\" she said.</p><p>\"We have significant fires in the landscape.</p><p>\"We've got other parts of the state drying out as we speak.</p><p>\"So this is an opportunity for people to remain focused, listen to messages, listen to warnings.</p><p>\"I know this is really hard and I know it's taking a massive toll on communities affected.\"</p><p>'This is the new normal'</p><p>Ms Neville said she had lifted an order which had given police the power to compel people to leave their homes, allowing people to return - but she warned similar orders were likely later in the week.</p><p>A state of disaster declaration remains in place until January 9.</p><p>\"At this stage the Thursday, Friday do look like fire spike days,\" she said.</p><p>Authorities had hoped to fly about 300 people out of the fire-hit coastal town of Mallacoota on Monday, but smoke made this impossible.</p><p>The Australian Defence Force shared video online to show what its pilots had been up against.</p><p>The Navy ship HMAS Choules, which in recent days transported about 1,000 people out of the area by sea, returned to Mallacoota on Monday to deliver supplies as well as heavy equipment that will be used to clear roads out of the town.</p><p>Crews are working to reopen sections of the Princes Highway and the Great Alpine Road, which have been closed for days due to the fires.</p><p>Across the state, 18 communities remain cut off, and relief efforts have not been able to get into two of these, Bendoc and Bonang in East Gippsland.</p><p>Mr Crisp said authorities had been in communication with the two communities and had been assured residents were safe, and the Defence Force would travel there as soon as possible.</p><p>Mr Andrews said more frequent and severe fires made a standing bushfire recovery agency necessary.</p><p>\"As Ken said, this is the new normal,\" he said.</p><p>\"We hope not to see this sort of unprecedented fire activity every year, but we're going to see more and more fires.</p><p>\"And I think that probably means we're going to see more and more properties lost over time and we're going to be doing more and more rebuilding.\"</p><p>Mr Andrews said while the initial $50 million would start the agency's work, the recovery effort would cost \"many hundreds of millions of dollars\".</p><p>\"It won't be $50 million, it won't be $500 million, it will be a lot more than that, but that's what we have to do.\"</p><p>Mr Lay said he would look to local people in affected areas for advice.</p><p>\"What I've got absolute clarity about is that when issues happen in local communities, when disasters happen in local communities, the answers are generally in that community,\" he said.</p><p>\"They're going to be absolutely critical to this organisation and how we do our job going

No-one was injured.</p><p>\"The fact we've been able to pull back from the emergency warnings to watch and acts reflects the suppressed fire behaviour we're seeing at the moment,\" Mr Crisp said.</p><p>\"I say suppressed because it's not gone away.</p><p>\"It is there waiting for the next hot day, the next strong wind - whether that's the northerlies or the southerlies.</p><p>\"We know these fires will become dynamic and dangerous again.\"</p><p>All blazes could merge into 'mega-fire'</p><p>Mr Crisp said there was \"every chance\" fires burning near Corryong could join with blazes burning in the High Country, East Gippsland and across the border in NSW to form a \"megafire\".</p><p>\"It is mega in terms of area. Just because you've got a large area, it doesn't mean it's all fire: a lot of it is actually burnt out, so in some respects that's not such a bad thing.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean you're going to see 1.5-2.2 million hectares of burning bush. That's not the case at all.\"</p><p>But he said the scale of such a fire would make it difficult for firefighters to extinguish it.</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said while the rain falling across fire-affected areas was providing a sense of relief, she urged people to not become complacent.</p><p>\"It is only January 6,\" she said.</p><p>\"We have significant fires in the landscape.</p><p>\"We've got other parts of the state drying out as we speak.</p><p>\"So this is an opportunity for people to remain focused, listen to messages, listen to warnings.</p><p>\"I know this is really hard and I know it's taking a massive toll on communities affected.\"</p><p>'This is the new normal'</p><p>Ms Neville said she had lifted an order which had given police the power to compel people to leave their homes, allowing people to return - but she warned similar orders were likely later in the week.</p><p>A state of disaster declaration remains in place until January 9.</p><p>\"At this stage the Thursday, Friday do look like fire spike days,\" she said.</p><p>Authorities had hoped to fly about 300 people out of the fire-hit coastal town of Mallacoota today, but smoke has made this impossible.</p><p>The Navy ship HMAS Choules, which in recent days transported about 1,000 people out of the area by sea, today returned to Mallacoota to deliver supplies as well as heavy equipment that will be used to clear roads out of the town.</p><p>Crews are working to reopen sections of the Princes Highway and the Great Alpine Road, which have been closed for days due to the fires.</p><p>Across the state, 18 communities remain cut off, and relief efforts have not been able to get into two of these, Bendoc and Bonang in East Gippsland.</p><p>Mr Crisp said authorities had been in communication with the two communities and had been assured residents were safe, and the Defence Force would travel there as soon as possible.</p><p>Mr Andrews said more frequent and severe fires made a standing bushfire recovery agency necessary.</p><p>\"As Ken said, this is the new normal,\" he said.</p><p>\"We hope not to see this sort of unprecedented fire activity every year, but we're going to see more and more fires.</p><p>\"And I think that probably means we're going to see more and more properties lost over time and we're going to be doing more and more rebuilding.\"</p><p>Mr Andrews said while the initial $50 million would start the agency's work, the recovery effort would cost \"many hundreds of millions of dollars\".</p><p>\"It won't be $50 million, it won't be $500 million, it will be a lot more than that, but that's what we have to do.\"</p><p>Mr Lay said he would look to local people in affected areas for advice.</p><p>\"What I've got absolute clarity about is that when issues happen in local communities, when disasters happen in local communities, the answers are generally in that community,\" he said.</p><p>\"They're going to be absolutely critical to this organisation and how we do our job going forward.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

But, like the fires raging down the South Coast of NSW that had forced me, my husband, and our three children, out of his family's holiday house, it was out of my control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It started when Sharon, a woman in her 70s, wearing jeans, a navy vest and a fierce look of determination - like John Wayne swaggering towards a gunfight at dawn - walked up to me, and informed me about the latest supplies that had arrived: \"There's underwear now\". She gestured towards a help desk, set up at the entrance of the indoor basketball court, on the site of the Moruya showgrounds, which is where more than a hundred of us were sheltering.</p><p>\"Toothbrushes this morning,\" she added, \"now underwear.\" She threw me a dry smile, as if to say: what's next? Lamborghinis?</p><p>Sharon was sheltering in the centre, with her daughter, and a number of her teenage grandchildren. I smiled, and turned towards Shelley, Sharon's daughter, who was standing next to me.</p><p>\"She tells me,\" I said to Shelley, \"because she knows if anyone's going to shit their pants, it'd be me.\" I beamed. \"She's a good judge of character, your mum.\"</p><p>Sharon - who I'd previously bonded with over her joke that \"craft is a four-letter word\" so little does she like to engage in the activity with her grandchildren, and who had told me her home in a nearby rural community was under threat - leaned forward and laughed.</p><p>This - this laughter, this joy - is not what I expected when I first walked into the evacuation centre, hours earlier on Tuesday, with my husband and our children, aged 13, 11, and six.</p><p>I was dreading going to the centre. Even when, arriving in Moruya, we were faced with a town-wide power outage and towering smoke clouds from the nearby Currawong Forest fire that filled the sky ahead of us - the top of them appeared to touch the actual clouds; the bottom of them nestled muted orange smudges that were the fires - I baulked.</p><p>I pictured the centre would be like something out of a disaster movie: dogs snapping at each other, babies crying, misery.</p><p>But what we got was, yes, dogs barking and babies crying, but also - almost single-handedly because of the elderly people in the centre - a chest-expanding joy, which for hours at a time, eased my fear that my children's tender flesh might be devoured by flames should wind conditions suddenly change, and nearby infernos suddenly dart towards us.</p><p>I felt this fear, at 3am, when I looked at my six-year-old son's milky arm, cradling his face, in his sleep. But he, along with his sister, was sleeping soundly in a tent, with a built-in mattress, rather than on the bath towels we'd all been sleeping on previously, on the cold hard wood basketball court floor, because Liz Fisher, a 72-year-old Anglicare volunteer, had lent it to us hours before, when we had gone to the help desk seeking blankets.</p><p>\"You're in luck!\" she had said, looking at me with the lit-up smile of someone watching her grandchild ride a bike for the first time, even though her own home was near encroaching bushfires. This selflessness, and kindness, was something I saw repeatedly - particularly from the elderly.</p><p>Among the many other volunteers handing out supplies and making sure the children were the first to eat from tables silently set with bread, cereal, and fresh fruit, there was Margaret, a thin woman with a snow-white bob in her 80s, whose wheelchair-bound son, was, when I saw her, living in a nearby Moruya facility, and unable to get out. While preparing her inflatable bed, for her and her frail husband, John, she said to me: \"I hope we don't wake you. We'll be up every hour.\" Can you imagine?</p><p>Now listen, I have always admired the wisdom and hard-won resilience of the elderly, particularly if they are in a far-off land, like, say, the Inuit in northern Canada.</p><p>But in the last couple of years, when the older members of my family have forgotten to ask me anything about myself, after hours of speaking about themselves, I - who obviously have no faults of my own - have sometimes lost sight of this, and instead mentally tarred not just them, but their entire generation with a slightly less reverential tag: crazy-arse-ache.</p><p>But now, safe in Sydney, I think of what Liz Fisher told me when I asked her over the phone after I'd left the centre why she had described her time volunteering at the centre as \"wonderful\".</p><p>\"I have found it incredibly moving,\" she said on Thursday, noting that she planned to stay in Moruya into Friday, rather than escape to safety in Canberra, even though the town is now at a greater risk than on Wednesday with NSW now in a declared state of emergency, and the forecast for fire conditions set to be at catastrophic levels today.</p><p>\"I have felt very useful, actually,\" she added, noting that after she was made redundant from her last paid job working with patients at Moruya hospital, she felt \"bereft\". And, she said of feeling useful, \"that's a hugely good feeling for me, which is weird\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Samantha Selinger-Morris is a Sydney writer.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520224244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWR-7501-DY19-C3T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

south-west Victoria thousands of years ago have been discovered after a fire swept through the area over the past few weeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Budj Bim Cultural Landscape, which includes an elaborate series of stone-lined channels and pools set up by the Gunditjmara people to harvest eels, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-06/indigenous-site-joins-pyramids-stonehenge-world-heritage-list/11271804\">was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List</url> last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some parts of the landscape, which also features evidence of stone dwellings, have been dated back 6,600 years.</p><p>Traditional owners, who inspected the site after the fire was brought under control last week, spotted extra sites previously concealed under vegetation that they believe are part of that aquaculture system.</p><p>Ancient channels lay hidden under vegetation</p><p>A fire sparked by a lightning strike at Lake Condah in late December, which was later subsumed by another fire that ignited nearby, was only brought under control last week after a mammoth firefighting effort.</p><p>It burnt through more than 7,000 hectares of land around Lake Condah and in the Budj Bim National Park, including some parts of the aquaculture system in an area known as the Muldoon trap complex.</p><p>Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation project manager Denis Rose said when the fire first broke out he was not \"too concerned\" about how the fire would affect the system.</p><p>\"Most of the cultural features out here on the lava flow are stone,\" he said.</p><p>\"There have certainly been many fires here in the thousands of years prior.</p><p>\"Our major concern was the effect after the fire and we've still got some work to do there.</p><p>\"We were concerned about the trees ... particularly those taller trees that are growing in and around some of those fish trap systems and also our associated stone house sites, of [the trees] being weakened and damaged and potentially falling over and the roots upending some of these ancient stone structures.\"</p><p>When Mr Rose and other traditional owners returned to the area after the fire, they were amazed by what they observed in the charred landscape.</p><p>\"The fire actually uncovered another smaller system, including a channel about 25 metres in length that we hadn't noticed before,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was only maybe 20 metres off the track that we walk in and it was hidden in the long grass and the bracken fern and other vegetation.</p><p>\"We've noticed that in other parts of the lava flow as well, we've come across sites that just haven't been recorded that have been very close by.</p><p>\"It's a wonderful opportunity for us to further investigate some of the sites out here.\"</p><p>New survey to be undertaken</p><p>In the wake of the blaze, a cultural heritage survey will be undertaken with input from archaeologists familiar with the site and Indigenous rangers.</p><p>Aerial photography using specialised software will be undertaken to survey the landscape as well.</p><p>Mr Rose said although the find was positive it took place in the sobering context of the destructive fires that continue to burn in other parts of the country.</p><p>\"We have been extremely fortunate here,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've had relatively cool burns - certainly nothing like the damage and the devastation over in the eastern parts of Australia.</p><p>\"[These fires] have burnt the undergrowth rather than scorching the forest the whole way through.\"</p><p>Firefighters worked around rocky, volcanic country</p><p>Firefighters have been managing fire in and around the Budj Bim National Park since the initial blaze that started a few days before Christmas Day.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria far south-west district manager Mark Mellington said firefighters had to work with the area's rocky terrain, a result of its relatively recent volcanic past.</p><p>\"Earthmoving machinery is one of our typical uses for fire line construction,\" he said.</p><p>\"But typically in the volcanic, rocky country it's quite impractical to use that sort of machinery and with a lot of work and engagement we had done with Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners, we'd established that there was a significant risk to cultural heritage values in us using machinery.\"</p><p>\"[We knew] if we did have fires in that landscape, we would have to use lower-impact control techniques.\"</p><p>Mr Rose praised the way firefighters tackled the blaze, avoiding bringing heavy machinery onto the site.</p><p>\"We certainly acknowledge the wonderful work that they have done in protecting the lava flow and the cultural features on here,\" he said.</p><p>Crews managed to keep the first, smaller fire contained during a particularly hot, windy day on December 30, but a lightning strike that accompanied a cool change that swept through that evening sparked a more intense fire in the national park that eclipsed the initial one.</p><p>Mr Mellington said over the weeks the crews worked on the fire they used aircraft to drop both large quantities of water picked up from Lake Condah and fire retardant.</p><p>Crews on foot using canvas hoses were also crucial in the firefight.</p><p>\"That was some really tough, intensive work by both Fire Forest Management crews supported by the Country Fire Authority, and we also had the Budj Bim rangers from Gunditj Mirring helping out as well,\" Mr Mellington said.</p><p>Nearby communities such as Bessiebelle were urged to evacuate during the worst flare-ups, but fortunately no private structures were lost in the fire.</p><p>\"Clearly the safety of people, the safety of communities is our number-one priority ahead of anything,\" Mr Mellington said.</p><p>\"With that in mind we really needed to work through the best possible control strategy to contain the fire to the smallest area possible.</p><p>\"Certainly things like environmental and cultural values are significant, but we really do need to preference human life over all other things.\"</p><p>Mr Mellington said although he was confident the fire was under control, there was still a risk of it worsening again over the remainder of summer and beyond.</p><p>\"We'd love to get a couple of inches of rain,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Having declared the bushfire season to be the Prime Minister's \"Chernobyl moment\", his Berlin Wall moment surely is not far away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The explosion of the Soviet -nuclear reactor was \"a crisis of legitimacy from which the regime did not recover\", Greenpeace Australia boss David Ritter reminded supporters last week, with typical understatement.</p><p>After a summer of firestorms, \"we have travelled through time and space and woken up in another country\", he continued.</p><p>The taboo around talking about climate change during a crisis has been smashed. Greenpeace wants to seize the moment and \"ensure the bushfire crisis continues to be framed as a symptom of -the climate emergency\". The -single-cause obsession of the climate-explains-everything movement is a gift to bad governments. All manner of public policy and administrative failures can now be duckshoved to the weather gods.</p><p>The quiet Australians have -already worked this out. On talkback radio (recommended by pharmacists as an antidote to Twitter), few if any callers have wanted to talk about climate policy in recent weeks.</p><p>Hazard reduction, rather than the reduction of emissions, was at the top of their list, backed by calls for stronger containment lines.</p><p>They are on solid empirical ground. The contribution of accumulated organic matter to fires was understood long before European settlement. Of the three factors that govern the intensity of fires - heat, oxygen and fuel - it is the only one that can be controlled easily by humans.</p><p>Every reputable authority on the subject, from the CSIRO to Forest Fire Management Victoria, agrees. \"Fuel management red-uces the spread and intensity of bushfires, which makes suppression more achievable and safer,\" reads the FFM's guide to managing bushfire risks.</p><p>We can only speculate why Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews played down the importance of fuel management in an extraordinary press conference last week, backed by Victorian Country Fire Authority chief officer Steve Warrington, who criticised the \"hysteria\" over backburning as \"an emotional load of rubbish\".</p><p>Perhaps it is part of the \"paradigm shift\" declared by the boss of Greenpeace. Perhaps Andrews also wants to seize the moment and join the climate-explains-everything movement.</p><p>Or perhaps he is embarrassed by his government's failure to implement recommendation 56 of the royal commission into Victoria's 2009 Black Saturday bushfires: conduct prescribed burning across 5 per cent of public land.</p><p>By that measure, the Andrews government should have burnt about 400,000ha last financial year but, as Rachel Baxendale reported in The Australian last week, it managed to burn only 130,044 ha.</p><p>A premier who is really driven by evidence-based science, as -Andrews claims to be, surely would be obliged to consider other variables before putting everything down to climate.</p><p>Our relationship with the bush, for example, has changed substantially in the past 50 years. Humans once tamed the wilderness. Today it tames us, restricting our ability not only to extract resources but also to resist its fury. National parks, as they were conceived at the end of the 19th century, were designed for both recreation and conservation. In areas of fire danger they were crisscrossed with fire trails.</p><p>With the arrival of Deep Green environmentalism in the 1970s, we chose a more overgrown path. The wilderness was declared pristine, visitors were made to feel unwelcome and conservation areas were sanctified as places untouched by the human stain.</p><p>The NSW Wilderness Act 1987, which was introduced by an earnest 40-something environment minister called Bob Carr, enshrined the romantic notions contaminating the debate. Wilder-ness was defined as territory \"that has not been substantially modified by humans and their works or is capable of being restored to such a state\". Few if any places on earth could claim such status, particularly in Australia where the landscape, flora and fauna have been managed for 60,000 years, often through the application of fire.</p><p>By declaring new national parks, as Carr did later as premier, and letting nature take its course, the vegetation grew dense, weeds thrived and the fuel load mounted.</p><p>When fires break out, firefighters find the terrain almost impenetrable. There are no containment lines from which to take a stand. Fire becomes its own master.</p><p>Absorbing the lessons from this angry summer will require a paradigm shift, though not the one for which activists hanker. Fire and drought have fuelled growing sentiment that we are ill-prepared for long periods of heat and aridity.</p><p>In an era when, for better or worse, we look to the state to shoulder risk, state and federal governments must find better ways of providing water, protecting our agricultural sector from drought, managing bushfires and cleaning the environment.</p><p>This summer's fires have -already brought a significant change, unimagined by the drafters of the Constitution.</p><p>The inadequacies of state administrations and the goading by Morrison's cultural opponents have forced the federal government into the frontline.</p><p>Bushfire management has joined energy, water, education and health in the portfolio of poisoned chalices that now requires the close attention of Canberra.</p><p>While constitutional conservatives fiddle nervously with their bow ties, there is at least an upside to this seemingly inevitable development. It will allow the federal government to seize the bushfire management agenda and to -promote investment in bushfire mitigation measures as essential national infrastructure.</p><p>The cost of clearing adequate containment lines to protect human settlements from fires is comparable with the expense of roads, rail and airports.</p><p>The development is also likely to require the compulsory acquisition of property and changes to native vegetation legislation, not to mention the odd fight with -misanthropic do-gooders. But, hey, if this is indeed an emergency, who could object to that?</p><p>The destruction of property and lives on the scale we are experiencing, not to mention the plight of wildlife, presents the opportunity to take the high ground on the security of containment lines, just as the Abbott government won the argument on the -security of borders.Nick Cater is executive director of the Menzies Research Centre.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-8fbc5a023a6d11eab2166b39799cd7ba25e03b75097ca99d771e931febfa97a2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y15-B361-F0JP-W1FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1073\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A22R</classCode><className>BORDER CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

south-west Victoria thousands of years ago have been discovered after a fire swept through the area over the past few weeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Budj Bim Cultural Landscape, which includes an elaborate series of stone-lined channels and pools set up by the Gunditjmara people to harvest eels, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-06/indigenous-site-joins-pyramids-stonehenge-world-heritage-list/11271804\">was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List</url> last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some parts of the landscape, which also features evidence of stone dwellings, have been dated back 6,600 years - older than Egypt's pyramids.</p><p>Traditional owners, who inspected the site after the fire was brought under control last week, spotted extra sites previously concealed under vegetation that they believe are part of that aquaculture system.</p><p>Ancient channels lay hidden under vegetation</p><p>A fire sparked by a lightning strike at Lake Condah in late December, which was later subsumed by another fire that ignited nearby, was only brought under control last week after a mammoth firefighting effort.</p><p>It burnt through more than 7,000 hectares of land around Lake Condah and in the Budj Bim National Park, including some parts of the aquaculture system in an area known as the Muldoon trap complex.</p><p>Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation project manager Denis Rose said when the fire first broke out he was not \"too concerned\" about how the fire would affect the system.</p><p>\"Most of the cultural features out here on the lava flow are stone,\" he said.</p><p>\"There have certainly been many fires here in the thousands of years prior.</p><p>\"Our major concern was the effect after the fire and we've still got some work to do there.</p><p>\"We were concerned about the trees ... particularly those taller trees that are growing in and around some of those fish trap systems and also our associated stone house sites, of [the trees] being weakened and damaged and potentially falling over and the roots upending some of these ancient stone structures.\"</p><p>When Mr Rose and other traditional owners returned to the area after the fire, they were amazed by what they observed in the charred landscape.</p><p>\"The fire actually uncovered another smaller system, including a channel about 25 metres in length that we hadn't noticed before,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was only maybe 20 metres off the track that we walk in and it was hidden in the long grass and the bracken fern and other vegetation.</p><p>\"We've noticed that in other parts of the lava flow as well, we've come across sites that just haven't been recorded that have been very close by.</p><p>\"It's a wonderful opportunity for us to further investigate some of the sites out here.\"</p><p>New survey to be undertaken</p><p>In the wake of the blaze, a cultural heritage survey will be undertaken with input from archaeologists familiar with the site and Indigenous rangers.</p><p>Aerial photography using specialised software will be undertaken to survey the landscape as well.</p><p>Mr Rose said although the find was positive it took place in the sobering context of the destructive fires that continue to burn in other parts of the country.</p><p>\"We have been extremely fortunate here,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've had relatively cool burns - certainly nothing like the damage and the devastation over in the eastern parts of Australia.</p><p>\"[These fires] have burnt the undergrowth rather than scorching the forest the whole way through.\"</p><p>Firefighters worked around rocky, volcanic country</p><p>Firefighters have been managing fire in and around the Budj Bim National Park since the initial blaze that started a few days before Christmas Day.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria far south-west district manager Mark Mellington said firefighters had to work with the area's rocky terrain, a result of its relatively recent volcanic past.</p><p>\"Earthmoving machinery is one of our typical uses for fire line construction,\" he said.</p><p>\"But typically in the volcanic, rocky country it's quite impractical to use that sort of machinery and with a lot of work and engagement we had done with Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners, we'd established that there was a significant risk to cultural heritage values in us using machinery.\"</p><p>\"[We knew] if we did have fires in that landscape, we would have to use lower-impact control techniques.\"</p><p>Mr Rose praised the way firefighters tackled the blaze, avoiding bringing heavy machinery onto the site.</p><p>\"We certainly acknowledge the wonderful work that they have done in protecting the lava flow and the cultural features on here,\" he said.</p><p>Crews managed to keep the first, smaller fire contained during a particularly hot, windy day on December 30, but a lightning strike that accompanied a cool change that swept through that evening sparked a more intense fire in the national park that eclipsed the initial one.</p><p>Mr Mellington said over the weeks the crews worked on the fire they used aircraft to drop both large quantities of water picked up from Lake Condah and fire retardant.</p><p>Crews on foot using canvas hoses were also crucial in the firefight.</p><p>\"That was some really tough, intensive work by both Fire Forest Management crews supported by the Country Fire Authority, and we also had the Budj Bim rangers from Gunditj Mirring helping out as well,\" Mr Mellington said.</p><p>Nearby communities such as Bessiebelle were urged to evacuate during the worst flare-ups, but fortunately no private structures were lost in the fire.</p><p>\"Clearly the safety of people, the safety of communities is our number-one priority ahead of anything,\" Mr Mellington said.</p><p>\"With that in mind we really needed to work through the best possible control strategy to contain the fire to the smallest area possible.</p><p>\"Certainly things like environmental and cultural values are significant, but we really do need to preference human life over all other things.\"</p><p>Mr Mellington said although he was confident the fire was under control, there was still a risk of it worsening again over the remainder of summer and beyond.</p><p>\"We'd love to get a couple of inches of rain,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

south-west Victoria thousands of years ago have been discovered after a fire swept through the area over the past few weeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Budj Bim Cultural Landscape, which includes an elaborate series of stone-lined channels and pools set up by the Gunditjmara people to harvest eels, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-06/indigenous-site-joins-pyramids-stonehenge-world-heritage-list/11271804\">was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List</url> last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some parts of the landscape, which also features evidence of stone dwellings, have been dated back 6,600 years - older than Egypt's pyramids.</p><p>Traditional owners, who inspected the site after the fire was brought under control last week, spotted extra sites previously concealed under vegetation that they believe are part of that aquaculture system.</p><p>Ancient channels lay hidden under vegetation</p><p>A fire sparked by a lightning strike at Lake Condah in late December, which was later subsumed by another fire that ignited nearby, was only brought under control last week after a mammoth firefighting effort.</p><p>It burnt through more than 7,000 hectares of land around Lake Condah and in the Budj Bim National Park, including some parts of the aquaculture system in an area known as the Muldoon trap complex.</p><p>Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation project manager Denis Rose said when the fire first broke out he was not \"too concerned\" about how the fire would affect the system.</p><p>\"Most of the cultural features out here on the lava flow are stone,\" he said.</p><p>\"There have certainly been many fires here in the thousands of years prior.</p><p>\"Our major concern was the effect after the fire and we've still got some work to do there.</p><p>\"We were concerned about the trees ... particularly those taller trees that are growing in and around some of those fish trap systems and also our associated stone house sites, of [the trees] being weakened and damaged and potentially falling over and the roots upending some of these ancient stone structures.\"</p><p>When Mr Rose and other traditional owners returned to the area after the fire, they were amazed by what they observed in the charred landscape.</p><p>\"The fire actually uncovered another smaller system, including a channel about 25 metres in length that we hadn't noticed before,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was only maybe 20 metres off the track that we walk in and it was hidden in the long grass and the bracken fern and other vegetation.</p><p>\"We've noticed that in other parts of the lava flow as well, we've come across sites that just haven't been recorded that have been very close by.</p><p>\"It's a wonderful opportunity for us to further investigate some of the sites out here.\"</p><p>New survey to be undertaken</p><p>In the wake of the blaze, a cultural heritage survey will be undertaken with input from archaeologists familiar with the site and Indigenous rangers.</p><p>Aerial photography using specialised software will be undertaken to survey the landscape as well.</p><p>Mr Rose said although the find was positive it took place in the sobering context of the destructive fires that continue to burn in other parts of the country.</p><p>\"We have been extremely fortunate here,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've had relatively cool burns - certainly nothing like the damage and the devastation over in the eastern parts of Australia.</p><p>\"[These fires] have burnt the undergrowth rather than scorching the forest the whole way through.\"</p><p>Firefighters worked around rocky, volcanic country</p><p>Firefighters have been managing fire in and around the Budj Bim National Park since the initial blaze that started a few days before Christmas Day.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria far south-west district manager Mark Mellington said firefighters had to work with the area's rocky terrain, a result of its relatively recent volcanic past.</p><p>\"Earthmoving machinery is one of our typical uses for fire line construction,\" he said.</p><p>\"But typically in the volcanic, rocky country it's quite impractical to use that sort of machinery and with a lot of work and engagement we had done with Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners, we'd established that there was a significant risk to cultural heritage values in us using machinery.\"</p><p>\"[We knew] if we did have fires in that landscape, we would have to use lower-impact control techniques.\"</p><p>Mr Rose praised the way firefighters tackled the blaze, avoiding bringing heavy machinery onto the site.</p><p>\"We certainly acknowledge the wonderful work that they have done in protecting the lava flow and the cultural features on here,\" he said.</p><p>Crews managed to keep the first, smaller fire contained during a particularly hot, windy day on December 30, but a lightning strike that accompanied a cool change that swept through that evening sparked a more intense fire in the national park that eclipsed the initial one.</p><p>Mr Mellington said over the weeks the crews worked on the fire they used aircraft to drop both large quantities of water picked up from Lake Condah and fire retardant.</p><p>Crews on foot using canvas hoses were also crucial in the firefight.</p><p>\"That was some really tough, intensive work by both Fire Forest Management crews supported by the Country Fire Authority, and we also had the Budj Bim rangers from Gunditj Mirring helping out as well,\" Mr Mellington said.</p><p>Nearby communities such as Bessiebelle were urged to evacuate during the worst flare-ups, but fortunately no private structures were lost in the fire.</p><p>\"Clearly the safety of people, the safety of communities is our number-one priority ahead of anything,\" Mr Mellington said.</p><p>\"With that in mind we really needed to work through the best possible control strategy to contain the fire to the smallest area possible.</p><p>\"Certainly things like environmental and cultural values are significant, but we really do need to preference human life over all other things.\"</p><p>Mr Mellington said although he was confident the fire was under control, there was still a risk of it worsening again over the remainder of summer and beyond.</p><p>\"We'd love to get a couple of inches of rain,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

As the cumulative area burnt by fire increased, the quantity and quality of Leadbeater's possum habitat decreased. </p><p>Tthe 2009 Black Saturday fires <url normalizedValue=\"https://museumsvictoria.com.au/article/a-good-possum-is-hard-to-find/\">burned almost half</url> of its habitat, causing its conservation status to jump from endangered to critically endangered. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: After the bushfires, we helped choose the animals and plants in most need. Here's how we did it</emphasis></p><p>Bushfires have always been part of Australian landscapes and many species, including Leadbeater's possum, have evolved alongside them. Eleven years later, Leadbeater's possum are now recolonising areas burned in the 2009 bushfires. </p><p>But as climate change increases the frequency and scale of bushfires, our models suggest the Central Highlands landscape may support less suitable habitat.</p><h>Timber harvesting is less of a threat</h><p>While timber harvesting compounds the impacts of bushfires on Leadbeater's possum habitat, across the landscape the effect is small in comparison. Timber harvesting reduced suitable habitat by only 1.4% to 2.3% over 250 years compared to scenarios without harvesting. </p><p>Within a coupe (the area of forest harvested in one operation), timber harvesting immediately reduces nesting and foraging habitat. But foraging habitat returns within 10 to 15 years and can be recolonised by Leadbeater's possum - as long as nesting sites are nearby. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Logging is due to start in fire-ravaged forests this week. It's the last thing our wildlife needs</emphasis></p><p>Protecting vegetation around waterways, in particular, was critical for the development and survival of hollow-bearing trees in an increasingly fire-prone landscape.</p><p>But while timber harvesting had much smaller impacts than bushfires, the two did interact. Over time, the cumulative impacts of timber harvesting and bushfire homogenised forest structure across the landscape, leading to smaller patches of habitat that were less connected. </p><p>This increases the risk of <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008953426795\">local extinction</url> for populations of Leadbeater's possum living in these patches.  </p><h>We need dynamic conservation areas</h><p>A core question for the conservation of any threatened species is: how well does the network of protected areas protect the species? </p><p>Our modelling framework meant we could test whether current areas set aside for Leadbeater's possum conservation actually provide long-term protection. </p><p>Over the next 100 years, less than 50% of existing parks, reserves and timber-harvest exclusion zones will provide continuous habitat for Leadbeater's possum due to climate change.  </p><p>However, we also identified approximately 30,000 hectares of forest outside the current network of protected areas that can provide stable habitat for Leadbeater's possum over the next century. </p><p>It's vital we put protection zones into the areas possums are likely to migrate to as the climate changes. These areas should be a priority for conservation efforts. </p><h>A new conservation strategy</h><p>Historically, conservation planning has taken a static, site-based approach to protecting species. </p><p>This approach is doomed to fail in dynamic landscapes - particularly in fire-prone landscapes in a warming climate. For conservation planning to be successful, we need coordinated forest, fire, and conservation management that accounts for these dynamics across the whole landscape, not just in individual locations. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Climate explained: what caused major climate change in the past?</emphasis></p><p>We need a vision for how to make our landscapes more resilient to the growing threat of climate change and provide better protection for the unique flora and fauna that inhabit them. </p><p>This will require government agencies responsible for land management and conservation to coordinate current management activities across tenures, while simultaneously implementing future-focused conservation planning. Our landscape-modelling approach provides a first step in that direction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Craig Nitschke received funding for this research from the Australian Research Council and industry partners (the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning, and VicForests) as part of Linkage Project LP140100580.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Robinson received funding for this research from the Australian Research Council and industry partners (the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning, and VicForests) as part of Linkage Project LP140100580.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Baker received funding for this research from the Australian Research Council and industry partners (the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning, and VicForests) as part of Linkage Project LP140100580.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raphael Trouve received funding for this research from the Australian Research Council and industry partners (the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning, and VicForests) as part of Linkage Project LP140100580.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAUS-140055</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6031-TDM1-JB75-900B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1218\"/><timeReceived>7:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Australia</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6070\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 7, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000613</classCode><className>ENDANGERED SPECIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

Creating more resilent and sustainable landscapes would reduce the risk of infernos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January 1994, there were four fire-related deaths, hundreds of thousands of hectares were burnt and fingers of fire crept into the city of Sydney. Parliament, the cabinet and the coroner held inquiries and released reports on the reasons, causes of death and the possible means of avoiding similar problems in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Christmas Day 2001, the concerns of fire authorities in NSW were fully realised. The lead-up to summer had been drier than normal. December 25, 2001, was hot with very low humidity and winds from the west. These bushfires burnt nearly 700,000 hectares, with 115 houses and many other buildings destroyed and scores damaged.</p><p>Parliament and the coroner held inquiries and released reports on the causes.</p><p>Then, in January 2003, the concerns of fire authorities in NSW, Victoria and the ACT were realised - in full measure. Once again, leading up to the summer, conditions had been drier than normal. Bushfires burned into Canberra. And Parliament, the coroner and the Council of Australian Governments held inquiries and released reports on the reasons.</p><p>In 2009 in Victoria, the results were even more tragic: over 170 deaths, hundreds of buildings destroyed, thousands of animals killed and tens of thousands of hectares burnt. And there was a royal commission, court cases and reports, and so on.</p><p>With minor variations the above could also be repeated for the fire seasons of 1897, 1912, 1926, 1933, 1939, 1944, 1949, 1951, 1957, 1960, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1977, 1980 and 1983. These events are not \"unprecedented\". They have been experienced before, often within living memory. This has been pointed out previously, alongside the warning that there was every reason the fires would be with us again. They are.</p><p>Australia is a fire-formed continent - fire is part of our landscape. The place and role of the invaders - people, plants, buildings and animals - must be mediated with the needs of our fire-formed landscapes for this uneasy relationship to be better managed.</p><p>Fires are events that have taken place across landscapes for millennia. They will continue to take place. People have direct and indirect influence on the incidence, nature and consequences of fires, and are affected by them. In order to have any success in \"managing\" fire, there must be a deep understanding and knowledge of fire in the landscape being managed. The measures to be put in place are those of sound management, informed by local ecology, shaped by history and constrained by current reality including political, economic, ecological and social reality.</p><p>Efforts to deal with the \"landscape-sized\" requirements to address bushfires and management of natural and human assets, and at the same time the efforts to incorporate protection of a particular species or habitat, are not trivial. In most fire seasons, the uneasy relationship between scale, scope, management ethos, funding and political processes goes unnoticed. Bushfire repercussions, however, cannot be avoided and the links are exposed by them, as is the case in the Arctic, the Amazon, California, Indonesia and Australia.</p><p>Firefighting is only one facet of fire management. Integrated approaches to fire management place greater emphasis on addressing underlying causes and seek long-term, sustainable solutions. Resources need to be directed to support fire data collection and analysis, which improves the understanding of causes, identifies existing management practices that encourage harmful fires, and promotes management systems that take advantage of well-established fire use. Analysis in fire-prone areas needs to start before a fire begins.</p><p>Data on wildfires/bushfires indicates that 90 per cent of fires are readily contained and burn 10 per cent or less of the total area affected. This suggests that for those fires the current planning, management and technologies are working reasonably well.</p><p>Five to 10 per cent of fires account for the remaining 90 per cent of the area that is burnt. These events are the ones that we see reported and include loss of life, damage and loss of property and infrastructure; they also have environmental consequences, as in Greece and California in July 2018, again in 2019, and now in Australia.</p><p>These fires are uncontrollable as they exceed the limits of suppression until the weather conditions (particularly wind strength) moderate or the fire no longer has sufficient fuel and burns out. There is nothing that firefighters can do to stop or contain such fires until conditions change. There will always be some wildfires that exceed the capacity for suppression. This needs to be understood and factored in by communities, agencies and governments.</p><p>The dominant approach to fires in the history of developed countries has been to suppress them and to prohibit fire use. The assumption is that damaging fires occur because of a lack of means to fight them. The accumulating experience makes clear that firefighting is not a solution.</p><p>Fires are a landscape problem. They are a problem resulting not from inadequate means of suppression but from fuel continuity, accumulation of fuels from vegetation, and their proximity to human assets (buildings, communities, infrastructure) and ecological values (particular habitats, species, natural features). The altered landscape has made the population increasingly vulnerable. The solution is resilient, sustainable landscapes that balance the hazards and reduce risk.</p><p>This year, the Women and Firefighting in Australasia conference will be co-located with the 2020 conference of the National Council for Fire and Emergency Services (AFAC). During the seventh International Wildland Fire Conference in Brazil late last year, there were sessions on women's role in integrated fire management; on the visibility and leadership of women; on visions, voices and Indigenous knowledge in traditional fire management; and on traditional communities' knowledge.</p><p>The input, influence, ideas and engagement of women and of traditional and Indigenous knowledge in fire management are key both for now, post the bushfires in Australia, and for a risk-reduced and resilient future for Australia and other fire-prone parts of the world.</p><p>Peter F. Moore is forestry officer, Forest Fire Management - Disaster Risk Reduction, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78pm6lqzehl1e89rukpo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XX5-5B41-JD34-V3F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1072\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Knopf, 592pp, $49.99</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is one of the great American political biographies of recent years, an extraordinary work that captures the mercurial American diplomat at his inspiring best and appalling worst.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Internationally, only Andrew Roberts's magnificent Churchill eclipses Packer's study of a remarkable figure in an extraordinary life. Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, whom Richard Holbrooke served well, perhaps put it best: \"I picture him like Gulliver tied down by Lilliputians.\" Packer sketches Holbrooke in striking prose. This is no mean achievement, for Holbrooke's passage from the salons of Washington DC to the villas of Saigon, from the mountains and forests of the former Yugoslavia to the battlefields of Afghanistan, often resemble a flash of heat lightning.</p><p>There were brilliant moments that often meant nothing. But when the lightning struck Earth, a grass or forest fire usually exploded, which consumed everything. This was particularly true of his period in the Balkans.</p><p>Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke was born on April 24, 1941, the son of Polish and German Holocaust survivors Abraham Dan Golbraich and Gertrud Moos. \"Holbrooke\" was a consequence of his father anglicising the name, courtesy of the Manhattan phonebook.</p><p>Pushed to study hard, Holbrooke was taken by his father at age eight to see the United Nations headquarters being constructed on the East River in New York. But it was a visit to Scarsdale High by Dean Rusk, later -secretary of state in the Kennedy administration, that convinced Holbrooke that the foreign service represented his future. That future saw him return to the UN precinct as US ambassador to the United Nations for president Bill Clinton.</p><p>Packer, who has written brilliantly on the Iraq War in The Assassin's Gate and on the social and economic dilemmas that have troubled the US over the last half century in The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America, places Holbrooke's life and career at the end of the American Century.</p><p>He argues: \"What's called the American Century was really just a little more than half a century, and that was the span of Holbrooke's life. It began with the Second World War and the creative burst that followed - the United Nations, the Atlantic alliance, containment, the free world - and it went through -dizzying lows and highs, until it expired the day before yesterday.\" This conclusion may be challenged, especially because it was Wall Street's bankers who funded the allied effort in the Great War from 1915 to the end of hostilities, in the process making America the decisive global power. Indeed, it was in 1915 that a huge loan of some $US500m was organised to support British and French arms by the Anglophile JP Morgan.</p><p>Packer's style may best be described as dinner conversational. He addresses his readers in an offhand manner, as if they were sitting across from him at a dining table. It may be a little disarming but it does not detract or divert from his sharp ability to read Holbrooke, his colleagues and friends in the sweep of events that carried him along and that in some cases he shaped and/or manipulated.</p><p>One of Packer's strengths as a narrator is his impressive ability to appreciate and explain the byzantine politics of Washington DC, from Georgetown soirees to the Oval Office, together with their seductive intersections with the media.</p><p>Holbrooke always understood the power of the great families of the American republic. It was this phenomenon in Washington DC and well beyond that led him to associate with the Rusks and the Wisners, the Lakes and the Clintons. This propelled the driven diplomat, whose ambition was as insatiable as his need for validation, to important diplomatic postings, but the great prize always eluded him.</p><p>He never made the magisterial eyrie of US secretary of state, losing out to Warren Christopher and Hillary Clinton, among others. But Christopher sent the Europhile Holbrooke to Bonn as ambassador to Germany.</p><p>Packer observes: \"I don't have much to tell you about his year in Bonn. Ambassadors in places like that have a nice deal. A beautiful old mansion on the Rhine with a pool and tennis court, a large and obsequious staff, nine-man personal security detail, armored Cadillac, honour guards, fancy dinners, high-level visitors (Nixon, one month before he died) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 In his living room, Holbrooke displayed the photograph of his grandfather with pickle helmet and Iron Cross. German visitors didn't care for it. But the Germans loved Holbrooke. He knew their history, he valued the Atlantic alliance, and he didn't talk in Protocol.\" But it was Holbrooke's remorseless diplomacy at an isolated US Air Force base in Ohio for which he should be remembered. The Dayton Peace Accords offered a solution for the Balkans, and it was Holbrooke who hammered out the clauses with people such as the Serb dictator Slobodan Milo\u00c5\u00a1evic. Holbrooke's engagement with the Balkans is a story of tragedy and triumph, but his unsuccessful campaign for the Nobel Peace Prize was probably justified.</p><p>As usual, Holbrooke alienated the judges just as he did the incoming president, Barack Obama. \"Holbrooke and Obama sat down alone,\" writes Packer.</p><p>\"He presented the president-elect with an inscribed copy of To End a War. Predictable, self-serving - a small mistake. Obama was the kind of person who, on meeting you, established his no-bullshit credentials by announcing that he hadn't read your book.</p><p>Obama addressed Holbrooke as \"Dick\", the name still used by former Holbrooke associates on the campaign.</p><p>'Would you do me a favour, Mr President?' Holbrooke said. 'It's important to my wife that you call me \"Richard\".</p><p>' \"Richard\".' Holbrooke had just corrected the next president, and in a way that could only be called uxorious. That was a bigger mistake.\"</p><p>This is a mesmerising biography that reads like a grand novel, with characters whose lives reflected the American Century in all its consequence and consternation. Packer has delivered a masterpiece.Stephen Loosley is a senior visiting fellow at the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-41714fde35b211eab96a4159c962ef9d825986b68beda53ffcdfb8940116912c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0M-RX81-F0JP-W0RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1030\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Review Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;
