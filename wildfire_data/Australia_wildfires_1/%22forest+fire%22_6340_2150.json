Sorry I'd rather be in a box than go to jail,\" Mr Selby said.</p><p>Police, at the time, were concerned Mr Selby intended to harm himself.</p><p>\"I'm absolutely terrified,\" Mr Selby said in the record of the interview with police, the court heard.</p><p>\"I feel like I've just thrown my whole life away and I don't even remember it.\"</p><p>Sergeant Von Tunk said partway through the police interview, Mr Selby's \"demeanour\" changed when he became \"aware of the death and causation\".</p><p>\"The realisation came over him,\" he said.</p><p>\"He was quite teary and upset by the circumstances.\"</p><p>Mr Selby told investigators he was not on the phone at the time and was not distracted.</p><p>Cannabis was found in his system but the court heard it was not a factor police relied upon.</p><p>Mr Selby had spent three days in hospital for treatment of a head injury after the crash and the \"dissection of the vertical artery,\" his defence lawyer Julie Buxton said.</p><p>She told the court Mr Selby was \"severely distressed\" and \"distraught\" over the incident and was willing to abide by strict bail conditions.</p><p>Police opposed bail, citing concerns that he was a flight risk because he had lived in Tasmania and Queensland in the past.</p><p>Court documents show he told police he wanted to \"disappear into the large bushland between Eildon and the border or will go to Thursday Island [in far north Queensland]\".</p><p>Accused driver suffered PTSD from 2009 bushfires</p><p>They were also concerned about the caravan park where Mr Selby said he would be living if he was granted bail.</p><p>\"Two years?\" he had asked during the police interview, a reference to a possible jail sentence.</p><p>Ms Buxton told the court her client had strong ties to the community and was needed to help his ageing parents who had health issues.</p><p>The court heard he had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since the 2009 bushfires in Victoria, in which 173 people died.</p><p>\"It's an unfortunate coincidence that the circumstances of this matter also arises in the context of devastating Victorian bushfires,\" Magistrate Susan Wakeling said.</p><p>But she denied his request for bail.</p><p>\"He asserted he would not go to jail, that he would ... take his partner, his child, his caravan and his vehicle and to go bush or to Thursday Island,\" she said.</p><p>\"It was a very explicit statement made by him.\"</p><p>Dressed in a suit and tie, Mr Selby held his hand in his head at times during the hearing and wiped his eyes with a tissue as his distressed partner watched on.</p><p>The case has been adjourned until mid-June.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Lecturer, Department of Human Pathology, University of Nairobi</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline><highlight><bodyText><p>Even those that live in areas where the population has already been vaccinated would not be totally protected if the virus mutates elsewhere.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some countries, such as Tanzania and Madagascar, have issued statements saying they do not have plans to vaccinate their populations against COVID-19. Moina Spooner, an editor with The Conversation Africa, asked pathology expert Dr Ahmed Kalebi to unpack what this means for the global effort to contain the pandemic.</emphasis></p><h>What are the risks if not everyone is vaccinated against COVID-19?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In countries where no significant proportion of the population is vaccinated, there is a huge risk of sustained community spread of COVID-19 over a prolonged period. </p><p>The longer the period of sustained community spread, the more likely that the virus will mutate. And this means it could be a breeding ground for the new coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - to mutate into more aggressive variants. The mutated variants from the unvaccinated population will be able to infect even those in the vaccinated population. </p><p>Vaccines may not work against mutated variants because of changes that happen in the genetic code of the virus. A vaccine is meant to create an immune response through antibodies which are designed to recognise the virus' protein structure which has been altered. Think of it like an enemy altering their military uniform, becoming less recognisable to the opposing army.</p><p>They can also evade immunity induced by previous infection for similar reasons - immunity was designed towards the structure of that original virus. The altered virus wouldn't be easily recognisable by antibodies from the previous infection. Therefore the mutated strains could infect those already vaccinated, causing re-infection. </p><p>This means that everyone would continue to be vulnerable. Even those who live in areas where the population has already been vaccinated would not be totally protected against the virus if the virus mutated elsewhere. With the interconnectedness of countries and regions around the world, no single population lives in total seclusion. No particular population is safe unless all populations are safe. </p><p>This coronavirus is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/the-coronavirus-may-have-mutated-to-become-more-infectious-dr-anthony-fauci-says.html\">easily</url> transmissible from person-to-person through the air. Any new, and possibly deadlier, mutated variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be more contagious, and easily spread worldwide. Much like the original virus.</p><p>The whole world will only be safe after ensuring that all populations are adequately vaccinated. It seems unlikely that the pandemic can be fully contained through the existing prevention measures or that it'll soon burn out. This happens when infections slow down because a significant proportion of the population has developed \"herd immunity\", either from previous infection or vaccination or when movement of people who fuel the epidemic is completely halted. The virus then can't be transmitted quickly - from one person or segment of the population to another - much like the way a bush or forest fire burns out when most of the plants are already charred, or if there is no more wind to propel the fire and thus cannot continue spreading.</p><h>How can governments mitigate these risks?</h><p>It won't be realistic for countries that have vaccinated their populations to close their borders against countries that haven't vaccinated. Unless vaccinated countries completely shut their borders from the rest of the world, there would always be some interaction between their citizens and citizens from unvaccinated countries. </p><p>To protect themselves against the virus, governments need to quickly roll out vaccines. Vaccines provide the most effective and controllable prevention measures to contain any viral infection. Particularly one that is highly transmissible like SARS-CoV-2. There's also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52354520\">no real possibility</url> of antiviral treatment or cure, because at present there are no antiviral drugs in the pipeline that have shown any indication of effectiveness against COVID-19. </p><p>As different countries wait to access vaccines and vaccinate their populations, the other public health measures <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">that are</url> known to slow down or mitigate the spread of COVID-19 should continue to be enforced. This will limit the intra-community and inter-community spread of the virus, reducing the rate of reproduction and mutations. It will also minimise hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19. </p><p>These measures include using face masks, hand-washing and social distancing. </p><p>Where there's an indication of an impending surge in infection rates, authorities must move fast to put a \"circuit-breaker\" action in to forestall the surge. These include imposing lockdowns and mass quarantines in a geographically targeted manner. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: How Ireland turned around one of the biggest spikes in COVID cases in the world</emphasis></p><p>Monitoring the infection rate and extent of spread of the virus through laboratory testing for detection of the virus - and genomic testing for mutations - is key in informing and guiding the authorities on what steps to take. Testing capacity therefore needs to be scaled up, including tests that detect the virus - such as PCR and antigen tests - and serological (antibody) tests which check for those who have had the infection before and have developed some immunity. </p><p>Having this data will allow for serosurveillance mapping - testing for antibodies - and monitoring. Serosurveillance can also guide the prioritisation of vaccine distribution. </p><p>This shows the importance of using science in approaches to fighting the pandemic. Governments must also work together - as one global community - so it works for everyone.</p><h>What approach should governments be taking in efforts to contain the pandemic?</h><p>Governments must work together to scale up the production and global supply of the vaccine within the shortest time possible. It's crucial that as much of the world's population can access the vaccine as soon possible. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/south-african-covid-19-vaccine-trials-hold-key-lessons-for-future-partnerships-154676\">requires</url> abolishing \"vaccine nationalism\" and hoarding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: No country is an island: collective approach to COVID-19 vaccines is the only way to go</emphasis></p><p>There also needs to be an increase in funding and support to existing vaccine <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/what-it-will-take-to-produce-vaccines-in-nigeria-moneys-just-the-first-step-153497\">production sites</url> and new sites for vaccine production must be established, including in deprived and underdeveloped countries. This would happen through technology transfers with sharing of <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/dummys-guide-to-how-trade-rules-affect-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-152897\">intellectual property</url> and technical capacity for the vaccines that have already been proven to be efficacious. </p><p>The solution lies in a concerted global approach to ensure the whole world is safe. No one will be fully safe from a pandemic unless the whole world is collectively safe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ahmed Kalebi does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAFR-155144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAFR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6210-KJ21-DXP7-12T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463585</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1110\"/><timeReceived>10:44 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Africa</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7045\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 15, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX002125</classCode><className>SARS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DP57</classCode><className>DISEASE IMMUNITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

With three others from Ballarat and a number of others from across Victoria, he was part of the first team of interstate volunteers to land in the western state and render assistance during a three day deployment late last week.</p><p>\"We flew into Perth and were then flown in an RAAF Hercules aircraft to Geraldton,\" he told The Courier.</p><p>Once there the Victorian team linked in with a group of SES and Rural Fire Service volunteers from New South Wales and the two formed a taskforce.</p><p>Read more: Ballarat SES volunteers deployed to WA to assist after devastating cyclone</p><p>With resources stretched on the ground, it meant they arrived with no equipment available for them to use.</p><p>One of the first things the crews did was go to Bunnings and almost \"clear it out\" - purchasing thousands of dollars of necessary equipment such as tarps, rope, ladders and screws.</p><p>VicSES has since flown over rescue vehicles and a massive amount of repair equipment.</p><p>Mr Bluett said Geraldton was \"extremely lucky\" that the cyclone hit the coast far north enough so that it was not extensively damaged, with an initial fear the cyclone could destroy more than 8000 homes if it hit the city directly.</p><p>However, fallen powerlines meant power was out in the area for several days.</p><p>Smaller towns further inland were also impacted.</p><p>\"Quite a few inland towns and farms were quite seriously impacted,\" Mr Bluett said.</p><p>On the second day the volunteers travelled to Mingenew, located on the \"cropping belt\".</p><p>The volunteers helped out a few residents in the town before visiting a number of outlying farms - up to 30 kilometres away - where roofs had been blown off houses.</p><p>The window of one farm house had been blown in, with the force of the wind then blowing an internal wall in.</p><p>Many of the people who live on these properties were desperately trying to hire more generators to keep their farm operations going, with it expected that they could be without power for a while yet.</p><p>\"They're powered off single or double line power lines that go for miles just to one farm.</p><p>\"Everywhere you go there are powerlines down. We saw large convoys or workers trying to restore power but it's a huge job.\"</p><p>On their final day of deployment, last Friday, the volunteers travelled to Northampton, which Mr Bluett described as \"seriously smashed about\".</p><p>\"There were still lots of caravans and cars coming down the national highway,\" Mr Bluett said, noting that it was the last week of school holidays.</p><p>So the first task they undertook was cleaning up the caravan park at Northampton.</p><p>\"We cleaned up the caravan park, all the fallen trees and signs, and three guys turned up with chippers to throw tree branches through,\" he said. \"In short order we had it ready for people to stay in.\"</p><p>Much of the day was filled with building assessments, in addition roof repairs.</p><p>A very old town, many of the houses which had damaged roofs were built with asbestos cement sheeting on the walls.</p><p>\"It makes it hard to do temporary repairs,\" he said. \"There are serious issues of asbestos around these towns.\"</p><p>It is expected many of these homes may need to be demolished and rebuilt.</p><p>Community infrastructure was also damaged, with Mr Bluett working as part of a team to repair the roof of the Northampton District Bowling Club for several hours.</p><p>\"It is important for community facilities to be put back together,\" he explained.</p><p>\"It isn't someone's house but it is an important community facility they need to have in tact for community resilience, recovery and to get back to normal.\"</p><p>Members of the club dropped in at one point to express their gratitude that the volunteers had travelled from so far away to help repair the roof and prevent further damage to the building from rain.</p><p>Mr Bluett, a SES volunteer of almost 40 years, said he had \"never seen so much devastation in a single town\".</p><p>\"We get storms that rip through Ballarat and knock some roofs off but it's a small area.</p><p>\"When you see lots of small towns and outlying farms you realise the scale.\"</p><p>While initially thinking they would be doing a lot of work clearing trees during their deployment, most of the work was repairing roofs.</p><p>A lot of people were living in damaged houses, while those whose roofs had been ripped off were forced to move out or live in temporary housing on their properties.</p><p>\"The effects on these communities will go on for months, if not longer,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Bluett said seeing the destruction was \"confronting\".</p><p>With resources so stretched due to the widespread damage, many of the people they went to assist hadn't yet seen any emergency services since the cyclone hit.</p><p>With power still out across much of the area when they were there, communities did not have mobile phones or televisions, so the volunteers actually knew more about what was happening than those living in the state.</p><p>\"They were in a communication black out,\" Mr Bluett said.</p><p>While he has seen a lot of roof damage during his years as an SES volunteer, in these circumstances their role was not only to fix damage but also to talk to community members.</p><p>Some of these people were distraught - in one case a farmer's wife begged for the volunteers to put a tarp over a house, but it was impossible for them to do so.</p><p>The response phase - which includes assessments and temporary repairs - is expected to continue for several weeks, with deployments from Victoria expected to continue into May.</p><p>A third group of Victorian volunteers travelled to the affected area on Wednesday, including four from Ballarat.</p><p>This includes Ben Lynch, who travelled in the first deployment with Mr Bluett.</p><p>Country Fire Authority, Forest Fire Management Victoria and Emergency Management Victoria personnel are also assisting the region.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said the agency-wide approach would continue to support WA for as long as required.</p><p>\"The area impacted by this devastating cyclone is enormous. Emergency services crews from around Australia and the Australian Defence Force are also assisting. Many communities are still without electricity,\" said Commissioner Crisp.</p><p>\"I'd like to thank our volunteers, their families and employers who are supporting them in this effort.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc7fgvbg2h7wngj291838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62H2-BY21-JD34-V29X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1135\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 23, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aid program</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001359</classCode><className>POWER FAILURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX017</classCode><className>PERTH, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS004</classCode><className>WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A State of Disaster was called that day.</p><p>Just before 2:00pm, forest management firefighter Mat Kavanagh was returning to the town of Alexandra after he and a colleague had spent the morning attending camping sites to ensure fires were extinguished.</p><p>They were travelling on the Goulburn Valley Highway when a car driven by Novak Selby hit them head-on after crossing \"completely on the wrong side of the road\", according to a witness.</p><p>Mr Selby, 47, has pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of Mr Kavanagh, who died at the scene as a result of multiple injuries.</p><p>During a plea hearing on Tuesday, the County Court heard of the funny, passionate, loving and loyal man Mr Kavanagh was to his wife, two children, extended family and friends.</p><p>His wife, Jude Kavanagh, told the court of the \"total disbelief and utter shock\" when she received the phone call from police that \"changed my life\".</p><p>\"They confirmed my fear, my beautiful Mathew was dead,\" she said via video link.</p><p>\"I've never lost anything so suddenly before.</p><p>\"I no longer have a husband to share the highs and lows of life.</p><p>\"It's not fair that the kids will grow up without their father.\"</p><p>Both men affected by Black Saturday bushfires</p><p>Mr Kavanagh loved nature, fishing, music and people, the court heard. The couple's two young children submitted drawings to the court to express their loss.</p><p>The 43-year-old had worked for Forest Fire Management Victoria for 10 years and spent a lot of time on duty and on call during this summer's fire season, something his wife said \"was not Mat's favourite part of the job\".</p><p>He had been upset by his experience in the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, Ms Kavanagh told the court.</p><p>Mr Selby's experience in those same bushfires was such that he was diagnosed with PTSD after losing loved ones.</p><p>The court heard he could not explain why he drifted across the highway. An earlier hearing heard Mr Selby told investigators he was not on the phone at the time and was not distracted.</p><p>Cannabis was found in his system but the court heard it was not enough to have affected his driving.</p><p>\"There was minimal smoke haze but it did not impact the vision of motorists in the area,\" prosecutor Robyn Harper told the court.</p><p>Mr Selby's defence lawyer, David Gibson, said her client told a psychologist that he must have been thinking about Black Saturday at the time.</p><p>But the court was told Mr Selby had initially claimed the other car was on the wrong side of the road, and did not take responsibility for the crash at the scene, or in the days after when questioned by police.</p><p>'True and proper remorse' after failed bail application</p><p>Mr Gibson said Mr Selby had at first acted in self-interest, \"in a state of panic\", when he was concerned about what would happen to his wife and child if he was jailed.</p><p>\"He was fearful of the consequences of incarceration on his family,\" Mr Gibson said.</p><p>He also told the court Mr Selby's memory had been affected by the accident. Mr Selby suffered a blow to the head after his car flipped over on its side during the collision.</p><p>A letter of apology was submitted to the court, but not read out.</p><p>During a failed bail application in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court in March, police investigator Detective Sergeant Christian Von Tunk described a police record of interview with Mr Selby after he was released from hospital.</p><p>Mr Selby told police he would \"hook up the caravan and go bush\" because he feared going to jail and leaving his son alone, Sergeant Von Tunk said.</p><p>\"Sorry, I'd rather be in a box than go to jail,\" Mr Selby had said.</p><p>Court documents released at that time show he told police he wanted to \"disappear into the large bushland between Eildon and the border\", or go to Thursday Island in far north Queensland.</p><p>Mr Gibson said Mr Selby had reflected on his offending after the failed bail application and that \"a true and proper remorse came into play\".</p><p>Judge Gavan Meredith noted the \"profound\" effect of the offending on Mr Kavanagh's family.</p><p>Mr Selby faces a maximum 10-year sentence.</p><p>He's expected to be sentenced later this month</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-12523468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HB-3131-JCM0-6364-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><timeReceived>5:42 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia:VIC:Melbourne 3000</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Alexandra 3714</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Law, Crime and Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law, Crime and Justice/Courts and Trials</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

An intact rock face is really rare to see anywhere in the gold fields.\"</p><p>Cultural burning and weed management</p><p>The community is hoping to see more cultural burning happening in the two sites in areas deemed sensitive.</p><p>Earlier this year the community expressed concern about a planned burn in the Kalimna Park area, which is home to the endangered Eltham Copper Butterfly.</p><p>\"The fear is that burning done at the wrong time of year with too high of an intensity will wipe out the plant species and then the butterfly won't be able to feed on that and recreate itself,\" Mr Douglas said.</p><p>\"Cultural burning is done at less of an intensity, and we can largely exclude areas based off mosaic burning patterns.\"</p><p>Mr Douglas said the project was also looking at how to use cultural burning in areas of Wildflower Drive to protect the endangered pink-tailed worm-lizard, six of which have been found in the area.</p><p>\"Both sites currently have burns proposed by forest fire management, but within that Dja Dja Wurrung have selected areas that we deem sensitive that we would like to burn culturally and largely exclude some areas with our mosaic burning patterns,\" he said.</p><p>Weed management was also an important part of rehabilitating the land.</p><p>\"Moonlight Creek is just absolutely covered with gorse, blackberries and spiny rush, so it's definitely a priority of our members to start restoring that area,\" Mr Douglas said.</p><p>More broadly, the project aimed to provide employment to local Djaara people and help

Melbourne earlier than expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cooler air could be felt in the city around 2pm- three hours earlier than the Bureau of Meteorology had previously forecast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Laverton in the city's west recorded 41.5C, the hottest temperature in metropolitan Melbourne, before falling dramitically about 1.30pm.</p><p>Viewbank, Moorabbin Airport and Scoresby also recorded temperatures in the 40s. </p><p>Despite countless warnings, paramedics were still called to three jobs of people trapped in hot cars on Monday.             </p><p>Victoria's hottest places would be Shepparton and Yarrawonga in the state's north -reaching 42.1C and 42.3C respectively at 2pm- with those temperatures set to climb and peak by 5pm. </p><p>Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Dean Narramore said rain was expected to move through western parts of the state later in the evening and overnight. </p><p>\"We could wake up to a wet morning for Australia Day in Melbourne, which will tend to showers and sunny breaks,\" he said. </p><p>Tuesdays temperatures could be 15C cooler than what was seen on Monday, Mr Narramore said. </p><p>About 5-15mm was expected, with isolated heavy falls and storms across the north, Murray and northern parts of the state. </p><p>The last time Melbourne saw consecutive days of 35C or more was in mid-November 2020.</p><p>\"It has been a lot cooler snd milder in Victoria and Australia over the summer,\" Mr Narramore said.             </p><p>Moorabbin Airport had reached 40.6C at 12.30pm and was sitting at 27.3C an hour later. </p><p>Gusty winds carried cool air up the bay from 1.30pm, hitting suburbs like Frankston, Moorabbin and St Kilda, with some gusts reaching up to 60km/h. </p><p>Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Christie Johnson said the cool change arrived significantly earlier than expected. </p><p>\"Its gathered a lot of momentum along the coast and is roaring up faster than expected, which means it'll come through Melbourne earlier,\" Ms Johnson said. </p><p>\"The cool change was always expected to move through the southwest and reach parts of the northwest and central Victoria during the afternoon.\"</p><p>At Geelong Airport, the temperature dropped from 35.6C to 29.4C between 11.30am and 12pm.</p><p>Melbourne exceeded its forecast top of 39C when it climbed 39.2C at 12.30pm. </p><p>Moorabbin and Melbourne Airport recorded temperatures of more than 40C. </p><p/><p>Ms Johnson said rain was not expected with the cool change, and would follow later this evening and overnight. </p><p>Earlier, the Bureau of Meteorology revised its forecast to include the possibility of thunderstorms later this afternoon. </p><p/><p/><p>Temperatures will spike in the mid-40C mark in the state's north.</p><p>The overnight low was 24.5C at 3am.</p><p>It had already passed 30C in Melbourne at 7.30am and the city is expected to hit 40C at 2pm.</p><p>By contrast, Warrnambool in the state's southwest was 24C and Port Fairy was 23.3C at 10.30am. </p><p/><p/><p>Northeastern parts of Victoria might not see a cool change until the early hours of Tuesday morning. </p><p>Melburnians on Sunday tried to sleep during an uncomfortable night of temperatures in the high 20s.</p><p>The weather bureau took the unusual step of saying in its forecast that the night would be \"oppressive\".            </p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FIREYS PREPARE FOR 'CHALLENGING' 24 HOURS</emphasis></p><p>A total fire ban will be in place for six Victorian districts.</p><p>A

summer.</p><p>Winds of up to 60km/h could quickly propel any fires if they broke out.</p><p>Fire bans are in place for the Mallee, Wimmera, North Country, North Central, East Gippsland and North East.</p><p>Forest Fire Management chief fire officer Chris Hardman said there was potential for \"very significant and devastating\" forest fires as conditions worsened.</p><p>\"As we know, the prevailing northerly winds in Victoria tend to drive those fires in a long, narrow strip from north to south,\" he said.</p><p>\"And when the risk really occurs is on the wind change, because a fire from that may only be say 500m wide (but) as soon as that change comes through it could be five, six, 10km long.

The energy system is huge, and even with an internationally committed and focussed effort the transition will take many decades,'' he said.</p><p>\"It will also require respectful planning and re-training to ensure affected individuals and communities, who have fuelled our energy progress for generations, are supported throughout the transition.\"</p><p>Dr Finkel backed a strategy outlined last month by Scott Morrison, and first flagged in 2015 by Josh Frydenberg, that gas must serve as the transition fuel until clean energy sources such as solar and wind were sufficiently reliable.</p><p>\"Ultimately, we will need to complement solar and wind with a range of technologies such as high levels of storage, long-distance transmission, and much better efficiency in the way we use energy,'' Dr Finkel said.</p><p>\"But, while these technologies are being scaled up, we need an energy companion today that can react rapidly to changes in solar and wind output.</p><p>\"An energy companion that is itself relatively low in emissions, and that only operates when needed.</p><p>\"In the short-term, as the Prime Minister and Minister Angus Taylor have previously stated, natural gas will play that critical role.\"</p><p>While still a fossil fuel, Dr Finkel said gas was much cleaner than coal and more flexible. His speech comes as rebel Nationals step up a push for government subsidies for coal-fired power.</p><p>On Tuesday, former resources minister Matt Canavan took issue with Mr Morrison's gas transition plan, saying the government should not be picking technology favourites.</p><p>\"I don't want to prioritise one technology over any other energy technology,'' he said.</p><p>'Steep collective cost'</p><p>Dr Finkel did not entertain the notion of new coal as he warned of the perils of climate change.</p><p>\"The link between climate change, a rising number of forest fire danger days and our season of bushfires is clear, and has resulted in a steep collective cost that can be measured in billions of dollars in economic damage, which pales to insignificance when compared to the greater costs behind the statistics,'' he said.</p><p>\"The lost lives and livelihoods. The lost businesses and homes. The lost flora and fauna. These costs are immeasurable.''</p><p>\"These extreme weather events will not only persist but will be more severe, and in some cases more frequent, into the future.\"</p><p>Hydrogen the 'hero'</p><p>He made a strong case for the development of hydrogen fuel technology for heavy transport, heavy industry and chemical production.</p><p>\"Enter the hero, Hydrogen,'' he said.</p><p>It can be easily produced from water using electrolysis, powered by renewable energy.</p><p>Alternatively, to ease pressure in the renewable network, it could be electrolysed using coal or natural gas for power with the carbon dioxide byproduct being buried using carbon capture and storage.</p><p>\"By producing hydrogen from natural gas or coal, using carbon capture and permanent storage, we can add back two more lanes to our energy highway, ensuring we have four primary energy sources to meet the needs of the future - solar, wind, hydrogen from natural gas, and hydrogen from coal,'' he said.</p><p>Moreover, it was a valuable source of exports.</p><p>\"There's a nearly $2 trillion global market for hydrogen come 2050, assuming that we can drive the price of producing hydrogen to substantially lower than $2 per kilogram,'' he said.</p><p>Dr Finkel hit back at those saying Australia should not reduce emissions because it only accounted for 1.3 per cent of global carbon pollution.</p><p>He said that was akin to a household not saving water during restrictions because one house would make little difference.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520239038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y66-3C31-DY19-C0S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><timeReceived>12:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Unlike most disasters, which are singular in nature - a flood, an earthquake, a cyclone that strike one location - this one just keeps rolling on. It's destroyed towns and villages, laid waste to forests and farmland, disrupted lives and distorted our very sense of time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the South Coast, we're calling it the Forever Fire. It's like a psychotic home invader we can't get rid of, quiet one day but triggered into a violent, unpredictable rage the next.</p><p>It's changed the way we live. The morning routine involves checking the Fires Near Me app and the weather forecast. Lives now revolve around the long-range weather outlook and plans are guided by what the fire is doing and where it is sending its smoke.</p><p>Anxiety levels spike every time heatwave conditions return. Even though the fire has passed through many areas, even though it can one day be declared under control, this monster has shown it is quite capable of reigniting when it seems there is nothing left to burn.</p><p>We saw that again at the end of January, when the fire took more homes in the Southern Highlands and on the Far South Coast.</p><p>The old certainties of summer - the trips to the beach, the evenings on the verandah, the barbecues with friends - have gone up in smoke. Nothing seems permanent any more - the sense of peril arrives on every warm breeze from the north-west.</p><p>When it first ignited in two places in the hinterland between Ulladulla and Batemans Bay on Tuesday, November 26, the editor of the Bay Post Kerrie O'Connor, who lives at East Lynne, warned it had the potential to run down to the coast. Turns out she was entirely prescient.</p><p>Within days it had roared up towards Ulladulla and down to threaten Batemans Bay. On November 30, it crossed the Clyde and began its destructive march towards Bawley Point and Lake Tabourie.</p><p>Urgent community meetings were called. Residents were told to activate their bushfire survival plans. Many had not given them a thought beforehand, despite the repeated urgings of the Rural Fire Service.</p><p>Hundreds gathered in Ulladulla on the afternoon of December 13 to hear dire warnings from Currowan Fire incident controller Superintendent Mark Williams, who presented a worst-case scenario: \"This fire has the potential to get as far as Nerriga Road to the north and Moruya to the south,\" he said. He also warned not to expect a fire truck at every property - there were simply not enough of them.</p><p>Ten days after this meeting, Nerriga itself had been overrun by flames, its residents hunkering down in the pub as RFS tankers surrounded the building and hosed it down.</p><p>By January 4, Supterintendent Williams' worst-case scenario had been surpassed many times over.</p><p>The Currowan fire had spread so far, it now had to be divided into four: the Currowan 2 fire, the Morton fire, the Charleys Forest Fire and the Clyde Mountain Fire. To get from one end of the fireground to the other involves a three-and-a-half hour drive. One would need an entire day to drive its perimeter - that's how big it has grown. And it's still on the move.</p><p>On January 31 the original Currowan blaze had started merging with the Badja Forest Road, Countengany Fire to the south.</p><p>As journalists covering the story, we have also become part of it.

David Crowe reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National anxiety over the next phase of the pandemic has reached a point where some Australians believe an early election is the best way to settle the politics, give federal leaders a mandate and steer the nation out of crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We would love to see an early election,\" says one business leader who is frustrated at the way populism rules the debate over the policies needed this year and beyond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fear of the coronavirus seems stronger than ever despite the country's extraordinary success against COVID-19. That fear has the power to decide the next election. So much power, in fact, that no political leader will take the risk of swimming against the tide.</p><p>Those who have to deal with political leaders have to be careful about what they say, but they know they will be forced to wait until after the election before they find out when the federal government will open the international border. The sooner the election, the sooner everyone knows the answer.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison sees this national mood and knows how to put it to use. He has adjusted his message to Australians in the past two weeks to warn of greater dangers ahead, to the point where he seems to stoke the fears.</p><p>Four months ago, when the country emerged from summer lockdowns and border closures, Morrison thought the risks were subsiding. Confident that vaccines were on their way, he said COVID-19 could present a similar risk to many other viruses already in the community.</p><p>\"What I'm saying is that the risk environment is reducing,\" he said on February 5.</p><p>Not any more. He now argues the pandemic is a greater threat than it was one year ago. \"The pandemic is raging. The pandemic is morphing. It's changing every day,\" he said last Tuesday. \"I'm not going to take risks with Australians' lives.\"</p><p>When Virgin chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka called for a road map to open the borders but made her unwise remark that \"some people may die\", Morrison made no attempt to acknowledge her case for a clear plan to open the country. He slapped down the remark as \"insensitive\" and said it was difficult to \"have any truck\" with what she was saying.</p><p>So Morrison does not want to calm the farm. He wants to talk about the forest fire next door.</p><p>A clear majority wants this caution. The Resolve Political Monitor, published by The Age on Tuesday, shows overwhelming support for border controls at a time when 3.4 million people have died from COVID-19 worldwide.</p><p>Asked about the federal budget's assumption the border will stay closed until the middle of next year, 44 per cent said this was about right and 33 per cent said it was too optimistic. Only 9 per cent thought it was too pessimistic. Those who want a faster plan to open the border are clearly in the minority.</p><p>The same survey, based on responses from 1622 voters online in the five days after the budget, also showed majority support for the overall budget strategy, with 62 per cent agreeing with the priority of stimulus spending. Only 17 per cent prefer action on deficits and debt.</p><p>Yet there is a caution on another front, too. The survey found 29 per cent of respondents were reluctant to take a vaccine against the coronavirus in the months ahead. To be exact, 14 per cent said they were \"not very likely\" and 15 per cent said they were \"not at all likely\" to do so.</p><p>The survey found 35 per cent had registered for a vaccine or had already received one or two doses. It also found a separate 14 per cent were extremely likely to be vaccinated, 8 per cent were very likely to do so and 13 per cent were fairly likely to do so.</p><p>The government has its own surveys showing similar concerns, which helps explain why Morrison said he was \"not overly troubled\" by the results.</p><p>This is true of other results in Resolve Political Monitor. The survey reveals what the government knows. The Liberal Party's polling is finding the same reluctance to open the border. Morrison reflects the mood of the focus groups with his new tone.</p><p>Morrison has been testing his new message since the May 11 budget, when Treasurer Josh Frydenberg outlined $74.6 billion in new spending on aged care, tax cuts, mental health, skills, disability services and more. Day by day, he has honed the message to be ready for the election.</p><p>And the Coalition went into campaign mode last week. Morrison went to Lilley in Brisbane for instance, held by Labor on a margin of just 0.64 per cent, and Dunkley in suburban Melbourne, held by Labor by 2.7 per cent.</p><p>Visits to Coalition seats also took Morrison to Deakin, Goldstein and La Trobe in Melbourne, Bass and Braddon in Tasmania and at least five seats in Queensland: Bonner, Brisbane, Flynn, Forde and Longman.</p><p>Morrison still strikes some observers, especially women, as too belligerent and arrogant at times. He has floundered on social issues over the past few months. Some expert observers, distant from Canberra but familiar with its ways, think he has been off his game since Brittany Higgins went public with her allegations of rape in Parliament House on February 15.</p><p>Now, with a budget to sell, Morrison is back on safer ground. Again, the Resolve Political Monitor shows why. When voters are asked about policy issues, they generally favour the Coalition as the better party to run the country.</p><p>Asked who is best to manage the COVID-19 situation, 46 per cent name the Coalition but only 20 per cent prefer Labor. The government's support is up from 42 per cent in the survey one month earlier.</p><p>On economic management, 46 per cent name the Coalition as best to manage the issue but only 20 per cent name Labor. The result one month ago was much closer: 43 to 21 per cent.</p><p>Labor is in dire trouble because the Coalition leads in areas where Labor has usually held the advantage. On jobs and wages, voters favour the Coalition over Labor by 37 to 30 per cent. On health and aged care, the gap is 34 to 29 per cent. On industrial relations it is 33 to 31 per cent. On education it is 34 to 30 per cent.</p><p>This is a different sort of budget bounce for a government. Resolve director Jim Reed says the result is \"way too close to call\" in two-party terms.</p><p>And the Coalition goes to the election with a majority of one in the lower house, a starting position with no political capital to spare. Morrison has to craft his message to capture the national mood.</p><p>Even so, the government neglects the Australian employers and communities that need a road map to open borders. Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, says anyone who depends on tourism is in \"diabolical\" trouble and the daily political doorstops, with ideas like vaccine passports, are not helping.</p><p>\"There are too many different communications circulating all over the shop,\" she says. \"There is a desperate need for some sort of national unity.\"</p><p>Yet national cabinet is back to meeting once every month. There is no sense of the urgency that led Morrison to put the peak group on an \"operational footing\" just six weeks ago.</p><p>While Morrison seems too cautious for some business leaders, he is in tune with scientists on the continuing risks.</p><p>\"The PM is correct the pandemic is changing,\" says Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of NSW. \"Pandemics shouldn't be viewed from a linear perspective, as there are many facilitators that do not have equal impact and some that have more impact than the sum of each.\"</p><p>Those factors include the vaccination rate and the variants overseas. Getting things wrong, says McLaws, could quickly throw Australia into another wave of infection.</p><p>Just as Australians want to play it safe, so does Morrison.</p><p>For the moment, the political imperative is to keep people anxious until their votes are counted. The path to policy certainty runs through the ballot box. No wonder some want to get there as fast as possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7fw3ntd5bqu3og8g32v</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62RD-NCD1-F0J6-J0KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Falls ranged between 5mm and 17mm in the region but authorities have said much more was needed to douse the blazes. Two major fires in the area - Green Wattle Creek and Morton - were 'being controlled,' while another two - Jacqua Creek and Charleys Forest were under control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RFS Southern Tablelands operations officer Michael Gapps said the Green Wattle Creek fire around Wombeyan Caves received 17mm on Wednesday night. On Thursday morning, crews were assessing whether they could access tracks to check on fire activity. \"There were still some flare ups as the storm front came through at about 7pm but crews were on hand to deal with them,\" he said.</p><p>\"...With the cooler conditions they have been able to be more aggressive in their attack and they have had remote area crews working where they couldn't to stem the spread. Given the dryness of the fuel we are still seeing considerable fire behaviour in benign conditions and that has surprised (personnel), although they have been able to manage it.\"</p><p>Aerial support had also continued over days. On the ground, crews had been strengthening containment lines to the east of Taralga and around High Range. The RFS was urging people to take extreme caution along Wombeyan Caves Road, which is open to Goodmans Crossing. The Green Wattle fire stood at 277,517 hectares and spans Upper Lachlan, Oberon, Wingecarribee and Wollondilly council areas.</p><p>Mr Gapps said everyone was waiting with bated breath to see whether the forecast 40mm to 50mm of rain would come through.</p><p>Meantime, the Morton fire, which stood at 19,250ha, was also still flaring up in places. These occurred around the Bundanoon area on Wednesday afternoon but were quickly extinguished, the RFS said.</p><p>\"Current aerial reconnaissance reports there is minimal fire activity across all areas of the fireground, however, there has been some active fire below Teudts Road, Penrose,\" the latest newsletter stated.</p><p>Mr Gapps said conditions were relatively benign around Caoura Road, Tallong, but on Wednesday there were a few hot spots that crews extinguished and continued monitoring. Four to five crews were on scene.</p><p>Local firefighters have been given a reprieve with several strike teams working in the area. Aerial support was also on hand on Tuesday.</p><p>Tallong resident Peter Downie received 5.5mm at his Caoura Road property, 10km from the village. \"The humidity is still quite high and we're expecting more this afternoon. It's looking very stormy,\" he said. \"The rain will assist greatly with suppression, but I still feel there will be pockets of fire. There's still a lot of unburnt country but it's pretty remote.\"</p><p>Mr Downie said people were returning to properties with stock after previously evacuating. But the former RFS volunteer warned people shouldn't become complacent. \"I don't have a crystal ball, but if we don't get 100mm of rain in the next fortnight, [the fire] will be just ticking away ... The run isn't over yet,\" he said.</p><p>Currowan blaze The Currowan fire stood at 313,089ha and was burning between Nowra and Batemans Bay and east of Braidwood. Mr Gapps said it was still active on the eastern side of the Shoalhaven River and near the Goulburn Mulwaree border. In this area, the Charleys Forest fire is on Currowan's western flank.</p><p>But around south Marulan, Currowan was burning in inaccessible country. \"There has been discussion about putting remote area firefighting teams in to extinguish hotspots as the fire behaviour subsides,\" Mr Gapps said.</p><p>Nearby, the Jacqua Creek blaze, which broke out on December 28, was under control. The fireground received 5-10mm on Wednesday night. Crews are continuing to patrol and attend to hotpsots.</p><p>Mr Gapps said although conditions were benign across the four firegrounds, the rain so far wasn't sufficient to put them out. \"If we don't get any more rain, we need to address these things before it heats up again and brings these fires back to life. About 100mm of rain would be fantastic,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Gapps also reminded landholders to remain vigilant, given Wednesday night's lightning strikes could leave logs smouldering for weeks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOPNWS-doc78x0gmrl13qjf7iiis4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y16-0CD1-F0J6-J19W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

30 hand-held radios were bought for Nariel Valley residents with a donation and the Towong group received a $5000 grant to buy a community quick-fill pump.</p><p>\"When the fire hit, we had a few CFA and DELWP people, but most of the fire-fighting was done with local fellas with their own resources,\" Ms Joyce said.</p><p>\"So if we can place some strategic standpipes around Towong, we can have more people filling up.</p><p>\"If a power-line was to fall across the road, that would really divide one half of Towong from getting to the river, which was the water resource in the fires.\"</p><p>The CFA stepped up their preparedness activities this year, running a session with 110 people and visiting 70 properties.</p><p>Ms Joyce said there were heightened emotions around the upcoming season.</p><p>\"Normally, you never curse a good year, but the anxiety levels are getting up, because everyone's looking at the flats with the head-high grass,\" she said.</p><p>\"We had the 'Are you bogged mate?' lady [Mary O'Brien] come recently, and I know my partner and a good group from Towong all went.</p><p>\"There's all these programs coming online now, with COVID restrictions easing.\"</p><p>The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the recovery outlook was clear in a survey of 327 people done by the Alpine community recovery committee.</p><p>CRC chair Fiona Nicholls said four in 10 people impacted by the 2019-2020 bushfires reported they were progressing well, but just under four in 10 said they were making some to no progress.</p><p>\"We had 227 people - or 70 per cent of our survey respondents - explain to us how COVID-19 restrictions affected their bushfire recovery - we heard a lot of stress, a lot of strain, a lot of emotion, in their responses,\" she said.</p><p>\"We heard about the impact on mental health, people lamenting the loss of being able to gather and debrief and support one another to recover from the fires.</p><p>\"We heard about the impact on people's lives - not being able to travel, having to homeschool, all these new issues we faced under restrictions, impacting people's recovery - the double whammy that so many people spoke about.</p><p>\"And, we also heard about gratitude - people acknowledging that despite the hardships, they were grateful to be safe and well.\"</p><p>Ms Joyce said despite the strain of the pandemic, she didn't feel like the Upper Murray had been forgotten.</p><p>\"We had a heap of help at the start from Melbourne, and everyone is naturally going to be focused on a massive pandemic and forget about the bushfires a little bit,\" she said.</p><p>\"But I think everyone is coming back and realising we have had this humongous year and we need help.</p><p>\"We have been very lucky.</p><p>\"We'd love for people, now that they can, to get involved and start sharing ideas.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRDRML-doc7dvb6gscj6p1g8gg5a1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRDRML2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61N5-W401-F0J6-J0BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386165</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"948\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Border Mail</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 1, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Social commitment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>City</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wwf.org.au/news/news/2020/3-billion-animals-impacted-by-australia-bushfire-crisis#gs.vckp7g\">estimated three billion</url> animals were killed or displaced, not including invertebrates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The impact of the fires on biodiversity was too vast for professional scientists alone to collect data. So in the face of this massive challenge, we set up a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/environment-recovery-project-australian-bushfires\">community (citizen) science project</url> through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</url> website to help paint a more complete picture of which species are bouncing back - and which are not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost 400 community scientists living near or travelling across the firegrounds have recorded their observations of flora and fauna in the aftermath, from finding <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/38285436\">fresh wombat droppings</url> in blackened forests, to hearing the croaks of healthy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/69126202\">tree frogs</url> in a dam choked with debris and ash. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each observation is a story of survival against the odds, or of tragedy. Here are five we consider particularly remarkable. </p><h>Greater gliders after Australia's largest ever fire</h><p>The Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html\">the biggest forest fire</url> in Australian history, razing an area seven times the size of Singapore. This meant there nothing in history scientists could draw from to predict the animals' response.   </p><p>So it came as a huge surprise when a community scientist observed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/66511751\">greater gliders</url> deep within the heart of the Gospers Mountain firegrounds in Wollemi National Park, far from unburned habitat. Greater gliders are listed as \"vulnerable\" under national environment law. They're nocturnal and live in hollow-bearing trees. </p><p>How gliders survived the fire is still unknown. Could they have hidden in deep hollows of trees where the temperature is relatively cooler while the fire front passed? And what would they have eaten afterwards? Greater gliders usually <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9960401\">feed on young leaves and flowers</url>, but these foods are very rare in the post-fire environment. </p><p>Finding these gliders shows how there's still so much to learn about the resilience of species in the face of even the most devastating fires, especially as bushfires are forecast to become more frequent.</p><h>Rare pink flowers burnishing the firegrounds</h><p>The giant scale of the 2019-20 fires means post-fire flowering is on display in grand and gorgeous fashion. This is a feature of many native plant species which need fire to stimulate growth. </p><p>Excitingly, community scientists recorded a long-dormant species, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://inaturalist.org/observations/70592241\">pink flannel flower</url> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Actinotus forsythii</emphasis>), that's now turning vast areas of the Blue Mountains pink. </p><p>Pink flannel flowers are not considered threatened, but they are very <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/once-in-a-lifetime-pink-flowers-emerge-from-burnt-landscapes-20210215-p572m8.html\">rarely seen</url>. </p><p>Individuals of this species spend most of their life as a seed in the soil. Seeds require a chemical found in bushfire smoke, and the right seasonal temperatures, to germinate.</p><h>Rediscovering the midge orchid</h><p>Much of Australia's amazing biodiversity is extremely local. Some species, particularly plants, exist only in a single valley or ridge. The Black Summer fires destroyed the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21266-5\">entire range</url> of 100 Australian plant species, incinerating the above-ground parts of every individual. How well a species regenerates after fire determines whether it recovers, or is rendered extinct.  </p><p>One of these is a species of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/1177324-Genoplesium-bishopii\">midge orchid</url>, which grows in a small area of Gibraltar Range National Park, NSW. </p><p>All of the midge orchid's known sites are thought to have burned in late 2019.

In Victoria, he's the crew boss for the team at Mount Buffalo.</p><p>He said he and his crew knew the horrors of bushfire season only too well and were honoured to be chosen to help out in Australia.</p><p>\"It's tragic. We know what it feels like back home and being able to lend a hand here, it's an honour to come,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Dimaculangan's home base is at the Angeles National Forest in southern California.</p><p>\"All this country is beautiful,\" he said. \"It's very similar to things back home like Georgia, Florida, where the moisture level is still high but it will still rip and burn, which can be devastating.\" Dry lightning struck the Mount Buffalo plateau on New Year's Eve, sparking 14 fires that have merged to become a mega-blaze.</p><p>After dangerous conditions eased slightly at the weekend, sustained waterbombing quelled some of the fires, slowing the spread of the blaze and opening the land to containment work by the US hotshot crew.</p><p>On Monday the team marched in formation with their heavy gear across a charred valley to scout out the landscape and find where they could undertake vital containment work to stop the blaze.</p><p>The bush of Mount Buffalo is parched but the biggest risk is the volatility of the eucalyptus trees, which Mr Dimaculangan said could throw embers 40km away.</p><p>While some Australian forest firefighters are qualified to undertake this arduous work, the Americans must be able to hike 4.8km in less than 45 minutes while carrying 20kg. They also have additional specialisations in operating their heavy equipment.</p><p>Justine Gude is working the chainsaw on this mission. She said she usually didn't accept any work after November but felt compelled to travel to Australia to help.</p><p>\"You look at these terrible stories and everyone wants to know what they can do to help,\" she said.</p><p>\"Not everyone's in the position where they can help, and fortunately I'm in that unique position where I actually can help, so I jumped at the opportunity.\" In Victoria, four men have died as a result of the fires and 340 residential properties and 532 non-residential structures have been destroyed or significantly affected.</p><p>While the Country Fire Authority battles to save towns and properties, Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighters are the ones working to stop the spread of fires in dense bushland.</p><p>FFMV firefighter Julian Atherstone, 49, said the Americans -arrived just in time to support the weary crew assigned to Mount Buffalo. \"It's great to have these guys over here because they just provide an enthusiasm and a dynamic to the effort, which is what we need, particularly in this situation where we're under-resourced,\" he said. \"It was only a couple of days ago there were only four of us.\" In the US, forest firefighters can be sent away on missions for up to 21 days before they get a chance for a break.</p><p>Eduardo Valle, 30, will miss his wife and two-year-old daughter who he left behind in Los Angeles but said he was honoured to be chosen among the thousands who applied to come to Australia.</p><p>\"She's two years old so she doesn't know,\" he said. \"I'll FaceTime her at night and talk to her and she's just smiling.\" Mr Valle is staying in the town of Bright with the other US firefighters.

So it really is a critical time for us,\" Mr Warrington said.</p><p>Father of two Bill Slade, 60, from Wonthaggi, was killed by a falling tree at the fire's edge in Omeo on Saturday while working with a group of Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighters.</p><p>His colleague, Mat Kavanagh, 43, was also killed on January 3 on the Goulburn Valley Highway at Thornton, near Mansfield.</p><p>Speaking at a fire edge near Bairnsdale on Monday, DELWP divisional commander Matt Long told The Age there was always a danger of falling trees.</p><p>\"We use our excavators to remove dangerous trees, we have a lot of training, we brief our crews all the time about the specific dangers on site. So their training and situational awareness, that provides us a good level of safety,\" Mr Long said.</p><p>Crews were strengthening containment lines during Monday's milder weather.</p><p>\"So what we do is, if it's an existing road, which is what we've got here, we'll use the bulldozers and excavators to prepare it, get it into a condition where we can use it. Then we'll put fire in along that line in a controlled way and that stops the fire coming up,\" Mr Long said.</p><p>\"When fire conditions are more severe, particularly in situations like this, it's just too dangerous to be in the forests and on the fire edge. So when these milder conditions are in place and the fire activity is a lower intensity, it allows us to put in these burns in a controlled way. It's a lot safer that way, and we can achieve what we need to.\"</p><p>Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Michael Efron said fire conditions would remain suppressed at least for the rest of the week.</p><p>\"There's no sign this week of any spike days in the fire danger,\" Mr Efron said.</p><p>\"If anything we actually see an increase in moisture level throughout the state ... But not quite the widespread 50 millimetres or so that we actually need to put these fires out.\"</p><p>There were 1500 firefighters on the ground on Monday while 19 fires continued to burn. One emergency blaze was threatening homes in Noorinbee and Noorinbee North.</p><p>Close to 1500 homes and businesses still had no power in the fire zones on Monday, as AusNet workers started getting into the affected areas.</p><p>\"Generators are providing emergency power to parts of townships where possible in surrounding areas around Mallacoota, Omeo, Corryong and Walhalla,\" a State Control Centre spokeswoman said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520227581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYV-8HJ1-JBJ7-N367-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><timeReceived>08:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

His colleague Mat Kavanagh, 43, was killed on January 3 on the Goulburn Valley Highway at Thornton, near Mansfield.</p><p>Speaking at a fire edge near Bairnsdale on Monday, Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning divisional commander Matt Long said there was always a danger of falling trees.</p><p>\"We use our excavators to remove dangerous trees, we have a lot of training, we brief our crews all the time about the specific dangers on site. So their training and situational awareness, that provides us a good level of safety,\" Mr Long said.</p><p>Crews were strengthening containment lines during yesterday's milder weather.</p><p>\"So what we do is, if it's an existing road, which is what we've got here, we'll use the bulldozers and excavators to prepare it, get it into a condition where we can use it. Then we'll put fire in along that line in a controlled way and that stops the fire coming up,\" Mr Long said.</p><p>\"When fire conditions are more severe, particularly in situations like this, it's just too dangerous to be in the forests and on the fire edge. So when these milder conditions are in place and the fire activity is a lower intensity, it allows us to put in these burns in a controlled way. It's a lot safer that way, and we can achieve what we need to.\"</p><p>Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Michael Efron said fire conditions would remain suppressed at least for the rest of the week.</p><p>\"There's no sign this week of any spike days in the fire danger,\" Mr Efron said. \"If anything, we actually see an increase in moisture level throughout the state ... but not quite the widespread 50 millimetres or so that we actually need to put these fires out.\"</p><p>There were 1500 firefighters on the ground yesterday while 19 fires continued to burn. One emergency blaze was threatening homes in Noorinbee and Noorinbee North, near Cann River in Victoria's east.</p><p>Close to 1500 homes and businesses still had no power in the fire zones yesterday, as AusNet workers started getting into the affected areas.</p><p>\"Generators are providing emergency power to parts of townships where possible in surrounding areas around Mallacoota, Omeo, Corryong and Walhalla,\" a State Control Centre spokeswoman said.

As a result, rainfall for the coming months is expected to be average to below average in the east, while wetter than average conditions are possible in much of WA and SA. However, temperatures are likely to remain warmer than average over the rest of summer.</p><p>Asked at a media briefing if 2020 would also be hot and dry, Dr Braganza said there was nothing to indicate that things would cool down but rainfall may improve slightly.</p><p>\"Optimistically I'd say less dry rather than wet,\" he said.</p><p>The three-month outlook January to March for Bellingen Shire indicates only a 32 per cent chance of receiving our usual median rainfall of 700mm.</p><p>There's a 64 per cent chance of receiving at least 500mm and an 81 per cent chance of at least 400mm.</p><p>\"Unfortunately the outlook is not indicating a widespread return to wetter than average conditions over drought and fire affected parts of eastern Australia,\" Dr Braganza said. \"But with the likely return of the monsoon by mid-January for northern Australia, it raises the chances that we could see some periods of higher rainfall move south in the coming months.</p><p>\"It's important the community remains vigilant to the risk of more heat and fire days this summer, particularly given how dry the country has been over the past 12 months.\"</p><p>Fast Facts Annual national mean maximum temperature warmest on record (2.09 &amp;#xB0;C above average) Widespread warmth throughout the year; January, February, March, April, July, October, and December all amongst the ten warmest on record for their respective months Significant heatwaves in January and in December Nationally-averaged rainfall 40% below average for the year at 277.6 mm Much of Australia affected by drought, which was especially severe in NSW and southern Qld Widespread severe fire weather throughout the year; national annual accumulated Forest Fire Danger Index highest since 1950, when national records began</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELCOS-doc78un5vaype98ei902yu</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELCOS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5T-4J11-F0J6-J3Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Daytime temperatures were 2.09 degrees above the 1961-90 average, beating the high set in 2013 by 0.54 degrees. Annual mean temperatures were 1.52 degrees above the norm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Globally, 2019 was also the second hottest year on data going back to 1880. It will be the warmest for any year that did not have an El Nino event - a Pacific climate pattern that boosts temperatures - and means the past five years are all among the top five warmest.</p><p>While short-term climate drivers, particularly in the Indian Ocean, contributed to Australia's hot year, the background warming - caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions - is clear.</p><p>\"We've seen clear trends in maximum, minimum and average temperatures across Australia,\" said Karl Braganza, head of the bureau's climate monitoring, adding the country has warmed about 1.4 degrees since 1910, most of it since 1950.</p><p>\"We've seen quite clear trends in reducing rainfall across south-west Western Australia and parts of the south-east,\" he said.</p><p>Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane, and Hobart notched their warmest year on record for daytime temperatures, while Perth was equal-warmest and Darwin the second-warmest. Exposure to cool westerlies kept a lid on the mercury for Melbourne, but it too had above-average maximums.</p><p>NSW broke its record for daytime temperatures for the third year in a row, while Victoria had its fourth warmest. For South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, 2019 also marked their hottest year for maximums.</p><p>Rainfall was generally dismal, averaging just 277.63 millimetres across Australia in 2019. That tally was more than one-tenth below the previous record low set in 1902.</p><p>\"Australia had below-average rainfall in every month - it's the first time that's happened,\" Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Each city, except Sydney, had rainfall totals in the driest 10 per cent of years. The city had many months with below-average rainfall and ended up with its driest year since 2005.</p><p>NSW and the Murray-Darling Basin both collected less than half their usual rainfall, setting new lows and intensifying the drought.</p><p>South Australia also had its driest year with one-third its typical falls, while Victoria has its 10th driest.</p><p>Australia started 2019 with an extreme heatwave which helped make the 2018-19 summer the country's hottest. But that record could be eclipsed as soon as this summer after a scorching December that \"brought an exceptionally warm end to the year\", the bureau said.</p><p>On December 18, Australia had its hottest-ever day, with an average maximum of 41.9 degrees. It also included the next six warmest days, all shading the previous 40.3-degree high set in early 2013.</p><p>The week ending Christmas Eve was also Australia's hottest ever, with an average of 40.5 degrees.</p><p>The size of December's temperature leap was perhaps the standout statistic from 2019. At 38.6 degrees on average, December's daytime temperatures were 4.15 degrees above the 1961-90 benchmark, beating a record set only a year earlier.</p><p>December maximums were the largest departure from the norm for any month the bureau has monitored.</p><p>Nullarbor station's 49.9 degrees last month set a new December record nationally. \"2019 was the extreme year in the sequence [of the past few hot years] but December was the sharp end of the extremes\", Dr Braganza said.</p><p>Rain clouds were largely absent for the month, with a delayed northern monsoon contributing to the nation's driest ever December. Rainfall averaged just 15.42 millimetres.</p><p>The combination of extreme heat and low rainfall meant the bushfire season started early. The Forest Fire Danger Index was the highest on record over most of Australia, including almost all of NSW.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc78r8u0q8i42mwew8m18</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXT-5851-F0J6-J3Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Last year was a low rainfall year. This is probably a complete surprise to most suburban-based Victorians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite reports to the contrary, the quantity of hot days this summer has not been higher than usual.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australian forestry information has been available for at least half a century, but most Australians have no comprehension of our indigenous species' need to burn regularly to ensure regeneration of plants and trees.</p><p>We take for granted going on our annual holidays to places that are historically risky, in terms of fire, over summer months and then complain that it's \"someone else's fault\".</p><p>When we can genuinely look after our own natural surroundings and cease taking for granted our natural bushland, only then will we begin to understand the natural order of historic indigenous plant ecosystems and our true place in the world that sustains us.</p><p>Forest fires will burn forever. It's doubtful humanity will last as long. Jill Loorham, Castlemaine</p><p>Learn from experts LET'S get it right. The voracity of the bushfires across the country is due to very poor forest management.</p><p>Let's get our indigenous citizens to teach the powers that be how to do it. They looked after the bush for thousands of years because that is where they lived.</p><p>Regular and consistent clearing of the forests is essential for everything to live in harmony.</p><p>Arthur Simpson, Monbulk</p><p>Fireys need you, PM PRIME Minister, our firefighters need our support so they can work through the present nightmare.</p><p>For weeks they have sacrificed their time and in many cases the protection of their homes. Prime Minister, there is no cost here. There is just an investment in showing we truly care for who have been willing to sacrifice everything for others.</p><p>Providing services for these people is not a just good political move, it is a morale imperative.</p><p>Joseph Allan, Yarraville</p><p>Where is our plan?</p><p>IN the early 1960s, the Dandenongs were on fire and the Army and RAAF were deployed to fight them. Unfortunately, no one was in charge and the response was poorly handled.</p><p>When the fires were eventually put out, a state disaster plan was put in place with a hangar at Point Cook filled with hundreds of grey blankets, milk cans for fresh water, knapsack sprays, beaters, fire rakes, hoses, etc.</p><p>Where has all this fire equipment gone and if it is still in storage why hasn't it been called upon?</p><p>LRD, Echuca</p><p>Greed is to blame IT'S foolish to think that our treatment of the environment has nothing to do with climate change. Nature has no moral compass, our lack of action over the warnings by scientists has created these catastrophic conditions.</p><p>Australia's greenhouse emissions have risen every year since 2014, the year guidelines forcing big industrial companies to pay for their emissions were repealed. Self regulation was put into place but that is like expecting the dog to look after the cat while you go on holidays. Ignorance, greed and self interest go hand-in-hand.</p><p>Kevin Mortensen, South Gippsland</p><p>Detection is the key AMID the horror of the current bushfire crisis come emotional claims of what could be done in advance to limit the extent of the fires.</p><p>One suggestion is removing the fuel a fire feeds on, which makes sense around a small farm or beside a highway. However, in the heavily-forested regions, this is impossible.</p><p>Having hiked in Victorian forests for 50 years, the build-up of dead and rotting trees is immeasurable, difficult to access and impossible to effectively clear.</p><p>This has not arisen due to a change in climate or a politician taking a holiday, it is simply generations of trees falling in the forest over hundreds of years.</p><p>The early detection of these fires is our best and only defence.Alan Wicking, Bundoora</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-c04c0232302a11eab6d31ffdcc976fabbc832838f85e6bc7ae9208bed091ecca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXC-SNK1-F0JP-W4S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

In Wangaratta, the town's Apex Park and Painters Island Caravan Park were inundated by floodwaters from the nearby Ovens River.</p><p>The river peaked at 12.8m and is expected to stay at high levels for a number of days.</p><p>Residents along Partiff Rd near its levee system were told to evacuate on Saturday morning, but the warning was later downgraded in the afternoon.</p><p>It was unclear if the Ross Edwards Causeway, the main road linking Shepparton and Mooroopna, would also be closed prior to waters peaking.</p><p>With thousands of homes potentially impacted, Shepparton residents were told to pack up and leave early instead of waiting for Tuesday's peak.</p><p>\"Clearly this is a very widespread and affected area ... what we really want the community to understand is to go early, and to not wait until the peak where you could put yourselves and emergency personnel at risk,\" Shepparton deputy incident controller David Tucek told the ABC.</p><p>\"We're expecting a large impact to properties and roads, and we're certainly working to protect infrastructure in the area.</p><p>A 1km line of cars stretched along High St in Shepparton as cars queued for hours to collect sandbags to protect their homes.</p><p>A relief centre was also in full swing at the nearby McIntosh Centre, while relief centres were also set up as far away as Echuca to assist those displaced in areas including Rochester and Murchison.</p><p>Benalla and Seymour residents spent the day waiting for waters to reside after they copped the brunt of the floods on Friday, with more than 300 homes impacted in Seymour.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further evacuations loom</emphasis></p><p>Earlier on Saturday, SES chief operations officer Tim Wiebusch said people in flood-affected areas needed to be prepared to leave as soon as they received an official alert. </p><p>\"We can't emphasise enough that when we issue an evacuation warning, that is serious,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are asking people to leave and not stay in their homes.\" </p><p>In and around Rochester, 160 people needed to be rescued from their homes after ignoring earlier pleas to evacuate.</p><p>\"We are going to see further evacuation warnings on the Campaspe River, at Echuca, later today and into Sunday,\" Mr Wiebusch said.</p><p>\"The community at Echuca, you need to be ready and preparing to evacuate (in some parts).</p><p>\"There will be a second peak and that will be coming from the Murray River mid to late next week.</p><p>\"You need to be alert to your conditions ... Don't expect that just because you might be a kilometre or two away that it won't impact you.\" </p><p>Victoria Police assistant commissioner David Clayton urged people to \"please heed those warnings and evacuate when you're asked to\". </p><p>\"We anticipate in coming days that we are going to see some of the largest evacuations that we have ever seen,\" he said.</p><p>Commissioner Clayton said police were on standby in areas that are evacuated in a bid to stop people looting. </p><p>\"We have no reports of looting, and there will be zero tolerance to any looting,\" he said.</p><p>Premier Daniel Andrews is set to visit flood affected areas near Bendigo on Saturday. </p><p>Earlier, he said about 3000 Victorians had so far made applications for emergency support payments.</p><p>\"While we've had a reprieve from rain, waters are rising, peaks are being reached, houses are being inundated and communities have been isolated because of these floodwaters,\" Mr Andrews said. </p><p>Across the state, 344 roads are currently closed, but that number changes hourly. </p><p>Major roads are assessed twice per day, and a number of urgent repair works have already started.</p><p>The Andrews government says it has reached out to contractors from its Big Build projects to assist with temporary support.</p><p>\"We may have to go back and redo that work at a later point but on major arterial roads, key roads for local communities, getting them open is the priority,\" Mr Andrews said.</p><p>\"Expense will not be an issue there. We will spend what needs to be spent in order to make sure that communities can be connected as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>Fourteen relief centres have so far been sent up across the state, and 55 sandbag collection points are now operational.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Man found dead in Rochester floodwaters</emphasis></p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/tributes-for-wellrespected-man-found-dead-in-floods/news-story/750ef60e453dcbaeb12377e98ed9ff78\">man has been found dead in Rochester floodwaters</url> as Victoria's crisis continues.</p><p>The 71-year-old man is believed to have suffered either a cardiac or respiratory arrest. </p><p>Emergency services were called to reports the man was found dead in floodwaters in the backyard of his High St property about 9.30am.</p><p>SES crews are on scene and police are attempting to get to the property which is blocked off due to floodwater.</p><p>The exact circumstances surrounding the death are yet to be determined.</p><p>Police will prepare a report for the coroner.</p><p>Premier Daniel Andrews said the man's death highlighted just how dangerous the flood emergency posed to Victorians.</p><p>\"We'll stand with that family and all families affected by this but it just brings home for all of us that this is serious,\" he said. </p><p>\"This is potentially very, very dangerous and hopefully that sends a broader message of just how serious this is.\"</p><p>Mr Andrews said he sent his \"deepest sympathies\" to the family and friends of the victim.</p><p>\"Rochester is a proud local community, a very tight local community and they'll all be saddened to hear of one of their number passing away,\" he added.</p><p>It has been a very tough night for the town, with floodwaters rising well in excess of the levels seen during the 2011 floods. </p><p>SES volunteers were working well into the night to evacuate people and pets from homes in the town.</p><p>Emergency workers were called to ferry a group of 20 people to safety from Railway Rd. </p><p>A community social media page post said that the \"water was diverting itself\" into Railway Rd \"at the weir via the old Campaspe irrigation system\".</p><p>Emergency crews were still busy on Saturday helping residents in an increasingly dangerous situation, as streets in the town became fast-flowing rivers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Victorians urged not to enter floodwaters</emphasis></p><p>Premier Daniel Andrews on Saturday urged Victorians not to drive into floodwaters, warning that 344 roads were closed.</p><p>Emergency services warned they expected a major flood warning around Charlton.</p><p>Victorian Emergency Services chief officer operations Tim Wiebusch said 160 rescues had been carried out around Rochester overnight.</p><p>The Echuca community was warned on Saturday to prepare to evacuate as the Campaspe River and Murray River get set to peak.</p><p>Victoria Police assistant commissioner David Clayton said emergency services agencies had so far responded to more than 350 rescues during Victoria's flood emergency. </p><p>More than 200 of these rescue operations took place to retrieve people from their homes, while authorities responded to 150 people caught driving through floodwaters. </p><p>Another 10 rescues were performed to save people from capsized tinnies. </p><p>Mr Andrews said so far about 3000 Victorians had made important applications for emergency payments. </p><p>\"It works out at just over $2000 for impacted families, and it is about helping them with somewhere to stay, clothing, food, medicine, all of those basics that are critically important, at a very difficult time for them,\" he said.</p><p>The Premier said 466 had flooding above floor level and about 500 properties were isolated.</p><p>He said he expected the to grow as we see floodwaters peak in several communities.</p><p>Mr Andrews said he has written to the banks to ask them to take urgent steps to defer or waive -

including carpets and rugs - and why there was so little notice on the severity of the floods. </p><p>The local council will be offering a myriad of support in the wake of the disaster, including extra rubbish collection, no parking fines, mud removal and assistance with insurance and disaster relief payments. </p><p>One resident said she wanted the council to do better. </p><p>\"This is an approach that clearly isn't working,\" she said, addressing Minister for Housing Danny Pearson. </p><p>\"We can't just rinse and repeat and hope that next time there's flooding that a few door knocks and half an hour will be enough.</p><p>\"My question is: who is going to put their hand up and say that this approach isn't working?\"</p><p>A fellow community member came offering the support of over 500 local residents who were not flood affected, pledging their support in any way possible.</p><p>\"There are so many of us and we want to help you -

Flood levels in Seymour are forecast to reach levels similar to the May 1974 flood, which was the second-biggest in local history.</p><p>Residents were urged to find refuge in areas above the expected 7m level at 4pm on Thursday as the town braced for the worst of the rainfall to hit in the evening. An evacuation centre was opened last night at the town's sports and aquatic centre after the Big 4 Holiday Park was \u00adordered to evacuated. </p><p>\"We're still trying to get people out, they won't move,\" co-owner Nola Ricketson said of some of the campground's permanent residents. </p><p>The Country Fire Authority tried to pump water out of the property, but the heavy downpour at lunchtime worsened the flooding. </p><p>The flooding is expected to extend downstream on the Goulburn River and to reach major high-water marks at Shepparton by Saturday \u00adafternoon.</p><p>Emergency services predict about 600 properties will be isolated and another 50 homes will be inundated as levels \u00adexceed what was seen in October 1993. </p><p>In nearby Wangaratta, the King River flooded and roads were closed. </p><p>The SES was inundated with more than 1700 calls for assistance on Thursday. More than 20 people had been rescued from floodwaters by 4.15pm. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I hope I can return the support to you,\" she said.</p><p>Boost after a rough summer</p><p>CFA Ovens Valley group officer Michael Freudenstein said it was exciting news.</p><p>He had heard the rumours of a possible Katy Perry concert last week, so was pleased with the confirmation.</p><p>Mr Freudenstein said it had been a rough time for the community and firefighters.</p><p>\"This puts a whole different focus on the future and will hopefully provide a great lift for the community and the fire brigade and forest fire management who have been involved as well,\" he said.</p><p>He said an international act like Katy Perry would be a \"great lift\" to the community and put the region back in the spotlight.</p><p>\"When the fires were on, we had to evacuate quite a few tourists out of the region and that was extremely disappointing for all businesses, and this provides an opportunity to get people back in the region.\"</p><p>He said the concert announcement was also a good time to remind people of ongoing fire risks despite summer now being over.</p><p>\"We had a number of fires in March last year and the fire brigade has still got to maintain a focus until the fire restrictions are finished in a month's time or maybe another six weeks,\" he said.</p><p>Businesses welcome 'morale boost'</p><p>Manager of Bright Brewery and president of the Bright and District Chamber of Commerce Rupert Shaw said the concert would benefit the town on multiple levels.</p><p>\"First, it's fun and exciting for everybody to have such a huge star come to Bright after a really difficult start to the year, and secondly it's nice to put Bright on the map,\" Mr Shaw said.</p><p>\"Everybody in Victoria will know where Bright is! And that will be a commercial uplift.\"</p><p>He said trade for the Bright Brewery was down in January by more than 70 per cent.</p><p>He said sales recovered slightly on the Australia Day long weekend largely due to the goodwill of people in surrounding towns daytripping.</p><p>\"Hopefully [the concert] will be good from a business perspective because we'll get more visitors around that time,\" Mr Shaw said.</p><p>\"It will be a big lift of morale for everyone in Alpine Shire.</p><p>\"A lot of people are doing it hard. Even though we haven't been burnt, the economic impact of the fires has been huge, and the timing couldn't have been worse.</p><p>\"It just decimated the town.

Twenty years ago, most of southern Australia was still in the grip of the millennium drought. The dry conditions broke records around the nation. Perth's dams were at their lowest since the First World War, and the south-east of the country was on its way to the driest 13-year period since record-keeping began. As the Bureau of Meteorology put it at the time, this was the nation's first climate change drought. That observation came hot on the heels of the third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which made headlines around the world with its conclusion that: there is new and stronger evidence that most of the global warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.</p><p>If suburban households become complacent about their household water use, then the drought was a wake-up call. Across the nation, education campaigns and water-saving devices joined water restrictions in an effort to ease pressure on limited urban water supplies. In Melbourne, for instance, the voluntary Target 155 campaign aimed to more than halve the daily water consumption of residents by encouraging shorter showers while imposing strict limits on watering gardens and washing the car.</p><p>Brisbane went even further, aiming to reduce residential water consumption to 140 litres of water per person per day. The rainwater tank and greywater recycling became suburban must-haves, offering the means to keep gardens green in trying conditions. As the dam levels fell lower and lower, state governments turned to desalination, with Perth leading the way in 2006, a prospect that was unthinkable just a decade earlier.</p><p>Other states took notice, and before long desalination plants were on the drawing board for the Gold Coast, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. But, for the most part, by the time those projects were completed, the rains had returned to the east coast and the plants built there were dismissed as white elephants.</p><p>Journalist Chris Hammer noticed this change in the weather himself as he reflected in the updated edition of his book on the Murray-Darling Basin in 2010. Browsing through his local bookshop, he'd realised that his book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The River</emphasis>, had somehow migrated from the environment and ecology section where it had stood just six months ago, to a new place on the history shelves. Even so, this record La Ni\u00f1a rainfall that broke the millennium drought did not turn back the clock. A drying trend continued across the south of the continent, particularly in the south-west where winter rains had been in decline since the 1970s, due in part to human induced climate change. Indeed, while Eastern Australia experienced record high levels of rainfall in late 2010 and in 2011, Perth and much of south-western Western Australia experienced record dry weather.</p><p>These are just some of the challenges of planning for both climate variability and climate change on a continent of extremes. It's been looking ahead into the future that has been one of the ways in which Australians have long tried to come to terms with this continent of extreme climate variability.</p><p>In 2011, the Climate Commission released its first report, declaring that Australia was facing the critical decade. Back then of course the Climate Commission was a federal government body, established under the Gillard government, but it was dissolved under the Abbott government soon after its election in 2013. The decade to 2020, the Climate Commission's report argued, was critical in terms of meeting the 2 degrees Celsius guardrail by curbing emissions of carbon dioxide.</p><p>In the decade to 2020, global emissions had to be well on track to reaching zero by 2050 to limit the planet's warming. Taking the temperature on the nation's progress towards this goal in 2017, the Climate Council, the independent body that rose from the ashes of the Climate Commission, declared that Australia was now known as a global climate laggard. Already the concentration of carbon dioxide emissions had tipped over 400 parts per million, higher than at any other time for millions of years, and the planet's temperature was over one degree higher than temperatures before the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century.</p><p>The report warned that the window of opportunity to limit worsening climate impacts is closing, and already extreme climate events were getting worse, pointing not only to bushfires and heatwaves but also to drought and drying across the south of the continent, just as the Garnaut Report of 2008 and countless other scientific studies had predicted. 2019 was the driest year since records began in 1900 and it was the country's warmest year. In fact, all the years since 2013 are among the ten warmest on record for Australia.</p><p>The impact of climate change has led to longer, more intense fire seasons, and an increase in the average number of elevated fire weather days as measured by the Forest Fire Danger Index. 2019 saw the highest accumulated index on record. Fires have burned before in Australia, but never like those we saw over the summer. It's cold comfort though, knowing that this disaster was no surprise. After all, the 2008 Garnaut Report warned that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later, and generally be more intense. This effect increases over time but should be directly observable by 2020.</p><p>In another 10 to 20 years' time, 2019 won't be so unusual. Although this year's emissions might be lower thanks to the Covid lockdowns, and the air might be cleaner, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide continues to rise, and the period 2016 to 2020 looks set to be the warmest five-year period on record.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few months of slowing down can't make up for the decades upon decades of greenhouse gas emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere. History is weighing heavily on the planet's climate future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Associate Professor Ruth Morgan at the ANU, a former ABC Top Five humanities star.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-12900596</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61C2-9JJ1-F031-X372-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 19, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment:Climate Change</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Business &amp;

We're giving you something, which is the information you need about the risk, but we're also asking something of you, and that is for you to take actions, and these are the ones we suggest.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>There have also been novel efforts to improve contact with remote communities, who can see first-hand what's happening on the ground. <br/><br/>In some places the government sent out text messages asking local residents to call the authorities because \"we can't get a hold of the community, there's no phone service, but we think there's one house that might have a little bit of service and we need to talk to that community,\" Eagle explained. <br/><br/>For some remote communities where there might only be a handful of farmhouses, the defence force dropped in satellite phones to local community leaders who could act as a bridge to the authorities. <br/><br/>But some challenges remain. Despite improvements in cross-agency coordination, it's still challenging to ensure everything works smoothly across state borders. <br/><br/>\"If you looked at the VicEmergency map about January 2, there was this line that stopped along the border. Nobody knew where the fire was in NSW. NSW couldn't pick up our information,\" Eagle explained. <br/><br/>But quick thinking enabled a quick fix. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"We got the IT gurus to connect the two states together so communities that were travelling in that area could pick up the information on the VicEmergency app if it was over the border, or the other way around.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANDRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANDRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MM-5P71-JD6R-T1DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><timeReceived>7:31 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mandarin</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000425</classCode><className>DEATH RATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They make out like I'm to blame for these pictures, that it looks like I'm encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message. I don't know what to say.\"</p><p>Similarly, while denying ever reportedly making Kate cry during bridesmaid fittings for Meghan and Harry's 2018 wedding, the book details a clash with the Queen's personal dresser, who Harry accused of ignoring his request for a tiara fitting.</p><p>Angela Kelly had accompanied Her Majesty and the couple as they chose Queen Mary's diamond bandeau, but allegedly failed to respond to repeated emails asking to schedule a hair trail.</p><p/><p>Frustrated by the stalling, Harry took it on himself to get the plans moving, calling his grandmother and getting the fitting sorted. </p><p>The antagonism of staff, who the couple accuse of regularly leaking damaging details, reaches its peak when the couple first raise their intention to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/harrys-showgirl-bombshell-revelations-in-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-biography-finding-freedom/news-story/820565425248c9903690875b39ab1491\">step back from royal duties, in an email to the Queen</url> and Prince Charles.</p><p>The details of the private message were promptly leaked to the press, and in a meeting to make the arrangements, one royal aide cattily predicts Meghan will launch a line of beauty products. Another is quoted as saying the couple did not communicate their future plans in a \"private, dignified way.\"</p><p>Perhaps most shocking is the arm's length relationship between William and Harry and their wives - making a lie of the 'Fab Four' image fostered early on.</p><p/><p>While the couple had been dating in secret since June 2016, she did not meet William until early November and even then Kate was not there; instead choosing to stay at Anmer Hall with George and Charlotte.</p><p>It was a warm welcome, the book claims, with William opening the black double doors to his home and telling her: \"I was looking forward to meeting the girl who has put that silly grin on my brother's face.\"</p><p/><p>Despite the warmth Harry had shown Kate during her first moves into public life, the favour was not returned to his then bride-to-be, who had to wait until January 10 to receive her first brief audience with the future queen.</p><p>Instead, Meghan kept close her celebrity posse of friends, and made her own London circle, which she turned to during some of the darkest days of the tabloid coverage.</p><p>The avalanche of negative press, as well as Meghan's bi-racial background, was blamed for triggering death threats and online abuse, which described her as the N-word or a \"mutt.\"</p><p/><p>So concerned were officials, Meghan was put through security training before her wedding, including a mock kidnapping by SAS soldiers who bundled her into the back of a car.</p><p>Kate had done the same after she married William but for Meghan it was seen as critical training as soon as possible, as the couple had received an unusually high number of threats.</p><p>It was retreating from that world of daily racial attacks and palace politics that explained their choice to step back as senior royals and go their own way.</p><p>The book's launch came on the same day Harry gave an interview to US civil rights campaigner Rashad Robinson, in which he compared addressing racism without first fixing institutional problems to \"bringing a buck of water to a forest fire.\"</p><p>He said: \"We have to go to the root of the problem, the source of the problem, and actually fix it there.\" </p><p>\"As we've discussed before, it is going to take every single one of us, this is not down to the black community, it's going to take every single person on the planet right now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The father of six - three boys, three girls - had involved all his children in farm work and life from when they were kids, something his girls acknowledge is not always the case for farmers' daughters. </p><p>Nowadays it is an \"all-girl show\" on the farm, which is just less than 400ha and currently runs 75 breeding Angus cattle and a flock of 1100 Merino sheep, mostly fine wool bred, with a small prime lamb production.</p><p/><p>\"We're busy, but we make it work,\" says Lou, as the sisters explain how they divide  farm labour (while they contract in shearers and crutchers, most of the work they do themselves). </p><p>They say farming is still \"a bit of a boys club\", and that some of their practices - such as keeping some livestock as pets, something their dad also did - can raise eyebrows. </p><p>But they have had plenty of support from friends and are always picking the brains of their fellow farmers. There is one in particular, a family friend, who has been on hand to help whenever they need advice, education or for a job they can't manage alone.</p><p>Initially the sisters were splitting their time between full-time work and the farm, but these days their time off the farm is spent at their other business, Jackson's Produce Store.</p><p>Taking inspiration from other providore-type stores they had visited, their shop in Violet Town's main street is a burst of colour upon entry, with fresh fruit and vegetables, local produce, art and giftwares. Where possible they try to source goods locally. \"The concept was we would be a local produce store, but knowing that you can't get a lot of local produce all the time, like when you talk about the fruit and vegies,\" Lou says. \"Then we started to layer on with superfoods, and organics, and the cheeses.\"</p><p/><p>The store was opened in 2018, but moved to its current premises on the other side of the road last February. (\"All the local blokes helped move everything across the road on a Saturday,\" mum Denise laughs).</p><p>They say the shop has also become a place for farmers to talk shop - what is happening around the district, at the saleyards, with the season and so forth - and the sisters can be a friendly ear or up for a laugh when people need to debrief. </p><p>\"We also use it as a way for us to learn more (from the farmers who come in) because we know we could learn every day,\" says Donna. </p><p>And the Jacksons are about to expand their skills  further - they have leased part of the shop next door and plan to open a smoothie and juice bar cafe. </p><p>\"I didn't think this was ever going to be what I was doing, and I love it because you have so much freedom,\" Mel says. \"We might yell and scream at each other but we're always there for each other. </p><p>\"It's a great dynamic, and you get off the farm by coming in here - you get a break from looking at brown grass or no water in dams and things like that (especially in drought because it is bad) and feeding stock, carting water and all those things. But we do it, because you think every day is a blessing to be able to do it.\"</p><p>Donna agrees, adding \"You have got a responsibility to the animals, and your land.\"</p><p>               Sisters enter new Terra-tory            </p><p>RUNNING a business with your sister is \"like running a business with your childhood best friend\", says Kel Sommerville. </p><p>Kel and sister Em, from the Grampians region, have combined a love of creating with a passion for the environment in their clothing label. </p><p>Through Terra (which started in 2016 as Folktribe Clothing - they rebranded last year) they now make clothing to order from hemp fabric. </p><p>Em says the rise of sustainable fashion in general since they began has been \"amazing\", but some education was required at times - she says they have been asked if hemp is like hessian, or if it can be smoked (\"we have had that question more than once\"). </p><p>\"As far as I can tell, and looking at stats of people searching for ethical and sustainable fashion, it's definitely rising very quickly, and I don't think it's just fashion - I think people are becoming more conscious of the impact they're having on the planet.\" </p><p/><p>They hope the business will become a full-time occupation, Em says, and they are making about four to five garments a week. </p><p>While Em works in Hamilton as an architect graduate, Kel, who lives in Dunkeld where the sisters grew up, works for Forest Fire Management from Halls Gap. </p><p>\"I feel proud to be home and to be able to do something like this</p><p>at our home. For us, the Grampians and Dunkeld, it's more than just home, it's where our heart is,\" Em says. </p><p>\"People often think, 'oh you can't do it out in the regional areas', but it's amazing, I feel really privileged to run our business from home and be able to do what we do. </p><p>\"I don't feel hindered by not being in the city - we're only three hours from Melbourne if we really need to go do something, or want to go.\" </p><p>And Kel, whose work experience in a hand-printed textile business during university helped spur her into her own sustainable fashion brand, says \"I've always loved creating things and I've always loved seeing that creative process ... and bringing something to life\". </p><p>\"We just get along really well.</p><p>If we can travel together in South America, I think we can navigate a business together,\" Kel says. </p><p>\"We've gone through a lot together and gone through a lot with the business together, so it has been ... I can't even put a word on it because it has been so nice to be able to do something like that with your sister.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE </emphasis></p><p><emphasis

They make out like I'm to blame for these pictures, that it looks like I'm encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message. I don't know what to say.\" Similarly, while denying ever reportedly making Kate cry during bridesmaid fittings for Meghan and Harry's 2018 wedding, the book details a clash with the Queen's personal dresser, whom Harry accused of ignoring his request for a tiara fitting.</p><p>Angela Kelly had accompanied the monarch and the couple as they chose Queen Mary's diamond bandeau but allegedly failed to respond to repeated emails asking to schedule a practice run.</p><p>Frustrated by the stalling, Harry took it on himself to get the plans moving, calling his grandmother and getting the fitting sorted.</p><p>The antagonism of staff, whom the couple accuse of regularly leaking damaging details, reaches its peak when the couple first raise their intention to step back from royal duties, in an email to the Queen and Prince Charles.</p><p>The details of the private message were promptly leaked to the press, and in a meeting to make the arrangements, one royal aide cattily predicted Meghan would launch a line of beauty products.</p><p>Another was quoted as saying the couple did not communicate their future plans in a \"private, dignified way\".</p><p>Perhaps most shocking is the arm's-length relationship between William and Harry and their wives - making a lie of the \"Fab Four\" image fostered early on.</p><p>While the couple had been dating in secret since June 2016, Meghan did not meet William until early November of that year, and even then Kate was not there, choosing to stay at Anmer Hall with George and Charlotte.</p><p>It was a warm welcome, the book claims, with William opening the black double doors to his home and telling her: \"I was looking forward to meeting the girl who has put that silly grin on my brother's face.\" Despite the warmth Harry had shown Kate during her first moves into public life, the favour was not returned to his then bride-to-be, who had to wait until January 10, 2017 to receive her first brief audience with the future queen.</p><p>Instead, Meghan kept close her posse of celebrity friends, and made her own London circle. It was to these friends whom she turned during some of the darkest days of the tabloid coverage.</p><p>The avalanche of negative press, as well as Meghan's bi-racial background, was blamed for triggering death threats and online abuse, which described her as the N-word or a \"mutt\".</p><p>So concerned were officials, Meghan was put through security training before her wedding, including a mock kidnapping by SAS soldiers, who bundled her into the back of a car.</p><p>Kate had done the same after she married William but for Meghan it was seen as critical training as soon as possible, as the couple had received an unusually high number of threats.</p><p>It was retreating from that world of daily racial attacks and palace politics that explained their choice to step back as senior royals and go their own way.</p><p>The book's launch came on the same day Harry gave an interview to US civil rights campaigner Rashad Robinson, in which he compared addressing racism without first fixing institutional problems to \"bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire\".</p><p>He said: 'We have to go to the root of the problem\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and actually fix it there. As we've discussed before, it is going to take every single one of us. \"This is not down to the black community, it's going to take every single person on the planet right now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-09fe7da6db8411ea882a79311864a62a3d74d80f24b8a6988effb50384687729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K0-VRX1-JD3N-50T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Advertiser Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6V</classCode><className>BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CVO6</classCode><className>BRITISH ROYALTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001830</classCode><className>WEDDINGS &amp; ENGAGEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CZUL</classCode><className>NIGHT &amp; SHIFT WORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000181</classCode><className>PROFILES &amp; BIOGRAPHIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DKD4</classCode><className>COURTSHIP &amp; DATING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM43</classCode><className>ROYALTY, NOBILITY &amp; GENTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CVO6</classCode><className>BRITISH ROYALTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>PE000DM1A</classCode><className>MEGHAN, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>PE0009Y83</classCode><className>HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Unlike most disasters, which are singular in nature - a flood, an earthquake, a cyclone that strike one location - this one just keeps rolling on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's destroyed towns and villages, laid waste to forests and farmland, disrupted lives and distorted our very sense of time.</p><p>On the South Coast, we're calling it the Forever Fire.</p><p>It's like a psychotic home invader we can't get rid of, quiet one day but triggered into a violent, unpredictable rage the next.</p><p>And it's changed the way we live. The morning routine involves checking the Fires Near Me app and the weather forecast. Lives now revolve around the long-range weather outlook and plans are guided by what the fire is doing and where it is sending its smoke.</p><p>Anxiety levels spike every time heatwave conditions return. Even though the fire has passed through many areas, even though it can one day be declared under control, this monster has shown it is quite capable of reigniting when it seems there is nothing left to burn.</p><p>We saw that only last week, when the fire took more homes in the Southern Highlands and on the Far South Coast.</p><p>The old certainties of summer - the trips to the beach, the evenings on the verandah, the barbecues with friends - have gone up in smoke. Nothing seems permanent any more - the sense of peril arrives on every warm breeze from the northwest.</p><p>When it first ignited in two places in the hinterland between Ulladulla and Batemans Bay on Tuesday, November 26, the editor of the Bay Post Kerrie O'Connor, who lives at East Lynne warned it had the potential to run down to the coast. Turns out she was entirely prescient.</p><p>Within days it had roared up towards Ulladulla and down to threaten Batemans Bay. On November 30, it crossed the Clyde and began its destructive march towards Bawley Point and Lake Tabourie.</p><p>Urgent community meetings were called. Residents were told to activate their Bushfire Survival Plans. Many had not given them a thought beforehand, despite the repeated urgings of the Rural Fire Service.</p><p>Hundreds gathered in Ulladulla on the afternoon of December 13 to hear dire warnings from Currowan Fire incident controller Superintendent Mark Williams, who presented a worst case scenario:</p><p>\"This fire has the potential to get as far as Nerriga Road to the north and Moruya to the south,\" he told the crowd. He also warned not to expect a firetruck at every property - there were simply not enough of them.</p><p>Ten days after this meeting, Nerriga itself had been overrun by flames, its residents hunkering down in the pub as RFS tankers surrounded the building and hosed it down.</p><p>By January 4, Supt Williams' worst case scenario had been surpassed many times over.</p><p>The Currowan fire had spread so far, it now had to be divided into four: the Currowan 2 fire, the Morton fire in the Southern Highlands, the Charleys Forest Fire to the west and the Clyde Mountain Fire to the south.</p><p>To get from one end of the fireground to the other involves a three-and-a-half hour drive. One would need an entire day to drive its perimeter - that's how big it has grown. And it's still on the move.</p><p>On Friday, January 31 the original Currowan blaze had started merging with the Badja Forest Rd, Countengany Fire to the south.</p><p>As journalists covering the story, we have also become part of it. Many of us have had to evacuate, some several times over.</p><p>There have been many days when we have left for work in the morning, not knowing whether we would have a home to return to at the end of the day.</p><p>We've endured the same terror as our readers. We've cried along with them, not at our predicament but at the tribulations of others, who have seen their homes and livelihoods burn, their little patches of paradise reduced to ash.</p><p>We've cried for our beautiful forests and for the wildlife we have lost. We've cried with gratitude for the firefighters who have battling flames for what seems like an eternity. We've cried because we've been frightened.</p><p>Unless you have been there, watching the sky turn from cobalt blue to orange, to red and then to pitch black at 3pm, it is impossible to fathom the fear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ILMYAU-doc7936k8x6nwh1gvf3991r</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ILMYAU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3R-PYW1-F0J6-J232-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314241</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Illawarra Newspapers Holding Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Illawarra Mercury</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000172</classCode><className>BEACHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

nitf:lede=\"true\">This year's Victorian budget contains nearly $130 million in regional development and agricultural spending, the state government claims will advance its 10-year plan for the farming sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of that, $46.4 million is earmarked for projects such as improved traceability systems, the Fruit Fly Strategy, a further $5.8 million to support the Rural Financial Counselling Service and nearly $20m to \"fast-track\" the agricultural sector's response to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The budget confirms the $10 million for the Morwell Food Manufacturing Precinct, forecast to support 1700 manufacturing jobs, when up and running and $3.6m for the Mode Shift Incentive Scheme.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read more: Rail freight operators want greater certainty on MSIS</p><p>A further $11.7m, announced before the budget, goes towards the traceability information hub, to develop new systems to prove the quality and origin of Victorian produce.</p><p>It also goes towards campaigns to promote paddock-to-plate operations.</p><p>In the south-west, the budget invests $17.4m to economic diversification for Portland and the Glenelg Shire.</p><p>That includes funding for local freight road upgrades.</p><p>Regional areas will also get a slice of the $3.8b set aside for reforms to the state's mental health system.</p><p>They will benefit from $700m in spending on services.</p><p>Budget address In his budget address to parliament, Treasurer Tim Pallas said the economy was recovering, not tentatively or gradually, but \"in an optimistic rush, that shows a heartfelt confidence in the future.</p><p>\"We're on track to meet our goal to get an extra 400,000 Victorians back in work by 2025 - in fact we've already beaten our own interim goal of 200,000 jobs, nearly a year early.\" Mr Pallas said.</p><p>The budget commits $3.8bn over the next four years to mental health spending and more than $10bn over the next four years on infrastructure including schools and hospitals.</p><p>Gross state product expected to increase 6.5 per cent next financial year.</p><p>The government also laid out its roadmap for increased stamp duty and land tax.</p><p>A new windfall gains land tax will bring in up to 50pc of the profits from developers, who gain from government rezoning decisions.</p><p>Mr Pallas said Victoria's economic growth had surged, with State Final Demand growing by 6.8 per cent in the December quarter, more than double the national average.</p><p>Gross state product is expected to increase by 6.5pc in 2021-22.</p><p>\"Thats well above Australia's forecast 4.25 pc GDP growth,\" Mr Pallas said.</p><p>The government has forecast an operating deficit of $11.6 billion in 2021-22, reducing to $2b in four years.</p><p>Speaking to the media, Mr Pallas said he was focussing on getting to a surplus.</p><p>\"Then, and only then, in my view do you get to a position where you can manage the debt profile of the state,\" Mr Pallas said.</p><p>\"Our priority is the well-being and welfare of all Victorians.</p><p>\"The choices we make reflect our values as a government - our values are that we need to grow jobs and care for those in the community, who need support.\"</p><p>He said there was no substitute for ambition, when growing the economy.</p><p>\"As a government, we are going to make that investment and continue that investment,\" he said.</p><p>\"I would be the first to recognise as a goverment the more we put into the market the greater heat we put into it.\"</p><p>But he said governments across the eastern seaboard were making massive infrastructure investments.</p><p>\"The government will continue to attend to what are the underlying causes associated with the escalation in price and risk,\" he said.</p><p>Multi-billion projects brought with them a substantial attendant risk to the existence of many companies.</p><p>\"As a government we need to have a genuine enagement with these companies, as to how risk is borne, and how government best manages its expectations - understanding the task before we commit to projects is a vital first step,\" he said.</p><p>Challenges would continue, as the government continued to invest more and more in the capital the state needed.</p><p>\"To do anything less than that, I think, would compromise the future,\" Mr Pallas said.</p><p>Transforming traceability The government will spend $3.5m in the coming financial year, $4.1m the following year and $4m in 2023-4 on what it says is its \"transforming traceability\" program.</p><p>\"Agricultural traceability systems will be strengthened to enhance Victoria's reputation for high-quality food and fibre products, driving growth in both local and export markets,\" the budget papers say.</p><p>\"This will be achieved by implementing a traceability and product integrity action plan, which iwll provide increased information on traceability systems and improve biosecurity risk management.</p><p>\"New traceability technologies will be trialled, building on successful Agriculture Victoria technology trials.\"</p><p>Changing climate Funding of $20m is set aside, over four years, to deliver the government's commitment to position Victoria as a leader in low-emissions agriculture.</p><p>That includes supporting measures to accelerate research, innovation and deployment of methane inhibiting feed additives and promote on-farm emissions reduction and adaptation.</p><p>The Victorian Agriculture and Climate Change Statement will also be developed, which will be co-designed by industry and regional leaders to create \"a shared long-term vision about the role of Victoria's agriculture sector in a net zero emissions economy.\"</p><p>In what is claimed to be the largest funding package ever from the government, more than $517m will go towards reducing bushfire risks, including $15.6m to increase work to remove long grasses and other highly flammable undergrowth.</p><p>More than $133m will go to upgrading the digital radio service, for Forest Fire Management Victoria staff and other emergency service personnel.</p><p>The government has earmarked $138.8m replace CFA radio equipment with modern, digital technology, to strengthen the brigade's emergency response, while keeping volunteers safe.</p><p>A further $22.5m will use the expertise of Aboriginal cultural burning, in Victoria's land management contributing to bushfire preparation in local communities.</p><p>CFA stations at Irymple, Serpentine and Metcalfe will be replaced, while Doreen will be upgraded.</p><p>Landcare, Trust for Nature and the Port Phillip Bay fund will share in $75.3m funding to care for wildlife, plant trees and tackle weeds and pests.</p><p>Water projects The budget sets aside $2.5m, over three years, for what is described as protecting the reliability of water entitlements and maximising resources for regional businesses and communities.</p><p>The funding has been provided to support water compliance, activities that will maintain community confidence in the water entitlement framework, prevent water theft and address emerging risks to water availablility.</p><p>It has also earmarked $3.6m for resilient water markets, regional communities and infrastructure, next financial year, with $2.6m for 2022-23, with $2.2m in 2023-24.</p><p>That money will go towards community engagement and capacity building to support irrigators and traditional owners.</p><p>It includes grants for infrastructure projects to enable farms to modernise and optimise water efficiency.</p><p>It will be funded from the environmental Contribution Levy</p><p>The government has set aside $1.3m, over the next four years, for pest and weed management.</p><p>Some of the funding will go to regional, rural and interface councils, with responsibility for maintaining rural roads to prevent the establishment and spread of weeds and pest.</p><p>\"This will reduce the risk of weed infestations on rural roadsides, helping prevent teh spread of fire along road reserves and onto adjacent public land, and flow-on benefits for weed and pest management on farming land,\" the budget papers say.</p><p>Roads The budget contains funding of $249m to continue upgrading country roads - on top of the more than 5,500 kilometres of improvements the government says it's already delivered across regional Victoria since 2018.</p><p>Total spending on road maintenance in the 2021-22 financial year ($754.9m) remains above the three year average ($745.25m).</p><p>That was before a one-off stimulus boost in the 2020-2021 financial year ($898.84 million).</p><p>There'll be $5.2m set aside, in the coming financial year, for Murray River bridge crossing upgrades, with $5.9m and $4.8, over the following two years.</p><p>The work will address road asset deterioration and reduce road user exposure to safety hazards.</p><p>A further $6.7m will go towards regional road upgrades, in the coming financial year and $2.2m will be set aside, over three years, for \"a more productive road network for freight.\"</p><p>That will include the development of a new automated road assessment and permit system, to allow heavy vehicle access to the road network in a faster and more efficient way.\"</p><p>\"Pre-approved heavy vehicle types and mapping of key routes will be expanded to support safer and more reliable heavy freight movements,\" the budget papers state.</p><p>Funding is provided for a program of priority bridge upgrades and renewal works.</p><p>Regional road upgrades include the Western Freeway and Learmonth Road intersection, corridor improvements on the Surf Coast Highway and Bellarine Link Stage 1.</p><p>Funding of $1.4m has also been set aside for delivering improvements in road asset management systems, integration and alignment across 11 rural shire councils.</p><p>It's intended to promote consistency in policy setting and road asset management practices, over the medium and long term, producing ongoing efficiencies in road maintenance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Such a move would mean Republicans retake control of the 50-50 Senate, ending President Biden's legislative agenda.</p><p>'New Kennedys' Democratic heavies Vice-President Kamala Harris, a former California senator, and senator Elizabeth Warren have been campaigning in the Golden State in recent weeks, curtain-raisers for President Biden's arrival for Newsom's final rally in Palm Beach on Tuesday AEST.</p><p>Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor dubbed one of the \"new Kennedys\" by Harper's Bazaar when he was married to Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr's current girlfriend, is fighting to avoid being the second US governor to be recalled.</p><p>In 2003 former Democrat governor Gray Davis, a few months into his second term, was ousted by a recall vote, replaced by actor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state's last Republican governor.</p><p>Newsom's own movie star looks have failed to inoculate the first-term governor against a small-business community enraged by the nation's longest lockdown, gig workers, and Republicans who've smelt vulnerability.</p><p>\"If you're going to tax people at a high rate, destroy small businesses, put hardworking blue-collar people on the street, and then brag about your $80bn budget surplus, I find that offensive,\" says Ram Duriseti, a 51-year-old emergency room physician living in the Bay Area.</p><p>Newsom's critics have furnished an exhaustive list of reasons to dump him, from high taxation, arbitrary rule, poor forest fire management, homelessness and unworkable industrial relations, persuasive enough to have attracted 2.1 million signatures, 600,000 more than needed under state law to trigger a recall vote.</p><p>\"He's the epitome of his hypocrisy, all 'do as I say not as I do',\" says Lydia Olson, a full-time Uber driver in the San Francisco Bay area, bristling at the Governor's decision to cut public servants' pay by 10 per cent but exempt his own.</p><p>\"And then there's the French Laundry,\" she exclaims, recounting what's become - almost everyone I spoke to in California brought it up - Newsom's signature blunder, being photographed at a high-end restaurant in Napa last November with pharmaceutical executives without a mask, flouting his own rules.</p><p>After weeks of steadily narrowing, the polls have drifted in Newsom's favour: 56 per cent of voters oppose the recall motion, and 42 per cent are in favour, according to the latest average of credible statewide polls published by Nate Silver. But it's not so simple where voting isn't compulsory.</p><p>About half of likely voters say they haven't decided how to vote yet or wouldn't vote for any of the replacement candidates on the recall ballot, according to a recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California.</p><p>California is solidly Democrat, but motivated Republicans might be more likely to vote.</p><p>\"It's a bet on propensity,\" says Steve Haro, a veteran Democrat strategist and principal at Mehlman and Castagnetti, arguing the recall was a low-cost way for Republicans to destabilise the Governor.</p><p>\"It's a colossal waste of time and taxpayer dimes because the state is now stuck footing the bill for a frivolous election that should not have been triggered,\" Haro tells The Australian, referring to a $276m estimate for the total state and county costs for running the recall election.</p><p>Under California's recall rules, a new governor could be elected with a tiny number of votes. The ballot has two separate questions, of which voters can answer either or both.</p><p>Should Newsom be recalled? And who should replace him, with a list of 46 hopefuls including Caitlyn Jenner, a trans former gold medal-winning decathlete, and Larry Elder, a black American conservative talk-show host, to pick from.</p><p>A simple majority in favour of a yes vote would see Newsom replaced by the candidate who obtained the most votes, even if that were a piddling figure in a state of 40 million people.</p><p>'Not a coup' Shannon Hile, 39, a volunteer for one of the Republican contenders, Kevin Kiley, bristles at the idea Republicans were behind the recall.</p><p>\"We made our own signs, bought our own banners; they didn't back us one bit, it's ridiculous they call this a Republican coup. They didn't even join in until we had enough signatures,\" she adds.</p><p>\"Everyone has their own reasons for signing; I'm a single mum and I was unable to work because I have a small child,\" she adds.</p><p>California has had the longest, strictest lockdown among US states, lasting with varying degrees of severity from March 2020 to June 2021. And, unlike other states, Newsom still hasn't ended a state of emergency order that allows him to govern by decree.</p><p>\"I've been in snow, rain, smoke; Covid held us back too, actually at some point we thought Newsom was shutting us down for so long to slow down the campaign,\" Hile says.</p><p>Almost 18 months since the pandemic began, more than 5 per cent of California's schools are still fully remote, according to the American Enterprise Institute's school tracker, a higher share than in any other US state.</p><p>At the 38 per cent of schools that have reintroduced face-to-face teaching five days a week, children over the age of two are still required to socially distance and wear a mask, even outside.</p><p>A perceived war on gig workers has put the Governor at odds with gig workers too. California passed \"assembly Bill 5\" in January 2020, which reclassified millions of independent contractors across California as \"employees\" in a radical rewrite of the state's industrial relations laws. Employers had to prove, with documentation, their contractors were not employees.</p><p>Tech giants Uber and Lyft later won exemptions for their drivers and delivery workers, but for thousands of other gig workers it meant unemployment in a state with a jobless rate of 7.6 per cent, more than two percentage points above the national average.</p><p>Recall votes aren't new to California, where they are easier to trigger than other states owing to progressive reforms going back to the early 1910s. But, while Schwarzenegger himself has drawn parallels between his own 2003 contest and Newsom's present political predicament, the state has grown only more staunchly Democratic since then.</p><p>Republican Elder After Jenner's campaign fizzled - \"it feels a bit comical, is this really serious?\" says Duriseti - Elder became the de facto Republican frontrunner, eclipsing the more traditional Republican 36-year-old California assemblyman Kiley, who wrote a 200-page book in January outlining the case against Newsom.</p><p>Dubbed the \"black face of white supremacy\" by a Los Angeles Times columnist in August, Elder has been cast as a Trump-supporting extremist, despite a platform of reopening schools and curbing the state's notoriously high levels of homelessness and crime.</p><p>\"I love Trump but at the same time, at this point, it's a good thing he's letting California get on with it. We want everyone to look at this with clear eyes,\" says Republican volunteer Hile.</p><p>Leading Democrats, including Governor Newsom, failed to condemn a white woman wearing a gorilla mask who threw an egg at Elder as he campaigned near Venice Beach in Los Angeles last week.</p><p>\"Whatever your views on abortion, it properly terrorises the average Californian Democrat and, frankly, the average Californian moderate Republican,\" says Duriseti, referring to Texas's recent, highly controversial move to outlaw abortion after six weeks.</p><p>Kevin Paffrath, a 29-year-old real estate broker and the only Democrat brave enough to put his name on the ballot, says Elder's candidacy has been a godsend for Newsom.</p><p>\"He was just talking about Republicans taking your voting rights, which was boring; now they've got someone who they can paint as extreme,\" he says.</p><p>The bulk of experts believe Newsom will win.</p><p>\"The Dems have practised holding power in that state for a long time, gerrymandered, and have built advantages that can't be understated,\" says one veteran Democrat adviser in DC.</p><p>\"At the same time, the Republican fundraising apparatus has fallen apart and the Republican political class just moved out of California,\" he adds, preferring not to be named.</p><p>The state that catapulted Ronald Reagan, governor from 1967 to 1975, to national fame has become progressively more and more Democrat.</p><p>\"Basically, it started to shift after \"prop 187\" was passed in 1994, a measure that prohibited undocumented immigrants from being able to use public schools, and that enraged a lot of people,\" Haro explains.</p><p>Newsom is a smart politician, a survivor, and glamorous in a state famous for Hollywood, and he's not running against an Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p>\"Even if Elder won, the state legislature, 75 per cent Democrat, wouldn't let him govern properly, waiting until the next governor election in 2022,\" says Paffrath.</p><p>About seven million Californians have voted already via mail-in ballot; 34 per cent of them from Democrats and 30 per cent from Republicans. Whether enough of the 22 per cent of ballots sent in by independents are angry with Newsom remains to be seen.</p><p>Olson, who ferries Californians around for work daily, is quietly optimistic. \"September 14th can't come soon enough, I say to them, and there's a lot of appreciative chuckling,\" she says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-fa680272137711ecac1a23b3f036d5c34d54948e8e256e0fff39989da1ddc338</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63KW-B0R1-F0JP-W1F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 14, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDkyMkE0NDI4NDVBNEVCM0FCMUNGQUNDQTg0NDQ3RTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0Y4NEU1ODkzRTlENEQ5MEI1NTRFRTI0RTIzNDcxRkI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Discipline, Licensing &amp;
