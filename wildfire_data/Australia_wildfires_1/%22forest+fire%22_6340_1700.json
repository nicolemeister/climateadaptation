There are a number of obvious reasons for this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The political/media elite, progressive to a fault, always welcomes the arrival of a left-of-centre government, especially after spending years demonising its Coalition predecessors. This was probably exacerbated by the nation coming out of the pandemic and looking for a period of reopening and renewal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And to give credit where it is due, Albanese and his team did not frighten the horses. On the contrary, they made a sure-footed and reassuring start on foreign policy, an area where many, myself included, feared weakness and regression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet now the trajectory for this government appears clear, and it suggests a path to economic hardship and political chaos. When the scales fall from the public's eyes - and that might be a year or two away - the reckoning will be savage.</p><p>There are two outstanding questions. How much damage will be visited upon the country? And will the Coalition make the hard decisions to present the necessary alternative for repair?</p><p>Jim Chalmers neatly summarised the nub of the problem while attacking the Coalition this week. \"Before the government changed hands interest rates were rising,\" the Treasurer said, \"real wages were going backwards, inflation was going up and a big part of the reason for that was the electricity price and energy market chaos that the shadow treasurer should come to the dispatch box and take responsibility for.\" A reasonably factual analysis. But the missing fact was that on each measure the situation has become significantly worse since the election and, worst of all, Labor's climate and energy policies will turbocharge the harm.</p><p>The hubris of Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen is extraordinary. His evangelical zeal for a renewables-plus-storage model as the enlightened path to lower prices, more supply, green jobs and a cooler planet ignores the simple fact that, despite numerous attempts, no country has achieved this.</p><p>In fact, all that have tried have ended up in an energy supply and cost crisis. The International Energy Agency warns that net zero cannot be achieved with current technology, and even net-zero and renewables advocate Kerry Schott, the former chairwoman of the Energy Security Board, admitted this week that the government's renewables plan might be beyond our wit.</p><p>\"It may not be possible,\" she told the ABC. \"But I think we've got to try.\" That such an admission from her did not generate broad news coverage goes to just how delusional the debate has become. Media, climate advocates, politicians and diplomats are sticking to a script of unchecked climate catastrophism while promoting implausible energy solutions.</p><p>When this bubble bursts it will get ugly. For a debate that is supposed to prioritise \"the science\" the biggest missing elements are scientific facts and rational arguments.</p><p>As an illustration, consider these numbered quotes: 1: \"We are facing an existential crisis in our region, which is climate change.\" 2: \"We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.\" 3: \"We need radical change to save the planet.\" 4: \"There are no actions too extreme to take at this moment to draw attention to the urgency of fixing this problem now.\" 5: \"We are the developed country with the most to lose from unchecked climate change and natural disasters - floods, fires, and cyclones - all of this is at stake.\" These quotes are all of a likeness but come from the most radical protesters and people charged with implementing policy. We expect hysteria and hyperbole from the radical fringe but should see factual arguments and rational approaches from responsible politicians - yet now there is no difference.</p><p>The fearmongering from those who glue their body parts to roads at protests is indistinguishable from the speeches of the UN secretary-general or our own Climate Change and Energy Minister.</p><p>For the record, those quotes belong to Bowen; UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres; Mali Cooper, who locked her head on to a car's steering wheel as she blocked the approaches to the Sydney Harbour Tunnel; retired teacher Tony Gleeson, who glued himself to a Picasso in an Extinction Rebellion protest at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne; and International Development and the Pacific Minister Pat Conroy at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.</p><p>It should be deeply worrying that the fact-free alarmism is indistinguishable between this lot. It is as though the nation's energy policy is being run by Greta Thunberg. (By the way, feel free to guess which quote belongs to who; I'll include the quiz answers at the end of this column.) Consider what this means for this country which, like every other developed nation, has built its prosperity on the foundation of cheap, reliable energy. We are accelerating an impossible renewable energy transition that has already constricted our electricity supply and elevated prices.</p><p>Through deliberate policy choices driven by ideology, we will further damage the reliability of our supplies while continuing to increase prices.</p><p>This is an act of national self-harm not seen since Kevin Rudd surrendered our borders - but the economic consequences will be much more severe and take longer to repair.</p><p>When the power shortages hit home, most likely over coming summers, the repercussions for the government will be dramatic. Ever-increasing power prices will cause household and business trauma along the way.</p><p>Two great lies are being perpetrated - and no, this is not climate denial, this is the opposite; this is recognising the supremacy of science, facts and rational analysis.</p><p>One is the gormless idea that renewables in countries such as ours are a practical solution to global warming, even as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise globally, thanks especially to China.</p><p>The other is the promotion of all natural disasters and weather events as being \"unprecedented\" and attributable to global warming. Scientists cannot make such links for our most recent droughts, floods or fires, but that does not stop some insinuating as much, and certainly it does not stop politicians and journalists leaping to conclusions.</p><p>This week the Prime Minister said: \"We've had the devastating bushfires, including in areas of rainforest that had never burnt ever before - ever before!\" This is typical of the alarmist claims we hear that scare our children and, presumably, help to justify radical but largely futile energy policies. They are simply wrong - yet stand uncorrected.</p><p>I have been through this in detail in these pages previously. Back in the spring of 2019 retired NSW fire commissioner and former NSW climate change councillor Greg Mullins told ABC radio that fires were \"breaking out in places where they just shouldn't burn \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the west coast of Tasmania, the world heritage areas, subtropical rainforests, it's all burning. And this is driven by climate change, there's no other explanation.\" But the South Australian Chronicle of February 1915 reported lives lost and the \"most devastating bushfires ever known in Tasmania sweeping over the northwest coast and other districts. The extent of the devastation cannot be over-estimated.\" And The Canberra Times in 1982 detailed a \"huge forest fire\" burning out 75,000ha of dense rainforest in that region.</p><p>Around the same time Mullins made his claim, Guardian Australia linked bushfires in Queensland rainforests to global warming.</p><p>\"I never thought I'd see the Australian rainforest burning. What will it take for us to wake up to the climate crisis?\" asked Joelle Gergis, of the Australian National University's Climate Change Institute, who was then a member of the Climate Council.</p><p>\"As a scientist, what I find particularly disturbing about the current conditions is that world heritage rainforest areas such as the Lamington National Park in the Gold Coast hinterland are now burning,\" she wrote.</p><p>Yet the Cairns Post reported on October 25, 1951: \"A bushfire in Lamington National Park today swept through a grove of 3000-year-old Macrozamia palms. These trees were one of the features of the park. The fire has burnt out about 2000 acres of thick rainforest country.\" We live at a time when clear, recorded, easily researched precedents do not preclude the use of the word unprecedented and do not prevent concocted hysteria. And on the back of this fabricated alarmism, we undermine the reliable energy sources that underpin our industry, agriculture, economy, health, education and prosperity.</p><p>There is a lot of science denial going on. And it is on the climate action side. Most of the media that has been complicit so far will not apologise for their role. Rather, when the reckoning comes they will pivot to the interests of their audiences and amplify the assault on governments.</p><p>There will be economic, social and political disruption. Then we will have to embrace gas generation or nuclear power, or even carbon capture and storage to reclaim our plentiful energy endowment.</p><p>Meanwhile, China will have continued its economic and military expansion, perhaps with the assistance of \"reparations\" from the West. Spike Milligan could not have conceived of such satire.</p><p>Of course, I could be wrong. We might see $1 trillion invested to build 28,000km of heavy transmission lines through landscapes where communities welcome them, linking tens of thousands of hectares of wind and solar farms in places where their aesthetics are appreciated, and they could be firmed up by massive battery installations yet to be invented, and all this could be delivered to us at a colossal loss to the investors so our prices do not increase dramatically. And the former coal and gas workers, and those who used to work in manufacturing, could all have jobs mowing the lawns between the rows of solar panels, or collecting bird kills from under the wind turbines.</p><p>And all the while heatwaves will subside, floods diminish, droughts will shorten and fires will be quelled. It sounds too good to be true.</p><p>Quiz answers 1: International Development and the Pacific Minister Pat Conroy; 2: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres; 3: Blockade Australia's Mali Cooper; 4: Extinction Rebellion's Tony Gleeson; 5: Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-78adbe4a5fc311ed94ce0471745576b8ff9c2594658fd72ff21f1c49161b0552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66V8-RHD1-JD3N-5421-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 12, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSJM</classCode><className>FRINGE THEORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000619</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

(By the way, feel free to guess which quote belongs to who; I'll include the quiz answers at the end of this column.)</p><p>Consider what this means for this country which, like every other developed nation, has built its prosperity on the foundation of cheap, reliable energy. We are accelerating an impossible renewable energy transition that has already constricted our electricity supply and elevated prices.</p><p>Through deliberate policy choices driven by ideology, we will further damage the reliability of our supplies while continuing to increase prices. </p><p>This is an act of national self-harm not seen since Kevin Rudd surrendered our borders - but the economic consequences will be much more severe and take longer to repair.</p><p>When the power shortages hit home, most likely over coming summers, the repercussions for the government will be dramatic. Ever-increasing power prices will cause household and business trauma along the way.</p><p>Two great lies are being perpetrated - and no, this is not climate denial, this is the opposite; this is recognising the supremacy of science, facts and rational analysis. </p><p>One is the gormless idea that renewables in countries such as ours are a practical solution to global warming, even as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise globally, thanks especially to China.</p><p>The other is the promotion of all natural disasters and weather events as being \"unprecedented\" and attributable to global warming. Scientists cannot make such links for our most recent droughts, floods or fires, but that does not stop some insinuating as much, and certainly it does not stop politicians and journalists leaping to conclusions.</p><p>This week the Prime Minister said: \"We've had the devastating bushfires, including in areas of rainforest that had never burnt ever before - ever before!\" This is typical of the alarmist claims we hear that scare our children and, presumably, help to justify radical but largely futile energy policies. They are simply wrong - yet stand uncorrected.</p><p>I have been through this in detail in these pages previously. Back in the spring of 2019 retired NSW fire commissioner and former NSW climate change councillor Greg Mullins told ABC radio that fires were \"breaking out in places where they just shouldn't burn ... the west coast of Tasmania, the world heritage areas, subtropical rainforests, it's all burning. And this is driven by climate change, there's no other explanation.\"</p><p>But the South Australian Chronicle of February 1915 reported lives lost and the \"most devastating bushfires ever known in Tasmania sweeping over the northwest coast and other districts. The extent of the devastation cannot be over-estimated.\" And The Canberra Times in 1982 detailed a \"huge forest fire\" burning out 75,000ha of dense rainforest in that region.</p><p>Around the same time Mullins made his claim, Guardian Australia linked bushfires in Queensland rainforests to global warming. </p><p>\"I never thought I'd see the Australian rainforest burning. What will it take for us to wake up to the climate crisis?\" asked Joelle Gergis, of the Australian National University's Climate Change Institute, who was then a member of the Climate Council.</p><p>\"As a scientist, what I find particularly disturbing about the current conditions is that world heritage rainforest areas such as the Lamington National Park in the Gold Coast hinterland are now burning,\" she wrote.</p><p> Yet the Cairns Post reported on October 25, 1951: \"A bushfire in Lamington National Park today swept through a grove of 3000-year-old Macrozamia palms. These trees were one of the features of the park. The fire has burnt out about 2000 acres of thick rainforest country.\"</p><p>We live at a time when clear, recorded, easily researched precedents do not preclude the use of the word unprecedented and do not prevent concocted hysteria. And on the back of this fabricated alarmism, we undermine the reliable energy sources that underpin our industry, agriculture, economy, health, education and prosperity.</p><p>There is a lot of science denial going on. And it is on the climate action side. Most of the media that has been complicit so far will not apologise for their role. Rather, when the reckoning comes they will pivot to the interests of their audiences and amplify the assault on governments.</p><p>There will be economic, social and political disruption. Then we will have to embrace gas generation or nuclear power, or even carbon capture and storage to reclaim our plentiful energy endowment.</p><p>Meanwhile, China will have continued its economic and military expansion, perhaps with the assistance of \"reparations\" from the West. Spike Milligan could not have conceived of such satire.</p><p>Of course, I could be wrong. We might see $1 trillion invested to build 28,000km of heavy transmission lines through landscapes where communities welcome them, linking tens of thousands of hectares of wind and solar farms in places where their aesthetics are appreciated, and they could be firmed up by massive battery installations yet to be invented, and all this could be delivered to us at a colossal loss to the investors so our prices do not increase dramatically. And the former coal and gas workers, and those who used to work in manufacturing, could all have jobs mowing the lawns between the rows of solar panels, or collecting bird kills from under the wind turbines.</p><p>And all the while heatwaves will subside, floods diminish, droughts will shorten and fires will be quelled. It sounds too good to be true.</p><p>Quiz answers</p><p>1: International Development and the Pacific Minister Pat Conroy; 2: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres; 3: Blockade Australia's Mali Cooper; 4: Extinction Rebellion's Tony Gleeson; 5: Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

In the north-west of the state, that fire potential is greater than it is in the east.\"</p><p>More 2,000 hectares of land have undergone planned burns from July 1 to the end of October in preparation for the coming summer.</p><p>\"I want to reassure Victorians that we are doing more and more,\" Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D'Ambrosio said.</p><p>\"We keep increasing our resources, we keep expanding our capability with record investment because we need to be ready each and every season, regardless of how mild or otherwise the season outlook is.\"</p><h>Ex fire chief weighs in on changing climate</h><p>Former chief of the Country Fire Authority Neil Bibby applauded the investment by the government, calling it increasingly necessary in the face of frequent bushfire activity.</p><p>\"I commend the Victorian government on what they've done, I think it's a fantastic step forward,\" Mr Bibby said.</p><p>\"It's the firepower that we needed, men and women, that are going to protect the state of Victoria and ensure these fires don't get out of hand.\"</p><p>Mr Bibby is now a member of Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, a group of senior Australian fire and emergency service leaders calling for direct government solutions to the increased frequency of extreme weather events.</p><p>He said the bushfires of the future would change the way Australians lived their lives.</p><p>\"We're going to have to change our lifestyle and the way we work to ensure we can live in an area of enhanced fire risk,\" Mr Bibby said.</p><p>With the expectation of a milder bushfire season, Mr Bibby said the devastating effects of bushfires, such as those that claimed 33 lives in 2019/2020, must not be forgotten.</p><p>\"I think the disaster half-life is about one to two years, after that people start rolling back the thought processes of what can happen,\" he said.</p><p>\"It will move to once every five years, to once every two years, and if we keep going the way we are with climate change, it's going to be every single year.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

died at a property on Coolagolite Road on December 31, 2019.</p><p>His death was the subject of a hearing as part of the NSW Bushfire Coronial Inquiry on Thursday, September 9.</p><p>Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan heard Mr Steele was living in a granny flat on a property owned by a friend of his in December, 2019.</p><p>The two men had a discussion on December 30 about the fire, and the second man gave evidence they weren't concerned at that point as the nearest fire was still \"seven kilometres away\" at Dignams Creek.</p><p>However, Mr Steele was awoken by a phone call from his friend at 4.40am on December 31 after the friend was awoken by a phone call from the RFS.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard the two men agreed on a plan to stay at the property and use a pump to bring water from the dam to help fight the fire, however a power cut at about 5.15am meant the pump no longer worked.</p><p>Both men then went into their homes to pack their belongings in preparation to leave the property.</p><p>\"The fire was still about three kilometres away from the property when we decided to pack bags,\" the man told the court.</p><p>\"It was probably about 30 minutes after the power went out that I was outside at my car and putting bags in when the wind changed.</p><p>\"I threw one of my cats in the car, and when I looked up the fire was only about 500m away.</p><p>\"By the time I got to the driver's door the flames were at my property's border, and my driveway was on fire by the time I'd left.</p><p>\"It went from being relatively safe to being in trouble in less than 60 seconds.\"</p><p>The man said he drove up Coolagolite Road but became worried when Mr Steele's headlights didn't appear in his rear-view mirror.</p><p>\"I tried to get back to the property, but I couldn't reach the granny flat,\" he said.</p><p>\"I could see his car was still there.\"</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard evidence that Mr Steele had sent text messages to his sister just before 6am, and it is believed those texts were the last communications he had with another person.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mr Steele's remains were found in the burnt granny flat on January 1, 2020.</p><p>In a family statement read to the court, Mr Steele's sister Martine described Rick as a \"character who had a great smile and an easy-going, relaxed nature\".</p><p>\"He had a knack of making you feel comfortable in his presence by giving you his full attention with his large smile,\" the statement read.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan thanked Mr Steele's family, who were watching a live stream of the inquiry, for their bravery during the investigation into his death.</p><p>\"Our thoughts are very much with you today, and thank you for being so generous in letting us get to know your brother a little better,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

locked out of the new Fire Rescue Victoria zones, possibly weakening the state's defences against grass and bushfires threatening outer Melbourne suburbs and regional cities. </p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief officer Chris Hardman has issued a staff directive to his green-clad firefighters not to conduct fuel reduction burns or fight fires in FRV zones, without first consulting him.</p><p>\"As you know, the Fire Services Reform has changed the CFA fire district boundaries through new legislation... and in doing so has changed the arrangements under which FFMVic is able to operate in areas which are now within the FRV Districts,\" Mr Hardman's directive stated. </p><p>\"For grass and scrub fires on private property and support to other incidents within FRV District, FFMVic should not undertake suppression/support activities within these areas, unless discussed with CFO.</p><p>\"Right now, we are working on an agreement in the form of an MOU, which will allow for review of this Directive in future.\" </p><p>In the meantime he warned any FFMVic firefighter who entered FRV territory would not have \"immunity from personal liability\", whether they were on private or public land.</p><p>FRV took control of former 39 CFA stations and their territory at Wodonga, Wangaratta, Shepparton, Traralgon, Morwell, Latrobe West, Mildura, Bendigo, Ballarat City, Lucas, Warrnambool and Portland on July 1 this year, plus another 27 CFA stations surrounding Melbourne, Geelong and the Mornington Peninsula.</p><p>FRV was contacted last Friday at 2pm for comment, but had still not responded by deadline yesterday to questions on why it had restricted FFMVic firefighters' access. </p><p>Just what role the United Firefighters Union may be playing in the drafting of an memorandum of understanding that would give FFMVic's firefighters access to FRV zones is unknown.</p><p>However Section 24 of the enterprise agreement between FRV and the UFU on emergency management changes states FRV: \"will not implement any change without the agreement of the UFU\".</p><p>The 777-page EA makes 400 mentions of the requirement of FRV chief Ken Block and his deputies to consult the UFU and gain its agreement prior to making staff, resourcing and operational decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url

She was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital on July 5 where she passed away overnight. <br/> Emily Kirkpatrick, South Australia's Deputy Chief Public Health Officer, said the woman had been diagnosed with thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) prior to her death. The rare blood clotting syndrome had previously been linked to the AstraZeneca shot. <br/> \"[It's] very, very sad and our thoughts are with her family during this very difficult time,' Kirkpatrick added, according to ABC News.[1] <br/> Despite the death, the chief public health officer continued to urge the public to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and encouraged people to seek medical help should they observe symptoms related to TTS. <br/> \"The symptoms are a headache, sudden onset headache that doesn't go away with the usual analgesia, abdominal pain, leg pain, feeling off, typically symptoms starting around day four, day five onwards,' she said. \"If you're unable to see your GP and you have symptoms then please go to the emergency department.' <br/> On Wednesday, a team of researchers from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, published a study in the science journal Nature[2] that linked a handful of amino acids to the unusual vaccine-related blood clots. <br/> The Canadian study involved analyzing blood samples from five people, ages 35 to 72, who developed immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT after receiving a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. <br/> The researchers then compared the platelet and clotting responses of the five people to 10 people who had VITT as a result of a blood-thinning drug called heparin and 10 healthy people. The study found that key antibodies targeted eight surface amino acids, which led to VITT. <br/> The AstraZeneca shot uses altered cold viruses to trigger the human body's immune system to create antibodies and defensive white blood cells to fight against COVID-19. But in rare cases, some people may have an autoimmune reaction that leads the antibodies to bind with unusual strength to a blood component. This results in the formation of blood clots. <br/> \"That's where the forest fire starts. These amino acids are super important to VITT but not to [heparin-induced thrombocytopenia],\" Ishac Nazy, an author of the study, told The Wall Street Journal[3]. <br/> The rare blood clotting syndrome was also seen in some people who received the Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson vaccine. However, it is more prominent among AstraZeneca recipients. <br/><br/>AstraZeneca's failure to deliver the promised doses sparked a bitter war of words between the drug company and the EU earlier this year Photo: AFP / GABRIEL BOUYS <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-12/sa-death-believed-to-be-linked-to-az/100286764\">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-12/sa-death-believed-to-be-linked-to-az/100286764</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03744-4\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03744-4</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-related-blood-clots-linked-to-amino-acids-in-new-study-11625648400\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-related-blood-clots-linked-to-amino-acids-in-new-study-11625648400</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857162614950402825979100251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634G-PC61-JCMN-Y42D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><timeReceived>4:11 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 13, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002L6S</classCode><className>ASTRAZENECA PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>AZN (STO)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>AZN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>AZN (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

M, 92 minutes. Four stars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Volunteering in this country is strong. We saw how it boosted the Sydney Olympics. Two decades later the Australian volunteering public was called on to do more, and then some, during the incredibly testing conditions of the Black Summer of 2019-2020. From south-east Queensland to the Southern Highlands and Far South Coast of NSW, to eastern Victoria, volunteering took on a whole new meaning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a documentary about the men and women of the NSW Rural Fire Service and the communities they risked their lives for during the hellish nightmare that unfolded two years ago. NSW RFS is one of the largest volunteer fire-fighting organisations in the world and, as former Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons points out, 90 percent of the RFS are volunteers and most people have no idea that their work is unpaid.</p><p>It's what these firies do. When they are needed, they down tools in jobs in the public service, or retail or design consultancy to don hi-vis gear, jump into emergency services vehicles and head towards the fire front. Most people run away from bushfire, observes Brendon O'Connor of Balmoral Village RFS in the Southern Highlands, while the RFS runs towards it.</p><p>O'Connor, who was formerly in the military, is one of two key witnesses whose story shapes this riveting documentary. Nathan Barnden of Jellat Jellat RFS is the other key witness. Both men were traumatised by their experiences, had near-death experiences and are now transitioning to recovery. Volunteering day after day in a constant state of high alert, where survival is touch-and-go, has an inevitable human cost.</p><p>On the night in the Southern Highlands when two young firefighters lost their lives, O'Connor, a captain in the RFS, refused to leave Balmoral Village unattended as instructed. Conditions were extremely volatile after three years of drought throughout Australia's south-east, but he stayed on, as many did in fact, throughout the regions, taking enormous risks to save lives and property.</p><p>It's Barnden's remarkable, harrowing personal story that helps structure the narrative. It began when the Badja Forest fire burst out of the mountains and sprinted across the tinder-dry dairy country of the Bega Valley towards the coast.</p><p>Barnden and a fellow firefighter, answering a call to 000 from Quaama, jumped into a 4WD without any fire-safe features, the only vehicle available, and drove through fireground to the house. A family of seven were huddled together inside under a blanket with three-quarters of the building alight around them. After the men had managed to drive them out to safety, with minutes to spare, they risked their lives to save several more families within the hour. It was the night that Barnden's uncle and cousin in nearby Wandella were killed by a fireball as they tried to defend their property.</p><p>Despite the family tragedy, he continued working for the RFS, non-stop without a moment to grieve, for the next two months. Unsurprisingly, he is still carrying a burden of guilt about not being there for his uncle and cousin.</p><p>It is still overwhelming to see those images of tiny figures in silhouette in the foreground of towering walls of flame. When day turned to night on New Year 2020, I was with my family sheltering in Bermagui surf club while fire tore through our block south of Cobargo.</p><p>The apocalyptic vision from eastern Australia that summer shocked the world and the smoke drifted across the globe. At the end of it all, when rain suddenly fell, there had been 200 consecutive days of emergencies and an area similar in size to Britain was burnt out.</p><p>Directed in workmanlike fashion by Justin Krook, with assistance from Luke Mazzaferro, A Fire Inside tells it how it was, and how it is now. The second half of the doco is devoted to mental health, food charities and to building community resilience, the area to which Fitzsimmons has made a natural segue from his former role.</p><p>There is little need for embellishment with raw, unfiltered human content such as this, still so extraordinary and riveting for us all. I hope it's being screened at Capital Hill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7i6zzpnlyn5kgqz73ld</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63YS-MGN1-JD34-V1GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And as graziers destock due to the drought, there is a risk of elevated fuel levels for next summer, which will create more severe fires if we get ignitions.</p><p>\"I'd like not to have to go through it again,\" Supt Jones said, \"but we'll see what the weather does, and what Mother Nature throws at us.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRAUS-doc79yiwaitr5cos79ml4g</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJR-C221-JD34-V05R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">290073</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I was aiming for about 60-80 per cent clean up but we got about 95 per cent clean up.\"</p><p>To the south of Ballarat on Sunday afternoon, Sebastopol Fire Brigade led a planned burn on council land at MR Power Reserve off Crown Street. Sebastopol Fire Brigade volunteer and Deputy Group Officer of the Eureka Group, Bill Cook, said the City of Ballarat had done a lot of work with machinery to clear long grass and weeds. But there were some areas they couldn't slash due to rocks and mounds, so the fire brigade undertook a controlled burn.</p><p>\"There's been an effort by council to clean up the land and the hazards there,\" he said, noting the burn was conducted to clean up the land that was left so it could be more easily maintained.</p><p>He said the weather had provided the perfect opportunity to conduct the burn.</p><p>Assisted by Ballarat Fire Brigade and Ballarat City volunteers, the fire was ignited around 1pm and went on for about two hours to burn around 2.6 hectares of grass and weeds including gorse and blackberry. However, firefighters remained at the scene until about 6pm to patrol it and ensure it did not reignite.</p><p>Meanwhile, there was also a 12-hectare fuel reduction burn along the Glenelg Highway near Skipton on Sunday afternoon while Forest Fire Management Victoria undertook a large burn near Scarsdale on Saturday.</p><p>The fire danger period remains in place in the region and burns can only be conducted with a strict permit. This includes Schedule 13 permits, which are currently being issued to allow farmers to burn stubble and grass to prepare their land for future cropping.</p><p>For the latest information about planned burns visit: ffm.vic.gov.au/plannedburns, download the VicEmergency app or call the VicEmergency hotline on 1800 226 226.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc7etqovv9k3o7gcfuegq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:625G-0T91-JD34-V4B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 9, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

LEAST 500,000 tonnes of windblown trees have been left lying on the floor of one of Victoria's most significant state forests, creating a \"ticking fire bomb\" experts say has the potential to engulf nearby towns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industry sources say the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning's conservation regulator have blocked a bid by the Dja Dja Wurrung and VicForests to clear tens of thousands of messmate, narrow-leaf peppermint, manna and other gums from the Wombat State Forest, felled by a storm last June.</p><p>Drone and satellite imagery of the region shows many large swathes of forest have been flattened on hills and ridge lines, covering a total of about 2000ha.</p><p>One local forester described the situation as a \"ticking fire bomb\" and said it had the potential to cause devastation similar to that recorded at Marysville during the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, with Daylesford, Barkstead, Bullarto, Lyonville, Blackwood and other settlements considered at major risk.</p><p>Forest surveys show fallen trees have pushed the fuel loads to between 200 and 400 tonnes a hectare, which experts warn would generate -enormous heat during a catastrophic fire.</p><p>University of Melbourne forest fire expert Kevin Tolhurst said \"the amount of heat produced would be far in excess of average - 200 tonnes/ha compared to 20 tonnes/ha\".</p><p>He said the vast amount of fuel on the ground would create fires similar to those that hit Victoria on Black Saturday and parts of southern NSW in 2019-20, which \"can produce cyclonic force winds\".</p><p>\" Continued, Page 4 \" Editorial, Page 18 \" Rule's View, Page 19 \" From Page 1 \"These fire-induced winds can knock down houses and blow windows in,\" he said. \"It makes homes indefensible because they (the winds) cause a lot of damage before the fire even gets there.</p><p>\"When you have high amounts of fuel, you don't need as large a fire to cause these fire-induced winds.\" Associate Professor Tolhurst said every effort should be put into reducing the fuel load lying on the forest floor, via timber harvesting.</p><p>But time is running out to harvest any of the timber, with the former owner of the now closed Black Forest timber mill, Geoff Proctor, saying the trees strewn across the forest floor must be harvested this winter, given it was starting to crack.</p><p>\"Years ago when it went into house frames it didn't matter so much, but now it's used for high-value appearance timber - floors and furniture, where you can't have cracks,\" Mr Proctor said.</p><p>\"The fire risk is enormous unless this wood is taken out.\" Dja Dja Wurrung chief executive Rodney Carter said the risk from the heavy fuel load was \"terrifying\".</p><p>\"There's environment groups that have an approach where you do nothing and I don't think that's useful,\" Mr Carter said. \"As traditional owners we want to be involved in forest management.\" To that end the Dja Dja Wurrung, who have rights to the timber under their Land Use Agreement with the Victorian Government, have approached VicForests to harvest up to 80,000 cubic metres of saw logs from the forests.</p><p>Mr Carter said that as first nation's people they wanted to practise traditional \"forest gardening\" and use fire to manage fuels loads to create more open \"woodland, not a forest\".</p><p>\"We're not here to profit from the forest, we want to manage it,\" he said. \"But if there's storm damage and the trees have fallen, then why won't people let us have some money.\" The Weekly Times understands DELWP has threatened VicForests with legal action if they go ahead and start harvesting, while also writing to Mr Carter opposing the deal.</p><p>\"We want to partner with VicForests, because they have the capability and resources,\" Mr Carter said, under what he called a natural resource agreement. \"This would be positive change for the citizens of Victoria, moving to traditional forest management and reducing fire risk.\" But he said DELWP had warned the agreement could not be declared, because the regulatory framework was not in place.</p><p>Last December Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio announced the Government intended to double the Wombat-Lerderderg parks system, from 20,474ha to 44,698ha, and add another 19,028ha across the region extending out to Mount Macedon.</p><p>DELWP's website states: \"The Wombat-Lerderderg National Park provides habitat for many threatened species, including the Greater Glider, and will be a tourism drawcard\".</p><p>Meanwhile timber mills are running out of timber across central Victoria and East Gippsland as environment groups mount legal action that has led to court-imposed injunctions on any coupe where Greater Gliders have been sighted within 240m.</p><p>Last week Montana Timber was forced to close its Nowa Nowa timber mill due to the timber shortage, but managing director George Kasikovic said they were open again on a 3.5 day week after sourcing logs.</p><p>He said the industry could use the logs from the Wombat Forest, even if it had to be hauled to East Gippsland.</p><p>For every two cubic metres of messmate, a timber mill can produce one cubic metre of flooring, with a wholesale value ranging from $1600 to $2100, plus other high value products, which puts the value of 80,000 cubic metres at between $64 million and $84m.</p><p>Minister D'Ambrosio's office was contacted for comment.</p><p>HAVE YOUR SAY Should VicForests be allowed to harvest

nitf:lede=\"true\">But that changed when Forest Fire Management Victoria and Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation (DDWCAC) <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-31/indigenous-cultural-burning-to-return-to-victoria/10761772\">brought back the practice</url> a few years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far there have been 14 cultural burns, including a recent one at <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2016-02-12/boorts-indigenous-history-on-a-global-scale/7164258\">Lake Boort</url> in central Victoria, with 60 more planned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're really growing exponentially,\" Scott Falconer, Deputy Chief Fire Officer with Forest Fire Management Victoria, said.</p><p>\"Cultural burning will be a huge part of our broader burning program, led by Aboriginal people implemented by Aboriginal people into the future.\"</p><p>More than just a fuel reduction exercise, it is about restoring damaged habitats and often unearthing cultural artefacts.</p><p>\"It's really about managing country, holistically, and fire is the tool that does that,\" Deputy Chief Falconer said.</p><p>While this practice has been around in northern parts of Australia, it has largely been on Aboriginal owned and managed land, whereas the practice in Victoria has also been done on public land.</p><p>Burning by traditional owners integrated into the state's existing planned burning program is crucial, according to Mr Falconer.</p><p>\"They need to lead that process at every level,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is a new role for us as a fire agency - to become enablers rather than just doers.\"</p><p>With many calling for a <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-09/indigenous-cultural-fire-burning-method-has-benefits-experts-say/11853096\">national cultural burning program</url>, there is hope it will be up for discussion at the current bushfire royal commission.</p><p>Bushfire royal commission offers hope</p><p>Following last summer's devastating Black Summer bushfires that claimed the lives of more than 30 people, one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/tor-nat-royal-commission-black-summer-bushfires.pdf\">terms of reference</url> for the commission is to look at ways in which traditional land and fire management practices of Indigenous Australians could improve Australia's resilience to natural disasters.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer of DDWCAC Rodney Carter welcomed the inclusion and said there needed to be a collective understanding at a national level.</p><p>\"It is really useful because it needs to be considered at the highest level,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think we've come this far, that in the absence of cultural fire in the landscape, that it's just untenable anymore, not to do it.\"</p><p>Mr Carter is hopeful the commission's findings will pave the way for politicians and senior policy makers to be held accountable.</p><p>\"That they will have to do something,\" he said.</p><p>He is also hoping the inquiry will provide the \"calmness to the complexity\" of the trauma of the recent bushfires and provide valuable learnings.</p><p>\"Use traditional owner knowledge, but do it through collaboration, don't appropriate it, otherwise I think it's destined for failure,\" Mr Carter said.</p><p>\"It's about traditional owners being allowed to do this with the other leaders.</p><p>\"Fire in the landscape, definitely has the benefit of overall hazard reduction and is good for the country.\"</p><p>'It's put us back in the landscape'</p><p>Chair of DDWCAC Trent Nelson said that historically, Indigenous communities had been excluded from conversations about land management.</p><p>\"Our voice was really extinguished for a long period of time,\" he said.</p><p>Things changed with regards to land management in central Victoria with the Recognition and Settlement Agreement between the Dja Dja Wurrung People and the State of Victoria in 2013.</p><p>It acknowledged the Dja Dja Wurrung as traditional owners of part of Central Victoria.</p><p>\"I suppose it's put us back in the landscape, so to speak,\" Mr Nelson said.</p><p>\"It's about us being part of the conversations on how our country's managed.\"</p><p>From when the first flame was light in central Victoria four years ago, Mr Nelson said a key component was including more people in the process.</p><p>\"Every burn we turn up to we have new faces, we have new people coming and being involved in a cultural burn,\" he said.</p><p>\"For me it is about learning, I learn at every burn that I go to - about the landscape and what our old people have left for us.</p><p>\"It's what 'Walking Together' is all about for us.\"</p><p>The royal commission into bushfires began hearings this week.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walking Together is taking a look at our nation's reconciliation journey, where we've been and asks the question - where do we go next? </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Join us as we listen, learn and share stories from across the country, that unpack the truth telling of our history and embrace the rich culture and language of Australia's First People.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

When the first half of the study period, from 1988 to 2001, is compared with the period between 2002 and 2018, the average annual forest burned area in Australia increased 350 per cent. That figured ramps up to 800 per cent when the fires of 2019-20, which burnt more than 24 million hectares of land, are included.</p><p>Mega-fires, which burn more than 1 million hectares, have \"markedly\" increased with three of the four recorded from 1930 occurring since 2000, while the gap between big blazes has had a \"rapid decrease\", the study says.</p><p>Last year, the bushfire royal commission reported fuel-load management through hazard reduction burning \"may have no appreciable effect under extreme conditions\" that typically cause loss of life and property.</p><p>The CSIRO findings bolster that conclusion and call into question calls for native forest logging tobe used as a bushfire management tool.</p><p>\"This is happening regardless of anything that we might or might not do to try to stop the fires,\" Dr Canadell said.</p><p>The increased frequency of bushfires is giving the bush less and less time to recover, which is changing ecosystems and threatening the survival of many plants and animals that are struggling to adapt to the pace of change and loss of habitat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7ikpag9kiwk175s2uacs</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:645H-1K21-JD34-V056-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Australian Community Media urges caution for readers as this could be deeply upsetting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A coronial inquiry has heard Colin \"Col\" Burns, 72, died in his vehicle when fleeing the Badja Forest Fire on December, 31, 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Col's death was heard at the NSW Bushfire Coronial Inquiry to the 2019/2020 bushfires on Tuesday, September 7.</p><p>The assisting counsel to the coroner said it was likely Col could not defend his property, or himself, and made a decision to evacuate.</p><p>\"Due to extreme conditions and the pace of the fire, he was unable to make it to safety,\" the assisting counsel said.</p><p>Col was a \"true bushman\" who continued to live on his family farm of 1500 acres. He had some cattle on the property that was described as being remote with dense bushland, 55km west of the nearest town, Bodalla.</p><p>Col was an active and dedicated member of Belowra RFS for about 40 years.</p><p>On December 30, the day before his death, fire encroached his property from the west and destroyed the first of his three cottages.</p><p>In a testimony to the court, Belowra RFS captain, Ewan Thompson, said Col understood the advice was to leave and seek shelter at the fire shed.</p><p>Despite losing his first cottage to the blaze, Mr Thompson said Col didn't want to leave.</p><p>\"He was always going to stay and defend the rest of his property,\" Mr Thompson told the court.</p><p>Mr Thompson had more than 50-years of firefighting experience and described conditions to the court.</p><p>\"I had never seen a fire behave that way,\" he said.</p><p>\"We never had to fight fire in the early hours of the morning. Usually fires are mid-morning, (or) late afternoon when they fully get going.</p><p>\"This one took-off and really became extreme at nine or 10 at night ... I have never fought a fire with such a big front before.\"</p><p>Col's remaining dwellings were positioned on top of a ridge, making them \"difficult to defend\".</p><p>\"No matter what direction the fire came, he was going to be under threat,\" Mr Thompson said.</p><p>RFS crews of Dalmeny and Belowra helped Col prepare into the night of December 30, before leaving in the early hours of December 31.</p><p>Mr Thompson was the last to safely leave Col's property. He informed Col the weather conditions had changed and fire was threatening the southern end of the valley.</p><p>\"I was very concerned,\" he said.</p><p>\"I had to make a decision to leave or stay there. I decided more people were going to be at risk at the southern end of the valley, I had to say to him that I had to leave.\"</p><p>Col's neighbours, Keith and Deb Dance, went to inspect their property at about 8.30am when they saw Col's fire-strewn ute and that he didn't make it.</p><p>READ MORE: The 'tsunami of fire' that wiped out everything its path at Belowra</p><p>They informed RFS members who reported to Police and cordoned off the area.</p><p>Due to radio, electricity and mobile phone outages, search and rescue personnel could not access the valley at the time.</p><p>On January 2, police detectives flew by helicopter to Belowra and spoke with RFS members.</p><p>Detectives found Col's ute positioned on its rims with the trailer tipped on its side. Both the ute and trailer were extensively damaged. Police told the court, Col's trailer was equipped for fighting fires.</p><p>Police believed the trailer flipped when the ute negotiated a curve of the narrow unsealed road.
