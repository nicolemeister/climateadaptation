Between 1973 and 2010, the Forest Fire Danger Index rose at 16 out of 38 weather stations around the country.</p><p>No station recorded a fall. Most of the most severe fire seasons have occurred from the 1990s. The number of days of very high to extreme fire danger in NSW could more than double from the current average of 17 days per year to 38 by 2050, by which time, Victorians could face the prospect of a 'Black Saturday' every two or three years.</p><p>The Climate Institute goes on to say that, while fuel loading is an important factor in the risk of fire, weather conditions including drought, high winds and extreme temperatures are often a major influence. According to the Institute, climate change doesn't light fires, but by rendering southern Australia drier and hotter, it's creating favourable conditions for more dangerous, more frequent bushfires. The Bureau of Meteorology's observations show that, since the 1970s, fire danger has been rising in many parts of the country. The average temperature of the continent has risen by almost a degree since Federation, while rainfall in the south has fallen.</p><p>The mix of warmer and drier weather is raising the risk of severe, extreme and catastrophic fire weather conditions in southeastern Australia.</p><p>Because the fire season itself is spreading further into spring and autumn, there are fewer and fewer opportunities for authorities to conduct hazard-reduction burns. With this in mind, it is critical that we pull out all stops to mitigate further climate change.</p><p>These past weeks should be a warning to us all.</p><p>We need stronger action on climate change, not total dismantling of all climate policies by the Abbott government.</p><p>Jenny Goldie</p><p>President</p><p>Climate Action Monaro</p><p>Michelago</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COOMAM-2099443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COOMAM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BJT-0RM1-JD6G-435R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390480</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We may need to rethink our land use planning regarding people wanting to have houses in the bush. And it's certainly making the job of fire suppression much harder.\" Liberal senator and former chief executive of the Bush Fires Board of Western Australia, Chris Back, said increasing numbers of people living in areas of risk left governments with a higher duty of care.</p><p>\"We need to return to the principles of prevention and not be focusing so much on the response in managing, in the past fortnight, bushfires,\" Senator Back said.</p><p>He warned that the lessons of the 2009 Black Saturday fires in Victoria had not been learned and said most of the 15 recommendations of the subsequent Senate inquiry into bushfire management in Australia had been ignored.</p><p>Since the Northcliffe forest fire that burned through WA's southwest for more than a week last February, the Barnett government has stepped up its program of prescribed burns in the region.</p><p>Using an extar $20 million for a four-year program of controlled burning, the Department of Parks and Wildlife has conducted 131,000ha of \"cool burns\" in southwest forests since July last year, a marked increase on recent years.The Barnett government has faced scrutiny over the response to the fire that hit Yarloop. There were about 200 firefighters on duty at the height of the blaze. On Saturday, 60 firefighters and five paramedics arrived from NSW to help, but the Baird government was not asked to send two firefighting aircraft, including a DC10 that can drop 45,000 tonnes of retardant at once.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-The Australian20160111Australian4000143270611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HTP-6761-JD3N-51FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"450\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 11, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Torts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JFNzU3RTM3OTg2NEU2OEFENUZDMTQzNUU3OEJEQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTk2ODNCODdGRjVGNDRCMjk5ODZFQjkzQTNCOEEwMTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

No sanction had been imposed and the probe should take no longer than three months, he said.</p><p>After the meeting, RAPP president director Tony Wenas said his company \"supports the government's commitment to restore peatland areas\" and would accept any recommendation from the investigation.</p><p>The meeting came after officials from the restoration -agency, led by agency chief Nazir Foead, were denied entry to the concession area on Monday.</p><p>Mr Foead said agency officials planned to \"conduct a spot check to see the conditions first- hand\" after allegations the company was trying to open a new plantation on peatland supposedly protected by law.</p><p>He said officials had found -canals suspected of having been built to drain water from the peatland and prepare it for a plantation. Officials planned to measure the depth of the peatland, which is protected if it is deeper than 3m.</p><p>In a video released by the restoration agency, Mr Foead is seen arguing with a plantation security guard who also claimed to be a member of the army's special forces commando, Kopassus. The military has denied the guard was one of its own.</p><p>RAPP has said there was a misunderstanding, and it had -always been open to government inspections.</p><p>Last week seven officials -investigating a forest fire inside a palm oil concession area in -Sumatra were taken hostage by a mob who threatened to kill them unless they erased photographs and removed a sign advising that the area was sealed and under -investigation.</p><p>They were released unharmed after 12 hours when police intervened, but their cars and cameras were seized by the mob. The government believed the 100-strong mob was hired by the firm operating the concession, Andika Permata Sawit -Lestarian, an allegation the company has denied.</p><p>National police chief Tito Karnavian said police were -investigating both cases. \"Obstructing government -officials from carrying out their duties is a criminal offence,\" he told the newspaper Tempo.</p><p>Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar condemned the incidents, promising to \"wage war against forest and land fires\".</p><p>President Joko Widodo has pledged more protection for the country's carbon-rich peatland areas. In January, he established an agency to restore about two million hectares of peatlands -destroyed in forest and land fires.</p><p>Scientists estimated more than 75 per cent of fires last year occurred on peatlands, some set deliberately to clear land for plantations, causing record catastrophic smoke levels affecting more than 500,000 people in -Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.This year, better responses and better weather have prevented fires reaching such levels.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20160910Australian11000170014564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KNH-82D1-F0JP-W27X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>September 10, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0001Z7M</classCode><className>ASIA PACIFIC RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000639</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5Q</classCode><className>WETLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

We may need to rethink our land use planning regarding people wanting to have houses in the bush. And it's certainly making the job of fire suppression much harder.\" Liberal senator and former chief executive of the Bush Fires Board of Western Australia, Chris Back, said increasing numbers of people living in areas of risk left governments with a higher duty of care.</p><p>\"We need to return to the principles of prevention and not be focusing so much on the response in managing, in the past fortnight, bushfires,\" Senator Back said.</p><p>He warned that the lessons of the 2009 Black Saturday fires in Victoria had not been learned and said most of the 15 recommendations of the subsequent Senate inquiry into bushfire management in Australia had been ignored.</p><p>Since the Northcliffe forest fire that burned through WA's southwest for more than a week last February, the Barnett government has stepped up its program of prescribed burns in the region.</p><p>Using an extar $20 million for a four-year program of controlled burning, the Department of Parks and Wildlife has conducted 131,000ha of \"cool burns\" in southwest forests since July last year, a marked increase on recent years.The Barnett government has faced scrutiny over the response to the fire that hit Yarloop. There were about 200 firefighters on duty at the height of the blaze. On Saturday, 60 firefighters and five paramedics arrived from NSW to help, but the Baird government was not asked to send two firefighting aircraft, including a DC10 that can drop 45,000 tonnes of retardant at once.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-The Australian20160111Australian34000143271904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HTR-0VV1-JD3N-53C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"450\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 11, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Torts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JFNzU3RTM3OTg2NEU2OEFENUZDMTQzNUU3OEJEQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTk2ODNCODdGRjVGNDRCMjk5ODZFQjkzQTNCOEEwMTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The forest experienced the largest Wallow fire, losing nearly 849 square miles to it.&lt;nl/&gt; Since Arizona houses nearly 28 species of bats, these scientists were keen on understanding the effects of forest fire on the bats. They wanted to learn of their reaction to the post fire environment. The press release[1]\u00a0disclosed that bats are indicator species that can predict an environmental problem. Hence, they can still provide information to the forest service employees on several matters post fire.&lt;nl/&gt; Maternity colonies have nearly 900 bats, and these contributed in the research as well. They roost mostly on tall or dying trees. Researchers state that this is an important bit of information for the forest officials as it would help decide which burned tress should be removed.&lt;nl/&gt; Chambers and Saunders used tiny radio transmitters for their research. They tracked the bats and compared different habitats based on the basis of the fire and the degree of loss in the ecosystem. Though they found that the fire did not affect the habitat of the bats, the researchers say that more fires and climate change will result in a decrease in habitat.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; They also found that different bats prefer different habitats in terms of the severity of the burned areas. Some prefer unburned snags or areas where there are less trees lost to the fire. They also found that bat count decreased in both severely burned sites and those not heavily affected. Chambers and Saunders state that this could be due to the migration of the bats to other areas.&lt;nl/&gt; \"Fire-killed snags usually fall within 10 years and it can take hundreds of years to regrow Ponderosa pine, if they grow back at all,\" said Chambers, referring to the consequences the bats would face in the long run. Saunders believes that the short term research must continue to provide stronger land management recommendations.&lt;nl/&gt; For questions/comments regarding the article, you may email the writer at\u00a0<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samrichardson.ibtimes@gmail.com\">samrichardson.ibtimes@gmail.com</email>;&lt;nl/&gt;

environment reporter</nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UP to 220 firefighters were sacked by the State Government before the botched Wilsons Promontory fire, according to an expert report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Government officials scrambled unsuccessfully to rehire the seasonal firefighters when the Prom fire jumped containment lines and burnt 6000ha, it is alleged.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, compiled by independent bushfire specialist group Forest Fire Victoria on its own initiative to generate debate, reviewed the Alpine 2003 bushfires as well as the Wilsons Promontory fire.</p><p>Co-author Athol Hodgson, who boasts more than 50 years' fire experience and was the state's chief fire officer, believes cost-cutting prompted the sackings.</p><p>He said the number of seasonal firefighters dropped from 600 in mid-January to about 380 by the end of March.</p><p>\"And this happened when the DSE were engaged in a rather large autumn-prescribed burning, including Wilsons Promontory,\" Mr Hodgson said.</p><p>Natural resource expert Barrie Dexter, who helped compile the report, said the authors believed the DSE tried to rehire the firefighters when the weather became hotter and the Prom fire broke containment lines.</p><p>He said attempts to correct the \"serious shortfall\" in available firefighters failed.</p><p>Mr Dexter said it highlighted the lack of resources for fighting fires.</p><p>However, a spokesman for Environment Minister John Thwaites said the State Government had increased funding for firefighting by an extra $168 million in last year's budget.</p><p>He said this included 200 full-time fire specialists, with 90 already working.</p><p>\"In the past year the Government has almost doubled the amount of fuel-reduction burning that has taken place compared to previous years,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>The Hodgson-Dexter report said authorities did not effectively patrol the burn-off at the Prom before it got of control.</p><p>\"Parks Victoria and the DSE didn't learn any lessons from the Alpine fires,\" Mr Hodgson said. \"They didn't put enough resources on it quick enough.\"</p><p>The 76-page report, titled The Facts Behind the Fire, argued that the Government's initial response to the Alpine 2003 bushfires was a failure.</p><p>The review called for a radical overhaul of the Government's bushfire management, saying that bureaucrats in too many different departments had hindered firefighting.</p><p>Creating one authority to deal with management of forests and bushfires would be the best way forward, the authors argue.</p><p>This would include the dumping of Parks Victoria and VicForests in favour of a revamped DSE.</p><p>Mr Hodgson said Forest Fire Victoria decided to conduct the review following its concerns with the Esplin inquiry into the 2003 bushfires.</p><p>The report has been given to Mr Thwaites, Opposition Leader Robert Doyle and the Emergency Services Commissioner for the coming Wilsons Promontory inquiry.</p><p>Editorial, Page 20</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Wet periods in autumn, though, curbed hazard-reduction burning in NSW and Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The next four to six weeks are going to be very important,\" said Ben Shepherd, an inspector and head of media at the NSW Rural Fire Service.</p><p>\"Many of the agencies are looking for that opportunity to get out there and start those [hazard-reduction] burns again in earnest\" before conditions turn too windy and warm, he said.</p><p>Authorities stress significant rain could yet push fire risks for the coming season back towards more typical levels, but note there is little sign of such a development.</p><p>High-pressure systems have dominated southern Australia, nudging rain-bearing systems south of the continent.</p><p>Saturday offered a clear illustration of the set-up. The bureau predicted almost the entire mainland of Australia would be dry.</p><p>The skies have been clear with an unusually wide daily temperature range over many regions. Nights were marked by heavy frosts or cold making way for milder than average days.</p><p>Big dry</p><p>Barring some unexpected instability, July will join last month as among Australia's driest.</p><p>Nationally, last month was the second-driest June since standard data began in 1910 with rainfall barely a third of average, the Bureau of Meteorology said.</p><p>Victoria had its driest June, NSW was the driest in 15 years and the Murray Darling Basin posted its lowest rainfall totals since 1986. \"It very much seems to be centring on the border between Victoria and NSW,\" Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said of the rainfall deficits. Winter-to-date rainfall levels have been \"very much below average\" for most of southern Australia, bureau data shows.</p><p>Back foot</p><p>Fire authorities are keen to take advantage of the cool and dry conditions to ramp up controlled burns before windy and warmer days make such activities more risky.</p><p>Cyclone Debbie's aftermath brought heavy rain to much of the east coast in April, reducing opportunities for hazard-reduction burning. \"That really put us on the back foot,\" Mr Shepherd said. In a typical year about 56 per cent of controlled burns in NSW are conducted in autumn and 23 per cent in spring.</p><p>During autumn, the RFS treated 93,116 hectares to protect 23,171 properties. By area, the tally was less than half the previous autumn's 191,684 hectares involving 27,867 properties.</p><p>\"The wet winter and spring conditions proved difficult, however our prioritisation of burns based on risk has resulted in the statewide risk being maintained at 2015-16 levels,\" said Stephanie Rotarangi, of Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>Longer-term trends</p><p>The key influence behind this year's relatively dry winter is far to the south. A positive phase in the so-called Southern Annular Mode marks a poleward contraction of the westerly winds belt towards Antarctica.</p><p>As the bureau notes, such a phase marked the Millennium drought during the \"big dry\" from 1997-2010.

That method, however, is based only on weather, such as temperature, relative humidity and wind speed.</p><p>The variables included in the National Fire Danger Rating System Probabilistic Framework range from fuel load and its type, the nature of the terrain and the housing density in a particular region.</p><p>A prototypehas been tested in the Sydney region including the Blue Mountains. Further testing will continue in NSW this fire season, with the findings to date published by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.</p><p>\"You can have a region with a lower fire rating but have a particular location with a higher risk,\" Trent Penman, a bushfire behaviour specialist at the University of Melbourne, and another developer of the new model. \"For people in those properties to know they are at higher risk would be beneficial for their preparations.\"</p><p>Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC, said the existing fire danger rating system had been largely unchanged since the 1960s and a new fire danger rating system was a national priority \"underpinned by the best science available\".</p><p>The work is being coordinated by the federal Attorney-General's Department and involves state and territory emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, and several universities.</p><p>The new system could take two or three years before it is routine, and a key issue will be how the information is communicated to the public.</p><p>While avoiding confusion will be a challenge, the more specific warning may also result in greater involvement from residents.</p><p>\"With fire management, you want individuals to respond to what is a community problem,\" Professor Tolhurst said. - The Sydney Morning Herald.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BLUMOU-6n1mznbs5mo1cnvbimpb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BLUMOU2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBP-M761-JD34-V1H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385916</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"482\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Blue Mountains Gazette</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 11, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

The fire came suddenly. There was so much wind, we didn't realise how it happened,\" said Anna Kiriazova, 56, who survived with her husband by shutting themselves in their house instead of trying to run through the flames.</p><p>Ms Kiriazova said they doused their house in the Mati area near Rafina with water from a garden hose, and credited the fact that their window frames were metal instead of wood for their home being spared.</p><p>\"We shut ourselves in the house, we closed the shutters, we had towels over our faces,\" she said.</p><p>\"The inferno lasted about an hour. I have no words to describe what we lived through.\" Her 65-year-old husband, Theodoros Christopoulos, said the couple decided to take shelter in their home because the narrow roads outside were jammed with cars.</p><p>\"There was a great panic because the whole street was blocked by cars,\" Mr Christopoulos said.</p><p>\"Shouting, hysteria, they could see the fire was coming with the wind. It already smelled a lot, the sky was black overhead and in no time at all the fire was here.\" Hundreds of others abandoned cars and fled to nearby beaches, from where they were evacuated hours later by coast guard and private boats.</p><p>Dozens swam out to sea despite rough weather to escape the intense heat and choking smoke blanketing the area.</p><p>Some 26 men, women and children made it almost as far at the gated staircase leading down to the Greek coastline and the safety of water. In the end, they simply couldn't see it.</p><p>Greek authorities found a desperate huddle of bodies just a few steps away from the path to safety.</p><p>But the onrushing wall of smoke and flame at first blinded them, then choked them.</p><p>Their charred bodies, burnt-out cars, a few molten belongings - and the fire-blasted pine trees around them - are all that remains.</p><p>The charred bodies of the 26 people, including small children, were discovered at a villa at the seaside resort of Mati, 40km northeast of Athens, said rescuer Vassilis Andriopoulos.</p><p>They were huddled together in small groups, \"perhaps families, friends or strangers, entwined in a last attempt to protect themselves as they tried to reach the sea\", he said.</p><p>Elsewhere, bodies were recovered from the sea, where victims had fled in vain to escape the flames and smoke.</p><p>The intense wind had whipped fireballs into the sea itself.</p><p>Dozens of people were overtaken by the flames in their homes, on foot or in their cars. News photographers saw the burnt bodies of humans and dogs.</p><p>Out of a total 187 people hospitalised, 82 including almost a dozen children were still being treated, 10 of whom were in \"serious condition\", the fire services said.</p><p>According to the mayor of Marathon, Ilias Psinakis, about 3000 homes have been destroyed by the blaze at the seaside resorts of Mati and Rafina. One of them was his own.</p><p>Greece is in mourning with local mayor Rafinas-Pikermi telling media he expects the number of victims will 'be three digits'.</p><p>\"Today, Greece is in mourning,\" said Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who cut short a visit to Bosnia and announced three days of national mourning.</p><p>Greek media described the disaster as a \"national tragedy\".</p><p>The Government has not yet said how many people were regarded as missing. But the death toll is likely to surpass that from the blazes which hit Greece's southern island of Evia in 2007 in which 77 people perished.</p><p>It's believed no Australians have been hurt in the fires.A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman said the Australian Embassy in Athens had confirmed with local authorities no Australians have yet been reported injured or missing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-a8fba43a8f4411e8892ade9d9c4e7fb13e06ed49f7dae7389a7dce360bb5d21a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWD-4K31-F0JP-W3FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Hobart Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 26, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001151</classCode><className>MISSING PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000172</classCode><className>BEACHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFMY</classCode><className>ABANDONED VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX126</classCode><className>ATHENS, GREECE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC319</classCode><className>GREECE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They were formally recognised as a brigade in 2013.</p><p>During the course of their time together, members have worked loading fire-bombing aircraft at major blazes across NSW including last year's Stockinbingal fire, the Blue Mountains fires when they were based at Albion Park, the state forest fire at Scone in NSW, last summer's fires around Wagga and the 2012 fire between Jugiong and Yass.</p><p>The RFS Zone Management Team has supported and encouraged the brigade with equipment and a new headquarters, as has Cootamundra Shire Council.</p><p>It is miscellaneous items aimed at the welfare of volunteers and accounting equipment that is not typically funded by the RFS.

Coulter</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A draft development application for a woodchip export facility near Dover reveals there would be truck movements every five minutes between Judbury and Strathblane 10 hours a day, six days a week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In November, Southwood Fibre, which is part of the Neville-Smith Forest Products Group, announced plans for a $42 million woodchip export facility at Strathblane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That proposal has since raised <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-28/government-takes-neutral-stance-in-woodchip-mill-stoush/9806344\">concerns among some local community members and salmon giant Tassal</url>, which has a nearby lease.</p><p>Right to Information (RTI) documents obtained by the Tasmanian Greens showed a series of emails between Sustainable Timber Tasmania (STT, the state-owned forestry business) and Southwood Fibre, which Franklin MP Rosalie Woodruff said indicates \"active collusion\" between the State Government and the proponents.</p><p>The Greens also obtained the November version of a 500-page development application for the project, which has not yet been fully submitted to the Huon Valley Council for consideration.</p><p>The application revealed there would be an expected 13 truck movements per hour both ways between Strathblane and Judbury if the operation ran 10 hours a day, six days a week.</p><p>There would also be 800 additional truck movements per week delivering wood to Southwood for chipping.</p><p>The documents showed timber would initially come from plantations but would include wood residues in the medium term.</p><p>A new road would also be needed to avoid incursions into the World Heritage Area because the middle of Peak Rivulet Road, which would otherwise be the preferred route, is the border of the World Heritage Area.</p><p>An email within the correspondence sent to STT from a redacted email address said: \"we need a new road with a new name, it can be metres from the existing road if need be\".</p><p>Resources Minister Guy Barnett said the contents of the RTI obtained by the Greens included only correspondence between STT and Southwood Fibre that was necessary to provide landowner consent for the project.</p><p>\"This is just another kooky conspiracy theory cooked up by the Greens to try and remain relevant with their base,\" he said.</p><p>Questions over dealings around plantation forest 'fire sale'</p><p>Proponent James Neville-Smith also denied any connection between his project and Reliance Forest Fibre, which last September <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2017-09-15/tasmanian-61m-plantation-deal-with-global-forest-partners/8946988\">purchased state-owned plantation forests for the price of $60.7 million</url>.</p><p>ASIC documents showed Reliance Forest Fibre was established just two months before the purchase of the plantations and had a parent company in the Cayman Islands.</p><p>At the time, Labor branded the deal as a \"fire sale\" and the Greens named it a \"dud deal\" with both estimating the trees were worth millions more.</p><p>However, the RTI documents showed the general manager of Reliance Forest Fibre, whose name was redacted, was involved in email correspondence with STT about the Southwood Fibre woodchip export proposal as recently as late May, at one point inquiring how \"our new proposal\" for changes to the road network was going.</p><p>Southwood Fibre's James Neville Smith said the general manager of Reliance Forest Fibre was Danny Peet, a former employee of Neville Smith Forest Products who was finishing up business but had used his new email address.</p><p>Mr Peet remains listed as the general manager of Neville Smith Forest Products' SmartFibre, according to the SmartFibre website.</p><p>Mr Neville-Smith said neither he nor any associates nor any members of his family had had any financial interests in Reliance Forest Fibre or their forestry funds.</p><p>Ms Woodruff asked Premier Will Hodgman during Parliament whether the sale of the plantations to Reliance Forest Fibre included a deal that a southern export port would be established.</p><p>A government spokesman said the plantation sale was not based on the establishment of a southern port, and due process was followed during the sale.</p><p>Resources Minister Guy Barnett was also asked in budget estimates hearings last week whether harvesting of the plantations bought by Reliance Forest Fibre was reliant on a southern export solution, to which Mr Barnett responded it was a question for STT or Reliance Forest Fibre.</p><p>He was then asked whether the Government had suggested the Strathblane site to Neville Smith Forest Products but Mr Barnett said he would not go into personal details or commercial in confidence discussions.</p><p>Calls for transparency</p><p>The Wilderness Society said the leaked information demonstrated that the Government was \"well and truly involved\" with the woodchip mill proposal.</p><p>\"It begs the question exactly what conditions, exactly what assurances did Reliance Forest Fibre get from the Government when they bought this plantations about this dover woodchip port.\"</p><p>He is also concerned about the intentions to use native forests and the impact of increased truck traffic.</p><p>\"This proposal demonstrates that there are going to be hundreds of truck movements every day crossing the Huon Highway, 288 trucks a day will be crossing the Huon Highway 24/7,\" he said.</p><p>Far South Future Group, which is fighting the proposal, described the revelations as disturbing.</p><p>\"We call on Labor now to stand up to the Liberals on this, to not tolerate this lack of transparency and utter disregard for the community of Dover and far south Tasmania,\" said president Rachael Trueman.</p><p>\"The potential for job losses in the industries of aquaculture and tourism is enormous and the community is not being considered in this issue.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We will then see some further milder weather for the state as a whole and possibly some rain on Wednesday. But we can't afford to become complacent,\" he said.</p><p>\"Unless you've got a really, really good reason to be there - please just stay away from fire affected areas.\"</p><p>THANK YOU TO ALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES, YOU GUYS ROCK!!

On Sunday night, a wind change pushed the fire north and back on itself.</p><p>Other major fires burning in the state included a 17,000-hectare blaze in Licola, in the state's east, where embers and ash were blowing around the hamlet.</p><p>In Wilsons Promontory, south-east of Melbourne, 3000 people have been evacuated. The popular national park will be closed to campers for the upcoming Labour Day long weekend due to a growing bushfire in the hills.</p><p>Dozens of schools and childcare centres across the state's east were closed on Monday, with many due to remain shut on Tuesday.</p><p>Health alerts have also been issued, with smoke from the bushfires contributing to poor air quality in Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley. Air quality in Morwell South and Churchill was classified \"unhealthy for all groups\".</p><p>Both Mayor Graeme Moore and Andrew Clarke, owner of Jinks Creek Winery, said they believed the fire's ferocity was due to the government's failure to sufficiently backburn the Bunyip State Park.</p><p>Mr Clarke said he had been \"on the government's back for ages\" to burn nearby land. Cr Moore said state and federal planning overlays prevented the council from doing it themselves</p><p>A Forest Fire Management Victoria spokesman said the department was \"burning smarter, rather than focusing on a number of hectares target. In some areas, this may mean less planned burns - in other areas it may mean more\".</p><p>However, the organisation admitted that no planned burns had been done recently due to \"unfavourable weather conditions\".</p><p>Police confirmed the worst for teacher Elke Frank. Her family's 32-year-old home was destroyed by the Yinnar South blaze.</p><p>Ms Frank was able to grab a bag pre-packed with videos, photo albums and documents on her way out on Saturday night, but she didn't think it would be the last time she would see her house.</p><p>Later that night, Ms Frank's son saw photos on Facebook showing their home had been gutted.</p><p>\"It was a shock,\" Ms Frank said. \"It's just a pile of black rubble??? There's nothing there.\"</p><p>Police then called on Sunday afternoon confirming the loss.</p><p>Ms Frank said it was heartbreaking for her, her partner and her three children to lose decades' worth of memories and belongings.</p><p>\"My partner had more than 2000 books he'd collected. My son had just moved back so he had all this stuff. They're all devastated,\" she said.</p><p>\"We were always just hoping it wasn't going to happen.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> - With Sophie Aubrey</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520101399</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJR-K761-DY19-C501-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1038\"/><timeReceived>08:51 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Although the world's first crime fighter to don a figure-hugging body-suit came from Bengalla, (the fictitious African/Indian country not the coal mine) he was an instant planetary success. In Australia, The Phantom is the longest-running comic in publication. It is the only country where the 1996 movie adaptation was not a commercial flop.</p><p>Forty years after the original exhibition one of the artists from that show, Peter Kingston, has joined once more with local popular culture guru and fellow Phantom devotee Dietmar Lederwasch to bring together the work of over 50 artists for the ever-evolving The Phantom Show at the Newcastle Art Gallery. It is testimony to The Phantom's ongoing appeal to artists and public alike that there are now more than 200 pieces in this exhibition.</p><p>Local artists are major contributors to the project, including Michael Bell, Dallas Bray, Chris Capper, Dino Consalvo, James Drinkwater, Ron Hartree, Aleta Lederwasch, Dietmar Lederwasch, Claire Martin, John Morris, Lezlie Tilley, Peter Tilley, John Turier and Graham Wilson. They have applied their individual styles and approaches to create a complex, largely light-hearted and joyful exhibition of super-heroic adventure interlaced with snippets of domestic life, contemporary politics, erotica and re-assessment of the central character's position in a post-colonial world.</p><p>Hamilton's Gallery 139 and Acrux Gallery have combined to present Little, two wide-reaching exhibitions of small paintings, prints, ceramics, drawings, photographs and sculptural pieces from a large group of local artists at differing stages of their careers. Many young and emerging artists are represented, with their work hanging comfortably beside those of well-known artists such Vera Zulumovski, Edward Milan, Malcolm Sands, John Earle and Catherine Di Gravio. Despite the diminutive nature of the individual pieces these are two successful exhibitions where imaginative hanging gives every piece the space required to engage with the audience.</p><p>In Bennett Street, Hamilton, is Newcastle's newest commercial gallery, Studio 21. It is owned by artist and designer Maryanne Walmsley, who also has work in the Little show.

Although the world's first crime fighter to don a figure-hugging body-suit came from Bengalla, (the fictitious African/Indian country not the coal mine) he was an instant planetary success.

Many young and emerging artists are represented, with their work hanging comfortably beside those of well-known artists such Vera Zulumovski, Edward Milan, Malcolm Sands, John Earle and Catherine Di Gravio.

Although the world's first crime fighter to don a figure-hugging body-suit came from Bengalla, (the fictitious African/Indian country not the coal mine) he was an instant planetary success. In Australia, The Phantom is the longest-running comic in publication. It is the only country where the 1996 movie adaptation was not a commercial flop.</p><p>Forty years after the original exhibition one of the artists from that show, Peter Kingston, has joined once more with local popular culture guru and fellow Phantom devotee Dietmar Lederwasch to bring together the work of over 50 artists for the ever-evolving The Phantom Show at the Newcastle Art Gallery. It is testimony to The Phantom's ongoing appeal to artists and public alike that there are now more than 200 pieces in this exhibition.</p><p>Local artists are major contributors to the project, including Michael Bell, Dallas Bray, Chris Capper, Dino Consalvo, James Drinkwater, Ron Hartree, Aleta Lederwasch, Dietmar Lederwasch, Claire Martin, John Morris, Lezlie Tilley, Peter Tilley, John Turier and Graham Wilson. They have applied their individual styles and approaches to create a complex, largely light-hearted and joyful exhibition of super-heroic adventure interlaced with snippets of domestic life, contemporary politics, erotica and re-assessment of the central character's position in a post-colonial world.</p><p>Hamilton's Gallery 139 and Acrux Gallery have combined to present Little, two wide-reaching exhibitions of small paintings, prints, ceramics, drawings, photographs and sculptural pieces from a large group of local artists at differing stages of their careers. Many young and emerging artists are represented, with their work hanging comfortably beside those of well-known artists such Vera Zulumovski, Edward Milan, Malcolm Sands, John Earle and Catherine Di Gravio. Despite the diminutive nature of the individual pieces these are two successful exhibitions where imaginative hanging gives every piece the space required to engage with the audience.</p><p>In Bennett Street, Hamilton, is Newcastle's newest commercial gallery, Studio 21. It is owned by artist and designer Maryanne Walmsley, who also has work in the Little show. Her latest group exhibition Light/Weight introduces new artists to the local exhibition scene along with works from Gallery 139's owner Ahn Wells and Acrux director Nadia Aurisch. Such mutually supportive collaboration between independent galleries helps to energise the sector for the benefit of artists, collectors and the public by developing expanding networks and encouraging increased interaction with the broader community.</p><p>If you are visiting Sydney, head to Paddington and take in the exhibitions from two of Newcastle's most prolific and progressive painters.</p><p>In Sydney A-Bridged at Janet Clayton Gallery, Dino Consalvo breathes new life into familiar images, exploring the bridges that span the city's harbour and rivers from new perspectives, reducing the engineered landscape into boldly constructed, energetic paintings balanced by a calm and harmonious tonal palette.</p><p>Just around the corner, the window of the Olsen Gallery is ablaze with a massive forest fire from Peter Gardiner's exhibition Apotheosis.</p><p>But, inside, the heat becomes an inferno of Dante proportions as the whole world burns.

in the Murray Sunset National Park.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blaze was spotted by crews about 6:30pm (AEDT) last night and was quickly controlled using firefighting aircraft.</p><p>The Department of Sustainability and Environment's (DSE) Nathan Christian says the fire was one of several sparked by this week's lighting strikes.</p><p>He says crews will continue to check to see whether any more fires are active in the region.</p><p>\"We're hoping with these fires that we've got today, we're hoping to declare safe in preparation for tomorrow's weather,\" he said.</p><p>\"Tomorrow's weather [for] the Mallee, if not extreme, it'll be at the upper level of the severe fire danger rating.\"</p><p>Authorities says they will continue with reconnaissance flights in the Wimmera and Mallee today to see whether this week's lightning strikes have started any more fires.</p><p>The weather bureau predicts temperatures will be in the low to mid 40s before a cool change reaches the region on Friday.</p><p>The DSE's Lee Gleeson says firefighters are preparing for hot conditions forecast for tomorrow.</p><p>\"The conditions across especially the northern parts of the northern Wimmera are in the severe range which is [a] forest fire danger of over 50,\" he said.</p><p>\"So that says to us that any fire that does start may be difficult to contain, especially in the earlier stages, so we'll be looking at a very quick attack on any outbreak of fire.</p><p>\"After lunch in the heat of the day, we'll put a flight up out of Horsham.</p><p>\"It will transverse across the district, especially the northern end around the Little Desert and the West Wimmera, to see if lightning strikes from Monday have created a fire and if there are, we'll be on them quickly.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Last week, Mr Oo found out has been accepted as a forest fire officer trainee with the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He is the first to do this in Bendigo's Karen community.</p><p>Mr Oo came to Bendigo four years ago aged 13, with his parents, two sisters and brother. Before this he had only ever known life in a refugee camp.</p><p>When he came to Australia, Mr Oo had only ever known life in a refugee camp. He was born in the Thai camp, where his parents had lived for about 20 years after fleeing violence in Myanmar.</p><p>Initially, life in Australia was tough. Mr Oo spoke little English, and had left behind many good friends in the camp.</p><p>However, during his four years in Australia he has been able to learn English, make friends, and settle into school life.</p><p>Having recently finished year 12 at Weeroona College, Mr Oo is now studying at Bendigo Tafe.</p><p>\"Sometimes I miss some of my friends when I first came here to Australia, but now it's ok,\" Mr Oo said.</p><p>\"I like to be in Australia because we have more freedom here, but if we stay in refugee camp, we don't have the opportunity to get more education.\"</p><p>Karen people originate from the Kayin state in Myanmar, formerly Burma. The people group is ethnically diverse, and does not share a common language culture or religion.</p><p>Many have been forced to flee in the face of violence from a military state.</p><p>The first Karen people came to Bendigo in 2007.</p><p>By 2015, there were at least 1,000 Karen people living in Bendigo.</p><p>Now, settlement service caseworker Nay Chee Aung estimates there are at least 2,000 people in the city's Karen community.</p><p>His job with the Bendigo Community Health Service is to work with people who have recently come to Australia, doing casework, running a youth group and connecting people to services.</p><p>He began work with the service as a volunteer, seeking to better connect his community with services.</p><p>Bendigo is a fantastic place for refugees to settle, according to Mr Aung.</p><p>\"Bendigo is very welcoming,\" Mr Aung said.</p><p>\"Bendigo does a great job for new families. People are constantly working on it to make it more welcoming, so I know that there's a lot of volunteers out there who support a family with their own time, with their own resource, to make them feel more welcome.\"</p><p>Starting conversations is the aim of organisers at Bendigo's Refugee Week.</p><p>From multicultural storytime to school debates, 10 events will take place from June 17-23.</p><p>Christine Cummins, conveyor of Bendigo's Rural Australians for Refugees group is hoping the week will be a chance to promote harmony and inclusivity in the community.</p><p>\"The purpose of the week is to really highlight the benefit of refugee settlement,\" she said.</p><p>\"We have people from many different cultures that have settled in Bendigo and are continuing to settle in Bendigo, and they bring with them a wealth of wonderful knowledge and skills.\"</p><p>This year RAR has teamed up with other refugee advocacy and support groups to run its biggest program yet.</p><p>\"It's really about trying to focus on getting people on board to recognise that people are people no matter where you come from,\" Ms Cummins said.</p><p>\"Horrible things can happen to anyone, that hardship can be bombing, it can be any sort of persecution that makes people need to flee.</p><p>\"When people have been forced to flee their homeland, they have really gone through a huge upheaval.\"</p><p>Refugee Week is important for communities like the Karen people, as a chance to honour their experience, Mr Aung said.</p><p>\"We have many people who live in Bendigo who are of refugee backgrounds, and to celebrate something unique and important,\" Mr Aung said.</p><p>\"It's not something to be ashamed of.

The vineyards of Griffith passed in a blur. He stopped at Victoria's Twelve Apostles, but took a few photos and left.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was not what he had planned, but as a monster heatwave baked a crust onto southern Australia, \"it was not possible to be outside at all\". \"I couldn't do anything, I was basically just in the car all the time,\" Stantic recalls.</p><p>\"When I was planning the trip, Uluru was supposed to be 36 degrees. But when I got to Adelaide the weather prediction said it would be 46 degrees there ... I like warm weather but I thought 'this is extreme'.\"</p><p>Unhappy road trippers were not the only ones whose plans were disrupted by freakishly hot weather this summer. Sun melted a coastal highway in northern NSW. Victoria's coal generators shut down. Tasmania burned. And rotting fish lined the Darling River at Menindee.</p><p>The record-smashing temperatures have made it very clear: Summer has changed, and so must we.</p><p>\"Climate change is putting stress on all our communities,\" says Sheila Nguyen, executive director of the Sports Environment Alliance. \"We have to make decisions for the present and ... decisions for the future.\"</p><p>Western Sydney University researchers investigated the effect of high temperatures on city-dwellers. Their findings suggest summers are increasingly being lived indoors, in airconditioning - a trend that is making people more isolated and lonely.</p><p>\"[On hot days] people would, if they had airconditioning at home, turn that on and stay within the home or get into an airconditioned car to go to an airconditioned shopping centre or cinema or other space,\" senior researcher Dr Louise Crabtree says.</p><p>Extreme heat can be crippling for those who can't cool their homes, such as people on low incomes.</p><p>\"People in social housing can't put in an airconditioning unit or install a ceiling fan. They would literally lie on the floor in the coolest part of the house and not move for hours,\" Crabtree says.</p><p>Blast-furnace ambient temperatures also turn people off exercise. \"If it's just too hot and a walk to the bus stop is too far and the bus stop has no shade, people will stop walking,\" Crabtree says.</p><p>Researchers are also concerned about the \"mental health effects of feeling trapped in your house and unable to do anything about it\".</p><p>The study suggested finding ways to cool outdoor urban spaces to draw people out of their homes, such as creating community gardens, as well as improving the accessibility of public infrastructure such as libraries, swimming pools and community centres.</p><p>A heavy reliance on airconditioners can also cause problems when the power bill arrives.</p><p>When Adelaide hit 46 degrees last month, making it the hottest capital city on record, pensioner Ann Petersen had to run her airconditioner day and night.</p><p>\"It worries me because this is going to cost me a huge bill which I haven't budgeted for. And I know a lot of other people are going to be in exactly the same boat,\" the 71-year-old says.</p><p>Petersen, who manages a number of severe health conditions, found it extremely difficult to cope.</p><p>\"I went out once to [get] the mail and I thought 'I'm going to pass out',\" she says.</p><p>In a submission to a Senate inquiry last year, the Australian Medical Association said heatwaves kill more people than any other type of natural disaster. The elderly and the ill are especially vulnerable - a problem compounded by the ageing population.</p><p>The association cited \"significant concerns\" over the preparedness of the healthcare system to withstand the challenges of more frequent and severe extreme weather events.</p><p>Heatwaves cause a spike in ambulance callouts, hospital admissions and GP visits. A GP working in Sydney's west recounted a week in which she treated a warehouse worker who felt unwell after working in 40-degree temperatures, elderly patients with heat exhaustion from taking public transport and a patient with multiple sclerosis experiencing fatigue and difficulty walking.</p><p>Even the fittest among us are being forced to adapt to blistering temperatures. The Climate Council has warned extreme weather events threaten the viability of Australian sport as it is now played - from the elite level down to backyard cricket.</p><p>Heat affecting players and spectators at the Australian Open has become a perennial issue, and the opening stages of January's Tour Down Under cycling event were shortened amid predictions of temperatures above 40 degrees.</p><p>\"We are restricted [as] to when we can play, when we can ride our bike, when we can go and play beach cricket,\" Nguyen says.</p><p>\"All these things are changing the dynamic of the culture of sport, how we consume it and interact with it.\"</p><p>When summer gets unbearable, some might consider getting out of town. But Griffith University tourism expert Susanne Becken says extreme weather will change the way we holiday.</p><p>People will increasingly travel to beaches, lakes and swimming holes, or seek out the cooler temperatures of mountains and hinterlands. Traffic congestion in these places will increase, and emergency services can be stretched if, say, a bushfire arrives and thousands of people need to be evacuated.</p><p>Meantime, \"people will avoid the hot places\", Becken says. These include outback and regional areas where governments are investing in tourism infrastructure, she says, adding global warming was \"in some ways undermining our economic development policies\".</p><p>Storms, hail, smoke from bushfires and other extreme weather can disrupt flights, throwing holiday schedules into disarray.</p><p>And the pernicious effects of climate change can badly damage tourist attractions.</p><p>\"The coral bleaching [on the Great Barrier Reef] is the most obvious. But also a forest fire in Tasmania - if the landscape is not as scenic or what you wanted to see is not there any more, that's obviously a longer-term problem,\" Becken says.</p><p>Bela Stantic has not given up on his road trip dreams. He wants to see the underground town of Coober Pedy and spend a New Year's Eve at Uluru. But in future he'll do it a little differently.</p><p>\"Summer was not a good time to travel anywhere,\" he says. \"Next time I'll do it in July.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7402eyd2fgp1f0scdi5q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD0-P0Y1-F0J6-J0JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1037\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

A <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/hennessykj_2005b.pdf\">2005 study</url> had already predicted an increase in fire weather risk throughout most of southeastern Australia over the coming decades, with \"very high\" and \"extreme\" fire danger ratings likely to increase in frequency by 4-25% by 2020 and 15-70% by 2050.</p><p>There has been more research in this area, although certainly not enough, given the huge stakes. A <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climateinstitute.org.au/verve/_resources/fullreportbushfire.pdf\">2007 report</url> for the Climate Institute of Australia predicted increases in annual average fire danger of up to 30% by 2050, and a potential trebling in the number of days per year where the uppermost values of the index are exceeded.

Bushfires are a major risk to these water supplies - particularly in the catchments of major dams such as the Thomson. </p><p>A bushfire followed by a downpour that washes ash into the dam could potentially force the closure of the trillion-litre capacity Thomson reservoir, making it unusable for months. Firefighters have been battling exactly this kind of blaze at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-01/thomson-dam-fire-threaten-melbourne-water-supply-desalination/10770718\">Mount Baw Baw</url> in recent days and at the time of writing the situation has improved.</p><p>Major bushfires often occur in time of severe drought. Black Saturday itself happened towards the end of the 15-year <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.water.vic.gov.au/climate-change/millennium-drought-report\">Millennium Drought</url>, when Victoria's water supplies were already strained. I remember vividly the then chief executive of the Melbourne Water Corporation urging the government to deal with any fire in the Thomson Dam catchment immediately, given the threat to Melbourne's water.</p><p>Fortunately, amid the devastation of Black Saturday we avoided major disruption to our water supplies. But this risk poses a huge challenge to both firefighters and policy-makers. The rule is that protection of human life is ranked above assets and infrastructure, and rightly so. But when there is a clear and present danger of towns and cities going without water, it's also true that safeguarding water means saving human lives in the ensuing days. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The bitter lesson of the Californian fires</emphasis></p><p>Any way you look at it, these are hard questions.

Bushfires are a major risk to these water supplies - particularly in the catchments of major dams such as the Thomson. </p><p>A bushfire followed by a downpour that washes ash into the dam could potentially force the closure of the trillion-litre capacity Thomson reservoir, making it unusable for months. Firefighters have been battling exactly this kind of blaze at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-01/thomson-dam-fire-threaten-melbourne-water-supply-desalination/10770718\">Mount Baw Baw</url> in recent days and at the time of writing the situation has improved.</p><p>Major bushfires often occur in time of severe drought. Black Saturday itself happened towards the end of the 15-year <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.water.vic.gov.au/climate-change/millennium-drought-report\">Millennium Drought</url>, when Victoria's water supplies were already strained. I remember vividly the then chief executive of the Melbourne Water Corporation urging the government to deal with any fire in the Thomson Dam catchment immediately, given the threat to Melbourne's water.</p><p>Fortunately, amid the devastation of Black Saturday we avoided major disruption to our water supplies. But this risk poses a huge challenge to both firefighters and policy-makers. The rule is that protection of human life is ranked above assets and infrastructure, and rightly so. But when there is a clear and present danger of towns and cities going without water, it's also true that safeguarding water means saving human lives in the ensuing days. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The bitter lesson of the Californian fires</emphasis></p><p>Any way you look at it, these are hard questions.

Also, the home-grown variety were dry-roasted and only lightly salted.</p><p>She forgot to add, they're also pretty yummy.</p><p>***</p><p>We feel we may have heard this one before, but urban myth or not, it's still a beauty ...</p><p>It seems fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burnt-out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wetsuit, complete with a dive tank, flippers, and face mask.</p><p>A post-mortem examination revealed that the person died not from burns but from massive internal injuries.</p><p>Dental records provided a positive identification and investigators then set about determining how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire.</p><p>They found that, on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast about 30km away from the forest.</p><p>The firefighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large buckets. The buckets were dropped into the ocean for rapid filling, then flown to the forest fire and emptied.</p><p>You guessed it.

The Country Fire Authority's chief officer Euan Ferguson visited Bendigo yesterday and announced the municipality's fire danger period start date alongside operations officer Mark Gilmore. Mr Ferguson offered a blunt assessment of the city's fire risk and said people only needed to think back to Black Saturday to remember the consequences of fire. He said he feared complacency was engulfing the community ahead of the year's fire risk period. </p><p>\"We are concerned about complacency and I am being kind when I say complacency,\" he told the Bendigo Advertiser. \"I think people are just apathetic. We have got excellent tools with the bushfire survival plan, but only about a quarter of people have filled out these forms. \"That means 75 per cent are just not making use of the tools available.\" The City of Greater Bendigo will enter its fire danger period at 1am on December 5. The region has an above-average risk of grassfire this year but Mr Gilmore said the risk of forest fire was ever present. He urged people to put their angle grinders away until next year, with sparks from the equipment notorious for starting fires. \"We are telling people to kiss their angle grinder goodbye and put it away until autumn,\" he said. \"And don't let your lawnmower sun bake | only use it until 10am.\" During fire danger periods, there is a general prohibition on lighting fires unless a permit has been issued or, subject to conditions, the fire is for warmth or cooking.

Those moments can be intimate - a poo inspection, a mother dinosaur protecting her young - or something seismic - an erupting volcano, a forest fire, the formation of an ocean.</p><p>Huxley - the show's Indiana Jones-style narrator - is even on hand to observe continents splitting apart and massive comets hitting Earth.</p><p>\"You can't really enter this world,\" he explains. \"You need to run that fine line between focusing the audience's attention on these amazing creatures that are happening but never actually touching a dinosaur.\" Lanky actor Bruce Spence originated the role of Huxley when Walking With Dinosaurs stomped through Australian cities in 2007. Blackman signed on in 2011, when the show returned here, and has just completed a huge North American tour. This actor from Fitzroy has a long list of TV credits (most recently House Husbands, Dr Blake Mysteries and Underbelly: Squizzy).</p><p>But Blackman's long involvement with the Complete Works Theatre Company, a theatre-in-education outfit based at Abbotsford Convent, makes him especially suited to the \"infotainment\" demands of Walking With Dinosaurs.</p><p>\"Huxley is the conduit, the link for the audience to this lost world,\" he explains. Blackman comes well armed with facts and figures but the narrative is leavened with comic asides.</p><p>\"I do think of people like David Attenborough and the late Steve Irwin,\" he says. \"Great communicators, both of them. Huxley, like them, is an expert who loves what he does. And my feeling is, if I'm excited by what's happening on stage, then the audience will suspend their disbelief.\" When the journey ends, in a cataclysmic blaze of sound and light, Huxley is still standing ... and taking his bow with a baby T-Rex.</p><p>\"Yeah, it's a bit of showbiz,\" he says. \"We take the work very seriously but we don't take ourselves too seriously.\"Walking With Dinosaurs The Arena Spectacular runs at Hisense Arena from March 25-29.

The conditions there are extremely dry and extremely unfavourable at times.\"</p><p>He joined the RFS in the early 1990s, at a time when Canberra had acres of pine plantations to its west and the Brindabellas could be mistaken for parts of British Columbia after heavy snow falls.</p><p>\u201cI joined because I just wanted to find something interesting and challenging and to develop new skills,\" Mr Pennock said. \u201cYou're giving back to the community and I've seen some extremely interesting things.</p><p>\u201cSome fires - although horrific - out in open mountain ranges are incredibly beautiful. I probably shouldn't say beautiful but they are just awe inspiring at night.\"</p><p>As the sun went down last week the fires reminded him of the scenes around Canberra more than 10 years earlier. It was then that fires wiped out the pine forests and destroyed hundreds of homes.</p><p>\u201cYou get to see things that not everyone gets to see,\" Mr Pennock said.</p><p>Volunteering remains a passion for him. And there are no plans to pull the pin on a job that has given him so many powerful experiences - both good and bad.</p><p>These include witnessing devastation to people and property, working with highly professional colleagues flying helicopters and operating heavy machinery in dangerous situations and witnessing extraordinary firestorms at night.</p><p>\u201cIt is just something that I do,\" he said.</p><p>\u201cEverybody has different interests in their life.</p><p>I'm very well supported by my work and I think they see the value of volunteering.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRAUS-53524161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRAUS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BCN-6MC1-JCBD-909B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">290073</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Chronicle (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 28, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We are a group of professional forest practitioners and scientists formed after the disastrous 2002-03 Victorian bushfires. We don't argue cases for or against any particular use of forests for logging, grazing, parks or wilderness.</p><p>Forest Fire Vic is interested only in vastly improving fire management, regardless of what the forest is used for. We totally disagree with the contention that active management equates with a more fire-prone forest.</p><p>McFadzean relies on emotive and incorrect statements.</p><p>\"Controlled burning can reduce fire hazard around towns and urban centres, but may also create a fire time bomb in the bush.\"</p><p>If controlled burning can reduce fire hazard in one place, it can do so elsewhere. Years of experience and research have shown that hazard reduction by burning makes firefighting safer and easier.</p><p>There is no evidence anywhere to support the contention that it creates a \"time bomb in the bush\".</p><p>\"We need to remember that (national parks) are huge carbon sinks.\"</p><p>Forests, not national parks, are carbon sinks, and only then if they are actively growing. Some Victorian forests are huge carbon sources. There will be a permanent loss of carbon to the atmosphere if these forests are not regenerated.</p><p>\"Their (forest ecosystems) response to regular hazard reduction burns is for fire-tolerant plants to take over from fire resistant plants . . .\"</p><p>McFadzean does not explain the difference between a fire-tolerant plant and a fire-resistant plant. His implication is that fire-tolerant plants are more flammable and make the countryside more fire prone. All credible scientific evidence is that as fuels age after burning and build up to large quantities of litter, they become more hazardous - even after the pioneering plants have died out.</p><p>\"Management burns are routinely made in most parks.\"</p><p>Not so, according to figures published in successive reports by the Auditor-General, the Esplin report into the 2003 bushfires, and Department of Sustainability and Environment reports. These all show the abject failure of Parks Victoria and DSE to achieve annual burning programs in any year, spanning two decades.</p><p>McFadzean cites the Esplin report on the 2002-2003 Victorian bushfires to argue that there are only about 10 days a year when conditions are right for prescribed burning. That argument comes from a desktop study done in the 1960s by Dr Malcolm Gill, who has no practical experience in prescribed burning and was co-author of the Esplin report.</p><p>It used Melbourne weather data and the ridiculous notion that prescribed burning could not be done at weekends, on public holidays and during the summer fire season.</p><p>DSE debunked that notion and now finds more days to do prescribed burning than it is able to take advantage of.</p><p>The real reasons DSE has not achieved its burning programs were identified after the fire in Wilsons Promontory National Park in 2005, in a second Esplin report.</p><p>Systemic and cultural shortcomings and the separation of entities such as Parks Victoria and VicForests from DSE disrupted the management of firefighting resources.</p><p>In short, DSE is dysfunctional and, with too few permanent staff accredited for fire-line work, is neither able to achieve its burning programs nor aggressively attack multiple fires in their incipient stages successfully.</p><p>Until someone sorts out the mess and makes the system work better, wilderness, national park and other forest values are doomed to degradation.</p><p>McFadzean also seems to know very little about the geography of Canberra or the fire that caused deaths and damage in 2003.</p><p>\"The Canberra suburbs of Duffy and Curtin, which were razed in 2003, were surrounded by pine plantations and grasslands. Pine plantations are managed forests with plenty of roads and easy access, yet these forests created a firestorm\".</p><p>The suburbs were not surrounded by plantations and grasslands but had sections with plantations, nature park and pasture on their western boundary.</p><p>A forensic analysis of the fire shows that the intensity of fires burning in the Namadgi and Brindabella national parks was so high that it created a tornado that carried fire 14 kilometres across eaten-out pasture and plantation alike, and the damage to the suburban houses was just as high where they were next to eaten-out pasture as where they were close to the plantation.</p><p>Victorians continue to pay too high a price for bushfires.</p><p>For what result? Built assets lost when bushfires burn with the wind and saved when the fires burn downhill or against the wind, water yields nearly halved for decades, millions of birds and mammals dead, forest diversity reduced and forests reduced from carbon sinks to carbon sources.</p><p>Melbourne Water is showing the way by recognising the importance of early detection and rapid, aggressive deployment of its highly skilled initial attack crews in protecting Melbourne's catchments.</p><p>Athol Hodgson is president of Forest Fire Victoria Inc, and a former chief fire officer of Victoria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5cz2ij447yo1fbmp6ogd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P3V-PV60-TXN5-S2XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>January 8, 2007 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents and Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accidents and Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Prevention</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;
