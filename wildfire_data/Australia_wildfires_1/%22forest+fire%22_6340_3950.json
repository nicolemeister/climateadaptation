I grew up in a small town. We had army recruiters there the whole time,\" says Miles Teller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His new movie, War Dogs, is screening on army and navy bases the week before general release, and he's a little nervous about how it will be received.</p><p>\"My homeboy's a Navy Seal. He's deploying tomorrow and he was like, 'Looking forward to that new film',\" Teller says. His friend may be surprised to discover the film isn't about war at all.</p><p>The script is based on a Rolling Stone article about two stoner kids from Miami who somehow scored a $300 million contract to arm the Afghan military.</p><p>Teller plays David Packouz, a massage therapist trying to make a buck selling sheets to retirement homes, who is recruited into the infinitely more profitable arms business by his best friend from high school, Efraim Diveroli.</p><p>Jonah Hill's Diveroli is utterly amoral: a cocaine-sniffing, Porsche-driving, money-hungry sociopath with a gift for telling people what they want to hear. Before he can legally drink a beer, he has mastered fbo.gov - the website where contracts with the US military are offered for tender.</p><p>By undercutting the competition, Packouz and Diveroli won a contract for more than 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition and millions of rocket-propelled grenades that they were drastically unprepared to fulfil.</p><p>As one might expect from director Todd Phillips, most famous for the Hangover franchise, War Dogs plays this absurd situation for laughs, but Teller insists the film never forgets what the guns will be used for.</p><p>\"When you're talking about arms dealing during a war, there's a certain seriousness, a certain gravity that will come with that material,\" he says.</p><p>The closest Teller has come to being in the military was in his breakthrough film Whiplash, in which he played a young drummer under the tutelage of J.K. Simmons' fanatical instructor, a more punishing sergeant-major than any in the Marines.</p><p>Teller played drums in his church choir and a teenage band, the Mutes, but he practised for the role until his fingers bled.</p><p>Whiplash won the Grand Jury prize and the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. \"I want to be talked about the way people talk about Hoffman and De Niro and Pacino,\" he told Rolling Stone.</p><p>Naturally, he was soon offered a superhero franchise: Fantastic Four. Predictably, it stalled his career after it failed at the box office.</p><p>War Dogs is part one of a four-film comeback year. In Bleed for This, he plays boxing world champion Vinny Pazienza, who returned to the ring after a near-fatal car crash. As a young actor, Teller was sometimes told the scars on his face, the result of a road crash, disqualified him from roles, but for this they make sense.</p><p>He is now filming Granite Mountain, about a crew of Arizona firefighters overwhelmed by a rapidly spreading forest fire. Finally, in Thank You for Your Service, Teller plays a US soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>War Dogs is about the price of war, and the vast fortunes to be made far from the battlefield: Thank You for Your Service is about the cost, particularly the emotional toll on the families of servicemen.</p><p>Teller knows that his friend in the Navy Seals will be entertained by War Dogs (and that he's likely to share its cynical view of profiteering. Playing a wounded warrior was an altogether more daunting challenge. \"I was so nervous about that. I didn't want to act like I'd been to war. That's such a sacred experience,\" Teller says. \"I'm sure he'll have some more opinions when I'm playing a soldier.\"</p><p>War Dogs</p><p>Genre Comedy</p><p>Buzz Early reviews are positive, with praise for its \"unique twist on war movies\"</p><p>Director Todd Phillips</p><p>Stars Miles Teller, Jonah Hill,</p><p>Bradley Cooper, Ana de Armas Released Out now, rated M</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS: Miles Teller (left) in War Dogs and with Jonah Hill (above).</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-6r31ehy68yo1ckudh4yy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KGT-52R1-JD34-V30C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>August 19, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001177</classCode><className>MOVIE REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CO</classCode><className>NAVIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp;

I grew up in a small town. We had army recruiters there the whole time,\" says Miles Teller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His new movie, War Dogs, is screening on army and navy bases the week before general release, and he's a little nervous about how it will be received.</p><p>\"My homeboy's a Navy Seal. He's deploying tomorrow and he was like, 'Looking forward to that new film,\"' Teller says. His friend may be surprised to discover the film isn't about war at all.</p><p>The script is based on a Rolling Stone article about two stoner kids from Miami who somehow scored a $300 million contract to arm the Afghan military.</p><p>Teller plays David Packouz, a massage therapist trying to make a buck selling sheets to retirement homes who is recruited into the infinitely more profitable arms business by his best friend from high school, Efraim Diveroli.</p><p>Jonah Hill's Diveroli is flamboyant and utterly amoral: a cocaine-sniffing, Porsche-driving, money-hungry sociopath with a gift for telling people what they want to hear. Before he can legally drink a beer, he has mastered fbo.gov - the website where contracts with the US military are offered for tender.</p><p>\"Me and my friends did some hustles to try and make some extra money but it was never on that kind of scale,\" says Teller.</p><p>By undercutting the competition, Packouz and Diveroli won a contract for more than 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition and millions of rocket-propelled grenades that they were drastically unprepared to fulfil.</p><p>As one might expect from director Todd Phillips, most famous for the Hangover franchise, War Dogs plays this absurd situation for laughs, but Teller insists the film never forgets what the guns will be used for.</p><p>\"When you're talking about arms dealing during a war, there's a certain seriousness, a certain gravity that will come with that material,\" he says.</p><p>The closest Teller has come to being in the military was in his breakthrough film Whiplash, in which he played a young drummer under the tutelage of J.K. Simmons' fanatical instructor, a more punishing Sergeant Major than any in the Marines.</p><p>Teller played drums in his church choir and a teenage band, the Mutes, but he practised for the role until his fingers bled.</p><p>Whiplash won the Grand Jury prize and the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. \"I want to be talked about the way people talk about Hoffman and De Niro and Pacino,\" he told Rolling Stone.</p><p>Naturally, he was soon offered a superhero franchise: Fantastic Four. Predictably, it stalled his career. Teller played the team's leader Mister Fantastic, but couldn't save the movie from lacklustre box office and scathing reviews.</p><p>War Dogs is part one of a four film comeback year. In Bleed for This, he plays boxing world champion Vinny Pazienza, who returned to the ring after a near-fatal car crash. As a young actor, he was sometimes told that the scars on his face, sustained in a serious road accident, disqualified him from the role, but for this part they make sense. It also can't hurt that he resembles a young Stallone.</p><p>He is now filming Granite Mountain, about a crew of Arizona firefighters overwhelmed by a rapidly spreading forest fire. Finally, in Thank You for Your Service, Teller plays an American soldier returning home with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>Teller knows that his friend in the Navy Seals will be entertained by War Dogs. Playing a wounded warrior was an altogether more daunting challenge.</p><p>\"I was so nervous about that. I didn't want to act like I'd been to war.\"</p><p>War Dogs is is out now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Miles Teller (left) and Jonah Hill in a scene from War Dogs.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-6r31j4pcij4ww6364yy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KGT-2BC1-JD34-V2B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>August 19, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XZ6</classCode><className>CONTRACT AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000461</classCode><className>DEFENSE CONTRACTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001137</classCode><className>MILITARY RECRUITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CO</classCode><className>NAVIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp;

Given hotter conditions in Parkerville, the index there peaks at between 50 and 60.</p><p>10.42am: The Grassland Fire Danger Index (GFDI), averaged over one hour, peaks at 30 in Bickley. It rises to 30-40 in Parkerville.</p><p>10.58am: The Parkerville-Stoneville fire starts after a power pole on a Granite Road property falls, igniting grass.</p><p>11.06am: Mundaring appliances mobilised. By the time the first firefighting crews arrive from Parkerville and Kiara, which were in Darlington at the time of the incident, the fire has spread and is running and spotting to a bridle path next to the creek line on Riley Road. Due to high fuel loads along the creek line, the fires intensity increases dramatically.</p><p>11.11am: DFES mobilises two aircraft and two Helitacs to the fire.</p><p>11.16am: The DFES Communication Centre pages additional resources and these crews begin to arrive.</p><p>11.20am: In the first 60 to 90 minutes, a combination of high fuel loads and the heat make the blaze difficult to control, even though significant ground and aerial resources are deployed.</p><p>11.42am Police requested to close Riley Road between Kintore and Lacy roads in Parkerville.</p><p>11.56am: Emergency Alert message issued to 8186 mobile SMS services and 1113 fixed line voice messaging services.</p><p>12pm: Air support is boosted by the addition of an Air-Crane helicopter. The deployment of aircraft is enhanced, with all available aircraft at the site. The 16 aircraft involved in aerial fire suppression operations make it the most dangerous undertaken in WAs history. Equipment deployed includes an aerial intelligence helicopter, three air attack supervisor helicopters, one air attack supervisor fixed-wing aircraft, six Helitacs, one Air-Crane and four fixed-wing air tankers.</p><p>12.59pm: Ambulance staff say that a person has fallen through the roof of a Stoneville house. Later pronounced dead in hospital.</p><p>1.15pm: Property losses first reported to the Incident Controller in Stoneville Road.</p><p>1.38pm: Property losses on Riley Road confirmed. Following concerted efforts by aircraft, the head of the fire is slowed but, with a change in wind direction to the south-west and an increase in the slope topography, the fires intensity increases again.</p><p>1.15pm-3.15pm: Considerable property losses occur as the fire travels into Stoneville. Ground crews employ both offensive and defensive firefighting strategies in an effort to minimise losses. The fire line intensities calculated indicated the head fire cannot be directly attacked until after 8pm. The forecast rate of spread is about 400m per hour. Under these conditions, only very well prepared and actively defended houses can be saved.</p><p>5pm: Community meeting convened at Mundaring Recreation Centre.</p><p>5.30pm: Situation report identifies 37 properties destroyed.</p><p>8pm: As weather conditions became more favourable in the early evening and, with the use of ground crews, aerial suppression aircraft and earth moving machinery, the fire is contained.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLGZ-CHG-20140620-005-105011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLGZ2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CG9-0VP1-F0JP-W2C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319010</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hills Gazette (Perth, Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 20, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

A second heat burst set records in some northern parts of the state that had only been set a few days earlier.</p><p>\"Hot, dry northerly winds ahead of [a] trough and cold front contributed to New South Wales, southern Queensland, and areas in neighbouring States experiencing unprecedented hot weather for this time of the year,\" the bureau said in its report.</p><p>While associated with large high pressure systems, the bureau noted global warming had pushed up background temperatures by about a degree over the past century for Australia and the planet as a whole, making the occurrence of such extreme events more likely.</p><p>\"Studies undertaken by the Bureau and other scientific institutions have shown that climate change has contributed to the severity and frequency of recent heat events, including spring warmth,\" it said.</p><p>The special report comes a day after new research showed Australian cities such as Melbourne and Sydney need to prepare for summer days when the temperature climbs to 50 degrees in decades to come - even if nations kept to Paris climate pledges to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees.</p><h>Big dry impact</h><p>The bureau's report also noted that unusually dry conditions contributed to the recent abnormal heat. </p><p>Both Sydney and NSW, for instance, posted their driest Septembers on record last month. Statewide, rainfall was just one-seventh of the usual amount for the month, extending a worsening dry spell that has lasted about three months.</p><p>Sydney, meanwhile, is on track to break the record for the most days in a row with less than 2 millimetres of rain.</p><p>The current record, spanning August-October 1989, stands at 64 days, a record likely to be match on Saturday and broken on Sunday, if current forecasts are correct, Blair Trewin, the bureau's senior climatologist, said.</p><h>Hot times</h><p>The recent significant heat emerged on September 21, with almost all the country recording above-average temperatures, the bureau said.</p><p>Australia as a whole recorded its warmest September day on record the following day, with a mean maximum temperature on 33.47 degrees. That was more than 6 degrees warmer than the September average, and eclipsed the previous September record of 33.39 degrees set on September 30, 1998.</p><p>For NSW, though, the biggest heat spike came on September 23, with a large inland area reaching 16 degrees above average during the day. (See chart below.)</p><p>Apart from setting NSW's first September day with a maximum of 40 degrees, the statewide average maximum of 35.81 degrees smashed the previous record set in 2003 by 1.61 degrees.</p><p>An odd quirk in the heat was the range during the day, with some areas warming 30 degrees from their overnight minimums.</p><p>Canberra Airport, for instance, ranged from 1.3-30.2 degrees during the day day, exceeding the previous record for any month of the year for the diurnal range. </p><p>Victoria posted its hottest September reading on September 23, with Mildura clocking a 37.7 reading.</p><p>For Queensland, the peak of the heat hit on September 27 when 36 per cent of the state had its hottest September day.</p><p>The state's mean maximum temperature that day reached was 37.79 degrees, eclipsing the previous September record of 37.43 degrees set in 1988. </p><h>Drought widens</h><p>The ongoing lack of rain in many regions has meant less cloud cover and available soil moisture to be evaporated, helping to drive daytime temperatures higher.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/\">bureau's latest drought statement,</url> out on Wednesday, showed rainfall deficiencies are intensifying in inland regions, particularly in NSW.

the Rural Fire Service (RFS) warning catastrophic fire days can be expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bushfire danger period is now in force across the entire region and it comes with changes to fire warning advice and a new fire danger rating system.</p><p>Community safety officer for the Riverina Highlands RFS zone, Peter Jones, says the new severe, extreme and catastrophic warnings clearly communicate the type of danger.</p><p>He says there is likely to be advance notice of a catastrophic rating.</p><p>\"We can make those warnings that potentially in three to four days we will [have] a catastrophic day, and that's when we really start to get the message out that the weather conditions will be horrible,\" he said.</p><p>\"So start preparing your properties, make sure you've got all that sort of stuff ready in case a fire does start.\"</p><p>On request the fire brigade can inspect properties to ensure they are adequately prepared.</p><p>Mr Jones says after good rain, the grass dries out quickly in the heat.</p><p>He says there is no forest fire ban yet, but he is urging people camping in the hills to take care when lighting fires.</p><p>Mr Jones says he hopes to avoid pine plantation fires like the destructive 2006 Billo Road fire, but there have already been a few minor fires in the past week.</p><p>\"We expect a lot more wind factor and a lot more high temperatures and low humidity days,\" he said.</p><p>\"The weather bureau is predicting a lot more of those days when temperatures are well into the 40s and as a result of a passing front we really think that wind speeds up to 100 kilometres per hour are really possible this year.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The fire - in Pumicestone Rd, Toorbul - started about 7.20am. Four fire crews attended. About six hectares of land was burned out. Heavy machinery had to be used to construct fire breaks and backburning was performed in the western and southern sectors of the affected area. One helicopter conducted aerial observation and water bombing. No homes were threatened.</p><p>Truck blaze</p><p>A truck caught fire on the Bruce Highway at Narangba on Friday night, causing traffic congestion. The blaze in the southbound lanes of the highway left only one lane open for several hours. There were no reports of injuries.</p><p>Women struck</p><p>TWO women were taken to hospital on Friday night after they were hit by a vehicle on Kendall Rd, Bellmere. Police said that it was believed the Bellmere women, aged 18 and 17, were walking with three other people about 8pm when a vehicle crashed into them. The 18-year-old, who reportedly hit the bonnet and windscreen of the vehicle, was treated at Caboolture Hospital for spinal injuries. The second woman, who was allegedly struck and thrown on to a footpath, received treatment for cuts and abrasions. Another 17-year-old Bellmere woman has been assisting police with inquiries.</p><p>Home burns</p><p>INVESTIGATIONS are continuing into a destructive house fire at Deception Bay on Sunday night.

The results are catastrophic - numerous fatalities, large numbers of injuries with many requiring hospitalisation. Properties are flooded, some of the Border cities' 82,000 people evacuated and many more further along the river. </p><p>An unprecedented national disaster rushes down the Murray River creating chaos, wreaking havoc on riverside communities. But in Wodonga there are just 410 beds available in community halls for the displaced. The motels are another option but they have a total capacity of about 700. Council civic services manager Mark Verbaken says an earthquake is unlikely but one that had to be planned for as part of the city's 180-page emergency management plan. He says grass fires and flash flooding are more likely. \"But this plan is about looking at the potential for emergencies and setting in place plans and contacts that would provide our best response,\" Mr Verbaken said. \"The report covers everything from windstorms to pandemics, terrorist attacks to aircraft crashes. \"But the reality and history suggest that fire, floods and spring-summer storms are our most likely emergency. \"With fires it is more likely to be grass fire, than a forest fire, and flash flooding rather than river flooding. \"The fact is very few of these emergencies would stretch the demand to be able to lay people down overnight.\" On Monday night councillors voted unanimously in favour of adopting the plan that was also prompted by the recent history of emergencies in the city. The report to council said there was always the potential for a major accident on the Hume Freeway but most past emergencies were \"primarily related to flooding\". It highlighted flooding in 1996, 1998 and last year as well as fires in 1952 and 2003. The report also said pockets of Wodonga can be affected by \"mini- cyclones\". Cr Anna Speedie congratulated the work and detail that had gone into the plan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRDRML-61vnontt6skh0tskoio</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRDRML2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:545T-HSJ1-JD67-101G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386165</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Border Mail</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>October 19, 2011 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000546</classCode><className>EARTHQUAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002020</classCode><className>GEOPHYSICAL EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000506</classCode><className>DISASTER PLANNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XAN</classCode><className>DISPLACED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DF9M</classCode><className>SEVERE SUMMER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000061</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX002018</classCode><className>TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000D0T5</classCode><className>TERRORIST ATTACKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000443</classCode><className>DAMS &amp; RESERVOIRS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000061</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

There was more than 100 firefighters working on that last night,\" he said.</p><p>\"It is going to require a deal of attention throughout today, but fortunately, like the other fire ground, conditions have eased considerably.</p><p>\"Firefighters on the ground and the use of aircraft will seek to bring that fire under control throughout today.</p><p>\"It's not declared contained yet, but it's not posing any threat to homes.\"</p><p>Commissioner Fitzsimmons says the next cycle of hot weather is expected to move through the state on Thursday, but until meaningful rainfall arrives the containment of the fire grounds will be tenuous for days, if not weeks.</p><p>Two fires still burning in state's south</p><p>Meanwhile, about 90 firefighters are working to contain two separate fires in remote forest escarpment in the state's south.</p><p>Both were ignited by lightning more than two weeks ago.</p><p>About 60 firefighters are trying to contain a forest fire burning through more than 7,000 hectares of Budawang National Park and private farmland around 25 kilometres north-east of Braidwood.</p><p>Specialist remote area fire crews are being winched into the region and water bombing is continuing today.</p><p>Without rain, the Shoalhaven Rural Fire Service says the fire is expected to continue burning for several weeks.</p><p>Further south, the Eurobodalla Rural Fire Service says 27 remote area fire fighters are trying to contain a 150-hectare blaze in the extremely steep and remote forests of Monga National Park, between the Kings Highway and Nelligen.</p><p>The fire has burnt out the historic Corn walking trail.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The species, called Hainan gibbon, are also considered one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world as people tend to boil their bodies to produce paste.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> As the dawn breaks on Futou Ling, a mountain on Hainan Island off China's south coast, the last remaining gibbons begin to sing. These species are not just considered as the world's rarest ape\u00a0but also the world's rarest primate and potentially rarest mammal.&lt;nl/&gt; Scientists have found Hainan gibbons creating an intense musical cacophony, filling the tropical forest, every morning. Males climb to the treetops and start warbling, hooting and shrieking, and females and youngsters start to sing.&lt;nl/&gt; About 28 gibbons were found to survive in Bawangling National Nature Reserve in western Hainan. Researchers did not find the animals in any other areas.&lt;nl/&gt; The tiny population of Hainan gibbons are at high risk of typhoon, forest fire\u00a0and outbreak of infectious diseases, which could wipe their entire species. However, researchers are working in an to prevent the gibbons to be the first primate to become extinct due to human activities.&lt;nl/&gt; 'The Hainan gibbon is the world's rarest ape, the world's rarest primate and, almost certainly, the world's rarest mammal,' said Samuel Turvey, a senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London.&lt;nl/&gt; Hainan gibbons were considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as one of the world's 25 most endangered primates. A report[1], released on Nov.sc\u00a024, shows that gibbons have the lowest recorded number of any species.&lt;nl/&gt; In a report by the National Geographic[2], Hainan gibbons have been devastated by poaching and deforestation. People use their bodies to make a gluey paste for Chinese medicine.&lt;nl/&gt; Hainan was originally home to thousands of gibbons however its forest was selectively logged for valuable timber and to make way for state-owned rubber plantations since 1960s. These devastating events led researchers to aim to fully understand how gibbons live and their needs to create a plan to save them.&lt;nl/&gt; Jessica Bryant, one of the researchers, has spent several seasons tracking gibbons. Bryant and her colleagues have found that gibbons tend to perform a song every day during dawn, and used their voice to track the animals.&lt;nl/&gt; She describes Hainan gibbons' song as 'the most beautiful of all.' But the team only have a small period of time to locate the gibbons before they fall silent.&lt;nl/&gt; 'If we don't find them in time, we have to wait another one or two hours until they sing again,' Bryant said. 'If we can find out how many there are, and where they live, we can focus on protecting and reforesting those areas.'&lt;nl/&gt; The scientists are aiming to identify the Hainan gibbons' declining population to provide plans to protect their number. The scientists are planning to build canopy bridges for gibbons, which are clumsy on the ground, to move through the fragmented forest.&lt;nl/&gt; They are also working for an emergency response plan to keep the gibbons from being wiped out by storms or other calamities.&lt;nl/&gt;

nitf:lede=\"true\">Authorities do not know how a devastating prawn disease got to aquaculture farms in Queensland, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However the corporation said white spot disease has not yet been detected in any wild prawn populations in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There is no clear idea of where it came from,\" the FRDC's Peter Horvat said.</p><p>\"[At this point in time] investigating the vector or pathogen's pathway into Australia isn't the priority, the clear focus is to contain and eradicate the white spot virus.\"</p><p>Biosecurity Queensland is continuing to destock and decontaminate ponds at two aquaculture farms south of Brisbane, and neighbouring farms are being checked to ensure it has not spread.</p><p>The disease does not pose any health risks to humans, but can cause major crop losses for prawn farmers.</p><p>Contain and destroy</p><p>White spot disease is widespread in Asia and in the Americas, but this is the first time it has been detected on prawn farms in Australia.</p><p>Establishing the pathway of a biosecurity incursion can help to identify if there are any other infected properties or areas.</p><p>However Mr Horvat said authorities needed to first make sure the disease was contained and destroyed.</p><p>\"The who, the why and the how when you're dealing with a forest fire for example is not the primary concern,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have got to deal with the crisis that is with them right this second, so they need to contain it and stop it from going any further.\"</p><p>The affected prawn farms are on the Logan River, south of Brisbane, but the FRDC said the disease has not yet been detected in nearby wild prawns.</p><p>\"There is a testing program being run through Biosecurity Queensland and industry to test not only prawn farms in the area, but also undertaking surveys up and down the Logan River,\" Mr Horvat said.</p><p>\"They are being tested regularly and to date there is no evidence that the disease has left the farm.</p><p>\"The goal is to make sure we never let that happen.\"</p><p>Producers urged to be alert of biosecurity risks</p><p>Dallas Donovan is the operations manager for Seafarms Group, the largest prawn farming operation in Australia with about 160 hectares of productive ponds in north Queensland.</p><p>Mr Donovan said he was confident white spot disease could be eradicated, and the incursion would not be a blight on the country's highly regarded aquaculture industry.</p><p>\"We have seen that in other countries where eradication has occurred and it requires a sustained effort and a good solid response,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is something caused by the virus coming into the country in some form of crustacean, and we will let the epidemiologist determine how.</p><p>\"But Australia's prawn farming industry remains highly sustainable and still clean and green.\"</p><p>Mr Donovan said it was important that farmers be alert to all biosecurity risks, and that the affected prawn farmers acted responsibly in reporting the disease to authorities.</p><p>\"I think there would be some worrying times and tears for the owners of those properties but hats off to them,\" he said.</p><p>\"They have communicated well with government and industry to get to the bottom of it, and have been more than cooperative to get the issue under control.\"</p><p>'Heart-wrenching' for prawn farmers</p><p>Many media reports have drawn links between WSD and the negligible impact on the supply of Christmas prawns.</p><p>However Mr Horvat from the FRDC said it was also important to acknowledge the wellbeing of the farmers affected.</p><p>\"They are not large producers, like most primary producers around Australia they are small family-run business,\" he said.</p><p>\"Having worked for the entire year in the lead up to Christmas and then having your stock destroyed is heart-wrenching from anyone's perspective.</p><p>\"It is a very tough situation for the farmers, and industry are focussing on providing them with as much assistance and help as they can.\"</p><p>Identifying the symptoms</p><p>Although the disease is called white spot disease, authorities said there were other symptoms farmers should look for.</p><p>Prawns with WSD may have a loose shell with a pink to red discolouration, and may gather near the surface of the water.</p><p>Infected prawns may also stop eating, become lethargic or swim differently.</p><p>Aquaculture businesses who notice these symptoms are urged to contact authorities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It helps to make the fire safer than it already is.\"</p><p>Forestry Tasmania says it has not received any complaints from the Geeveston community, and the smoke from the burn-offs has now cleared.</p><p>'Call for change'</p><p>The Huon Valley Environment Centre says it recognises fuel reduction burns are needed to keep communities safe, but says the issue is what it has labelled Forestry Tasmania's mismanagement of the practice.</p><p>The Centre's Jenny Weber says the Parks and Wildlife Service and the Tasmania Fire Service would be better suited to managing fuel reduction burns.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-2972562</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:803B-NNN1-2RG7-23WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"306\"/><timeReceived>8:45 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>August 3, 2010 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia/TAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/TAS/Geeveston 7116</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/TAS/Hobart 7000</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/TAS/Launceston 7250</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Emergency Planning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Environmental Management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government and Politics/Public Sector</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Regional</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government and Politics/Activism and Lobbying</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Environmental Impact</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

On Black Saturday, the intensity reached 100,000 kilowatts per metre. ``Not only the intensity of the fire, the heat of the fire, but its speed was phenomenal,'' Mr Rush said. ``Fire spotted kilometres ahead, fireballs seemingly of atomic force came before the fire.''</p><p>The opening day of the commission was dogged by more complaints that individual victims were being denied the right to give evidence in person.</p><p>Mat Tinkler, acting executive director a public interest law clearing house, said applications from 30 individuals and communities were rejected without their barristers getting the chance to put their case.</p><p>``Money is no object for the big players, who are briefing the country's top lawyers to appear,'' Mr Tinkler said.</p><p>Black Saturday pictures, video</p><p>adelaidenow.com.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV-20090421-1-006-787425</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VH0-HJX1-2RYX-1090-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - State Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 21, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000168</classCode><className>BARRISTERS &amp; SOLICITORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001849</classCode><className>WITNESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DL3J</classCode><className>INTERIM MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000168</classCode><className>BARRISTERS &amp; SOLICITORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Widely respected for his enduring public service in protecting and conserving Victoria's forests, he retired as chief of the division of forest operations in 1983 after three years in the job. Earlier, he had been chief of the division of forest protection from 1967 after spending nine years in Melbourne as a fire research and fire protection officer. Born in Mildura, he was a resilient child of the Depression and a formidable sportsman. As a Forests Commission Victoria trainee, he gained a diploma from the Victorian School of Forestry in Creswick in 1942, and a BSc, also in forestry, from Melbourne University in 1951. Forestry graduates of those times were indelibly imprinted with the destruction wrought by the 1939 bushfires; severe criticism by the Stretton Royal Commission that year led to a major change in policy and practice for the protection of Victoria's forests from wildfire. </p><p>Reactive fire control changed to proactive fire management. This recognised that unless fire management, including prevention, suppression and fire ecology, was the core business of the forested land manager, it would not be possible to sustain and conserve all other uses and values of forests for the community. Cleary's dedication and leadership over the defining years in achieving these policy and management goals gave Victoria an enviable and internationally recognised reputation in forest fire management. His experience fitted him well to the roles assigned to him. In March 1950, on board the only helicopter in Australia at that time, an RAAF Sikorsky S-51, he took part in the first use of aircraft for fire suppression work in Australian forest history, over fires in the Jamieson-Howqua valleys near Mansfield. During the period that he was chief, Cleary and his staff developed close working relations with foresters in the United States through reciprocal fire control study tours. He also introduced the large fire organisation concept for command, control and co-ordination of resources at forest fires in Victoria - pre-dating the incident command system now used for emergency management. Under his leadership, there was strong interaction between field officers and the division, as well as interagency co-operation. Cleary was a member of the board of the Country Fire Authority from 1967-1980 and was the commission representative on the bushfire sub-committee of the Victorian disaster committee from 1966 to 1980. He led the CFA submission to the Barber Inquiry into the 1977 fires in western Victoria, and went to London to provide expert witness when litigation following those fires went to the Privy Council. On Ash Wednesday 1983, Cleary and Stan Duncan, each working long shifts, ran the CFA's operational response to that disaster. He gave expert evidence to the Miller Inquiry following the event. His unflappable demeanour in a crisis belied the deep empathy that he felt for rural communities in harm's way each summer. Like many of his profession, he had lived and worked in those communities. He understood that it was the local at the blister-end of a rake-hoe or knapsack who ultimately fought the battle to its bitter, back-breaking end. Cleary was visiting lecturer in fire protection at the Victorian School of Forestry from 1960 until 1980, noting wryly that the Forests Act was one of the dreariest documents ever devised. An honoured member of the Institute of Foresters Australia, he was made a fellow of the institute in 1981. Cleary disclaimed the myth that major bushfires are an act of God and climate change - a myth sustained by a simple disregard for the copious quantities of leaves, twigs, branches and bark that every Eucalypt sheds annually. Four years before the Ash Wednesday fires, he wrote \". . . the only effective barrier against serious bushfires was an area having considerable depth, where fuel quantities were kept below the threshold level at which high intensity fires could be sustained\". His professional life exposed him many times to the devastating results of fire, and he grieved over the extensive losses arising from last February's bushfires in Victoria. To him, that tragedy was a stark reminder that forest fire management is a year-round task central to protecting people's lives and property and conserving the environment.

Much of that output is sent to refineries in the US.</p><p>The outages are widely expected to be temporary, but they drove up the price of typically heavily discounted Canadian crude in recent trading.</p><p>Prices for the US benchmark crude rose 1.2 per cent to $US44.32 a barrel on Thursday, and the global benchmark gained about 1 per cent - with worries about lower supplies from Libya and Nigeria also affecting trading.</p><p>If oil production now threatened by the Canadian fires was halted, it would be enough to nearly wipe out the world's oversupply, said Tim Pickering, chief investment officer of Calgary-based Auspice Capital Advisors, which manages $US300 million ($401m) and an exchange-traded fund based on the Canadian Crude Index.</p><p>\"This is the most important issue in oil today,\" Mr Pickering said. \"That will put the system back in check really quick.\" Oil prices have been pressured for almost two years by excess supplies. But production has started to fall in the US and elsewhere following massive spending cuts by energy companies. Meanwhile, demand continues to grow.</p><p>Analysts say the global market is less oversupplied than it was even a few months ago while producers' capacity to ramp up production has been reduced. That makes the oil market more vulnerable to a shortage if production is halted in any part of the world.</p><p>In addition to Canada, oil traders are worried about lower supplies from Libya due to political unrest and from Nigeria due to a pipeline outage. Some analysts also warn that Venezuela's oil production could fall amid the country's struggling economy and power shortages.</p><p>The longer-term impact of the Alberta fire remains unclear. Some officials say production will likely bounce back once the fire threat recedes; others say damage to infrastructure and from displaced workers could hamper efforts to ramp up output once the fires are extinguished.</p><p>\"I expect we'll recover fairly quickly, but it's too early to say how much damage has been done to equipment and operations in the town of Fort McMurray,\" Steve Laut, president of Canadian Natural Resources, said on a conference call with analysts. Mr Laut said that oil-sands output at his company, a major oil and gas producer, had not been affected by the disaster.</p><p>But the Bank of Nova Scotia said the destruction of property and loss of production at other oil-sands operations could cast a long shadow. The forest fire fallout could mean \"very little\" GDP growth for the overall Canadian economy in the second quarter and that the damage to infrastructure will slow the recovery in the country's oil patch, the bank said in a report.</p><p>In the latest of a series of plant closures, Exxon Mobil's Imperial Oil and ConocoPhillips on Thursday shut some production. Exxon cut output at its 194,000 barrel-a-day mine, citing \"uncertainties\". Conoco halted a 50,000 barrel-a-day mine and evacuated all staff due to a fire near the town of Anzac. They followed a move on Wednesday by Nexen Energy, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC.</p><p>ConocoPhillips began evacuating people at its Surmont site before dawn on Thursday, including 196 local residents who had been offered shelter, in what it called a \"precautionary measure\".Two of the biggest oil-sands producers already reduced or halted production by at least 385,000 barrels a day. Suncor Energy, Canada's largest producer, late on Wednesday shut its base mine operation. That operation's two mines have a combined cap-acity of 350,000 barrels a day, though they had been running closer to 130,000 barrels a day as a result of routine maintenance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-The Australian20160507Australian35000152045406</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JPM-XY41-F0JP-W46S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 7, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>Oil &amp;

The Singaporean Government called for stricter action against the perpetrators and information on those responsible for the haze.</p><p>But Centre for International Forestry Research scientist Herry Purnomo said Singapore and Malaysia needed to share the responsibility for the fires and haze with Indonesia as they shared the profits from palm oil.</p><p>\"I would like them to buy carbon credits from the people of Sumatra,\" said Dr Herry. \"So many of my colleagues produce carbon credits but there are no buyers.\"</p><p>The Centre for International Forestry Research aims to help shape policy and improve the management of tropical forests.</p><p>Fires are often used to clear land for palm oil and acacia plantations because it is about 10 times cheaper than mechanical land clearing. It is especially difficult to access remote peatland with heavy machinery.</p><p>Palm oil plantations owned by Indonesian, Malaysian and Singaporean companies reaped revenues of $US18.4 billion ($25.8 billion) in 2014.</p><p>\"In compensation, Malaysia and Singapore could be carbon credit buyers,\" Dr Herry said.</p><p>Indonesia has launched investigations into 200 companies and ordered four to suspend operations for allegedly causing forest fires, as it struggles to combat the devastating haze caused by hotspots in Sumatra and Kalimantan.</p><p>Indonesian President Joko Widodo said losses caused by the fires could reach trillions of rupiahs and brought disadvantage to the entire country.</p><p>The government has declared seven companies suspects for having forest fires on their land.</p><p>\"I instructed the Minister of Environment and Forestry to not hesitate in revoking the licences of irresponsible concession holders,\" Mr Joko said during a visit to firefighters at Gantung Damar village in South Kalimantan on Wednesday.</p><p>The government had created artificial rain, provided 17 water-bombing helicopters and deployed more than 2000 military and police. Mr Joko said concession holders must dig canals on peatland to prevent future fires.</p><p>But Dr Herry said while the government was taking the fires seriously, it was not strong enough to solve the problem.</p><p>He said a \"patronage network\" made up of elites who wore multiple hats, such as farmers, politicians, businesspeople and government officers, benefited enormously from the fires.</p><p>\"These protective patronage networks hinder the government's capacity,\" Dr Herry said. \"The scale of these financial benefits means livelihood alternatives need to be significant.\"</p><p>The chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association, Joko Supriyono, disagreed.</p><p>He said palm oil companies that burned to open up their plantations faced jail sentences of up to 10 years. Companies that burned on planted concessions would be \"burning our own assets\". \"We have no motive and reason to burn the land,\" he added.</p><p>He cited <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.globalforestwatch.org/country/IDN\">Global Forest Watch</url> data that found most of the fires were not on land held by palm oil company concession holders.</p><p>\"Journalists should not dramatise situations. This is a very big problem but we have already done the best thing to overcome the crisis,\" he said.</p><p>GreenpeaceIndonesia spokeswoman Anisa Rahmawati said there were about 110,000 deaths a year across South-East Asia due to the fires that blight the region annually.</p><p>\"Pupils can't go to school for a month, 460 flights have been cancelled due to the fire haze - these are things you can't value with money,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1000741757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H0G-79B1-JB5F-9234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><timeReceived>01:53 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

nitf:lede=\"true\">The outgoing Country Fire Authority chief, Russell Rees, has expressed deep regret over the failure of emergency warning systems on Black Saturday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Rees was questioned at the Bushfires Royal Commission today about the lack of wind change warnings for the Kilmore East and Murrundindi fires.</p><p>He told the inquiry there were weaknesses in the structure and design of the CFA and the Integrated Emergency Control Centre, and that this prevented the timely disemination of warnings.</p><p>\"We fell down in this area and we deeply regret the fact that that happened,\" he said.</p><p>\"But the expectation was that warnings would be flowing up from incident control centres in relation to those high risk environments.\"</p><p>Earlier, Rees' lawyers accused lawyers acting for the Royal Commission of trying to turn their client into a \"sacrificial lamb\".</p><p>It is the fourth time Mr Rees has faced the inquiry, but the first time he has been represented by the high-powered QC, Julian Burnside.</p><p>Before the fire chief had said a word in the witness box, his new barrister stood to object.</p><p>Mr Burnside said his client had already been treated \"grossly unfairly\" in the hearings, especially compared to the treatment given to Victoria's forest fire chief Ewan Waller.</p><p>Mr Burnside said the commission's lawyers had \"hounded\" Mr Rees and questioned him in a largely \"hostile\" manner while the examination of Mr Waller had been substantially \"friendly\".</p><p>Mr Burnside suggested his client had been singled out as a \"sacrificial lamb\" perhaps to give the public a \"scalp\".</p><p>Commissioner Bernard Teague interrupted to say Mr Burnside sounded like he was addressing a jury and called his speech \"tedious\".</p><p>Mr Burnside rejected the accusations and said it was \"entirely proper\" that Mr Rees be questioned on material that had come to light since he last gave evidence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Singaporean Government called for stricter action against the perpetrators and information on those responsible for the haze.</p><p>But Centre for International Forestry Research scientist Herry Purnomo said Singapore and Malaysia needed to share the responsibility for the fires and haze with Indonesia as they shared the profits from palm oil.</p><p>\"I would like them to buy carbon credits from the people of Sumatra,\" said Dr Herry. \"So many of my colleagues produce carbon credits but there are no buyers.\"</p><p>The Centre for International Forestry Research aims to help shape policy and improve the management of tropical forests.</p><p>Fires are often used to clear land for palm oil and acacia plantations because it is about 10 times cheaper than mechanical land clearing. It is especially difficult to access remote peatland with heavy machinery.</p><p>Palm oil plantations owned by Indonesian, Malaysian and Singaporean companies reaped revenues of $US18.4 billion ($25.8 billion) in 2014.</p><p>\"In compensation, Malaysia and Singapore could be carbon credit buyers,\" Dr Herry said.</p><p>Indonesia has launched investigations into 200 companies and ordered four to suspend operations for allegedly causing forest fires, as it struggles to combat the devastating haze caused by hotspots in Sumatra and Kalimantan.</p><p>Indonesian President Joko Widodo said losses caused by the fires could reach trillions of rupiahs and brought disadvantage to the entire country.</p><p>The government has declared seven companies suspects for having forest fires on their land.</p><p>\"I instructed the Minister of Environment and Forestry to not hesitate in revoking the licences of irresponsible concession holders,\" Mr Joko said during a visit to firefighters at Gantung Damar village in South Kalimantan on Wednesday.</p><p>The government had created artificial rain, provided 17 water-bombing helicopters and deployed more than 2000 military and police. Mr Joko said concession holders must dig canals on peatland to prevent future fires.</p><p>But Dr Herry said while the government was taking the fires seriously, it was not strong enough to solve the problem.</p><p>He said a \"patronage network\" made up of elites who wore multiple hats, such as farmers, politicians, businesspeople and government officers, benefited enormously from the fires.</p><p>\"These protective patronage networks hinder the government's capacity,\" Dr Herry said. \"The scale of these financial benefits means livelihood alternatives need to be significant.\"</p><p>The chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association, Joko Supriyono, disagreed.</p><p>He said palm oil companies that burned to open up their plantations faced jail sentences of up to 10 years. Companies that burned on planted concessions would be \"burning our own assets\". \"We have no motive and reason to burn the land,\" he added.</p><p>He cited <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.globalforestwatch.org/country/IDN\">Global Forest Watch</url> data that found most of the fires were not on land held by palm oil company concession holders.</p><p>\"Journalists should not dramatise situations. This is a very big problem but we have already done the best thing to overcome the crisis,\" he said.</p><p>GreenpeaceIndonesia spokeswoman Anisa Rahmawati said there were about 110,000 deaths a year across South-East Asia due to the fires that blight the region annually.</p><p>\"Pupils can't go to school for a month, 460 flights have been cancelled due to the fire haze - these are things you can't value with money,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1000741757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H0G-79B1-JB5F-9251-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><timeReceived>01:53 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The same conference two years ago in Paris agreed to keep warming to below 2 degrees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Based on the first nine months of the year, 2017 is unlikely to match 2016 - the hottest year on record - or the previous year. Still, it is likely to dislodge 2014 as the third warmest.</p><p>Such a ranking for 2017 will be notable not least because El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions have been neutral this year, removing the warming boost the past two years had from an El Nino.</p><p>\"It's clearly the warmest year [on record] that doesn't have a warming influence,\" said Blair Trewin, senior climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology and scientific coordinator of the WMO report.</p><p>According to the first 10 months of the year, Australia will have its third-warmest year on record, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/updates/articles/a026.shtml\">the bureau said in a separate report</url>.</p><p>Mean temperatures are running 0.96 degrees above the 1961-90 average used by the bureau. Maximum temperatures were even more unusual, running at 1.34 degrees above average. </p><p>The WMO's report comes a week after the United Nations agency said greenhouse gases are now at levels not seen for perhaps five million years. Carbon dioxide levels rose the most on record last year, increasing 3.3 parts per million to 403.3 ppm.</p><p> 23.5 million displaced </p><p>The report also details many of the dislocations caused by extreme weather in the past year, including some 761,000 internal refugees in Somalia alone because of drought.</p><p>By June, more than half the African nation's cropland was affected by dry conditions, while animal herds have dived 40-60 per cent since December 2016.</p><p>Globally, 23.5 million people were displaced last year by weather-related disasters, WMO said.</p><p>The intense hurricane season in the Atlantic provided the most unusual cyclonic activity in an otherwise slightly quieter than average year.</p><p>Among the three category 4 or 5 hurricanes that hit the US mainland this year, one outstanding weather statistic was the 1539 mm or rain recorded at Nederland, Texas - the largest ever recorded for a single rainfall event on the US mainland - during Hurricane Harvey. </p><p>WMO's science team is yet to determine whether a warming planet is making slow-moving, land-falling hurricanes more or less frequent. Still, \"it is likely that anthropogenic climate change made rainfall rates more intense, and that ongoing sea-level rise exacerbated storm surge impacts\", the report said.</p><p>During the El Nino itself, sea-level increases peaked at a rate of 10 mm a year. \"That was effectively three years' worth of extra sea-level rise in a year,\" Dr Trewin said.</p><p>With El Ninos, the Pacific equatorial trade winds stall and reverse, resulting in the ocean taking up less heat and even giving some back to the atmosphere. Conditions now favour the reverse event, a La Nina, which may point to some cooling in 2018.</p><p> Fire and ice </p><p>2017 was also a big year for wildfires, with Chile reporting eight times the usual forest fire destruction. It had 614,000 hectares burnt after extreme heat following a drought.<br/><br/>California's hottest summer on record also contributed to a bad fire season. The area scorched across the 48 contiguous US states was almost 50 per cent above the 2007-2016 average, while the region burned across the border in Canada was up eight-fold compared with a 2006-2015 average.</p><p>A host of other climate signals were evident in the past year even if records weren't always set.</p><p>Data sets varied, for instance, as to whether the annual maximum Arctic sea ice extent marked a new record low in March 2017. But the 10 record low maximum years have all occurred since 2007. </p><p>The Greenland ice sheet, meanwhile, added 40 billion tonnes in 2017, bucking a trend - perhaps only briefly - that has seen the ice sheet lose about 3600 billion tonnes since 2002.</p><p>\"It's more a moisture signal, rather than a temperature one,\" Dr Trewin said, noting Greenland had received heavier than usual snowfall in the past year.</p><p> Australian trends </p><p>In Australia, NSW and Queensland stand out as being unusually warm so far this year. (See chart below.)</p><p>\"NSW has the highest January-October anomaly on record, but 2014 - which finished very hot - had an annual anomaly which was higher,\" Dr Trewin said.</p><p>\"So it's harder to say that NSW is 'on track' for its warmest year on record,\" he said.</p><p>In Queensland's case, though, merely average conditions for the final two months of 2017 would be enough to make it that state's hottest year on record for data that goes back to 1910, he said.</p><p>Rainfall so far this year has been mixed for Australia, with the east relatively dry and the west wetter than normal. (See chart below.)</p><p>The key Murray-Darling agricultural basin is having its driest year since 2006, one of the years of the Millennium Drought, Dr Trewin said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1026965505</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PWR-NJB1-DY19-C3GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><timeReceived>09:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Everything will be on the table: the adequacy of prescribed preventative burning or hazard reduction; the lethal crime of arson; escape clearways; warning alarm systems; 'go or stay' risk assessment and evacuation procedures; fireproof bunkers; planning regulations; building codes; the adequacy of fire fighting resources; and the usefulness of the forest fire danger index.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Submissions from everyone will be welcomed. Such is the local and national trauma and grief that the inquiry is expected to be therapeutic for those who need and want to tell their stories and those who listen to them.</p><p>It may be a year to 18 months before the royal commission completes its work.</p><p>It is significant to note that two stakeholder groups have already come to concluded views: the 13,000 professional firefighters of Australia and the Climate Institute, which commissions scientific research in Australia into fires and global atmospheric warming.</p><p>Climate Institute CEO John Connor told Stateline NSW (on February 20, 2009) that in his organisation's concluded view: \"These are the fires of climate change that we've seen in Victoria and perhaps indeed in Port Lincoln in South Australia in 2005. Climate change is not just about warmer weather. It's about wilder weather. Climate change costs ... climate change kills\".</p><p>In 2007 the Climate Institute (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climateinstitute.org.au\">www.climateinstitute.org.au</url>) commissioned research by the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO Marine and Atmosphere Research. The researchers produced a paper, \"Bushfire Weather in Southeast Australia\", which, like actuaries for the insurance industry, projected extreme and catastrophic fire weather risks for the regions of Australia through each increment in global atmospheric warming.</p><p>The paper did not then declare Sydney's 'Black Christmas' bushfires in late 2001, the Canberra bushfires in January 2003 or the 2003 and 2007 eastern Victorian bushfire to be directly related to climate change. The language was equivocal: \"The recent observed rise in fire danger may be due to a mix of both natural variability and human-induced climate change. The relative importance of these two factors is not known at this time. Observations from the next few years to decades will allow the determination of the role played by each of these factors\".</p><p>After the deadly Victorian bushfires of February 2009, the Climate Institute is now unequivocal. These were climate change fires. It is expected to make such a definitive submission and ask the royal commission to commission further research. There is much at stake: the lives of Australians living in bush settings; insurance premiums for all Australian property owners; the national economic impact from a massive increase in fire protection costs.</p><p>While some politicians have accepted that climate change is behind the exponential increase in extreme fire weather, no government - state, territory of federal - has yet declared the now deadly bushfire phenomenon in Australia to be by scientific definition 'the fires of climate change'.</p><p>To make such a declaration, of course, would require a coordinated national, state and territory policy response. The people of Australia would be entitled to ask why they have to wait for the Victorian bushfires royal commission to produce its findings on something that is already staring them in the face. The Canberra bushfires of 2003 and Victoria 2009 were off the scale of the forest fire danger index.</p><p>The 13,000 professional firefighters of Australia have collectively determined that climate change is producing the extreme fire weather conditions which have confronted them over recent years. This again is a significant declaration in a body (the United Firefighters Union of Australia) which is known to have its share of climate change sceptics within the membership.</p><p>In the open letter to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (dated February 12), national secretary Peter Marshall said:</p><p>\"Consider the recent devastation in Victoria. Research by the CSIRO, Climate Institute and the Bushfire Council found that a 'low global warming scenario' will see catastrophic fire events happen in parts of regional Victoria every 5-7 years by 2020, and every 3-4 years by 2050, with up to 50 per cent more extreme danger fire days. However, under a 'high global warming scenario', catastrophic events are predicted to occur every year in Mildura, and firefighters have been warned to expect an up to 230 per cent increase in extreme fire days in Bendigo. And in Canberra, the site of devastating fires in 2003, we are being asked to prepare for up to a massive 221 per cent increase in extreme fire days by 2050.\"</p><p>The union is calling for a national inquiry into the state of readiness of the country's fire services to confront yet more climate change fires. And it has urged all governments to follow scientific advice by halving Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.</p><p>When I challenged the union's NSW secretary Simon Flynn on the practicality of Australia acting unilaterally on greenhouse gas emissions, which everyone understood was a global problem requiring a global response, he replied that firefighters on the west coast of the USA and the east coast of Australia had come to realise the enormity of the change in extreme fire weather conditions. After Victoria he now wanted Australia to take the lead in confronting climate change in particular, as well as the resourcing and preventative strategies for Australians living in all areas vulnerable to climate change bushfires.</p><p>Should we discount the urgings of the firefighters' union as stereotypical self-interest for more resourcing and membership? As they put their lives on the line for us, perhaps we could cut them some slack on this occasion and give the firefighters the benefit of the doubt about their now collective declaration of a link between climate change and extreme fire weather.</p><p>Should we discount the urgings of the Climate Institute, a privately funded NGO? It could be a front for vested interests in the renewable industry. (On its website the Climate Institute declares that it is primarily funded by the philanthropic Poola Foundation, through the estate of the late Tom Kantor, a nephew of Rupert Murdoch). That might be a worry in figuring out agendas and motivations, but the research it commissioned does carry the signatures of the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO.</p><p>It is obviously getting harder to put climate change fires into the too-hard basket.</p><p>The Climate Institute's website gives a state by state, region by region break down of FFDI (forest fire danger index) tracking the annual change in fire weather.</p><p>\"Of most concern to firefighters are days classified as having 'very high' or 'extreme' fire dangers. The number of very high and extreme fire-weather days is projected to increase in all scenarios. For example, in Canberra, if the rate of global warming is low, the number of extreme days increases around 8-10 per cent by 2020, and 17-25 per cent by 2050. If the rate of global warming is high, the number of extreme days rises 25-42 per cent by 2020 and 137-221 per cent (around double to triple) by 2050.\"</p><p>As the politicians, economists, insurance companies and emergency services struggle to come to terms with what this means, Australians residing and working in the bush landscapes have clearly been warned.</p><p>Do they abandon their now-dangerous lifestyles, or do they push for policy responses which confront the fires of climate change?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quentin Dempster presents Stateline NSW on ABC TV</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-2497095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7V2J-81P0-Y9Y8-S0SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1311\"/><timeReceived>2:50 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 20, 2009 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Climate Change</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Business &amp;

Photo: GRAHAM TIDY By John Thistleton Two summers of unprecedented rain and unusually cool temperatures have left a large fuel load of grass and unburnt forest areas in and around Canberra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A network of 500 fire trails and strategic burns along the north-west urban edge, heavy grazing and extra grass slashing will create a fortress for the territory which forecasters say faces a higher than average risk this summer.</p><p>After a fire-fuelled tornado in January 2003 killed four Canberrans and frightened thousands more, CSIRO fire expert Phil Cheney told the subsequent inquiry the fire's penetration into urban areas under extreme conditions did not reflect a failure of fuel management on the urban interface.</p><p>The failure was in the forest areas.</p><p>Following a 10-year strategy, ACT fire managers have created a mosaic across the landscape of different fuel levels, burning at every opportunity.</p><p>But forests have been too wet to burn this spring and the past two summers.</p><p>Of the 12,000 hectares to be burnt this season, 200 hectares have been burnt around the urban edge in fuels dry enough to burn.</p><p>Territory and Municipal Services fire manager Neil Cooper said forests would be targeted in autumn.</p><p>\"The larger burns [areas] in the forested areas are not yet dry enough to implement a successful hazard reduction fire burn.</p><p>\"I'm not worried, in a lot of areas fuels have not got to that [dangerous] stage.\"</p><p>Mr Cooper said it was no secret Canberra had lots of grass. \"But with grass fires, there's no fire danger until the grass dries out.\"</p><p>Senior weather forecaster in Canberra Sean Carson said after only three days of temperatures over 35 degrees in the past two summers - in contrast to the long term average of 13 days of above 35 degrees - people had forgotten what a normal summer was like.</p><p>\"It only takes two weeks of hot dry weather to cure the grass. I would say without doubt it is very likely that will happen.\"</p><p>Bushfire Co-operative Research Centre deputy chief executive and research director Dr Richard Thornton said since the 2003 Canberra fires, weather modelling and fundamental underpinning science that impacted on fire behaviour had changed.</p><p>Much had been done to understand weather forecasting on severe fire danger days from the Canberra, Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday fires in Victoria.</p><p>Researchers looked at wind change across the country, predictors of severe blow ups, high level jets and dry slots which brought very dry upper atmospheric winds down into the fire ground which dramatically increased fire behaviour.</p><p>\"There is quite a lot of underpinning science that is now used routinely across the bureau's severe weather forecasting that feeds into the fire fighters on the ground.\"</p><p>After the Black Saturday bushfires, royal commission \"catastrophic\" was added to the alert ratings.</p><p>Original fire ratings were calibrated to 100, based on the worst fires seen since the 1939 fires in Victoria, but around Black Saturday fire danger ratings were peaking at 200.</p><p>\"But it is more about making sure we pick the peak levels and making sure people are aware that this isn't slightly worse than a very high or severe rating, it is actually a lot, lot worse, that the houses, in the preparation you made, may not be sufficient.\"</p><p>Dr Thornton could not comment on fuel loads near Canberra because he had not seen them. The CRC's website says winter frosts and snow have increased curing rates, creating above-average fire potential for the Murrumbidgee corridor through the ACT.</p><p>Dr Thornton said fuel loads were only one part of the picture, along with weather, buildings and what people did before and during a fire.</p><p>\"A lot of discussion around the Canberra fires was about a prolonged drought, a lot of use of mulch in gardens because of water restrictions which helped carry fire into some of the areas around Chapman and Duffy.\"</p><p>ACT Rural Fire Service chief officer Andrew Stark said green grass did not have the intensity of well-cured grass. \"When grass gets to 70per cent [cured] it is extremely flammable and difficult to control.\"</p><p>Mr Stark said a grass fire could burn four times quicker than a forest fire. But a forest fire's spotting embers could ignite flames 10kilometres away in minutes.</p><p>Among the firefighters who backburned at Uriarra during the 2003 firestorm, Mr Cooper said the big risks remained in the mountains west of Canberra.</p><p>This spring, pioneer growth such as acacias and snarls of blackberries fill the areas burnt in 2003.</p><p>Mr Cooper said a United States Forest Service burns expert, Brian Levin, had joined the Territory and Municipal Services fire unit in August, to share technical expertise as they continued creating a mosaic of fuel control.</p><p>\"We're not tied to a historical view that you cannot burn in summer.</p><p>\"We will look at the weather conditions, what conditions are for the burn and following the burn and we will take it from there.\"</p><p>Future burning around Googong Dam foreshore for water protection will also aim to stop bushfires from leaving the ACT and going into NSW, and another burn in the Brindabella mountains will aim to stop landscape fire from coming into the territory.</p><p>\"For some of the burns, we need moisture. We will light on the ridge and it will burn back down and as soon as it comes across to higher moisture it just goes out. So that's perfect for us.\"</p><p>Mr Stark said the 2003 firestorm caused interest in volunteer fire fighting to surge, before dropping away in later years. Now the territory had 487 volunteers who were skilled.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-19320837</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:594K-CMX1-DYTG-24W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>November 19, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009XN1</classCode><className>EASTER SEASON</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
