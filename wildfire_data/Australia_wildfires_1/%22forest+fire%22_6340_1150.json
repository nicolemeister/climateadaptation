But there are a few important considerations to note.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/updates/articles/a008-el-nino-and-australia.shtml\">not all</url> El Ni\u00f1o years result in bad bushfires. The presence of an El Ni\u00f1o is only one factor that determines the prevalence of bushfires. Other factors, such as the presence of drought, also come into play. </p><p>And second, whether or not this fire season is a bad one, Australia must find a more sustainable and effective way to manage bushfires. The El Ni\u00f1o threat only makes the task more urgent.</p><h>Understanding fire in Australia</h><p>An El Ni\u00f1o is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/june-2023-enso-update-el-ni%C3%B1o-here\">declared</url> when the sea surface temperature in large parts of the tropical Pacific Ocean warms significantly. </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/world-meteorological-organization-declares-onset-of-el-ni%C3%B1o-conditions\">statement</url> by the World Meteorological Organization, released on Tuesday, said El Ni\u00f1o conditions have developed in the tropical Pacific for the first time in seven years \"setting the stage for a likely surge in global temperatures and disruptive weather and climate patterns\".</p><p>The organisation says there's a 90% probability of the El Ni\u00f1o event continuing during the second half of 2023. It said El Ni\u00f1o can trigger extreme heat and also cause severe droughts over Australia and other parts of the world.</p><p>But before we start planning ahead for the next bushfire season, it's important to understand what drives bushfire risks - and the influence of climate change, fire management and events such as El Ni\u00f1o.</p><p>The evidence for human-induced climate change is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/\">irrefutable</url>. While the global climate has changed significantly <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/while-we-fixate-on-coronavirus-earth-is-hurtling-towards-a-catastrophe-worse-than-the-dinosaur-extinction-130869\">in the past</url>, the current changes are occurring at an unprecedented rate. </p><p>In geologic time scales, before the influence of humans, a significant <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&amp;pid=procite:13c02405-e8c6-466c-a400-f6137710a651\">shift</url> in climate has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/6836/\">associated</url> with an increase in fire activity in Australia. There is every reason to expect fire activity will increase with human-induced climate change as well.</p><p>Humans have also changed the Australian fire landscape - both First Nations people and, for the past 200 years, European colonisers. </p><p>Changes brought about by Indigenous Australians were widespread, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378038/\">sustainable</url>. Their methods included, for example, lighting \"cool\" fires in small, targeted patches early in the dry season. This reduced the chance that very large and intense fires would develop.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Our land is burning, and Western science does not have all the answers</emphasis></p><p>Changes brought about by European colonisers have also been widespread - such as land clearing using fire, and fire suppression to protect human life and property. But this approach has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30388718_National_Inquiry_on_Bushfire_Mitigation_and_Management\">far from sustainable</url>, either financially, ecologically or socially.</p><p>Australia has just experienced a period of high rainfall across the continent due to a La Ni\u00f1a event <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateextremes.org.au/large-scale-climate-drivers-in-australia-2022/#:%7E:text=The%20combined%20influence%20of%20a,in%20123%20years%20of%20records.\">combined with</url> two other climate drivers: a negative Indian Ocean Dipole and a positive Southern Annular Mode. It means the soil is moist and plants are flourishing.</p><p>Now, we're set to enter into a drying period driven by an El Ni\u00f1o. The abundant plant growth leading into a dry period is likely to result in widespread bushfires across Australia. </p><p>Initially, this is <url normalizedValue=\"https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/bushfire-new-south-wales-1974/\">likely to occur</url> in semi-arid inland areas where grasses have flourished in the wet period, but will dry out quickly. If the drying cycle persists for two or three years, then fires might become more prevalent in forests and woodlands in temperate Australia. </p><p>But an El Ni\u00f1o year doesn't necessarily mean a bad bushfire season is certain. </p><p>In Australia, El Ni\u00f1o events are associated with hotter and drier conditions, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263018552_Multi-decadal_variability_of_forest_fire_risk_-_Eastern_Australia\">leading to more days</url> of high fire danger. But large and severe forest fires also need a prolonged drought to dry out fuels, especially in sheltered gullies and slopes. Soils and woody vegetation are currently moist following the La Ni\u00f1a period.</p><p>So El Ni\u00f1o and its opposite phase, La Ni\u00f1a, are on their own are a relatively <url normalizedValue=\"https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/forecasting-fire-activity-in-victoria-australia-using-antecedent-\">poor predictor</url> of the number and size of bushfires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: The burn legacy: why the science on hazard reduction is contested</emphasis></p><h>Fight smarter, and be prepared</h><p>Climate change will continue to test our fire management systems. And the return of an El Ni\u00f1o has fire crews <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/australia-firefighters-fire-crews-prepare-for-return-of-el-nino-bushfire-season-smoke-hazard-reduction-burns\">on alert</url>.</p><p>When it comes to fire management, Australia must be much smarter than it has been for the past 200 years. This means changing the focus to holistic fire management. Throwing huge amounts of money and resources at controlling bushfires - such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7034300/govt-vows-to-get-more-firefighting-aircraft/\">purchasing more</url> and larger <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/new-weapon-to-fight-aussie-bushfires-kicks-off-service-in-wa/news-story/fa66e567e336164723cae8b98bb3ba8d\">firefighting aircraft</url> - is is not sustainable or sensible.</p><p>Fire is as fundamental to our environment as wind and rain. And the amount of energy released from a large bushfire will never be matched by any level of resources humans can muster. </p><p>The evidence bears this out. Take, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/WF9970221\">analysis</url> of fire dynamics in two areas north and south of the US-Mexico border. Between 1920 and 1972, authorities on the US side had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on firefighting aircraft and other resources trying to suppress wildfires. This resulted in fewer wildfires than in the Mexico region. But the fires that occurred were larger and more severe.</p><p>Similar patterns have occurred in Australia. For example, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284776990_Evidence_of_altered_fire_regimes_in_the_Western_Desert_regime_of_Australia\">study</url> of burn patterns in the Western Desert region showed that after the exodus of Traditional Owners, the number of fires reduced substantially, but the fires became far bigger.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Watching our politicians fumble through the bushfire crisis, I'm overwhelmed by d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu</emphasis></p><h>Change must happen</h><p>Damaging bushfires will return to Australia in the near future.  The expected return of another El Ni\u00f1o should heighten efforts to create a more considered and sustainable fire management regime - particularly in southern Australia. </p><p>Experts, including me, have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forestry.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Final-KPI-Document-v2.pdf\">devised</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/media/4935/nationalbushfiremanagementpolicy_2014.pdf\">plans</url> to guide the shift.

A lot of the levees were built in 1956 and some of them were in disrepair -particularly the Ranfurly Way one - so we need to reinstate a large section of that and also build a new section of the levee,\" he explained.</p><p>It comes as the Murray River is likely to exceed the major flood level at Mildura early next week.</p><p>While the major flood level sits at 38.3 AHD, Mr Manning said it would be similar to the floods experienced in the 70s.</p><p>\"It's around that 1973 flood mark, that's sort of the closest comparison, we've had high rivers in the 90s but they were more high rivers, this a significant flood.\"</p><p>As the emergency looms, Mr Manning urged curious locals not to drive around road closures or walk on levee banks.</p><p>\"People are driving around road closures and walking on the levee banks as we've got machines constructing them ... it's a danger to themselves as well as the people doing the work. </p><p>\"We know people are interested and it's historic but those signs are in place for a reason.\"</p><p>His final piece of advice was to make sure people were keeping up to date with all the warnings being put out by the SES. </p><p>\"We've got a lot of people saying we didn't get a warning, but we've got watch and acts in place,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's what those are for ... get ready - if you need to organise your pets and get your medicines sorted then do that now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSOL-608fd707fc762c53900c876c4173523f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MILDOL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XR-DX11-DY66-50MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472251</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><timeReceived>7:14 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mildura News Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4594\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 23, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Victoria</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>road closures</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>fantastic collaboration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Manning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nangiloc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>final touches</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>indecent control center</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>management crews</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>levy banks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mildura council</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>flood level</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>flood mark</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

To be frank, we as a society have learnt very little following 2019/20 bushfires and bushfires before that, especially in regards to bushfire mitigation and safety.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As noted by Davey and Sarre (2020):</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Thirty-three deaths occurred as a result of these fires, 25 of them in New South Wales. Nine firefighting personnel died, comprising three American aircrew and three Rural Fire Service volunteer firefighters in New South Wales and three members of Forest Fire Management Victoria. Fires destroyed 3100 homes.\" </p><p>The author has identified 21 main areas of concern in relation to bushfire firefighter safety in forested areas, these are outlined below across a number of heading areas:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire mitigation, fuel load management, preparedness and risk management for firefighter safety</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 1</emphasis> is a poor focus on sound bushfire mitigation programs/ prescribed burning to reduce bushfire spread and assist in optimising safe, quick and efficient bushfire attack where fire conditions allow. \u00a0Prescribed burning improves the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of fire suppression. </p><p>See further: <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/120356\">https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/120356</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112712005452\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112712005452</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/prescribed-burning/the-science-behind-prescribed-burning/\">https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/prescribed-burning/the-science-behind-prescribed-burning/</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/the-truth-about-fuel-reduction-burning/\">https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/the-truth-about-fuel-reduction-burning/</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JODSEAPic111.23.jpg\">Forest recently prescribed burnt in southern Queensland, greatly reducing firefighting risks.</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 2</emphasis> is that there is inadequate actioning at all levels of government for safe, healthy and resilient forest landscapes, including in regards to the establishment and maintenance of resilient forest landscapes. There were inadequate levels of low intensity burning and forest thinning, important adaptive measures in the setting up of resilient fire landscapes, as the USA had identified and are actioning.</p><p> See: <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2022/01/25/opportunities-for-improved-fire-management-in-australia-john-odonnell/\">Opportunities for improved fire management in Australia: John O'Donnell</url> \u00a0</p><p>As a result there are huge high intensity bushfires and consequent heavy fuels and strata and dead trees across large areas of Australian landscapes.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JODSEAPic211.23.jpg\">Photo highlighting the intensity of the 2019/ 20 bushfires at Eden in June 2020 and difficult conditions for fire fighters to fight those bushfires.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JODSEAPic3.11.23.jpg\">Recent fuels resulting from the 2019/ 20 bushfires in northern NSW, including heavy undergrowth fuels, dead fuels and heavy grass fuel, not safe conditions for firefighters, especially in adverse conditions.</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 3</emphasis> is that there is inadequate focus on prescribed burning of ridges to improve containment of bushfires and firefighter safety.\u00a0 There is also inadequate action across landscapes in relation to Ignition Management Zones, which are areas where ignition from lightning or arson is a high risk, where fuels should be maintained at a lower level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 4</emphasis> is inadequate consideration of providing effective examples of reducing fuel loads across states and protecting communities and firefighters, and undertaking effective community protection on all bushfire at risk communities.\u00a0 </p><p>Kurrajong Heights has a highly successful bushfire management plan (BFMP) that has kept the community safe for 68 years. The Kurrajong Heights BFMP relies heavily on local knowledge. Knowledge of terrain, fire behaviour and fire paths.\u00a0 The Kurrajong Heights Brigade has developed and implemented a plan that hazard reduces native vegetation blocks using a mosaic pattern. This strategy keeps low fuel areas as a blocking influence for approaching wildfires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 5</emphasis> is inadequate consideration and production of firebrands in the forest landscape.\u00a0 As outlined in Ecos (CSIRO 2017) in the Black Saturday fires in February 2009 at Kilmore East, Victoria, spot fires were reported 30-40 kilometres downwind from the main fire front. \u00a0Fuel reduction burning reduces firebrand potential in stringybark, messmate and other rough-barked species for long periods.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 6</emphasis> is the flawed approach to bushfire risk in some jurisdictions, increasing risks to bushfire fighters and communities.\u00a0 Selecting approaches in some eastern states where 1 per cent of forested landscapes per year are fuel reduced is one example of an approach that increases risks to fire fighters.\u00a0 Another example relates to the Victorian Government which set out a new approach to reducing the risk of bushfire in Victoria called Safer Together.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>See: <url

typeStyle=\"bf\">Safe access and water supplies for firefighters</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 7</emphasis> is inadequate firefighter safety and access in high fuel load and strata forested areas, with many forests dangerous for firefighters, with poor access, non-maintained access, access not adequate width and inadequate passing bays and inadequate turnaround areas.\u00a0 Carrying out regular prescribed burning along fire access roads and fire trails is essential if they are to be of optimum value as control lines.</p><p><url

firefighter safety.\u00a0 Thanks to the Howitt Society for the permission to use this photo.</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 8 </emphasis>is inadequate action on establishing safe evacuation of key road routes into and out of bushfires, restricting safe access and emergency escape in some cases of bushfires, many such routes having no mitigation treatment measures such as low intensity burning and fuel removal.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JODSEAPic5.11.23.jpg\">\u00a0Recent prescribed burning beside a main road near Barraba NSW,

Also, NSW South East Timber Association Submission to The NSW Bushfire Inquiry, Submission 694\u00a0 (20200417)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 11</emphasis> relates to expertise and experience to conduct backburns safely as succinctly outlined by Roger Underwood, The Utter Failure of Yet Another Bushfire Panel, in Quadrant on 19 November, 2020:\u00a0</p><p>\"It is also clear that NSW and Victorian fire and land management authorities these days lack the expertise and experience of previous times to carry out large-scale indirect fire suppression operations \u2014 that is, strategic backburning to create effective fire breaks in the face of a running fire. Backburning is often the only effective strategy, but in long-unburnt bushland it is dangerous and can easily go wrong if conducted by people who don\u2019t have the necessary experience and know-how, or the right sort of resources, to ensure the flames do not get away. Attempting backburning under extreme conditions and without very skilled and experienced firefighters in control is a recipe for calamity.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 12</emphasis> relates to firefighting aircraft, tools and technology that are not a substitute for effective on ground firefighting, but to make on ground efforts safer. IFA (2020) notes: </p><p>\"Firefighting aircraft, tools and technology are not a substitute for effective on-ground firefighting. The primary focus of fire control should always be around on-ground efforts with aircraft, tools and technology being used to make on-ground efforts safer and more effective.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 13</emphasis> relates to the creation of more opportunities for increased adoption of new technology that can increase firefighter safety, including firefighting. Opportunities includes safe use of drones for reconnaissance and to optimise, speed up and better organise bushfire attack; fire detection cameras and satellites during bushfire events (noting apps for the later are useful).\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 14 </emphasis>relates to cases where the use of local knowledge in prescribed burns and bushfire fighting/ techniques hasn\u2019t been optimal, noting the decline in this area over time, creating extra firefighter safety risks. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 15</emphasis> relates to poor air quality conditions during long duration major bushfires such as 2019/ 20, made worse by heavy fuels, dead tree fuel, dense understories, long fire runs and long bushfire durations.\u00a0 This increases the difficulties and health impacts on firefighters.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JODSEAPic7.11.23.jpg\">Hazardous smoke conditions in the Tumbarumba on 5 January 2020, in this case during mopping up.\u00a0 These conditions were common during that period, common for firefighters and emergency personnel.</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Loss of skilled resources</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 16</emphasis> is the loss of skilled forest bushfire fighter resources, skills of experienced firefighters with skillsets from \u201cbetter times\u201d, ongoing loss of volunteers and with the loss of forestry/ timber contractor skillsets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Communications</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 17</emphasis> is weaknesses in the design and protection of radio towers, communications towers and electricity lines to support radio and phone technology by firefighters and the community during bushfire disaster events.\u00a0 Inadequate communication between different but adjacent brigade regions can be an issue when major communication systems are down.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Learning and safety review hierarchy</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number 18 </emphasis>is failure to adequately listen to major by experienced retired firefighters/ fire organisations in relation to concerns about firefighter safety, firefighting and other issues in inquiries, Royal Commissions and generally.\u00a0 An example is outlined in \"The Utter Failure of Yet Another Bushfire Panel\" (2020) relating to the Bushfire Royal Commission after the 2019/ 20 bushfires:</p><p>\"... when it was let slip by a Commission staffer that submissions from \u201clay people\u201d would not be treated as seriously as those from people within the emergency services.

All were extinguished within hours.</p><p>The Country Fire Authority has warned that the Mallee, Wimmera and North Country regions, much of which were underwater just weeks ago but have now mostly dried out, are subject to high fire danger ratings until later this week.</p><p>Fire Risk Consultants managing director Graeme Taylor said the back-to-back years of wet weather fuelled by La Nina had resulted in phenomenal grass growth.</p><p>\"The risk with a lot of dry grass across the landscape is that in February or January, when you get those hot, windy days, there's certainly the chance of fast-moving grass fires.\"</p><p>Taylor said grass fires could travel up to 25km/h in windy conditions. Grass can ignite when it is 40 per cent dried out, or \"cured\", and will definitely ignite when 60 per cent cured. The taller and drier the grass, the more intensely it will burn.</p><p>Taylor said that in seasons of prolific growth, such as this one, grass slashing programs needed to be increased to meet the risk. \"There is still lots of unmanaged [grass] on roadsides. This is always an issue, and we can't drop the ball on roadside fuel management,\" he said.</p><p>Slashing, essentially mowing grassy areas, is carried out by Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic).</p><p>Earlier this month, FFMVic said 1400 hectares would be slashed in the Mallee region. Another 2000 hectares was slashed across central Victoria.</p><p>FFMVic said after this year's floods, rapid regrowth was a possibility and some areas might need extra treatment. Weatherzone meteorologist Andrew Schmidt said areas in Victoria's north, which will reach 40 degrees today, were likely to carry a high - but not catastrophic - fire danger rating.</p><p>\"Heading into next year, I think we'll experience a bit more dry weather, as well as hotter weather, than we've experienced over the past several months,\" he said.</p><p>\"The key ingredients we usually need for an elevated bushfire risk include low dew points - which is to say dry weather, not humid - high temperatures and gusty winds.\"</p><p>Kevin Tolhurst, a University of Melbourne associate professor in fire ecology and management, said dry lightning storms passing over semi-arid areas could set fires, which was more likely in February when conditions were driest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7o7oxz1kx6o1gfb18hc1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:675R-H2N1-F0J6-J3K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"528\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 27, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

we can invest in the equipment, technology and infrastructure they need to reduce the risk of the next bushfire season.\" <br/><br/>Nearly $340 million will be provided to fund Forest Fire Management workers and firefighters while ensuring their technology, fire towers and equipment are 'up to scratch'. <br/><br/>New digital radios to help Forest Fire Management Victoria staff avoid black spots and improve communication with other emergency services will be purchased with a $133 million commitment. <br/><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ MORE: <url

Register your burn-off via the Fire Permits Victoria website (firepermits.vic.gov.au), or call 1800 668 511. Notify neighbours if your activity will generate fire and smoke. Check and monitor weather conditions - particularly wind - on the day and coming days. Leave a three-metre fire break, free from flammable materials around the burn. Have sufficient equipment and water to stop the fire spreading; don't leave it unattended Make sure you properly extinguish your fire before you leave it.

measures, including a new office that will collaborate with other agencies and communities, and upgrades to firefighting technology. </p><p><br/><br/>The funding package is part of the upcoming state budget this month, and aims to help reduce the risk of future bushfires in a changing climate, according to energy, environment and climate change minister Lily D'Ambrosio. <br/><br/>\"Our first responders and local communities band together to do an incredible job protecting Victorians throughout bushfire season,\" she said in a statement. <br/><br/>\"While we can't ever thank them enough -- we can invest in the equipment, technology and infrastructure they need to reduce the risk of the next bushfire season.\" <br/><br/>Nearly $340 million will be provided to fund Forest Fire Management workers and firefighters while ensuring their technology, fire towers and equipment are 'up to scratch'. <br/><br/>New digital radios to help Forest Fire Management Victoria staff avoid black spots and improve communication with other emergency services will be purchased with a $133 million commitment. <br/><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ MORE: <url

the Inspector General for Emergency Management and the bushfires royal commission -- which both examined the 2019-2020 bushfires -- $21 million will be provided to establish a new Office of Bushfire Risk Management. <br/><br/>The office will work with Forest Fire Management Victoria, the Country Fire Authority, Emergency Management Victoria, as well as local government, landholders, road authorities and the community to reduce the risk of bushfires on public and private land. <br/><br/>D'Ambrosio said the new entity would also have a key role in delivering recommended improvements to land and fire management. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, $15.6 million will fund measures to address long grasses and other highly flammable undergrowth, such as fuel management along major arterial road and rail corridors, additional planned burns, specialist skills and machinery, and advanced bushfire risk modelling. <br/><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ MORE: <url

disaster law to hold feds to account</url></emphasis><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cultural land and fire-management practices<br/>D'Ambrosio has also announced a $22.5 million investment to 'reinvigorate' Traditional Owner-led cultural land and fire management practices, by supporting Aboriginal Victorians to implement the Victorian Traditional Owner Cultural Fire Strategy. <br/><br/>She said the support for cultural burning would promote self-determination, reduce extreme fires, rejuvenate local flora, protect native animal habitats, and respond to weeds and pests. <br/><br/>\"For tens of thousands of years, Traditional Owners and their knowledge of Country has been protecting and making the most of our natural environment,\" D'Ambrosio said. <br/><br/>\"With this investment, we'll make sure Aboriginal culture and knowledge continues to inform the way the land is cared for.\" <br/><br/>The funding will go towards establishing an Aboriginal-led Cultural Fire Leadership group, supporting Traditional Owners in sharing cultural burning techniques with state emergency services and conservation groups, and providing employment opportunities for First Peoples' communities.

So fire dangers and particularly in those grassland areas are elevated and our communities need to think about what they're doing to prepare for the summer season.\"</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria acting chief fire officer Allyson Lardner said even though rainfall is predicted to continue and cooler weather will remain, conditions can change quickly. </p><p>\"Victoria remains one of the most highly bushfire prone areas of the world,\" she said. </p><p>\"It's important to remember that it will only take a few hot and windy days to change conditions and increase bushfire risk quickly.\"</p><p>Bureau of meteorology meteorologist Kevin Parkin said although the state has copped \"two Springs worth of rainfall\" across the north and northeast, Summer will bring hotter weather and the likelihood of bushfires will increase. </p><p>\"While we're starting from very wet conditions and probably (a) continuation of that into December, (there will be a) drying trend as we head more into summer proper,\" he said. </p><p>\"That is likely to push out in terms of drying the fuel. We certainly would expect some fire activity.\"</p><p>Mr Parkin said it has been the wettest spring on record in the northern plains, and noted well-above average rain in Melbourne led to swollen rivers and the major flood experienced by residents of Maribyrnong in the state's inner north west in late October. </p><p>He said there are likely to be below average temperatures in December and above average rainfall, but January and February will warm up. </p><p>\"We're expecting things to trend more towards what we would normally expect for summer so some heatwaves without them being exceptional,\" he said. </p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said there will be a lower risk of bushfires in east Gippsland and south west Gippsland, located about 350 east of Melbourne, as well as in the Otways and the central highlands including around Macedon and Daylesford. </p><p>\"The rest of the state is at normal fire potential. It will get hot and there will be fires in Victoria and we need to be ready.\"</p><p>Major flooding took communities in Rochester, Shepparton and Echuca by surprise in October as record amounts of rainfall massively increased the Campaspe, Murray and Goulburn river flows. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Although this thriller is obviously treading a well-worn path, it does so with real poise, purpose and surprisingly menacing intent. Punchy writing and direction comes from Taylor Sheridan (who penned the great Sicario and the hit series Yellowstone).</p><p>ONLY THE BRAVE Rent only *** 1/2 A gripping true story of one of the deadliest wildfires in US history: the Yarnell Hill blaze of July 2013. Unusually, the filmmakers humbly humanise not just the heroic members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots - the first rural firefighting crew ever licensed to tackle major-category blazes - but also their family and friends. A superb ensemble cast is led by Josh Brolin, Jeff Bridges, Miles Teller and Jennifer Connelly.</p><p>BACKDRAFT Binge, Foxtel or Rent *** Life in the fire brigade is not all hoses and hydrants, as rookie ladder man Brian (William Baldwin) discovers when he joins an elite unit headed by his grouchy older brother Stephen (Kurt Russell). Meanwhile, a serial-killing loon is handing out surprise cremations to prominent citizens around town.

brigade</url>.</p><p>Country Fire Service Chief Officer Brett Loughlin said Ms Hincks made a \"truly significant impact on so many lives\".</p><p>\"Alongside her most important roles of mother, wife, daughter and sister, Louise was a great friend, colleague and first responder who always made the time to help others,\" he said.</p><p>Happy Valley brigade chief Mike Patterson said the garden was funded by donations from the community as well as contributions from\u00a0the State Government, the CFS Foundation and the City of Onkaparinga council.</p><p>\"It is a place that we can now be able to spend time, remember Louise and take time out to reflect whenever we want to,\" he said.</p><p>Ms Hincks's daughters Alice and Addie Fleming expressed their gratitude to the members of the\u00a0Happy Valley brigade, who they described as their family, and spoke of their mother's devotion to helping others.</p><p>Alice said her mother had a lifelong dedication\u00a0to the CFS, which she joined at 16.</p><p>\"She would never stop and take a break and when she finally did that bloody pager would go off and she would be out the door again, loving every minute of it,\" she said.</p><p>Alice and Addie are CFS cadets and plan to join the Happy Valley brigade in the next couple of years.</p><p>\"We knew we wanted to join before mum had passed away, however we are now even more passionate to join because we want to continue her legacy as the legend and hero she really was,\" Alice said.</p><p>Ms Hincks's husband Lindsay said the garden was a\u00a0place of memorial and reflection.</p><p>\"Louise would be embarrassed, but also a little bit excited about this garden in her honour,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Hincks said he and his wife had\u00a0an\u00a0agreement to never go out to emergency jobs\u00a0in the same team or in the same appliance.</p><p>\"You\u00a0can always plan for something, but I tell you what \u2014 when it comes to fruition you just have to work through it and take it day by day,\" he said.</p><p>Premier Peter Malinauskas also gave tribute to Ms Hincks's dedication\u00a0to helping others and the commitment of CFS volunteers more broadly.</p><p>\"This selflessness, while representative of Louise's unwavering sense of duty, it is also representative of our state's CFS volunteers more broadly who readily drop everything to go where they are needed most,\" he said.</p><p>\"We trust the CFS because they are always there for South Australians in fires, today in floods, in all natural disasters.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Although this thriller is obviously treading a well-worn path, it does so with real poise, purpose and surprisingly menacing intent. Punchy writing and direction comes from Taylor Sheridan (who penned the great Sicario and the hit series Yellowstone).</p><p>ONLY THE BRAVE Rent only *** 1/2 A gripping true story of one of the deadliest wildfires in US history: the Yarnell Hill blaze of July 2013. Unusually, the filmmakers humbly humanise not just the heroic members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots - the first rural firefighting crew ever licensed to tackle major-category blazes - but also their family and friends. A superb ensemble cast is led by Josh Brolin, Jeff Bridges, Miles Teller and Jennifer Connelly.</p><p>BACKDRAFT Binge, Foxtel or Rent *** Life in the fire brigade is not all hoses and hydrants, as rookie ladder man Brian (William Baldwin) discovers when he joins an elite unit headed by his grouchy older brother Stephen (Kurt Russell). Meanwhile, a serial-killing loon is handing out surprise cremations to prominent citizens around town.

With the state on fire, it was all hands - and machines - on deck.</p><p>He said Des and Alan were creating a fire break that would have restricted the 15,940ha fire to just 120ha of state forest - something 133 times smaller that would have taken one day to extinguish instead of 55.</p><p>The break was meant to intersect with the Charcoal Track at Dales Creek at the north end of the blaze.</p><p>The break - and the men who made it - were caught 30m short of the target, and possible safety.</p><p>A small pile of rocks in overgrown bush now marks the site.</p><p>\"The rate of expansion of those fires was massive. The country was so dry,\" Mr McHugh said. \"People in the department said that in 30 years of this kind of work they had never seen anything as unpredictable as Greendale that afternoon.\"</p><p>Mr McHugh said the first that wives Carol Collins and Christine Lynch heard about the deaths was a report on television.</p><p>His book explains that they immediately went to the Daylesford Forests Commission office, but could not get definite answers.</p><p>Confirmation came at 7pm when the office manager door-knocked both homes.</p><p>Des - a veteran of the 1966 Battle of Long Tan - left Carol with four children aged three-13.</p><p>Christine had two girls aged 8 and 9. She passed away in 2014 and is buried alongside Alan in Daylesford.</p><p>\"The outpouring of grief was immediate and widespread for Carol and Christine and their families by the entire community,\" he said.</p><p>\"There was a huge turnout of around 1000 people at the funeral.</p><p>\"It's been an emotional journey for the Lynch and Collins families.\"</p><p>Seven Commission employees gave evidence at an inquest with Coroner Lance Pilgrim SM in Ballarat on 15 April 1983.</p><p>Again it was eclipsed: this time by the visit of Charles and Diana just metres away in Ballarat's main street.</p><p>Mr McHugh said he was concerned that the story of the Greendale fire was not widely known.</p><p>\"You tried to search on Google and there was just nothing,\" he said. \"The deaths of those two guys shocked the Forests Commission to the core at the time, but a few weeks later it was overshadowed by the Macedon Fire (1 February 1983), a huge Melbourne dust storm (8 February) and Ash Wednesday (16 February).</p><p>Mr McHugh felt compelled to write his 250-page book - and has made sure the State Library has a copy for generations to come in the form of a free e-book..</p><p>Released in October 2022, it attracted 120,000 hits in 48 hours and is free to access.</p><p>Last week's service at the Greendale's Egan Reserve was supported by Tony English who is the Deputy Chief Fire Officer of the Forest Fire Management Victoria: the agency the men would have worked for, had they been alive today (following nine name changes since 1983).</p><p>\"There were some tears. Everyone reacted in their own way,\" Mr McHugh said.</p><p>\"I knew of Des and Alan - but I didn't know them personally. For me and my wife, recording what happened was one of the most worthwhile things we've done in a while.

Now, she is taking to the skies. \"I thought hang on, there's no women in the air, so I asked myself 'why can't I have a go'?\" she said.</p><p>\"Representation for women is increasing on the ground but we need more women to have more opportunities to have roles in the air and develop their knowledge to use in that air attack role. It's time for a change.</p><p>\"We need to support women with their goals.\" Ms Burns completed her air attack training in October, a collaborative effort between the Country Fire Authority (CFA), Forest Fire Management Victoria and Fire Rescue Victoria.</p><p>\"It's taken a long time and there's been a lot of barriers but I want other people to know they can get there and I'm 100 per cent behind them,\" Ms Burns said.</p><p>In her new role, she is responsible for the safe and effective tactical coordination of aircraft. It involves making decisions on dropping water or retardant from the helicopter to battle bushfires, while working with others in the air and on the ground.</p><p>\"We're the first people to be up there and to make the decisions of where to drop the loads during first attack (those who are first to arrive on the scene),\" Ms Burns said. Staff are rostered on during the peak bushfire season between October and March. The crews also undertake safety briefings and mock scenarios.</p><p>Ms Burns said it was a long journey to where she was now, but said throughout the program she was well-supported. \"When you had those moments of why I'm doing this or putting this pressure on myself, they were so supportive. I can't thank them enough.\"</p><p>In her current role, Ms Burns works as a ranger team leader at Port Campbell National Park, where she patrols and manages the national park. \"That includes the 12 Apostles, lots of threatened flora and Australian wildlife,\" she said. \"All the stunning geological formations in that park are amazing.\"</p><p>Ms Burns said a core component of the role was forest fire management. In that role Ms Burns was involved in battling the major bushfires in Gippsland in 2020, Black Saturday and the Grampians fires in 2014. \"The Gippsland ones hit me hardest because it was so intense,\" she said.</p><p>\"There was horrific damage to the wildlife and the people who lost their homes. It's a sad occasion but I feel privileged and honoured to be able to support those communities through that.\"</p><p>Ms Burns lives her life by two mottos: 'You can't do what you can't see' and 'if he can, so can she'.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WRBLST-doc7j7zyxjlil21cdzb0m8q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRBLST2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64H4-HNM1-F0J6-J0DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

trees\u00a0will endanger everyone's lives.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the regional Victorian town of Linton, once richly\u00a0blanketed in native gum trees, spiky\u00a0dark-green pines are taking over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A historic gold hub, Linton is 30 minutes south-west of Ballarat and is bracketed by the Scarsdale Plantation, which is owned by HVP Plantations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Linton has some of Victoria's oldest pine plantation land but some of it has been reclaimed for conservation.</p><p>Residents say poor land management over the decades has led to the spread of pines \u2014 which\u00a0self-seed\u2014 across the town and conservation land.</p><p>This they say has become potential fuel for a fire.</p><p>Data from the 2021 census shows the population in Linton has nearly doubled in the last decade, but locals say this is not\u00a0the tree-change the newcomers are looking for.</p><p>One Linton advocate said\u00a0it was\u00a0not \"if\"\u00a0but \"when\"\u00a0a bushfire will start, and the risk to the town could be devastating.</p><p>Linton resident Halina Sztynda said she was very concerned about the Linton reservoir and surrounding land.</p><p>The Crown-owned property is managed by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning\u00a0and is metres from Ms Sztynda's home.</p><p>She said the area used to be filled with native plants and gum trees but was now\u00a0a wild pine forest.</p><p>Ms Sztynda said\u00a0the issue was not\u00a0just about the pine, with thick blackberry bramble, gauze hedge, bracken, and fallen trees littering the area.</p><p>\"I think we will lose the community if we don't have mitigating of this risk,\" she\u00a0said.</p><p>\"I believe that it needs to go back to the way it was some years ago, where you had people on the ground, not sitting behind a desk \u2026 actually working in the environment to protect [it].</p><p>\"We're actually sitting ducks.\"</p><p>DELWP said in a statement that Forest Fire Management Victoria removed pine seedlings adjacent to pine plantations.</p><p>\"Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) has completed about 1,200 hectares of planned burning in the Linton area over the past 10 years, with a further 885 hectares planned over the next two years,\" DELWP Midlands district manager David Watson said.</p><p>\"FFMVic also undertakes non-burn fuel management works such as mulching, mowing and slashing in the Midlands District, including in the Linton area.\"</p><p>In November 2021, locals held a meeting with representatives from HVP Plantations,the Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning, as well as Golden Plains councillors and members of the CFA.</p><p>Planning is underway by DELWP for another multi-agency meeting in December at nearby Smythesdale.</p><p>Linton community members will be invited to attend.</p><p>But, Ms Sztynda said so far, the community did not feel heard.</p><p>\"Just because we keep our own grass cut down low and we've got no vegetation in front of our properties doesn't mean that's going to protect us,\" she said.</p><p>\"Because of that risk we have around us \u2026 we're going to burn anyway.\"</p><p>Professor of bushfire science at the University of Melbourne, Trent Penman, has been conducting research at Linton in tandem with the public.</p><p>\"What we are trying to do \u2026 is understand the risk perceptions that the community have, and also use fire simulation modelling to understand whether those perceptions are matching the reality of the risk,\" Professor Penman said.</p><p>Professor Penman agreed there was an \"invasion\"\u00a0of pine that is shifting the local biodiversity, saying pine plantation fires were not easy to manage.</p><p>\"When it is dry, pine plantations are challenging from a fire perspective because you have that pine fuel from the ground to the top of the canopy,\" he said.</p><p>\"So, you tend to shift to a canopy fire much quicker than you would with a eucalypt fire, and that presents huge challenges for firefighters.\"</p><p>Captain of the Linton Fire Brigade, Gavin Ross, said the 50-strong CFA was\u00a0\"well aware of the risk\".</p><p>\"[A\u00a0pine fire] can be fairly volatile once it gets going,\" Mr Ross said.</p><p>\"There is a few spots we are concerned about \u2026 but we are very well prepared in the case of the fire.\"</p><p>Next year\u00a0will mark 25 years since a devastating wildfire in Linton, which claimed the lives of five volunteer firefighters from Geelong. The deaths led to a coronial inquest.</p><p>Linton resident and CFA volunteer Karen Sherlock said the memory of the horror fire was \"ever-present\".</p><p>\"Going that long without a fire \u2026 it means there is a lot of bush, there is a lot of growth \u2026 that is now very much encroaching on the town.\" Ms Sherlock said.</p><p>She said bureaucracy was playing a role in the lack of land management, as DELWP, Golden Plains Council, FFMVic and HVP Plantations did not always communicate.</p><p>\"We do have a number of disabled people in our community \u2026 physical or visual impairments. They are the ones who are at most risk if there is a fire,\" she said.</p><p>\"They're quite vocal about being frightened.\"</p><p>In a statement, HVP Plantations say they \"support local communities by responding to fires within our plantations and outside on other lands during fire seasons\".</p><p>Meanwhile, the Golden Plains Shire said Linton was classified as having a very high risk bushfire rating\u00a0and that the council welcomed\u00a0the opportunity to meet with the Linton community to discuss concerns.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-101319364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:665H-TMD1-JBN5-F349-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 16, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Fires:Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government and Politics:Local Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment:Environmental Management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia:VIC:Linton</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">HIGH-RISK fire days in the Geelong region could almost double by 2085, under new modelling completed by the Country Fire Authority (CFA).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The research, published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire, found that under different emissions -scenarios, both mean and extreme fire danger were expected to increase in Victoria.</p><p>Statewide, research modelling indicates a 10-20 per cent increase in the extreme Forest Fire Danger Index, with the greatest change projected in the northwest region.</p><p>But the greatest relative change in the number of very high days per year will be in central and eastern parts of Victoria.</p><p>The number of very high days in the central region, which includes Geelong, is expected to rise from the historical average of 12, recorded between 1973-2016, to 22.5 between 2085 and 2100.</p><p>Northwest Victoria's high-risk days are expected to jump from 60 to 100, and the northeast's from 17.5 to 39.</p><p>Report co-author Dr Sarah Harris said that scenarios used in the research showed increased temperature, caused by human-induced climate change, to be the main driver of heightened fire danger.</p><p>\"Changes in temperature, humidity and rainfall during spring and early summer mean the fire season will continue to start earlier and run longer,\" Dr Harris said.</p><p>\" As a flow-on effect, springtime opportunities for prescribed burning could reduce.\" CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said he was proud of the CFA's robust research program, which he said brought further understanding of the impact of climate change in the context of firefighting.</p><p>\"As firefighters, we see the effects of these longer and more severe fire seasons and it's important that we turn our minds towards what fire-fighting looks like in the not-too-distant future,\" Mr Heffernan said.</p><p>\"CFA is undertaking work to identify challenges brought on by climate change and increased fire risk, and ways to solve them through adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>\"CFA also proudly works to reduce our own greenhouse emissions, through initiatives such as increasing our use of rooftop solar and the number of hybrid vehicles in the fleet.\" Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said climate change was increasing the risk bushfires posed to the community.</p><p>\"That's why our strategic approach to managing bushfire risk is based on the best evidence available, such as this research,\" Mr Hardman said. \"We have a 365-day approach to fuel management, more mechanical treatment and increasing capacity to contain bushfires at first attack.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

TEXT</h><p>Above-average winter rainfall will cut the spring bushfire risk across eastern parts of Victoria and NSW and in the ACT, the latest outlook shows.But\u00a0AFAC, the national council for fire and emergency services, says the risk is varied across the rest of the country with parts of Western Australia and central Australia showing above-average fire potential.Fuel loads in those areas are either fully cured or are expected to cure with warmer and drier seasonal conditions predicted in spring.\"Much of Australia has experienced above-average winter rainfall and this is expected to persist for many regions throughout spring due to a convergence of climate influences,\" the AFAC outlook says.\"Historically, forest fire activity in southeast Australia is lower during a La Nina or negative Indian Ocean Dipole year.\u00a0<br/>\"However, regions that see above average rainfall leading to increased grass vegetation growth can subsequently see an increase in grassfire risk during short periods of warmer and drier conditions within the season.\"Low fuel loads remain across areas in NSW, Victoria and the ACT devastated by the 2019-2020 bushfires.Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania are expected to have a normal risk of fire, along with regional NSW and western Victoria.The latest bushfire outlook used data from the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System, which comes into force on September 1.The rating system calculates, forecasts and reports fire danger using up-to-date state fuel data, spatial and satellite imaging and weather forecasting.The system will also introduce nationally consistent colours, signs and terminology to ensure everyone can understand the threat level and what they need to do to stay safe.It features four fire danger ratings, ranging from moderate through to high, extreme and catastrophic.\"The way fire danger ratings are communicated has\u00a0been improved and simplified, to make it easier for Australians to make decisions to stay safe on days of fire danger risk,\" AFAC said.\"This means that wherever you go in Australia, and whatever the season or fuels you're surrounded with, you can understand the level of threat and what you need to do to stay safe.\u00a0\"The key benefit is a more prepared and resilient community resulting in a reduction in loss of life, property, and human harm.\"AFAC is holding a conference in Adelaide this week.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

burns created hazy conditions across the city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the smoke could return in coming weeks, with autumn the best time for authorities to conduct planned burns across the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Planned burns in the Yarra Ranges sent the smell of smoke across Melbourne on Monday, with the smell still lingering in the eastern suburbs on Tuesday.</p><p>But Forest Fire Management Victoria deputy chief fire officer Tamara Beckett said the smell should ease by Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Ms Beckett said the past five days had presented clear warm days with light winds and cooler damp air returning overnight, which supported safe burning operations. </p><p>\"This has provided an opportunity for our crews to carry out some of our highest priority bushfire risk reduction burns (last) weekend, particularly in Melbourne's east,\" she said.</p><p>And more planned burning is on the way.</p><p>\"With milder weather, autumn is a critical time to undertake most of our planned burning and there is a short window of time to do so, which means it does unavoidably include long weekends and school holidays,\" Ms Beckett said.</p><p>\"We need to do planned burns after summer when we control the risk of fire in the landscape, but before winter when it is too wet.</p><p>\"It's important that crews take every opportunity while conditions are right to reduce bushfire risk, however we know that smoke from burns can raise concern.</p><p>\"The program is underpinned by scientific evidence, local knowledge, and continuous improvement to make sure planned burning activities are focused where they can be most effective.</p><p>\"Before undertaking planned burning, we engage with local communities to notify people of burns in their area as close to the time as possible, so that people can take the right precautions.\"</p><p>Ms Beckett said where possible, people - especially those with pre-existing lung or heart conditions - should minimise exposure to bushfire smoke including staying in indoors and keeping windows closed.</p><p>It comes after residents from Bulleen, Diamond Creek, Burwood, Kilsyth, Ferntree Gully, Mt Evelyn, and the northern suburbs reported smelling heavy smoke on Sunday night.</p><p>Several CFA brigades took to Facebook to reassure residents the smoke was coming from planned burns.</p><p>The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning issued a message about the smoke for residents in the eastern, southern metropolitan and northern and western metropolitan areas at 9.37pm on the VicEmergency App.</p><p>\"Smoke may be visible from nearby communities and roads, as there is a planned burn in Eastern Melbourne sending smoke across the city,\" the message read.</p><p>\"There is no immediate threat to the community and no action is required.\"</p><p>The Lilydale SES said the smoke had come from planned burns in the Montrose/Mt Evelyn area.</p><p>\"Please take care of yourself, consider closing windows and having your reliever medications handy if you need them,\" the unit posted on Facebook. </p><p>\"Planned burns are important to keep fuel loads low, and it would seem the lower temperatures and change of wind direction has started moving the smoke Lilydale and Mooroolbark bound.\"</p><p>It comes after Forest Fire Management Victoria announced it plans last week to ramp up planned burning across the state.</p><p>Ms Beckett said FFMVic conducted planned burns based on conditions rather than seasons, which meant planned burns could take place at any time throughout the year.</p><p>\"As long as the conditions allow and it is safe to do so, we will carry out as many of our high priority burns in bushfire prone areas as we can,\" she said.</p><p>\"We will undertake planned burns to reduce fire risk near communities, essential infrastructure and assets like water catchments, and ecological burns - particularly in the western grasslands - to help support rare and protected flora and fauna.\"</p><p>FFMVic works closely with the Bureau of Meteorology to monitor weather conditions - such as humidity, temperature and wind speed - and will only carry out burns when conditions are right.</p><p>To be notified of planned burns near you, visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://plannedburns.ffm.vic.gov.au/\">vic.gov.au/plannedburns</url> or phone 1800 226

There are clear provisions in the National Parks Act that prohibit the removal of timber, including it being an offence to cut or take away fallen or felled timber.</p><p>Southern Dandenong Landcare President Robert Pergl said the storm-tossed forest is still recovering. \"It's essential the affected forest is managed with a greater level of sensitivity and salvage logging will compromise the ecological integrity of this park.\"</p><p>Australian National University ecologist Professor David Lindenmayer expressed shock at the plan.</p><p>\"I've never heard of this happening in a national park in Australia - it's entirely inappropriate,\" said ecologist Professor David Lindenmayer.</p><p>\"Salvage logging is the most damaging form of logging because it's a double disturbance. You have a wind storm, or a fire, and as the system is recovering you kick it in the teeth by logging,\" he said.</p><p>The local landcare groups have done walking surveys of the two areas and estimate about 30 per cent of the tree canopy has been damaged, which they say does not justify the planned works. Much of it was not storm damaged, they said. In meetings with community groups, the department said logs removed from the national park would be sold, with any proceeds split between the department and VicForests.</p><p>Where debris was removed, it would be \"provided to the community as firewood and other timber products, and commercial use\", the department later said in a statement. Any proceeds from the commercial supply of debris would be used to reduce the cost of the operation and to rehabilitate storm damaged landscapes, it said.</p><p>Victorian National Parks Association's Jordan Crook said it was not the role of national parks to supply pulp mills or meet timber contracts.</p><p>\"This highlights the conflict of interest and commercial incentive of VicForests at a time of state-wide timber shortage,\" he said.</p><p>VicForests recorded an unprecedented $52.4 million financial loss this year, which it blamed on the cost of court cases brought against it by community environment groups.</p><p>In its 2021-22 annual report,VicForests' chief executive, Monique Dawson, said the year had been \"incredibly challenging\" and the agency did not meet its wood supply targets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7o659io3cm11laj0hhc1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6753-KC31-JD34-V18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
