But they're doing it a week before the season, so there's a lot of people that will quite rightly not take their dog with them, and that will actually lead to more ducks being shot, because the people won't be able to retrieve as many ducks.\"</p><p>Mr Bourmann says using hunters to help reduce fox and feral numbers in state parks and reserves has been raised by his party \"time and time again.\"</p><p>\"It goes into the deep black hole that is DELWP and commonsense - and you may quote me on that,\" Mr Bourmann says.</p><p>\"The problem is there's a lot of people in DELWP that are proper environmentalists; they know the best way of getting rid of these pest animals is with a gun and not laying waste to the countryside with poison. But then there's some committed greenie types who are just opposed to hunting. So it just ends up being a disaster area. And it's all the other animals that basically pay the price.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) said the agency had been laying baits in Mt Hooghly, Bung Bong and Wareek state forests, to reduce the number of foxes in the area, which prey on nearby livestock as well as native species.</p><p>\"Risk assessments are undertaken to guide the timing of baiting activities, baiting locations and the placement of baits to ensure there is minimal impact on native animals and other non-target species. Baiting is conducted by a qualified and experienced controller,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>\"Fox baits are buried to a specified depth according to Victorian Directions for Use and manufacturer's guidelines to reduce risks to native animals, which are generally unlikely to uncover buried baits.\"</p><p>The department says 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) is registered and approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for the control of a variety of pest animals in Victoria.</p><p>The use of 1080 baits is only one element of pest animal management and is used as part of an integrated pest animal control program. Integrated pest animal control requires planning, the use of a range of control tools and is best achieved with cooperation from adjoining land managers.</p><p>FFMVic Senior Forest Manager and Roading Officer, Lynda Mabon said the baiting program will run until 30 May 2022.</p><p>\"Foxes are a pest animal in Australia and attack livestock and wildlife. Every year, foxes are responsible for significant stock losses, especially during lambing season,\" Ms Mabon said.</p><p>\"Foxes are also known to carry diseases and increase the spread of weeds in our state forests.\"</p><p>Ms Mabon said baits containing 1080 poison would be buried in bait stations in the program areas, with baits monitored regularly and replaced weekly.

He warned the consequences of malfunctioning items could range from a scorch, to a fire that destroyed a home, or even took lives.CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said autumn and winter were the highest risk periods for residential fires in Victortia, in part due to increased use of home heating.Mr Heffernan reminded people to never leave portable heaters and fireplaces unattended, and to turn heaters off before leaving a room. </p><p>He said people should check their heaters were in good working condition, and gas heaters should be professionally serviced every two years.More information about preventing fires in the home is available at: bit.ly/2PLfU5u</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc7fb7ec4rkt5fyogmh41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DP-NSR1-JD34-V411-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"311\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He warned the consequences of malfunctioning items could range from a scorch, to a fire that destroyed a home, or even took lives.CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said autumn and winter were the highest risk periods for residential fires in Victortia, in part due to increased use of home heating.Mr Heffernan reminded people to never leave portable heaters and fireplaces unattended, and to turn heaters off before leaving a room. </p><p>He said people should check their heaters were in good working condition, and gas heaters should be professionally serviced every two years.More information about preventing fires in the home is available at: bit.ly/2PLfU5u</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc7fb7e00ogy81azgadh41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DP-NSR1-JD34-V425-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"311\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But they're doing it a week before the season, so there's a lot of people that will quite rightly not take their dog with them, and that will actually lead to more ducks being shot, because the people won't be able to retrieve as many ducks.\"</p><p>Mr Bourmann says using hunters to help reduce fox and feral numbers in state parks and reserves has been raised by his party \"time and time again\".</p><p>\"It goes into the deep black hole that is DELWP and common sense - and you may quote me on that,\" Mr Bourmann says.</p><p>\"The problem is there's a lot of people in DELWP that are proper environmentalists; they know the best way of getting rid of these pest animals is with a gun and not laying waste to the countryside with poison. But then there's some committed greenie types who are just opposed to hunting. So it just ends up being a disaster area. And it's all the other animals that basically pay the price.\"</p><p>A Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) spokesperson said the agency had been laying baits in Mt Hooghly, Bung Bong and Wareek state forests, to reduce the number of foxes in the area, which prey on nearby livestock as well as native species.</p><p>\"Risk assessments are undertaken to guide the timing of baiting activities, baiting locations and the placement of baits to ensure there is minimal impact on native animals and other non-target species. Baiting is conducted by a qualified and experienced controller,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>\"Fox baits are buried to a specified depth according to Victorian Directions for Use and manufacturer's guidelines to reduce risks to native animals, which are generally unlikely to uncover buried baits.\"</p><p>The department says 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) is registered and approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for the control of a variety of pest animals in Victoria.</p><p>The use of 1080 baits is only one element of pest animal management and is used as part of an integrated pest animal control program. Integrated pest animal control requires planning, the use of a range of control tools and is best achieved with cooperation from adjoining land managers.</p><p>FFMVic Senior Forest Manager and Roading Officer Lynda Mabon said the baiting program would run until May 30, 2022.</p><p>\"Foxes are a pest animal in Australia and attack livestock and wildlife. Every year, foxes are responsible for significant stock losses, especially during lambing season,\" Ms Mabon said.</p><p>\"Foxes are also known to carry diseases and increase the spread of weeds in our state forests.\"</p><p>Ms Mabon said baits containing 1080 poison would be buried in bait stations in the program areas, with baits monitored regularly and replaced weekly. The baits will be removed at the end of the program.</p><p>\"Baits are buried in bait stations according to strict guidelines that minimise the risk of other species taking them,\" she said.</p><p>\"These baits could pose a risk to domestic animals and we ask nearby landholders to ensure their dogs and other pets are confined to their property.</p><p>\"Neighbouring landowners have been notified of the program and signs have been placed at entrances to the control areas so that visitors are aware of the baiting.\"</p><p>Under the Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994, foxes are declared pests.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc7kd3slf4tjadaesm79c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6546-68B1-JD34-V4TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 1, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Forestry hunt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Animal welfare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protection of species</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CMA3</classCode><className>SPORT HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN66</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS REGULATION &amp;

Anyone who is operating any machinery in long grass at the moment, including driving a car, needs to be aware that they're likely to cause a fire.\"</p><p>Praising the work of firefighters, ACFO Fradd said there had been an \"enormous amount of resources\" put into the two fires this week.</p><p>The Beaufort fire required dozens of firefighters working on more than 30 fire trucks as well as fire bomber aircraft, in addition to support from Forest Fire Management Victoria and the council.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Burrumbeet fire resulted in dark gray plumes of smoke billowing across the area and the highway being closed for a short time.</p><p>Bringing it under control also required significant resources - 10 fire trucks, several field command vehicles, air support as well as police.</p><p>Aside from the initial emergency response, the fires require monitoring in the days afterwards to ensure every single ember has been extinguished so it does not reignite in windy conditions.</p><p>He said work to prepare properties for the fire season should have long been completed and no permits to burn-off would be issued for at least four or five weeks.</p><p>\"It is very dry out there now so it is time for the community to pay attention to what they're doing, because our volunteer firefighters cannot keep up this pace for the next six weeks,\" ACFO Fradd said. \"It is very draining for them.\"</p><p>\"If you're considering works you need to consider if you can control a fire if one starts. If you are doubting if you can, the safest thing to do is to hold off until we've had some rain and it's a lot safer to do.\"</p><p>But if property owners deem it absolutely necessary to complete work now, he said it was \"critical\" to ensure fire suppression equipment was at hand.</p><p>This equipment includes extinguishers and a pump connected to enough water.</p><p>Equipment should be well maintained before use, while the likelihood of equipment hitting a rock and sparking a fire should also be considered.</p><p>Police are notified for investigation if a fire is deemed to be recklessly lit, with the potential for charges to be laid.</p><p>\"We have little sympathy around these types of fires because they are completely avoidable.\"</p><p>Our team of local journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the Ballarat community.

While the fire danger rating was classified as 'high' on Sunday, it will be 'very high' on Monday, though Mr Verdoorn said it was pushing into the 'severe' category.</p><p>Emergency services are prepped to rapidly respond to a fire, with numerous control centres to be operational. This includes the Incident Control Centre - which sees representatives from agencies including CFA, Victoria Police, Forest Fire Management Victoria and local councils - which will be up and running in Sebastopol from 10am.</p><p>Mr Verdoorn urged residents to ensure their fire plans are prepared in case a grass fire was to ignite, as they move much faster than a bushfire. If living in an urban fringe area close to open grasslands and a fire breaks out and it is too late to leave, the advice is to walk - not drive - at least two streets back. With thick smoke produced from grass fires that could pose a risk while driving, it also means the roads will not be congested and emergency vehicles will be able to reach the fire as quickly as possible.</p><p>As many people have taken a long weekend, Mr Verdoorn said there was a concern about the number of campers in regional Victoria. While a total fire ban has not declared for the area on Monday, he still urged people to consider not lighting a campfire, but if it is completely necessary then to ensure it is completely extinguished before leaving a site.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc7e7n62ksok3p3szd6fi</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61V9-7TP1-F0J6-J1T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"284\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 25, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Traffic accident</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N721211MM</classCode><className>RV PARKS &amp; CAMPGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's the methodology in which it's harvested that we must get right.\"</p><p>He said the industry had worked with VicForests to develop harvesting prescriptions and to ensure value for all.</p><p>\"We've always had pretty much a place around the table and as an industry. I think we've done very well. But I don't say the outcomes match that.</p><p>\"We've worked with VicForests over the time and that's really led to nowhere.

At one point it looked like it would pass to the south. Then just before dawn, it swung towards him.</p><p>\"The spot fires were bombing everywhere and they just came together as one unit,\" he said. \"It had waves, walls of fire - like one-and-a-half, two metres high - just rolling through the paddock towards us, my hay shed and towards the Salways, towards their place.\"</p><p>Robert Salway, 63, and his son Patrick, 29, were in the paddock close to their house defending the property, with Robert on a bulldozer and Patrick on a four-wheel motorbike. Neither would survive.</p><p>Photographs tendered to the inquiry indicated that by the time it hit their property, a pyrocumulus - or fire-generated thunderstorm - had formed, causing cyclonic winds. Large established trees were uprooted and their branches thrown up to 100 metres from where they fell. Vehicle parts were strewn up to 500 metres from their original positions. The roller door was ripped from the machinery shed and one of its walls wrapped around the water tank.</p><p>A few hundred metres away, green swathes of pasture remained untouched.</p><p>NSW Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan is inquiring into the cause and manner of 25 deaths associated with the 2019-20 bushfires, and the origin of 91 fires.</p><p>She heard evidence yesterday about the death of Colin Burns, 72, who died in his vehicle after the Badja fire hit his bush block near Belowra, further inland from Cobargo, Robert Salway, a fifth generation dairy farmer, and his youngest son Patrick, an engineer and father to one boy.</p><p>The court heard that Mr Burns, who was described as generous, loyal and \"stubborn\", was determined to stay and defend his property, despite warnings from his friend, the captain of the NSW Rural Fire Service brigade at Belowra, Ewan Thompson, he was in grave danger if the wind changed direction.</p><p>\"He never changed his mind at all,\" Mr Thompson said.</p><p>The Badja fire is linked to seven deaths.

possibility of fighting fires while also dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fire agencies are preparing for another dangerous fire season this summer with the La Nina weather event expected to increase spring rainfall, resulting in more grass growing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a video conference with regional media on Wednesday, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said behind the work going into the pandemic are massive preparations for the upcoming fire season.</p><p>More news</p><p>Calls mount for regional bubble as virus restrictions take hold No new COVID-19 cases in central Victoria, active cases remain steady \"Part of the challenge of these things is a lot of effort has to go into dealing with the principle challenge but you have all these other challenges, that you know are coming, in the background,\" he said.</p><p>\"In the background to all this pandemic work, please be assured there is a massive effort going on to make sure we are ready for the coming fire season.</p><p>\"That's the nature of challenge we face and 2020 is one of those years where you can assume we will be tested on all fronts.\"</p><p>Mr Andrews said the state's fire season planning was preparing for the worst.</p><p>\"We always plan as if it is going to be just as bad as the last one was,\" he said. \"Pleasingly, some of the forecasting doesn't necessarily bear that out.</p><p>\"It's fair to say though, that the forecasts, some of the predictive work that is being done is forecasting significant spring rain, that is both good and bad.\"</p><p>Central Victoria has up to 15 hazard reduction burns planned with up to 2000 hectares to be slashed and mulched.</p><p>In September, Forest Fire Management Victoria acting regional manager forest fire operations Paul Bates said he expects a wetter than average spring in central Victoria with a good chance of a La Nina forming.</p><p>\"What that means is it will just keep the forests wetter for a bit longer and delay the fire season starting,\" he said.</p><p>The extra rain will ensure soil moisture are maintained and the drying of forest fuels delayed but could result in concerning grass growth near roads and on private properties.</p><p>\"When we get into summer and have hot windy days, grass growth becomes a higher risk for those fast moving, intense grass fires,\" Mr Bates said.</p><p>\"There will be an increased risk this year from those types of fires compared to previous years.\"</p><p>Related</p><p>La Nina event in Victoria promises above average spring rainfall Bigger role for cultural burning in future Bendigo expert As well as planning behind the scenes, Mr Andrews said there were also considerations for people looking to travel to remote properties to prepare them for fire season.</p><p>\"It gets really personal and granular in some ways,\" he said. \"We are having a good, close look at what restrictions might mean for people going from Melbourne to regional Victoria to clean up their property.</p><p>\"All those things will be looked at all the way through to making sure we have a big aerial fleet and doing as much controlled burning as we can.</p><p>Mr Andrews said all efforts will be made to ensure fire season preparations are completed.</p><p>\"I know the CFA made some decisions to wind back a bit of that because of safety concerns but any catch-up that needs to be done, we'll do that as fast as we can.</p><p>\"There is a big job of work going on to be ready, not just for pandemic, but for fire and what ever else might come our way.\"</p><p>Visit the CFA's website for more information about preparing for the bushfire season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

They are also urged to know campfire safety rules and extinguish all campfires before leaving.
