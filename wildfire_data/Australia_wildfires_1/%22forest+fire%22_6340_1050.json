We can discuss those things, pointlessly, or we can discuss what is actually happening and what it means.  There are hundreds, thousands of CEOs responsible for running financial service businesses all over the world who are now seeing the industry that has been protected from fundamental change for so long is no longer safe. The problem they face is that, for the first time, responding to these changes is impossible by using solutions that lie within the existing framework of the industry.  The structures of banking and finance are changing, completely. This week we saw undeniable signs that banking as we know it is dying and the rigid foundations that exist because of it, upon which thousands of financial services companies are built, are no longer rigid at all.  The moat around this industry has been breached and nobody within it knows how to pivot the traditional businesses they run to benefit from the invading hoard that, seemingly, has no regard for convention or rules. This industry is about to be taken over by people who've never been in it; people who don't give two hoots about the industry itself or the backward ways in which it operates. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Apple threat</emphasis>Apple's announcement isn't significant because it's the first potentially fatal competition to Afterpay, Zip or any other BNPL company. It is significant because of what it undeniably represents.  Afterpay never threatened the banks. It never presented any real competition to them. It placed minor pressure on credit cards (one product) in one demographic that barely used them anyway. It added an extra step to the checkout process for physical purchases, required an app to be downloaded and really didn't deliver all that much benefit to the customer, in real terms.  Sure, the major BNPL providers did a great job online of making themselves as available as credit/debit cards by offering payments at the click of a button. But they didn't do so profitably and they didn't do so in a way that supported their retailers.  They did so in a way that cost those retailers more than they had traditionally paid for transactions, at a time when they could least afford it. This was a huge mistake and opened the door to the fatal competition they now face.  Of course a company that gains the user numbers Afterpay has and the retail networks it did would be a 'success story'. I don't begrudge them for their achievements in that regard, and certainly many shareholders would be grateful. But it's a long bow to draw to say it was ever truly a threat to any single thing at all in the banking and finance industry.  You know what is a threat to banking and finance? Apple.  Apple is a threat because of what it will do to the conscious thoughts of every single person who uses its BNPL offer in the months and years ahead, and I think everyone is missing that.  Imagine this: You're out running errands. You buy fuel for your car, then stop at the supermarket to get food for home, after that you head to the shops to get a new pair of shoes for work. On the way home your partner calls and asks you to pick up dog food, so you swing by Pet-Barn.  In the space of two hours you've been repeatedly caused to think in a way that the banking industry has been fighting to prevent for over 100 years.  You've tapped your phone to a terminal four times. You've clicked one button and the phone has done the rest. You've not needed your bank, not thought about your bank, not considered the numerous steps in the transaction that your bank allows, nor were you given any reason to.  For the first time in modern history you will credit a technology device, and the company that made it, for helping you move your money - and for not charging you a cent to pay for your purchases over eight weeks instead of up front.  This may not seem like a fundamental shift in behaviour if you know the industry and know the complexity of the payments process. If you do, you know the phone needs to be linked to a bank-issued card that accesses a bank-issued account of some kind to access funds, which the bank lets you use based on their predetermined rules. You know the bank's role is crucial to allowing that technology feature the customer experiences to operate at all.  To the industry professional, banks are still crucial and that won't change. This week has changed nothing. But that's because they've always been looking at trees when 99% of the population see nothing but forest.  You see that's the problem with the experts running the industry; they know how it works. But ordinary every day people have <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">never</emphasis> known how banking and finance works.  The experts built their moat and they always made sure to keep the ordinary people out. That's why banks need licenses and products need disclosing. The industry has always been too opaque for ordinary people - the people it serves - to understand how it works.  But not any more.  So while old mate is out shopping for goods and experts see a bank supporting his needs, he doesn't. He sees a tech company that's offering something seemingly so simple to use that he starts wondering why other products in this industry aren't as simple and easy.  We've just handed this individual cause to question the necessity of complexity and if he's like every other human being in history he will look to the easiest way to do anything.  What Apple has done is remove friction and complexity from a transaction that people have always known could not occur without a bank.  What Apple have done is plant a seed - a seed of a question that will be watered millions of times a day by millions of people every time they pay with Apple's BNPL product:  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Why do I even need a bank at all?'</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Questions and more</emphasis> And there it is. There is the single biggest shift in banking and finance this industry has ever seen. For the first time, ordinary people have been equipped, given real cause, to question the necessity of banks in their life at all.  From here comes more questions. Questions that banks should be very afraid of. Fundamental questions of human behaviour as we currently know it.  Why do I put my money in a bank?  Why does my wage go into a bank?  What is a bank?  Does using a bank actually benefit me?  Does letting a bank use <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">my</emphasis> money help <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">me</emphasis>?  All of a sudden the single biggest control mechanism a bank has over its customers - the deposit transaction account - is at risk.  People no longer have to borrow money from banks - there's fintechs for that. They already buy shares with fintechs, they save money with fintechs, they use credit that fintechs allow them access to. They can buy fractional parts of houses and not worry about a mortgage. They can have their wages paid as crypto and held in a wallet. For a while now, people haven't needed banks in the retail setting. They just didn't know.  What Apple did this week was hand people a question they've never asked before.  That's the point; the forest fire is coming.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an edited version of an article that was first published in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/everybodys-calling-time-afterpay-gawking-revolut-while-kane-jackson/?trackingId=COs%2FYp5knUcMlLUfGqa65g%3D%3D\">LinkedIn</url>.\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637Y-TT91-JD6R-T33B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1301\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 27, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

What Apple has done is remove friction and complexity from a transaction that people have always known could not occur without a bank.  What Apple have done is plant a seed - a seed of a question that will be watered millions of times a day by millions of people every time they pay with Apple's BNPL product:  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Why do I even need a bank at all?'</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Questions and more</emphasis> And there it is. There is the single biggest shift in banking and finance this industry has ever seen. For the first time, ordinary people have been equipped, given real cause, to question the necessity of banks in their life at all.  From here comes more questions. Questions that banks should be very afraid of. Fundamental questions of human behaviour as we currently know it.  Why do I put my money in a bank?  Why does my wage go into a bank?  What is a bank?  Does using a bank actually benefit me?  Does letting a bank use <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">my</emphasis> money help <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">me</emphasis>?  All of a sudden the single biggest control mechanism a bank has over its customers - the deposit transaction account - is at risk.  People no longer have to borrow money from banks - there's fintechs for that. They already buy shares with fintechs, they save money with fintechs, they use credit that fintechs allow them access to. They can buy fractional parts of houses and not worry about a mortgage. They can have their wages paid as crypto and held in a wallet. For a while now, people haven't needed banks in the retail setting. They just didn't know.  What Apple did this week was hand people a question they've never asked before.  That's the point; the forest fire is coming.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an edited version of an article that was first published in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/everybodys-calling-time-afterpay-gawking-revolut-while-kane-jackson/?trackingId=COs%2FYp5knUcMlLUfGqa65g%3D%3D\">LinkedIn</url>.\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637S-5PM1-JD6R-T2DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1301\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 27, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The largest body of sand the banking and financial services industry has ever seen has just started moving in to cover it. The wind has finally gathered enough strength and absolutely nothing will stop what is coming.  We can discuss Afterpay, or how Apple will kill it by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal\">moving into the buy now, pay later (BNPL) space</url>. We can discuss how Revolut landed on the world's most ridiculous <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGxnbjgyQsgmPIYRwErP6FjUQJNHZjjnRyGGsj5EIChtuCEec1QwjE3b063GMbIFE1woh97DbBmvJ0ouKbweacBAev6F7g8L5l6v30jQfqnUdJKDo93TdWxGjpvEnkYPZo9Z5TY89ZG4KmDjM-Pi3peoEnVqUAdgRkBDS-RZWyJz\">valuation</url>. We can discuss those things, pointlessly, or we can discuss what is actually happening and what it means.  There are hundreds, thousands of CEOs responsible for running financial service businesses all over the world who are now seeing the industry that has been protected from fundamental change for so long is no longer safe. The problem they face is that, for the first time, responding to these changes is impossible by using solutions that lie within the existing framework of the industry.  The structures of banking and finance are changing, completely. This week we saw undeniable signs that banking as we know it is dying and the rigid foundations that exist because of it, upon which thousands of financial services companies are built, are no longer rigid at all.  The moat around this industry has been breached and nobody within it knows how to pivot the traditional businesses they run to benefit from the invading hoard that, seemingly, has no regard for convention or rules. This industry is about to be taken over by people who've never been in it; people who don't give two hoots about the industry itself or the backward ways in which it operates. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Apple threat</emphasis>Apple's announcement isn't significant because it's the first potentially fatal competition to Afterpay, Zip or any other BNPL company. It is significant because of what it undeniably represents.  Afterpay never threatened the banks. It never presented any real competition to them. It placed minor pressure on credit cards (one product) in one demographic that barely used them anyway. It added an extra step to the checkout process for physical purchases, required an app to be downloaded and really didn't deliver all that much benefit to the customer, in real terms.  Sure, the major BNPL providers did a great job online of making themselves as available as credit/debit cards by offering payments at the click of a button. But they didn't do so profitably and they didn't do so in a way that supported their retailers.  They did so in a way that cost those retailers more than they had traditionally paid for transactions, at a time when they could least afford it. This was a huge mistake and opened the door to the fatal competition they now face.  Of course a company that gains the user numbers Afterpay has and the retail networks it did would be a 'success story'. I don't begrudge them for their achievements in that regard, and certainly many shareholders would be grateful. But it's a long bow to draw to say it was ever truly a threat to any single thing at all in the banking and finance industry.  You know what is a threat to banking and finance? Apple.  Apple is a threat because of what it will do to the conscious thoughts of every single person who uses its BNPL offer in the months and years ahead, and I think everyone is missing that.  Imagine this: You're out running errands. You buy fuel for your car, then stop at the supermarket to get food for home, after that you head to the shops to get a new pair of shoes for work. On the way home your partner calls and asks you to pick up dog food, so you swing by Pet-Barn.  In the space of two hours you've been repeatedly caused to think in a way that the banking industry has been fighting to prevent for over 100 years.  You've tapped your phone to a terminal four times. You've clicked one button and the phone has done the rest. You've not needed your bank, not thought about your bank, not considered the numerous steps in the transaction that your bank allows, nor were you given any reason to.  For the first time in modern history you will credit a technology device, and the company that made it, for helping you move your money - and for not charging you a cent to pay for your purchases over eight weeks instead of up front.  This may not seem like a fundamental shift in behaviour if you know the industry and know the complexity of the payments process. If you do, you know the phone needs to be linked to a bank-issued card that accesses a bank-issued account of some kind to access funds, which the bank lets you use based on their predetermined rules. You know the bank's role is crucial to allowing that technology feature the customer experiences to operate at all.  To the industry professional, banks are still crucial and that won't change. This week has changed nothing. But that's because they've always been looking at trees when 99% of the population see nothing but forest.  You see that's the problem with the experts running the industry; they know how it works. But ordinary every day people have <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">never</emphasis> known how banking and finance works.  The experts built their moat and they always made sure to keep the ordinary people out. That's why banks need licenses and products need disclosing. The industry has always been too opaque for ordinary people - the people it serves - to understand how it works.  But not any more.  So while old mate is out shopping for goods and experts see a bank supporting his needs, he doesn't. He sees a tech company that's offering something seemingly so simple to use that he starts wondering why other products in this industry aren't as simple and easy.  We've just handed this individual cause to question the necessity of complexity and if he's like every other human being in history he will look to the easiest way to do anything.  What Apple has done is remove friction and complexity from a transaction that people have always known could not occur without a bank.  What Apple have done is plant a seed - a seed of a question that will be watered millions of times a day by millions of people every time they pay with Apple's BNPL product:  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Why do I even need a bank at all?'</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Questions and more</emphasis> And there it is.

The largest body of sand the banking and financial services industry has ever seen has just started moving in to cover it. The wind has finally gathered enough strength and absolutely nothing will stop what is coming.  We can discuss Afterpay, or how Apple will kill it by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal\">moving into the buy now, pay later (BNPL) space</url>. We can discuss how Revolut landed on the world's most ridiculous <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGxnbjgyQsgmPIYRwErP6FjUQJNHZjjnRyGGsj5EIChtuCEec1QwjE3b063GMbIFE1woh97DbBmvJ0ouKbweacBAev6F7g8L5l6v30jQfqnUdJKDo93TdWxGjpvEnkYPZo9Z5TY89ZG4KmDjM-Pi3peoEnVqUAdgRkBDS-RZWyJz\">valuation</url>. We can discuss those things, pointlessly, or we can discuss what is actually happening and what it means.  There are hundreds, thousands of CEOs responsible for running financial service businesses all over the world who are now seeing the industry that has been protected from fundamental change for so long is no longer safe. The problem they face is that, for the first time, responding to these changes is impossible by using solutions that lie within the existing framework of the industry.  The structures of banking and finance are changing, completely. This week we saw undeniable signs that banking as we know it is dying and the rigid foundations that exist because of it, upon which thousands of financial services companies are built, are no longer rigid at all.  The moat around this industry has been breached and nobody within it knows how to pivot the traditional businesses they run to benefit from the invading hoard that, seemingly, has no regard for convention or rules. This industry is about to be taken over by people who've never been in it; people who don't give two hoots about the industry itself or the backward ways in which it operates. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Apple threat</emphasis>Apple's announcement isn't significant because it's the first potentially fatal competition to Afterpay, Zip or any other BNPL company. It is significant because of what it undeniably represents.  Afterpay never threatened the banks. It never presented any real competition to them. It placed minor pressure on credit cards (one product) in one demographic that barely used them anyway. It added an extra step to the checkout process for physical purchases, required an app to be downloaded and really didn't deliver all that much benefit to the customer, in real terms.  Sure, the major BNPL providers did a great job online of making themselves as available as credit/debit cards by offering payments at the click of a button. But they didn't do so profitably and they didn't do so in a way that supported their retailers.  They did so in a way that cost those retailers more than they had traditionally paid for transactions, at a time when they could least afford it. This was a huge mistake and opened the door to the fatal competition they now face.  Of course a company that gains the user numbers Afterpay has and the retail networks it did would be a 'success story'. I don't begrudge them for their achievements in that regard, and certainly many shareholders would be grateful. But it's a long bow to draw to say it was ever truly a threat to any single thing at all in the banking and finance industry.  You know what is a threat to banking and finance? Apple.  Apple is a threat because of what it will do to the conscious thoughts of every single person who uses its BNPL offer in the months and years ahead, and I think everyone is missing that.  Imagine this: You're out running errands. You buy fuel for your car, then stop at the supermarket to get food for home, after that you head to the shops to get a new pair of shoes for work. On the way home your partner calls and asks you to pick up dog food, so you swing by Pet-Barn.  In the space of two hours you've been repeatedly caused to think in a way that the banking industry has been fighting to prevent for over 100 years.  You've tapped your phone to a terminal four times. You've clicked one button and the phone has done the rest. You've not needed your bank, not thought about your bank, not considered the numerous steps in the transaction that your bank allows, nor were you given any reason to.  For the first time in modern history you will credit a technology device, and the company that made it, for helping you move your money - and for not charging you a cent to pay for your purchases over eight weeks instead of up front.  This may not seem like a fundamental shift in behaviour if you know the industry and know the complexity of the payments process. If you do, you know the phone needs to be linked to a bank-issued card that accesses a bank-issued account of some kind to access funds, which the bank lets you use based on their predetermined rules. You know the bank's role is crucial to allowing that technology feature the customer experiences to operate at all.  To the industry professional, banks are still crucial and that won't change. This week has changed nothing. But that's because they've always been looking at trees when 99% of the population see nothing but forest.  You see that's the problem with the experts running the industry; they know how it works. But ordinary every day people have <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">never</emphasis> known how banking and finance works.  The experts built their moat and they always made sure to keep the ordinary people out. That's why banks need licenses and products need disclosing. The industry has always been too opaque for ordinary people - the people it serves - to understand how it works.  But not any more.  So while old mate is out shopping for goods and experts see a bank supporting his needs, he doesn't. He sees a tech company that's offering something seemingly so simple to use that he starts wondering why other products in this industry aren't as simple and easy.  We've just handed this individual cause to question the necessity of complexity and if he's like every other human being in history he will look to the easiest way to do anything.  What Apple has done is remove friction and complexity from a transaction that people have always known could not occur without a bank.  What Apple have done is plant a seed - a seed of a question that will be watered millions of times a day by millions of people every time they pay with Apple's BNPL product:  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Why do I even need a bank at all?'</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Questions and more</emphasis> And there it is. There is the single biggest shift in banking and finance this industry has ever seen. For the first time, ordinary people have been equipped, given real cause, to question the necessity of banks in their life at all.  From here comes more questions. Questions that banks should be very afraid of. Fundamental questions of human behaviour as we currently know it.  Why do I put my money in a bank?  Why does my wage go into a bank?  What is a bank?  Does using a bank actually benefit me?  Does letting a bank use <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">my</emphasis> money help <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">me</emphasis>?  All of a sudden the single biggest control mechanism a bank has over its customers - the deposit transaction account - is at risk.  People no longer have to borrow money from banks - there's fintechs for that. They already buy shares with fintechs, they save money with fintechs, they use credit that fintechs allow them access to. They can buy fractional parts of houses and not worry about a mortgage. They can have their wages paid as crypto and held in a wallet. For a while now, people haven't needed banks in the retail setting. They just didn't know.  What Apple did this week was hand people a question they've never asked before.  That's the point; the forest fire is coming.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an edited version of an article that was first published in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/everybodys-calling-time-afterpay-gawking-revolut-while-kane-jackson/?trackingId=COs%2FYp5knUcMlLUfGqa65g%3D%3D\">LinkedIn</url>.\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637N-KN51-F0NT-H3TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1301\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 27, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

They're very flammable, so given the weather forecast it's going to be hard to stop.</p><p>\"I suspect the government wishes they built the fire trucks they were meant to over the last three years if this keeps going.\" QFES Commissioner Greg Leach last month said volunteer firefighters were \"well prepared, well trained and increasingly better equipped to deal with the risks that they're facing\" and that he was happy with the mitigation burning.</p><p>Deputy Commissioner Joanne Greenfield said after the intense start to the season she still had \"high levels of confidence\" in the state's fire-fighting capacity, and the service had good fatigue management practices in place for volunteers.</p><p>\"What you've seen from these early fires, we've responded strongly,\" she said. Ms Greenfield said QFES had been expecting the severe season and was able to prepare. \"Were always preparing, it's never done,\" she said.</p><p>\"This year we've burned over 170,000 hectares.\" But Rural Fire Brigades Association Queensland general manager Justin Choveaux said brigades would be put to the test this season as huge chunks of state-owned land had not been maintained, nor were rail corridors or roadside burns completed.</p><p>The national bushfire outlook report warns of exceptionally high fuel loads across Queensland following La Nina, significantly increasing bushfire risk, spread and severity. \"This is only the start,\" Mr Choveaux said.</p><p>\"A majority of the land - 66 per cent - is owned by the Crown, the state, and they're just not managing their risk.</p><p>\"They've got only two choices - which is to get more people to manage their risk or get less land, or let a third party in to manage the land.</p><p>\"We need a statewide policy on roadside burning because right now, brigades are only there to help those burns, they aren't the landholder.</p><p>\"Roadsides, railway corridors, all those things that can be used as a fire break are now an ignition point.\" As of Monday, three national parks in the Glass House Mountains, Burrum Coast and Carnarvon, and Fairbairn State Forest, remain on fire.</p><p>Opposition fire and emergency services spokesman Dale Last said rural residents had been caught off guard when Mr Leach announced last month that it was \"too late\" to keep burning, saying residents were simply told \"no\" at \"the last moment\".</p><p>But Fire and Emergency Services Minister Mark Ryan said any suggestion Queensland was unprepared was an insult to the entire firefighting community.</p><p>\"Fire mitigation programs occur all year round and have been ramped up over the last 18 months following significant rain events and increased vegetation,\" he said.</p><p>\"Queensland's firefighting crews and volunteers are committed to minimising the community impacts of bushfires, and any suggestion they do not adequately serve the community is an insult to the brave men and women.\" But the senior volunteer firefighter disagreed, saying much of the hazard reduction burns had been purely \"cosmetic\" and the main risk was government-owned land.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating; there's so little reduction happening, we're totally reactive,\" he said.</p><p>\"When those fires start, there's nothing we can do to stop them.\" Editorial P20</p><p>FIRE LIST *As of September 18, 2023 \" Glass House Mountains National Park fire: Areas affected: Beerwah, Caloundra West, Aura \" Serene Valley fire - moving towards Serene Crt, Nome. \u00e2\u20ac\u017dAreas affected: Properties between Elliot Springs, Bentley Dr and Zinc Rd \" Brady Rd fire - moving towards Chisholm Trail.

Fire doesn't recognise boundaries \u2026 so it is [for] the benefit of the community as well.\"</p><p>In a statement, ForestrySA chief executive Julian Speed said a maintenance plan had been made to address issues with all existing towers and the use of towers would only be stopped when there was a \"viable alternative\".</p><h>Autonomous fire detection</h><p>The GTFA worked with fire management company Working on Fire Australia to install the technology.</p><p>SA manager Justin Jagger is conducting the trial and says the camera is continuously monitoring.</p><p>\"It's taking small snippets of video images and then looking for changes in the landscape,\" he said.</p><p>\"Whether it's glow, whether it's smoke or whether it's other change in the landscape, that is what it picks up.\"</p><p>The camera sends the footage to a manned computer set-up in Mount Gambier, where an operator can assess any changes detected.</p><p>\"The software in the background, and the algorithm it uses to detect the fires, ... continuously improves,\" Mr Jagger said.</p><h>Protecting more than assets</h><p>Mr Hein came face-to-face with the devastation of a bushfire last summer when some of his plantations burnt.</p><p>\"We had a fire start in the afternoon \u2026 that burned through some native forest under pretty extreme conditions and then entered into the plantation estate,\" he said.</p><p>\"All up there was about 800 hectares [of plantations] lost, of ours about 390.</p><p>\"That's approximately $20 million in value that was lost over those few days.\"</p><p>The forests are planted near towns, highways, and farms \u2014 a forest fire can risk more than just the timber assets.</p><p>Local Country Fire Service regional commander John Probert said his team regularly worked with the forestry industry to protect communities from fires.</p><p>\"One of the really critical things is it's all about the whole community working together come bushfire season,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have many people helping and early reporting of fires is a critical part of that.\"</p><p>The trial will run until the end of the bushfire season when the industry will decide whether to invest further.</p><p>However, it has already cost the GTFA nearly $60,000.</p><p>\"We're asking for, from the Government, financial support for not only the money we spent on the trial \u2026 but the ongoing investment in the expansion and operation of the camera network,\" Mr Hein said.</p><p>\"We would want the SA Government to work with us and co-invest in expanding the camera network across the South East [region].\"</p><p>In a statement, Minister for Primary Industries and Regions David Basham said the Government was already supporting the trial.</p><p>\"ForestrySA is an active member of the Green Triangle Fire Alliance which helped to establish the current fire detection pilot program and we look forward to seeing the results of the trial,\" he said.</p><p>\"ForestrySA will work with emergency management agencies to ensure high-level fire protection and detection capability this summer and will comply with recommendations of the Keelty Review into last summer's bushfires.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Therefore, it makes no sense to try to keep it out of forests for 40 to 50 years, as suggested by Professor David Lindenmayer.</p><p>Best practice forest fire management takes into account the findings from fire and environmental research, the lessons from previous bushfires and community expectations that life, property and environmental values will be protected from severe bushfires.</p><p>We are fast approaching the 20th anniversary of the 2003 Canberra bushfires, which killed four people, destroyed 510 buildings, and caused significant environmental impacts to 91 per cent of Namadgi National Park.</p><p>The two inquiries following these fires both made very clear findings on the need for active management of fuels in the forests to the west of Canberra. As someone who was actively involved in fighting these bushfires, I know how difficult it was to establish fire control lines in areas with very high fuel levels. At the 10th anniversary of these bushfires the then-chief minister, Katy Gallagher, said the lessons from the 2003 fires were learned in the hardest possible way and vigilance and cooperation was required to make those lessons count.</p><p>With the passage of time various people, who are opposed to active management of forests, increase their lobbying of politicians to try to reduce or eliminate the implementation of prescribed burning in forest landscapes.</p><p>There is ample evidence within Namadgi National Park of the destructive negative impacts on forest ecosystems arising from repeated short-interval catastrophic bushfires, as well as the positive impacts implementation of well-managed prescribed burning can have on reducing such negative impacts.</p><p>The lived-experience in the ACT clearly demonstrates the proposed strategy of trying to keep fire out of forests for more than 40 years will not ensure that such areas do not burn at high intensity in the future. There was a large area in the very south of Namadgi National Park where no fire had occurred for more than 40 years and the ground fuel levels were very high. The 2020 Orroral Valley bushfire burned through this area at very high intensity and left the forest with no foliage on any trees and no understory vegetation.</p><p>The 2020 bushfire burnt 80 per cent of Namadgi National Park, with a very large proportion of the burnt areas coinciding with areas that had been severely burnt in the 2003 bushfires. This means there are large areas of fire-sensitive vegetation in Namadgi National Park that have now been burnt by severe bushfires twice in 17 years.</p><p>The majestic alpine ash forests are one example of the forest ecosystems that have been impacted significantly by these large-scale bushfires. About 20 per cent of their pre-2003 extent has been lost due to being burnt by bushfire a second time, before the regrowth that arose from the 2003 bushfire was old enough to produce seed. In a changing climate, where severe bushfires are expected to occur more frequently, it is absurd to argue abandoning prescribed burning in remote forest areas is the best way to protect these areas.</p><p>We need to use low-intensity prescribed fire strategically in the landscape to reduce the likelihood of important areas of fire-sensitive vegetation being subject to repeated high-intensity bushfires.</p><p>Far from being a threat to most of the vegetation in Namadgi, the application of prescribed fire has significantly reduced the impacts of the 2020 bushfire on native vegetation, as well as offering protection to water storages.</p><p>When considering how to manage forest landscapes, we need to be more respectful of Aboriginal people, their traditional knowledge and their care for Country over many thousands of years.</p><p>Michael-Shawn Fletcher, a Wiradjuri man and Associate Professor at the University of Melbourne, maintains the imposition of conservation policies that prevent prescribed burning has created the conditions in which forests have become denser, more flammable and more susceptible to climate-driven bushfires. He argues that it is time to listen to and learn from Indigenous and local people and empower these communities to drive research and forest management agendas.</p><p>There is no doubt we need to improve fire management in Australian forests. We need to get better at quickly suppressing forest wildfires when they pose risks to life, property and the environment. But at other times of the year, land managers need to increase the use of prescribed fire, both to reduce fuel hazards in strategically important areas and to better protect important environmental values from the impacts of frequent severe bushfires. Nurturing effective partnerships with Aboriginal people needs to be a key part of this strategy.</p><p>Dr Tony Bartlett AFSM is a forest scientist and affiliate senior lecturer at the Australian National University, who has more than 40 years of experience in forest fire management in south-eastern Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7ntg1uw6o8wh92pkbqd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66YT-4X61-F0J6-J009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Therefore, it makes no sense to try to keep it out of forests for 40 to 50 years, as suggested by Professor David Lindenmayer.</p><p>Best practice forest fire management takes into account the findings from fire and environmental research, the lessons from previous bushfires and community expectations that life, property and environmental values will be protected from severe bushfires.</p><p>We are fast approaching the 20th anniversary of the 2003 Canberra bushfires, which killed four people, destroyed 510 buildings, and caused significant environmental impacts to 91 per cent of Namadgi National Park.</p><p>The two inquiries following these fires both made very clear findings on the need for active management of fuels in the forests to the west of Canberra. As someone who was actively involved in fighting these bushfires, I know how difficult it was to establish fire control lines in areas with very high fuel levels. At the 10th anniversary of these bushfires the then-chief minister, Katy Gallagher, said the lessons from the 2003 fires were learned in the hardest possible way and vigilance and cooperation was required to make those lessons count.</p><p>With the passage of time various people, who are opposed to active management of forests, increase their lobbying of politicians to try to reduce or eliminate the implementation of prescribed burning in forest landscapes.</p><p>There is ample evidence within Namadgi National Park of the destructive negative impacts on forest ecosystems arising from repeated short-interval catastrophic bushfires, as well as the positive impacts implementation of well-managed prescribed burning can have on reducing such negative impacts.</p><p>The lived-experience in the ACT clearly demonstrates the proposed strategy of trying to keep fire out of forests for more than 40 years will not ensure that such areas do not burn at high intensity in the future. There was a large area in the very south of Namadgi National Park where no fire had occurred for more than 40 years and the ground fuel levels were very high. The 2020 Orroral Valley bushfire burned through this area at very high intensity and left the forest with no foliage on any trees and no understory vegetation.</p><p>The 2020 bushfire burnt 80 per cent of Namadgi National Park, with a very large proportion of the burnt areas coinciding with areas that had been severely burnt in the 2003 bushfires. This means there are large areas of fire-sensitive vegetation in Namadgi National Park that have now been burnt by severe bushfires twice in 17 years.</p><p>The majestic alpine ash forests are one example of the forest ecosystems that have been impacted significantly by these large-scale bushfires. About 20 per cent of their pre-2003 extent has been lost due to being burnt by bushfire a second time, before the regrowth that arose from the 2003 bushfire was old enough to produce seed. In a changing climate, where severe bushfires are expected to occur more frequently, it is absurd to argue abandoning prescribed burning in remote forest areas is the best way to protect these areas.</p><p>We need to use low-intensity prescribed fire strategically in the landscape to reduce the likelihood of important areas of fire-sensitive vegetation being subject to repeated high-intensity bushfires.</p><p>Far from being a threat to most of the vegetation in Namadgi, the application of prescribed fire has significantly reduced the impacts of the 2020 bushfire on native vegetation, as well as offering protection to water storages.</p><p>When considering how to manage forest landscapes, we need to be more respectful of Aboriginal people, their traditional knowledge and their care for Country over many thousands of years.</p><p>Michael-Shawn Fletcher, a Wiradjuri man and Associate Professor at the University of Melbourne, maintains the imposition of conservation policies that prevent prescribed burning has created the conditions in which forests have become denser, more flammable and more susceptible to climate-driven bushfires. He argues that it is time to listen to and learn from Indigenous and local people and empower these communities to drive research and forest management agendas.</p><p>There is no doubt we need to improve fire management in Australian forests. We need to get better at quickly suppressing forest wildfires when they pose risks to life, property and the environment. But at other times of the year, land managers need to increase the use of prescribed fire, both to reduce fuel hazards in strategically important areas and to better protect important environmental values from the impacts of frequent severe bushfires. Nurturing effective partnerships with Aboriginal people needs to be a key part of this strategy.</p><p>Dr Tony Bartlett AFSM is a forest scientist and affiliate senior lecturer at the Australian National University, who has more than 40 years of experience in forest fire management in south-eastern Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNWTME-doc7ntg12dez7k1in3q0bqd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNWTME2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66YT-4X61-F0J6-J07C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Snowy Times</publicationName><edition>Internet Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 29, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Black Summer fires of 2019-20 were the worst on record for the area burned and property loss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How much climate change has contributed to these increases is a hot topic. Bushfire risk is dialled up by <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00512.x\">four switches</url>: fuel amount and condition, fire weather and ignition sources. Untangling these various influences is difficult, so the role played by the warming climate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abf1326\">is heavily debated</url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fire-weather measures fire risk on a daily basis, while a fire-climate regime measures fire risk over seasonal and longer time scales. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/6/121\">Our research</url> shows almost everywhere in Australia is now in a different fire climate than it was just 20 years ago, with falling relative humidity a key factor. <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/57/2/jamc-d-17-0167.1.xml\">Previous research</url> has also identified these sudden jumps in fire danger.</p><p>What caused fire climates to shift? Conventional scientific wisdom assumes the climate's response to increasing emissions is gradual and linear. When rapid change happens, it's often thought to be due to <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222328\">climate variability</url>. But that's not what happened here. </p><h>Most Australian fire climate regimes have already shifted</h><p>Fire weather is calculated using the <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McArthur_Forest_Fire_Danger_Index\">Forest Fire Danger Index</url>, which takes into account vegetation dryness, windspeed, temperature and relative humidity. </p><p>Obtaining reliable long-term records using these measures is difficult, so we used high quality seasonal and annual climate inputs to estimate the annual fire climate for different regions of Australia from 1957-58 to 2021-22.</p><p>We tracked changes in this fire danger index over that 64-year period across all states and the Northern Territory. We also looked at distinct sub regions such as southwest Australia. What we found was startling. Rather than a linear increase, fire regimes tracked along a similar line - and then suddenly jumped. For most states and territories, that happened around the year 2000. </p><p>There is no evidence for a long-term trend. Instead, the data shows a shift from one stable fire climate regime to another.  </p><p>We're already seeing these changes play out. Whenever you see a news article about intense fires in areas not used to fire, that's likely to be due to a shift in fire climate. Think of the fires devastating Tasmania's alpine regions in 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/like-losing-the-thylacine-fire-burns-tasmanian-wilderness-world-heritage-area-20160131-gmi2re.html\">killing off</url> many old pencil and King Billy pines.   </p><h>When did these jumps happen?</h><p>Here's when each region shifted from one fire regime to the next.  </p><p>You can see the shift in the number of days above \"high fire danger\". </p><p>When we showed this research to Greg Mullins, former Commissioner of Fire &amp; Rescue New South Wales, he said it was</p><p>utterly consistent with what firefighters are experiencing worldwide: more frequent, intense, and damaging bushfires that sometimes are impossible to control.</p><p>Is it really that bad? Yes. </p><p>For instance, what would have been the one in ten bad fire season under the earlier regime (occurring once in ten years) became, on average, a one in two fire season in the second regime. </p><p>That means the worst 10% of fire years were now happening every second year. </p><p>When we looked at even worse fire years -\u00a0the worst year in 20 fire seasons -\u00a0the shift was shocking. On average, we are now seeing these years twice every five years.</p><h>Why did fire climates shift so abruptly?</h><p>That's the big question. </p><p>To find out, we analysed all the available input variables for regime shifts and tested their influence on the results. We found wind speed was not a factor. Changes in rainfall had little effect. </p><p>So what was it? We found the main driver was relative humidity in combination with higher daily temperatures during the fire season. Recently, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/10/1577\">we examined</url> global humidity data and found large-scale downward shifts in humidity. In the Southern Hemisphere, that happened in 2002. In the Northern Hemisphere, it happened in 1999. </p><p>Humidity reductions in each region of Australia were closely followed by shifts to higher fire season maximum temperatures, amplified by soils drying out. </p><p>We also tested <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8537\">global average fire season length</url> from 1979 to 2013 for regime shifts, finding a rapid expansion in 2002. That's the same year Australia's median fire danger jumped. </p><p>The consequences of these shifts are profound. The unprecedented fires in Canada and Europe, the devastating fires in Hawaii and the increasing frequency of wildfires around the world have their roots in lower relative humidity, which leads to higher daytime temperatures. That, in turn, creates these dangerous new fire regimes.</p><p>Why haven't we heard about these sudden shifts in fire climate? One reason is much of our modelling is built on the assumption the steady accumulation of heat trapped by greenhouse gases leads to linear changes elsewhere. </p><p>But as this year's climate chaos suggests, this assumption may be unfounded. </p><p>In our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/10/1577\">earlier research</url>, we found zero of 32 climate models were able to reproduce the sudden shifts in relative humidity across the globe. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: 'Australia is sleepwalking': a bushfire scientist explains what the Hawaii tragedy means for our flammable continent</emphasis></p><h>What does this mean for this year's fire season?</h><p>Many parts of New South Wales, Queensland, the western Northern Territory and northwest Victoria have already dried out, though large forests will keep some moisture after the years of rain. Grass fires are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-10/nt-emergency-services-battle-bushfire-in-barkly-region/102837278\">already raging</url> in the Northern Territory. </p><p>That suggests the greatest risks this summer will be in grassland, scrubland and suburbs on the fringe of cities. Widespread catastrophic forest fires are probably less likely. But the major fires will return if dry conditions persist. </p><p>In fact, in the current climate, land can dry out much faster than it used to, leading to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26692-z\">flash droughts</url> which swing from very wet to very dry in a short period of time. </p><p>Remember -\u00a0this current fire regime may not be permanent. As the climate warms further, it's entirely possible our fire regimes could warp into something even more dangerous. Ensuring our climate models are capable of predicting these changes is an urgent task. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Australia's Black Summer of fire was not normal - and we can prove it</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Roger Jones has provided technical advice on fire climate regimes to the Victorian Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (Formerly the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning).</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAUS-209689</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAUS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694X-97P1-DXP7-1002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1050\"/><timeReceived>2:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Australia</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6070\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 11, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Therefore, it makes no sense to try to keep it out of forests for 40 to 50 years, as suggested by Professor David Lindenmayer.</p><p>Best practice forest fire management takes into account the findings from fire and environmental research, the lessons from previous bushfires and community expectations that life, property and environmental values will be protected from severe bushfires.</p><p>We are fast approaching the 20th anniversary of the 2003 Canberra bushfires, which killed four people, destroyed 510 buildings, and caused significant environmental impacts to 91 per cent of Namadgi National Park.</p><p>The two inquiries following these fires both made very clear findings on the need for active management of fuels in the forests to the west of Canberra. As someone who was actively involved in fighting these bushfires, I know how difficult it was to establish fire control lines in areas with very high fuel levels. At the 10th anniversary of these bushfires the then-chief minister, Katy Gallagher, said the lessons from the 2003 fires were learned in the hardest possible way and vigilance and cooperation was required to make those lessons count.</p><p>With the passage of time various people, who are opposed to active management of forests, increase their lobbying of politicians to try to reduce or eliminate the implementation of prescribed burning in forest landscapes.</p><p>There is ample evidence within Namadgi National Park of the destructive negative impacts on forest ecosystems arising from repeated short-interval catastrophic bushfires, as well as the positive impacts implementation of well-managed prescribed burning can have on reducing such negative impacts.</p><p>The lived-experience in the ACT clearly demonstrates the proposed strategy of trying to keep fire out of forests for more than 40 years will not ensure that such areas do not burn at high intensity in the future. There was a large area in the very south of Namadgi National Park where no fire had occurred for more than 40 years and the ground fuel levels were very high. The 2020 Orroral Valley bushfire burned through this area at very high intensity and left the forest with no foliage on any trees and no understory vegetation.</p><p>The 2020 bushfire burnt 80 per cent of Namadgi National Park, with a very large proportion of the burnt areas coinciding with areas that had been severely burnt in the 2003 bushfires. This means there are large areas of fire-sensitive vegetation in Namadgi National Park that have now been burnt by severe bushfires twice in 17 years.</p><p>The majestic alpine ash forests are one example of the forest ecosystems that have been impacted significantly by these large-scale bushfires. About 20 per cent of their pre-2003 extent has been lost due to being burnt by bushfire a second time, before the regrowth that arose from the 2003 bushfire was old enough to produce seed. In a changing climate, where severe bushfires are expected to occur more frequently, it is absurd to argue abandoning prescribed burning in remote forest areas is the best way to protect these areas.</p><p>We need to use low-intensity prescribed fire strategically in the landscape to reduce the likelihood of important areas of fire-sensitive vegetation being subject to repeated high-intensity bushfires.</p><p>Far from being a threat to most of the vegetation in Namadgi, the application of prescribed fire has significantly reduced the impacts of the 2020 bushfire on native vegetation, as well as offering protection to water storages.</p><p>When considering how to manage forest landscapes, we need to be more respectful of Aboriginal people, their traditional knowledge and their care for Country over many thousands of years.</p><p>Michael-Shawn Fletcher, a Wiradjuri man and Associate Professor at the University of Melbourne, maintains the imposition of conservation policies that prevent prescribed burning has created the conditions in which forests have become denser, more flammable and more susceptible to climate-driven bushfires. He argues that it is time to listen to and learn from Indigenous and local people and empower these communities to drive research and forest management agendas.</p><p>There is no doubt we need to improve fire management in Australian forests. We need to get better at quickly suppressing forest wildfires when they pose risks to life, property and the environment. But at other times of the year, land managers need to increase the use of prescribed fire, both to reduce fuel hazards in strategically important areas and to better protect important environmental values from the impacts of frequent severe bushfires. Nurturing effective partnerships with Aboriginal people needs to be a key part of this strategy.</p><p>Dr Tony Bartlett AFSM is a forest scientist and affiliate senior lecturer at the Australian National University, who has more than 40 years of experience in forest fire management in south-eastern Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7nsxv4dihlygoic5bqd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66YK-5KP1-F0J6-J00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I'm pretty happy about that,\" Mr Larbey said. \"I didn't think there'd be anything left.</p><p>\"We managed to escape Black Saturday and now 2023. We're fortunate, as we've always been worried about fires here. The CFA have done an amazing job.\" Arson squad detectives on Wednesday arrested and questioned a 71-year-old Flowerdale man for allegedly lighting a fire on Spring Valley Rd. The man was later -released.</p><p>Mr Larbey said it was a \"very unpleasant thought\" to think the fire may have been deliberately lit.</p><p>\"We're fortunate to not have suffered the ultimate consequence - lost lives or something stupid like that,\" he said. \"The grass will grow back but it could have been very different.\" A relief centre was established at nearby Yea Recreation Reserve, where residents were encouraged to attend a community meeting on Wednesday night.</p><p>That same venue became a tent city in 2009 as displaced locals from Flowerdale, Marysville and Kinglake were forced to call it home after the Black Saturday bushfires blazed through their towns.</p><p>The state's emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said Flowerdale residents might have had those scars reopened by \"what they're hearing, what they're seeing, what they're smelling\".</p><p>\"We certainly feel for the community of Flowerdale and those in that area that have been impacted by fires previously, particularly 2009 in those Black Saturday fires,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're throwing everything at this particular fire.\" CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said 80 firefighters had been supported by water- bombing aircraft to gain the \"upper hand\" over the blaze but warned conditions were \"constantly changing\".</p><p>\"No one can afford to be complacent anywhere in the state over the next few days,\" he said. Emergency service bosses said while the Flowerdale fire remained the priority, the heatwave hitting the state over the next three days could endanger other regions, particularly the Wimmera.</p><p>Meanwhile, Victorians planning to make the most of the final \"burst of summer\" have been urged to take extra caution with campfires.</p><p>\"If you leave your campfire, you must extinguish it,\" Forest Fire Management chief officer Chris Hardman said. \"That's not by putting soil in it, that's by extinguishing it with water.

As someone who was actively involved in fighting these bushfires, I know how difficult it was to establish fire control lines in areas with very high fuel levels. At the 10th anniversary of these bushfires the then-chief minister, Katy Gallagher, said the lessons from the 2003 fires were learned in the hardest possible way and vigilance and cooperation was required to make those lessons count.</p><p>With the passage of time various people, who are opposed to active management of forests, increase their lobbying of politicians to try to reduce or eliminate the implementation of prescribed burning in forest landscapes.</p><p>There is ample evidence within Namadgi National Park of the destructive negative impacts on forest ecosystems arising from repeated short-interval catastrophic bushfires, as well as the positive impacts implementation of well-managed prescribed burning can have on reducing such negative impacts.</p><p>The lived-experience in the ACT clearly demonstrates the proposed strategy of trying to keep fire out of forests for more than 40 years will not ensure that such areas do not burn at high intensity in the future. There was a large area in the very south of Namadgi National Park where no fire had occurred for more than 40 years and the ground fuel levels were very high. The 2020 Orroral Valley bushfire burned through this area at very high intensity and left the forest with no foliage on any trees and no understory vegetation.</p><p>The 2020 bushfire burnt 80 per cent of Namadgi National Park, with a very large proportion of the burnt areas coinciding with areas that had been severely burnt in the 2003 bushfires. This means there are large areas of fire-sensitive vegetation in Namadgi National Park that have now been burnt by severe bushfires twice in 17 years.</p><p>The majestic alpine ash forests are one example of the forest ecosystems that have been impacted significantly by these large-scale bushfires. About 20 per cent of their pre-2003 extent has been lost due to being burnt by bushfire a second time, before the regrowth that arose from the 2003 bushfire was old enough to produce seed. In a changing climate, where severe bushfires are expected to occur more frequently, it is absurd to argue abandoning prescribed burning in remote forest areas is the best way to protect these areas.</p><p>We need to use low-intensity prescribed fire strategically in the landscape to reduce the likelihood of important areas of fire-sensitive vegetation being subject to repeated high-intensity bushfires.</p><p>Far from being a threat to most of the vegetation in Namadgi, the application of prescribed fire has significantly reduced the impacts of the 2020 bushfire on native vegetation, as well as offering protection to water storages.</p><p>When considering how to manage forest landscapes, we need to be more respectful of Aboriginal people, their traditional knowledge and their care for Country over many thousands of years.</p><p>Michael-Shawn Fletcher, a Wiradjuri man and Associate Professor at the University of Melbourne, maintains the imposition of conservation policies that prevent prescribed burning has created the conditions in which forests have become denser, more flammable and more susceptible to climate-driven bushfires. He argues that it is time to listen to and learn from Indigenous and local people and empower these communities to drive research and forest management agendas.</p><p>There is no doubt we need to improve fire management in Australian forests. We need to get better at quickly suppressing forest wildfires when they pose risks to life, property and the environment. But at other times of the year, land managers need to increase the use of prescribed fire, both to reduce fuel hazards in strategically important areas and to better protect important environmental values from the impacts of frequent severe bushfires. Nurturing effective partnerships with Aboriginal people needs to be a key part of this strategy.</p><p>Dr Tony Bartlett AFSM is a forest scientist and affiliate senior lecturer at the Australian National University, who has more than 40 years of experience in forest fire management in south-eastern Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7nsxhmpy6qs2flfobqd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66YK-5KP1-F0J6-J029-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But there are other areas of black sheoak within the area that will be burnt.</p><p>\"It's clear that [Forest Fire Management Victoria] is not doing enough to identify and protect important habitat for species most impacted by the 2019-20 fires,\" Dr Lau said.</p><p>\"On the one hand, the Victorian government is providing support to communities to revegetate areas with sheoak ... but on the other, [Forest Fire Management Victoria] has burnt sheoak in areas unlikely to reduce risk to life and property but likely to have real consequences for threatened glossy black cockatoos.\"</p><p>In a statement, Forest Fire Management Victoria's chief fire officer Chris Hardman said biodiversity specialists assessed planned burn areas, and had recently excluded known feeding areas for the glossy black cockatoo.</p><p>Strategic planned burning around areas of significant biodiversity and wildlife refuges could \"not only reduce the risk bushfire presents to life and property but also the devastating impacts of unrestrained fire on critical habitat,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>About 1.5 million hectares was burnt in eastern victoria during last year's bushfires.</p><p>At a meeting in mid-March, representatives from 16 Gippsland conservation groups, including Gippsland Environment Group, Environment East Gippsland and Lakes Entrance Landcare, met with the Environment Department and FFMV staff and moved a motion requesting that all burns are \"paused and reviewed\" this year.</p><p>Areas that have or will be burned include Mitchell River National Park, Tostaree and Wombat Track.</p><p>The group is also concerned that some of the agency's planned burn maps don't appear to include the department's own data that highlights the area's biodiversity values, meaning staff are unaware of the evidence of endangered creatures.</p><p>Gippsland Environment Groups spokesperson Louise Crisp said Forest Fire Management Victoria was burning the habitat of threatened species such as yellow bellied gliders and powerful owls.</p><p>\"Despite the catastrophic destruction of threatened species habitat and the death of millions of animals they are extinguishing their last refuges.

But there are other areas of black sheoak within the area that will be burnt.</p><p>\"It's clear that [Forest Fire Management Victoria] is not doing enough to identify and protect important habitat for species most impacted by the 2019-20 fires,\" Dr Lau said.</p><p>\"On the one hand, the Victorian government is providing support to communities to revegetate areas with sheoak ... but on the other, [Forest Fire Management Victoria] has burnt sheoak in areas unlikely to reduce risk to life and property but likely to have real consequences for threatened glossy black cockatoos.\"</p><p>In a statement, Forest Fire Management Victoria's chief fire officer Chris Hardman said biodiversity specialists assessed planned burn areas, and had recently excluded known feeding areas for the glossy black cockatoo.</p><p>Strategic planned burning around areas of significant biodiversity and wildlife refuges could \"not only reduce the risk bushfire presents to life and property but also the devastating impacts of unrestrained fire on critical habitat,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>About 1.5 million hectares was burnt in eastern victoria during last year's bushfires.</p><p>At a meeting in mid-March, representatives from 16 Gippsland conservation groups, including Gippsland Environment Group, Environment East Gippsland and Lakes Entrance Landcare, met with the Environment Department and FFMV staff and moved a motion requesting that all burns are \"paused and reviewed\" this year.</p><p>Areas that have or will be burned include Mitchell River National Park, Tostaree and Wombat Track.</p><p>The group is also concerned that some of the agency's planned burn maps don't appear to include the department's own data that highlights the area's biodiversity values, meaning staff are unaware of the evidence of endangered creatures.</p><p>Gippsland Environment Groups spokesperson Louise Crisp said Forest Fire Management Victoria was burning the habitat of threatened species such as yellow bellied gliders and powerful owls.</p><p>\"Despite the catastrophic destruction of threatened species habitat and the death of millions of animals they are extinguishing their last refuges. It's like the fires never happened,\" Ms Crisp said.</p><p>Conservationists were not opposed to planned burns, particularly when close to homes to protect assets, Ms Crisp said. But she questioned why it was necessary to burn in national parks.</p><p>Gunai Bidwell man Derek \"Poogie\" Hayes visited Mitchell River National Park after the latest hazard reduction burns: \"This is vandalism and it makes me wild. So many old trees burning up. And when the scrub grows back thick after the burn, you won't be able to walk through here.\"</p><p>The burns in the vicinity of the Mitchell River National Park were \"cool mosaic\" burns and aimed to create a corridor of reduced fuel above communities like Flaggy Creek and Wuk Wuk, Forest Fire Management Victoria said in a statement.</p><p>After the black summer bushfires, the national Threatened Species Recovery Hub said unburnt forest refuges should be protected from burns: \"For many years, they will be the only \u2018mature' patches within extensive landscapes and hence require protection.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520402170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62F1-V431-DY19-C3K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>12:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Some 220 fires, grass and scrub fires, since Saturday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yesterday, as many people would know, we saw very strong winds coupled by hot temperatures and then that frontal system came through which saw 93 kilometres an hour winds affecting most of the firegrounds across East Gippsland there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire of main concern this evening as we go to air is that Briagolong fire. It is some 5,600 hectares. Fire crews, assisted by water bombing aircraft and heavy plant this evening, have been working on the southern containment of that.</p><p>It will be, the next 24 hours will be key for fire authorities here in Victoria. We are going to see a return of those winds.</p><p>Already the winds are starting to pick up across East Gippsland and over the night tonight and into very early in the morning, we'll see a return potentially of some of those 80 kilometres winds, northerlies, all across that fireground.</p><p>It is active, it is 42 kilometres in perimeter and we do expect that fire will move tonight.</p><p>So a long way from being out of the woods. the communities south of the Briagolong fire need to be alert to what's going on. Stay up to date, have that Vic Emergency app and be prepared to get into action tonight.</p><p>SARAH FERGUSON:\u00a0 Now tell me, were people prepared for fires so early in the season?</p><p>JASON HEFFERNAN:\u00a0 We've had three years of really unseasonally wet weather here in Victoria and in the lead up to your into there, certainly the East Gippsland region where we see these fires has been the driest on record over winter which has lead the bushland to be prime for what we have here now.</p><p>The fire danger period for East Gippsland comes into effect this week. That is some six weeks earlier than what we would traditionally see here in this part of Victoria.</p><p>Today we have a total fire ban in the north-west of the state, in the Mallee weather districts and 35 degrees, a hot northerly winds. That declaration of an El Nino by the bureau coupled with that positive Indian Ocean dipole has created a recipe for really dry conditions here in Victoria which has led to these fires across the Gippsland.</p><p>SARAH FERGUSON:\u00a0 So tell me this, is the CFA, do you have all of the assets that you need to fight fires this summer?</p><p>JASON HEFFERNAN:\u00a0 We work as one here in Victoria. It is not just the CFA volunteers, we are joined by our career counterparts in Forest Fire Management Victoria and of course, Fire Rescue Victoria.</p><p>CFA's 52,000 strong volunteer workforce, 30,000 operational members, they are out there doing what they do best in protection of their Victoria communities and we saw a large deployment yesterday of volunteer firefighters, some up to 600, deploy into the Gippsland across these fires.</p><p>And as we speak, there are strike teams coming out of the Melbourne area into the Gippsland region in anticipation for the weather this evening. The Victorian communities can rest assured that they are well looked after this summer.</p><p>SARAH FERGUSON:\u00a0 And does that mean that you do have enough fire-bombing aircraft available to use should you need them?</p><p>JASON HEFFERNAN:\u00a0 Fire-bombing aircraft this year, we have more capacity this year than what we did last year with available aircraft which is fantastic.</p><p>Aircraft are just one tool in the toolkit when it comes to dealing with bushfire suppression. We've got heavy plant and of course, aircraft along can't put fires out - you need firefighters on the ground.</p><p>So, as we lead into tonight, those concerning weather conditions across East Gippsland, obviously the aircraft will not necessarily be available to us.</p><p>So it will be a ground firefight this evening but more importantly, it will be about making the sure the community is aware that tonight, particularly those south of the Briagolong fire, you could be in danger as these winds continue to increase. Have that Vic Emergency app with you this evening and take the action as required.</p><p>SARAH FERGUSON:\u00a0 Now just a question about you, you've been a volunteer, I think you became a volunteer firefighter in the late 1980s. What have you seen across those decades in terms of the change in the nature of fires, the duration, what it is like to be a firefighter compared to then?</p><p>JASON HEFFERNAN:\u00a0 For myself, being a volunteer firefighter was probably the best thing I have ever done for myself.</p><p>I felt a need to give back to my local community and watching the RFS volunteers, I'm from regional New South Wales and watching them go out and protect their local communities and I thought to myself, you know what, if they can do it, why can't I.</p><p>Fantastic training, leadership, some skills that I use to this very day. So I encourage anyone to think about joining their local CFA here in Victoria and giving back to their community.</p><p>It is about being part of the community and that social network and giving back to them in people's times of need is an added benefit.</p><p>There is no doubt that we are seeing a change in our climate. I have seen fire seasons in my later part of my career now, starting earlier but finishing later which will be a challenge for fire authorities not only in the coming years but for the decades to come.</p><p>SARAH FERGUSON:\u00a0 And just briefly, I think your organisation launched a recruitment drive for volunteers recently. Is there still time for people to make a meaningful difference as volunteers?</p><p>JASON HEFFERNAN:\u00a0 Absolutely. There is always time. In CFA we have launched the Give Us a Hand campaign asking exactly that - people in the community to come along, give their local CFA a hand, join up.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you think you can't be a firefighter, we have many roles not just those that hold the hose. We have got radio operators, we have got catering officers, logistics operators. We have got people that use their administrative skills in their own professional careers to assist brigades in managing in their day-to-day functions.</p><p>We have got people that load aircraft, use their mappings skills or work in instant management teams. There is a role for everyone in the CFA and we encourage people to reach out, have a chat with us or go to our CFA website and have a read and think about giving us a hand.</p><p>SARAH FERGUSON:\u00a0 Jason Heffernan, thank you for joining us and we wish the very best over the coming days. Thank you.</p><p>JASON HEFFERNAN:\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCRPT-102926570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCRPT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:699F-86V1-JBN5-F1S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>7.30 Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"3999\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 2, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A2L7</classCode><className>INDIAN OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

system is exaggerating the risks, alarming communities, and undermining public confidence, an ABC investigation has found.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Australian Fire Danger Rating System (AFDRS) mistakenly warned Queensland's Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) earlier this month that a large swathe of southern Queensland was facing catastrophic conditions \u2013 when it was not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QFES staff scrambled to adjust the system at midnight before the day of the so-called \"catastrophic\" fire category in a bid to downgrade the rating that had been applied across the Darling Downs and Granite Belt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The incorrect classification of \"catastrophic\" \u2014\u00a0which calls for residents in a fire area to evacuate, and warns of a high probability of loss of life and property \u2014\u00a0stood for at least 16 hours before being downgraded.</p><p>Introduced in September last year, the AFDRS was supposed to use the latest science, including detailed vegetation data maps and fire prediction models, to more accurately gauge bushfire behaviour.</p><p>But the ABC has confirmed the system has been generating misleading ratings, because it requires detailed data about vegetation that is often unavailable.</p><p>Under the previous system, fire department staff were only required to choose between two types of vegetation.</p><p>But the AFDRS calls for officers to choose from\u00a0eight different fuel types and consider moisture content.</p><h>'Teething issues'</h><p>Problems were flagged earlier this year interstate when a West Australian government fire officer briefed a Perth council about \"teething\" issues with the way types of vegetation were scored in the system.</p><p>Mundaring Shire Council's June minutes recorded the briefing and noted that \"public confidence in the system has faded as a result\".</p><p>The National Council for Fire and Emergency Services in Australia and New Zealand (AFAC), which oversaw the system's development and implementation, this week admitted there were \"some improvements to inputs needed\".</p><p>But AFAC said the system was a fundamentally safer option that was being fine-tuned and \"places us in a much better position than retaining the widely-criticised system of the past\".</p><p>The system's operations have been criticised by a former Queensland government fire behaviour expert, who has described it as not fit for purpose and called for the original ratings system to be reinstated while the AFDRS is fine-tuned.</p><p>\"We don't have the quality of inputs that we need to get really confident fire danger ratings out of the new system,'' says fire behaviour expert Andrew Sturgess, who founded and ran Queensland's Fire Service's predictive services unit until late 2019.</p><p>\"The new system, it requires a whole pile of new data relating to things like the height of the fuel and the load on the ground.</p><p>\"To be trying to make a decision about the conditions at midnight the day before, means the system is not fit for purpose.\"</p><p>Mr Sturgess said the system was especially struggling with fire danger ratings in pine plantations and in spinifex areas.</p><p>\"[It requires] a\u00a0high level of detail about the pine plantations, such as the age of the trees, but this data was not available,\" he said.</p><h>'A gross over-prediction'</h><p>Mr Sturgess, who is now working as an independent fire mitigation and behaviour consultant, said presenting an incorrect outlook of a catastrophic fire season could undermine public confidence.</p><p>He said the forecast in early September of catastrophic fire danger for southern Queensland was \"a gross over-prediction\".</p><p>\"It's a huge problem because we need people to understand what that means.\"</p><p>He also noted the recent decision in New South Wales, where a catastrophic fire danger rating for a large region of the state's far south coast led to the closure of 20 schools.</p><p>Mr Sturgess said conditions were\u00a0bad, but would not have been classified at the highest level under the old system.</p><p>NSW Rural Fire Service has rejected the claim, with a spokesperson saying the inputs for the far south coast were confirmed with the local district ahead of the forecast weather last week.</p><p>The catastrophic classification in southern Queensland on September 4 triggered unease among the affected councils.</p><h>'Fielding calls as the rain fell'</h><p>Goondiwindi Regional Council mayor Lawrence Springborg said a \"higher level of explanation\" was needed about how the system worked.</p><p>He said he had been fielding calls from media from around Australia about the catastrophic rating as rain fell on his roof.</p><p>\"When we got this catastrophic forest fire risk,\u00a0that raised a lot of concerns for a whole range of people,'' Cr Springborg said.</p><p>\"This is something we will be pursuing with the authorities to so we can get a better understanding and explanation, and also encourage them to make sure that the community have got some awareness.</p><p>\"Otherwise, the community might not take it seriously.\"</p><p>Western Downs Regional Council mayor Paul McVeigh said catastrophic conditions can trigger \"quite a bit of effort\".</p><p>\"We have to have people leave their residence and they have to have somewhere to go like evacuation centres,'' he said.</p><p>Asked about what is being done to correct the problem, QFES said it was updating vegetation maps and reviewing the system's baseline.</p><p>\"In addition, in coming weeks QFES is conducting a workshop alongside industry experts to review the AFDRS baseline and overall vegetation classification inputs, to ensure the data going into the system is of the highest standard and is providing accurate fire danger forecasting across Queensland,\"\u00a0a spokesperson said.</p><p>\"As a partner in the development of the AFDRS, QFES was aware that the size of Queensland had the potential to generate data challenges.\"</p><h>'Over-forecasting\u00a0issue resolved'</h><p>The spokesperson said there had been a review of the September 4 incident and the issue that led to the \"over-forecasting\" had been resolved.</p><p>An AFAC spokesperson said the \"scale of change\" in moving to the new system \"cannot be underestimated\".</p><p>\"Community confidence in the system is vital and ongoing refinements to the system will ensure more accurate and timely fire risk information to the public,'' the spokesperson said.</p><p>\"Where issues with the AFDRS are identified, they are investigated, and where necessary, improvements are made.\"</p><p>The AFDRS system cost $11.6 million, with extra funding made available to support local implementation, including a national education campaign, the spokesperson said.</p><p>The overhaul of the old fire rating system was recommended by the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements in 2020.</p><p>The old system featured six different fire rating levels and predicted fire behaviour based on two types of vegetation \u2013 forest and grass.</p><p>Federal Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt acknowledged issues with the AFDRS on ABC Radio Perth this morning, but said it was a significant improvement on existing

Most visitors come to the alps in winter, when snow blankets these mountains and these changes are less obvious.</p><p>In theory, these younger snow gums will mature, produce seed, and sustain the next generation. But they need to be at least 20 years old to produce seed, perhaps more, and the odds of another bushfire sweeping through in that time period are shortening.</p><p>Otherwise, it's like these young forests are stuck in toddlerdom; just as they begin to mature they get hit by another bushfire, and the forest has to attempt to start the cycle all over again.</p><p>Snow gums extend all the way from the central highlights in Victoria to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=590654907&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU989AU989&amp;q=Kosciuszko&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimg8rxoY2DAxWMS2wGHUoGDLAQkeECKAB6BAgJEAI\">Kosciuszko</url> in New South Wales, and are also found in Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. But the biggest impact on them is in the middle part of their range, in Victoria, where the really high frequency of fires are occurring.</p><p>Dr Tom Fairman, a forest scientist at Melbourne University, did his doctoral research on the frequency of alpine fires: \"I remember looking at maps of fires and thinking 'They're starting to overlap, that's concerning.' There were only a few years between big, landscape-scale bushfires.\"</p><p/><p>Fairman surveyed snowgum forests, and mixed tree species forests, to find out how well they were resprouting, going into areas that had been burned in high-severity fires up to three times in a decade, in 2003, 2007 and 2013.</p><p>He found snow gums recovered after a couple of fires, but after the third one they really suffered, with a loss in the ability of the lignotuber to keep pushing out shoots.</p><p>After two fires the background mortality rate was about 10 per cent of the trees, but after three fires it jumped to half of them. At some sites it was as high as 80 per cent.</p><p>\"I have some very distinct memories of sitting at the end of the day looking across a valley...that had been burned multiple times, and you could see the stems of the trees and underneath them mainly acacia shrubs and grass...it affected me quite deeply,\" says Fairman. \"I remember thinking 'Shit, we have to start doing stuff differently. We have to confront this. We're pushing things beyond a resilient limit for a species that is otherwise pretty tough'.\"</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.128%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/93d31357480649e7fdb44d9f9e695162dcb8c56b\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>Snow gums are the only tree species at high altitudes, and removing them will change the microclimate of the region, the composition of the soil and its permeability, says Morgan.</p><p>\"It's not like we get rid of snow gums and another eucalypt takes its place...it is the only species up here.\"</p><p>Multiple fires lead to significant changes in the understorey of a snow gum forest, and grasses dominate rather than shrubby plants, creating a savannah landscape. \"All these now dead trees we see around us are no longer carbon sinks, they're sources of carbon emissions.

But in its case the state government spent more than seven million dollars after the black summer fires to airlift tonnes of seed to the devastated forests.</p><p>Commensurate action has been taken on snow gums, says Walker, who estimates roughly a third of Victorian snow gum forests are under threat.</p><p>Walker, and the scientists we interviewed, want the state government to undertake a scientific survey and assessment of snow gum health, and actively protect the remaining areas of old-growth snow gums from fire.</p><p>And this would require a shift in the public conversation about what should be prioritised during bushfires, to include the protection of natural and ecological \"assets\", as well as human ones.</p><p>There are some precedents for this.

Most visitors come to the alps in winter, when snow blankets these mountains and these changes are less obvious.</p><p>In theory, these younger snow gums will mature, produce seed, and sustain the next generation. But they need to be at least 20 years old to produce seed, perhaps more, and the odds of another bushfire sweeping through in that time period are shortening.</p><p>Otherwise, it's like these young forests are stuck in toddlerdom; just as they begin to mature they get hit by another bushfire, and the forest has to attempt to start the cycle all over again.</p><p>Snow gums extend all the way from the central highlights in Victoria to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=590654907&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU989AU989&amp;q=Kosciuszko&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimg8rxoY2DAxWMS2wGHUoGDLAQkeECKAB6BAgJEAI\">Kosciuszko</url> in New South Wales, and are also found in Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. But the biggest impact on them is in the middle part of their range, in Victoria, where the really high frequency of fires are occurring.</p><p>Dr Tom Fairman, a forest scientist at Melbourne University, did his doctoral research on the frequency of alpine fires: \"I remember looking at maps of fires and thinking 'They're starting to overlap, that's concerning.' There were only a few years between big, landscape-scale bushfires.\"</p><p/><p>Fairman surveyed snowgum forests, and mixed tree species forests, to find out how well they were resprouting, going into areas that had been burned in high-severity fires up to three times in a decade, in 2003, 2007 and 2013.</p><p>He found snow gums recovered after a couple of fires, but after the third one they really suffered, with a loss in the ability of the lignotuber to keep pushing out shoots.</p><p>After two fires the background mortality rate was about 10 per cent of the trees, but after three fires it jumped to half of them. At some sites it was as high as 80 per cent.</p><p>\"I have some very distinct memories of sitting at the end of the day looking across a valley...that had been burned multiple times, and you could see the stems of the trees and underneath them mainly acacia shrubs and grass...it affected me quite deeply,\" says Fairman. \"I remember thinking 'Shit, we have to start doing stuff differently. We have to confront this. We're pushing things beyond a resilient limit for a species that is otherwise pretty tough'.\"</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.128%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/93d31357480649e7fdb44d9f9e695162dcb8c56b\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>Snow gums are the only tree species at high altitudes, and removing them will change the microclimate of the region, the composition of the soil and its permeability, says Morgan.</p><p>\"It's not like we get rid of snow gums and another eucalypt takes its place...it is the only species up here.\"</p><p>Multiple fires lead to significant changes in the understorey of a snow gum forest, and grasses dominate rather than shrubby plants, creating a savannah landscape. \"All these now dead trees we see around us are no longer carbon sinks, they're sources of carbon emissions. That's happening over a large part of the Victorian Alps,\" says Morgan.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.128%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/d33b945f5133b1034ae3bad5bb25670cf63261cd\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>We're walking through an alpine meadow, spongy with thick mosses, sedges and grasses, with Cam Walker, the campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth.</p><p>Walker lives for part of the year at the ski village of Dinner Plain, near Hotham Heights, and joined the local Country Fire Authority brigade as a volunteer after the fires in 2016.</p><p>Evacuating from the village at the time, he saw three towering pyrocumulonimus clouds, generated by fire, stretching in a line southward: \"I realised, this is the future,\" he says.</p><p>Another mountain tree species, the lesser-known alpine ash, is in even bigger trouble than snow gums, also because of the frequency of fires, says Walker. But in its case the state government spent more than seven million dollars after the black summer fires to airlift tonnes of seed to the devastated forests.</p><p>Commensurate action has been taken on snow gums, says Walker, who estimates roughly a third of Victorian snow gum forests are under threat.</p><p>Walker, and the scientists we interviewed, want the state government to undertake a scientific survey and assessment of snow gum health, and actively protect the remaining areas of old-growth snow gums from fire.</p><p>And this would require a shift in the public conversation about what should be prioritised during bushfires, to include the protection of natural and ecological \"assets\", as well as human ones.</p><p>There are some precedents for this. During the Australian bushfires of 2019-20, a team of remote area firefighters was successfully deployed to save the ancient Wollemi pines from the giant Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales.</p><p>And a similar approach was taken during these fires in the Namadgi National Park, in the Australian Capital Territory, where bulldozers cut containment lines to prevent fire spreading into important unburnt vegetation.</p><p>The Victorian government has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/open-call-next-generation-forest-firefighters\">recruited more forest firefighters</url>, but further investment is needed, including the establishment of a volunteer remote area firefighting team - Victoria is the only state on the east coast that doesn't have one - and the purchase of a large airtanker.</p><p>It's not all bad news, Walker is keen to point out, leading us to a patch of young snow gums that have flourished during the past three years of damp La Nina conditions. \"What we know is these forests will come back, but only if you keep the fire out. It's a very low intervention approach.\"</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.263%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e40704d0719df2d1d59d29b5989f9eeaeba4ea95\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Joe Armao</p><p>A spokesperson for the Victorian government said it conducts monitoring programs across the state's forests to inform ongoing protection of its precious native ecosystems, including snow gum woodlands.</p><p>\"Forest Fire Management Victoria also focuses on rapid response in sensitive environmental areas - this includes using helicopter rappel crews to access remote snow gum woodlands and alpine landscapes,\" they said.</p><p>Understanding the damage wrought by fire on snow gum woodlands should sound an alarm bell for anyone who loves Australia's alpine areas, says Walker. \"It's devastating. Like everyone else, I thought, well, we live in a country that's built on fire. Everything is fire adapted. You think it will come back.

But in its case the state government spent more than seven million dollars after the black summer fires to airlift tonnes of seed to the devastated forests.</p><p>Commensurate action has been taken on snow gums, says Walker, who estimates roughly a third of Victorian snow gum forests are under threat.</p><p>Walker, and the scientists we interviewed, want the state government to undertake a scientific survey and assessment of snow gum health, and actively protect the remaining areas of old-growth snow gums from fire.</p><p>And this would require a shift in the public conversation about what should be prioritised during bushfires, to include the protection of natural and ecological \"assets\", as well as human ones.</p><p>There are some precedents for this. During the Australian bushfires of 2019-20, a team of remote area firefighters was successfully deployed to save the ancient Wollemi pines from the giant Gospers Mountain fire in New South Wales.</p><p>And a similar approach was taken during these fires in the Namadgi National Park, in the Australian Capital Territory, where bulldozers cut containment lines to prevent fire spreading into important unburnt vegetation.</p><p>The Victorian government has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/open-call-next-generation-forest-firefighters\">recruited more forest firefighters</url>, but further investment is needed, including the establishment of a volunteer remote area firefighting team - Victoria is the only state on the east coast that doesn't have one - and the purchase of a large airtanker.</p><p>It's not all bad news, Walker is keen to point out, leading us to a patch of young snow gums that have flourished during the past three years of damp La Nina conditions. \"What we know is these forests will come back, but only if you keep the fire out.

About 5000 paid firefighters are covered, as are some 90 maintenance staff.</p><p>The reform, which could be brought before parliament within weeks, will probably reignite tensions between Labor and the professional firefighters' body.</p><p>While the United Firefighters Union (UFU) is supportive of expanding the number of cancers covered by the laws, it has long campaigned against them applying to employees who work on vehicle and equipment maintenance.</p><p>Personal injury lawyers have previously warned the inclusion of people who are not firefighters could make it easier for insurers to challenge claims because mechanics are exposed to fewer risks from toxic fumes. The government has insisted maintenance workers who attend fires should have the same rights as professional firefighters.</p><p>United Firefighters Union boss Peter Marshall yesterday called for an urgent parliamentary inquiry.</p><p>\"The presumptive cancer legislation that supports professional firefighters is underpinned by comprehensive scientific medical research, which establishes the link between the occupation of firefighting and cancer,\" he said.</p><p>\"By ignoring that scientific evidence and expanding presumptive cancer legislation to non-firefighters, the Andrews government is putting the integrity of those laws at risk.\"</p><p>Geelong-based firefighter Katherine Dunell, who has been present at major chemical blazes, told The Age: \"Mechanics don't go into burning buildings. Firefighters do.\"</p><p>However, she said she wanted to see female-specific cancers added to existing laws. Testicular and prostate cancers are already covered by Victoria's scheme.</p><p>\"At the moment, female firefighters, who do the same job as their male counterparts, do not have the same presumptive cancer protections in place,\" she said.</p><p>Dunell said she was not aware of any female firefighters in Victoria with cancer, but did know of one in Western Australia who wasn't covered by presumptive cancer laws. There were just over 20 women firefighters in Victoria as of 2019.</p><p>The Greens unveiled their own bill yesterday, arguing that the government had taken too long to close the \"gender medical data gap\". That bill focuses on covering firefighters with primary site ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer once they've been in the job for a decade.</p><p>Asked if the party was open to supporting legislation that covered female mechanics, Greens leader Samantha Ratnam said: \"This is the reform that we're putting on the table.\"</p><p>The UFU has called on Labor to support the Greens' bill. During last year's state election, the union urged voters to put government candidates last in key seats, including Richmond, which Labor lost to the Greens.</p><p>Marshall campaigned for Premier Daniel Andrews in 2014, but the pair later had a public falling-out over controversial fire services reforms, which included presumptive cancer laws. Andrews rubbished the Greens yesterday, describing the party as the \"commentators in the cheap seats\".</p><p>\"We won't be having to rely upon a Green political party bill,\" he said. \"Let me make it clear: we will have more to say about this, and it'll have precisely nothing to do with the Green political party.</p><p>In response, Ratnam said the Greens had been championing these reforms for more than a decade.</p><p>\"One of our jobs as the Greens in the Victorian parliament is to push the government to go further and faster at every opportunity on progressive reforms,\" she said.</p><p>The Coalition's emergency services spokeswoman, Ann-Marie Hermans, told The Age all firefighters, regardless of their sex, deserve to be supported by \"appropriate\" presumptive cancer laws.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7qjhe6bef0612gmjhsl</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-X8G1-JD34-V002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

You might remember sceptics <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/some-say-weve-seen-bushfires-worse-than-this-before-but-theyre-ignoring-a-few-key-facts-129391\">questioning the idea</url> that the Black Summer fires really were worse than conflagrations like the 1939 Black Friday fires in Victoria. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We can now confidently say that these fires were far from normal. Our new analysis of Australian forest fire trends just published in <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27225-4\">Nature Communications</url> confirms for the first time the Black Summer fires are part of a clear trend of worsening fire weather and ever-larger forest areas burned by fires. </p><h>What did we find?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our study found that the annual area burned by fire across Australia's forests has been increasing by about 48,000 ha per year over the last three decades. After five years, that would be roughly the size of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/latestproducts/415C79FDC0BB111ECA2573A1007B3070?opendocument\">entire</url>Australian Capital Territory (235,000 hectares). </p><p>We found three out of four extreme forest fire years since states started keeping records 90 years ago have occurred since 2002. </p><p>And we found that the fire season is growing, moving out of spring and summer into autumn and winter. </p><p>These trends are almost entirely due to Australia's increasingly severe fire weather and are consistent with predicted human-induced climate change. </p><p>Our study is based on satellite and ground-based estimates of burnt forest area, and trends of nine wildfire risk factors and indices that relate to characteristics of fuel loads, fire weather, extreme fire behaviour, and ignition. </p><p>We have focused here only on the most dangerous forest fires, not the fires affecting Australia's savanna across the tropical north.</p><h>Fire burns much more land than 25 years ago</h><p>Before the 1990s, Australia's forest fires were infrequent, though damaging. A given area would burn at an interval between 20 to over 100 years. </p><p>The exception were rare summers which would see severe and extensive fires, such as 1939. Overall, only a small fraction of the total forest area burned in any year.  </p><p>This pattern of fire behaviour no longer exists. </p><p>Over the last 30 years, the areas affected by fire have grown enormously. </p><p>If we compare the satellite records from 1988-2001 to the period from 2002-2018, the annual average fire area has shot up by 350%.    </p><p>If we include the 2019-20 Black Summer fires, that figure soars to 800% - an enormous leap.  </p><p>We are seeing fires growing the most in areas once less likely to be affected by fire, such as cool wet Tasmanian forests unaccustomed to large fires as well as the warmest forests in Queensland previously kept safe from fire by rainfall and a humid microclimate. This includes ancient Gondwanan rainforests not adapted for fire. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: A staggering 1.8 million hectares burned in 'high-severity' fires during Australia's Black Summer</emphasis></p><h>More extreme fire years and longer fire seasons</h><p>Before 2002, there was just one megafire year in the 90 years Australian states have been keeping records - and that was 1939. </p><p>Since 2001, there have been three megafire years, defined as a year in which more than one million hectares burn. </p><p>Our fire seasons are also getting longer. Spring and summer used to be the time most forest fires would start. That's no longer guaranteed. </p><p>Since 2001 winter fires have soared five-fold compared to 1988-2001 and autumn fires three-fold. </p><p>Overall, fires in the cooler months of March to August are growing exponentially at 14% a year. </p><h>What's driving these changes?</h><p>Imagine a forest fire starts from a lightning strike in remote bushland. What are the factors which would make it grow, spread and intensify? </p><p>A fire will get larger and more dangerous if it has access to more fuel (dry grass, fallen limbs and bark), and if the fire starts when the weather is hotter, drier and windier. Topography also plays a role, with fire able to move much faster uphill. </p><p>To get a sense of the overall risk of forest fire, temperature, humidity, windspeed and soil moisture are combined into a single figure, the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI). </p><p>As you might expect, this index has been steadily worsening over the past 40 years. The number of very high fire danger days in forest zones has been increasing by 1.6 days per decade. </p><p>So what does this mean for fire behaviour and spread?</p><p>In what we believe is a first, we have used 32 years of fire index data across Australia's forest zones and compared the number of very high or severe fire danger days with areas subsequently burnt by fire. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Humans see just 4.7km into the distance. So how can we truly understand what the bushfires destroyed?</emphasis></p><p>We found a clear link, with a 300 to 500% increase in burnt area for every extra day of severe fire danger, and a 21% increase in burnt area for every extra day of very high fire danger. </p><p>Could fuel loads or prescribed burning be to blame? No. We looked for trends in these factors, and found nothing to explain the rise in burnt areas. </p><p>The main driver for the growing areas burnt by fire is Australia's increasingly severe fire weather, accounting for 75% of the variation observed in the total annual area of forest fires. This is consistent with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46362-x\">predictions from climate change scenarios</url> that severe fire weather conditions will intensify due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  </p><p>Other fire weather risks are also growing. We're seeing more higher atmospheric conditions which can lead to the formation of fire-generated thunderstorms (known as pyrocumulonimbus clouds).</p><p>These thunderstorms emerging out of fire plumes can spread burning embers further and whip up more dangerous winds for unpredictable fire behaviour on the ground, as well as generate lightning in the fire plume that can ignite new fires far ahead of the fire front. </p><p>Dry lightning is the primary natural cause of fire ignitions. Here too, the trends are worsening in southeast Australia. We are now seeing 50% more dry lightning in forest areas in recent decades (2000-2016) compared to the previous two (1980-1999).</p><p>Under most <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/weather-services/fire-weather-centre/bushfire-weather/index.shtml\">climate change scenarios</url>, fire weather is predicted to keep on worsening. </p><h>Can we predict our next megafire?</h><p>So could we have predicted how bad and how widespread the Black Summer fires would have been, if we had examined fire danger index forecasts in mid-2019? </p><p>In short, yes. </p><p>The huge amount of bush that burned is entirely consistent with the 34 days of very high forest fire danger across the forest zones that summer. That's in line with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1071/ES20001\">long-range bushfire weather forecasts</url> provided to fire agencies earlier in 2019. </p><p>This means that in future years, we will be able to broadly predict the area likely to burn each fire season by examining fire index forecasts. </p><p>We can also safely -\u00a0and sadly -\u00a0predict that more and more of Australia will burn in years to come, with increasing numbers of megafire years. </p><p>While many factors contribute to <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/102/6/BAMS-D-20-0112.1.xml\">catastrophic fire events</url>, our Black Summer was not an aberration. </p><p>Rather, it was the continuation of fire trends beginning more than two decades ago. It is now clear that human-induced climate change is creating ever more dangerous conditions for fires in Australia. </p><p>We need to be ready for more Black Summers -\u00a0and worse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Dowdy receives funding from the National Environmental Science Program (NESP) Climate Systems Hub.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pep Canadell receives funding from the National Environmental Science Program - Climate Systems Hub</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Garry Cook, Juergen Knauer, Mick Meyer, and Peter Briggs do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAUS-172506</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:645J-9V91-JB75-9256-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1273\"/><timeReceived>10:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Australia</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6070\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 26, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Photo courtesy The Koondrook and Barham Bridge Newspaper</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Cohuna men were part of a team of 46 Victorians from Forest Fire Management Victoria and the Country Fire Authority which spent 35 days providing relief to exhausted Canadian fire crews fighting the Kimiwan complex near Peace River in Alberta. They joined crews from other parts of Australia, New Zealand, United States, South Africa, France, Chile, Costa Rica, Portugal and Spain.\u00a0</p><p>Tim said he was excited to be part of Victoria\u2019s first taskforce to join the emergency response, which flew out on May 26 and returned on June 30. \u201cI have been hoping for an international trip for years,\u201d he said, \u201cso I was really excited. I was somewhat proud to represent Victoria, and to lead the first taskforce from Victoria.\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s taskforce of 20 Victorians was located in a flat, swampy area with millions of hectares of spruce and aspen (poplar) forests, and very remote. The weather was cold at night with daytime tops of about 23 degrees.</p><p>The team completed a 16-day shift followed by two days of rest before a final 14-day shift. Besides a little socialising with Albertan crews, U.S. Hotshot crews and other Australians, 14-hour shifts meant the members were physically exhausted. \u201cWe would eat, shower and bed, because we were exhausted. We\u2019d lay down in a bright tent for the night,\u201d said Tim.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230713-Canadian-Wildfires-Base-camp-at-11pm.jpg\">Base camp was in a lucerne paddock. Photo taken at 11pm. Photo courtesy The Koondrook and Barham Bridge Newspaper</url></p><p>The brightness Tim refers to is due to their proximity to the Arctic Circle, causing the sky to stay relatively light much of the night. \u201cWe were there for the longest day, so it actually never got dark. It was sort of twilight between midnight and 2 in the morning, then the sun would be up again. We were in tents, so it was light all the time. It was a bit hard to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Tim\u2019s role as taskforce leader saw him manage the taskforce of on-ground firefighters, who, he says were popular due to their competency in ignition, backburning and helicopter work, and were involved in supervising bulldozers, setting up pumps and hose lays, and a lot of backburning. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause the nature of the forest is very wet, swampy ground, transport in was with snow mobiles or tracked vehicles, we couldn\u2019t drive anywhere. We were airlifted in by helicopters a lot of the time.\u201d</p><p>Base camp and the air base were in a farmer\u2019s lucerne paddock and consisted of portable facilities including kitchen, laundry, toilets and showers. Small tents dotted the paddock and helicopters flew in and out.</p><p>An orientation session upon arrival instructed the crews on wildlife identification and behaviour and what they should do around them.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230713-Canadian-Wildfires-Helibomber.jpg\">Helicopters played a large part in the fire fighting effort.

All the local crews over there carried big knives on their belts \u2013 so most of our crew purchased knives for safety.</p><p>\u201cAll we were told was to keep our distance where we could and we learned some of their behavioural aspects, but basically, you\u2019re on your own if one was going to attack you. I was a bit nervous. Cougars were there as well, but we didn\u2019t see any of them.\u201d</p><p>Helicopter pilots would advise if bears were nearby.</p><p>\u201cWe had bears get into our pumps and jerry cans at night and bite holes in them and cart them off into the forest. We had to deal with bears a lot. We had people doing backburning and bears would wander out and we\u2019d have to scare them away at times.\u201d</p><p>Tim says he saw around a hundred black bears, some wolves, lynx, squirrels, woodpeckers, coyotes, moose, deer and plenty of beavers.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the wildlife that kept the firefighters on their toes. \u201cThe area we were in was North America\u2019s richest oil and gas field, so there were oil and gas facilities throughout the forest \u2013 oil pumps, oil trucks, so we were working around the gas and oil facilities the whole time.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230713-Canadian-Wildfires-view.jpg\">Nick Whatley (right).

Once home, both he and Nick had some very well deserved time off recovering before returning to their regular work.</p><p>\u201cI was pretty fatigued and sore,\u201d said Tim, \u201cbut I had a really good time. We bonded as a crew and had heaps of laughs and really enjoyed it.

In semi-arid Australia, fuel loads are often around half a tonne to 1.5t\u00a0per hectare, but even in these areas fuel loads have ballooned in the wet, Mr Mullins said.</p><p>\"At the moment some of those areas are at\u00a04.5t to 6t\u00a0per hectare.\"</p><p>Conditions are expected to worsen over the coming months as\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a weakens, according to Professor Karoly.</p><p>\"It's not just arid areas, it is in fact much of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia as well as south-east Queensland.</p><p>\"The risk is also expected to continue and build in March. It's a relatively warm period in southern Australia and there's often not much rain.\"</p><p>According to the Climate Council's research, Australia's worst grassfires have followed previous consecutive\u00a0La Ni\u00f1as, with the worst on record coming after\u00a01974-75, scorching around 117 million hectares of\u00a0the country.</p><p>\"If it doesn't happen this time, it will be the first time it hasn't,\" Mr Mullins\u00a0said.</p><p>Following periods of high rainfall, grassfires usually present the first threat as grasslands are quick to dry out. And though they may sound more benign than bushfires, Mr Mullins said they can be just as dangerous.</p><p>\"Scientists and firefighters will say they're less intense than forest fires, but for a person caught up in one that means nothing.\u00a0</p><p>\"They move up to four times quicker than a forest fire and they will kill.\"</p><h>Indigenous management key long term strategy</h><p>Josh Gilbert is a Worimi man from Gloucester in New South Wales\u00a0working as a consultant in the Indigenous agriculture and land management spaces. He's also studying a PhD in indigenous agriculture.</p><p>His parents' farm\u00a040 minutes from Gloucester has been hit by\u00a0one of the worst droughts on record, which was followed by bushfires, then floods.</p><p>\"On the back of the drought, we had two\u00a0floods that smashed most of our fences, and are equally the biggest floods we've seen in recent time,\" he said.</p><p>\" [And] we had the bushfires before the floods.\"</p><p>He said he's seen potential fire conditions worsen recently as the country around Gloucester has dried out, and that one fire has already got out of control\u00a0this year.</p><p>\"The big amount of rain\u00a0led to a real increase in grass growth and the conditions have dried really quickly,\" Mr Gilbert said.</p><p>\"Just in our local area in Gloucester we had a fire get out of hand. It was pretty severe \u2014 we had helicopters [water] bombing it.\"</p><p>Mr Gilbert said his family has\u00a0strategies to help with\u00a0fire resilience on the farm, but Indigenous land management is the best long-term option.</p><p>Across much of Australia, he said, there's already a wealth of Indigenous knowledge and experience in land management that can be supported. Where that knowledge has been lost, it can be relearned.</p><p>\"There's an opportunity right across Australia to have that practical land management tool for mob. What I encourage is that land is proactively managed, even for conservation.</p><p>\"Mob who have a longstanding knowledge and relationship with country \u2014 that care on country is what's going to benefit it most, rather than putting a padlock on a gate and hoping for the best.\"</p><h>Climate change 'supercharging' risk</h><p>Today's report forecasts dangerous grassfire conditions over the next few months, and that\u00a0by next summer there will be an elevated risk of bushfires as well.</p><p>But while La Ni\u00f1a-El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0transitions can\u00a0create the conditions for fire, climate change extremes are \"supercharging\"\u00a0the risk, Mr Mullins and Professor Karoly\u00a0said.</p><p>A combination of El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0and temperature extremes next summer has the potential to produce another devastating bushfire season.</p><p>But Professor Karoly said while an\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o is a possibility, it's not considered likely at this early stage.</p><p>\"The Bureau's [BOM]\u00a0forecast models suggest\u00a0that an El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0is possible, but not likely yet.</p><p>\"But even with normal conditions come spring and summer in southern Australia later this year, it's likely there'll be rapid drying conditions which will affect grasslands first, then forest fire danger will increase.\"</p><p>Mr Mullins said it's a matter of when, not if, the fires will come.</p><p>\"Our message is:\u00a0this is coming, get ready. But if we have a climate change overlay, this could be massive.</p><p>\"That's the worry.\u00a0All the fire services are starting to warn already, but we just don't know what to expert in terms of weather \u2014\u00a0if it's supercharged, we might see something like Colorado.\"</p><p>In the US winter of December 2021, following a drought in Colorado, a grassfire driven by winds in excess of 185 kilometres per hour ripped through country near Denver, destroying 1,100 homes and killing one\u00a0person.</p><p>As an example of the unpredictable weather Denver was facing, it snowed the next day.</p><p>As well as supercharging weather events, Professor Karoly said climate change is narrowing the window for hazard reduction burning.</p><h>Mood has changed but more needs to be done</h><p>Mr Mullins said he was fighting fires ahead of the Black Summer bushfires in 2019, but couldn't get the federal government at the time to listen to the warnings.</p><p>\"I was out there as a volunteer\u00a0firefighter and\u00a0you had minsters in Canberra saying, 'You don't know what you're\u00a0talking about.'\"</p><p>He said the attitude appears to be very different this time across all levels of government.</p><p>\"It's chalk and cheese.\u00a0They're putting money ahead of disasters.\u00a0It's nice to be listened to for a change.</p><p>\"I'm pretty confident that if we do face a catastrophe, the states, territories, federal and local government will all work much better together.\"</p><p>Mr Mullins said residents need to speak to their local fire services, and take advice on how to\u00a0prepare for fires. They also need to understand the warning system and know when it's time to leave.</p><p>But he said the bigger picture is we need to do more to slow climate change.</p><p>\"This reinforces the need for more climate action. It's good to see us move in that direction,\u00a0but we need to push the\u00a0accelerator worldwide and stop the planet heating up so quickly.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCIONL-102002490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCIONL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67M2-F341-DY47-50CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">369587</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1184\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Science Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2393\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 22, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Science and Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000479</classCode><className>DESERTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N111000CC</classCode><className>CROP PRODUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS003</classCode><className>SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But as Gamilaroi woman and educator Lee Couch advised me in 2020, the year of the Black Summer bushfires: \u201cHalf of Country was on fire this year. There\u2019s no better time to listen to Country than now.\u201d  If you can\u2019t listen to Country, listen to expert women attuned to the land and you\u2019ll hear how a certain white masculinity is inscribed into Australia\u2019s landscapes. Social geographer Christine Eriksen\u2019s studies are among those finding bushfire \u201cis not a <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholars.uow.edu.au/christine-eriksen\">gender-neutral natural phenomenon</url>\" but a \u201cmeans by which traditional gender roles and power relations are maintained\u201d.  This happens in many ways.

Social and environment resilience researcher Associate Professor Janet Stanley is among experts explaining how <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338814483_How_a_Failure_in_Social_Justice_Is_Leading_to_Higher_Risks_of_Bushfire_Events\">social disadvantage worsens bushfire risks</url> and how policy can \u201creduce both social injustices and the occurrence of bushfires\u201d. Some women, such as Associate Professor Marta Yebra, have invented <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.anu.edu.au/news-events/events/fighting-bushfires-space-dr-marta-yebra\">satellite and drone systems</url> that could \u201cdetect bushfires early and put them out within minutes\u201d.\u00a0  Expert women say we need to redress a lethal imbalance. Rematriating involves \u201clooking at the land <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/firesticks-alliance-australia-cultural-burning-indigenous-knowledge\">like a mother</url> or a family member\u201d, says Budawang researcher Sian Hromek, a Firesticks Alliance director, in a recent interview. Country, she explains, \u201cis our life force. This is where we\u2019ve come from and where we\u2019re going back to, so we treat it like a relationship. We\u2019re the ones who need to lead this, and link arms with government \u2026 If Indigenous people aren\u2019t leading, then you aren\u2019t learning \u2026 The social implications are really important.\u201d  Expert women say Australia can\u2019t address its bushfire crises using the very structures and mindsets that enabled them. First Nations and non-Indigenous women <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/healing-country\">can't heal Country</url> using the systems whose impacts they seek to repair, and Australia won\u2019t prevent megafires while excluding more than half its citizenry.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it time to let the experts, Indigenous women, teach us how to fight fire?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Let us know by writing to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/mailto:letters@crikey.com.au\">letters@crikey.com.au</url>.
