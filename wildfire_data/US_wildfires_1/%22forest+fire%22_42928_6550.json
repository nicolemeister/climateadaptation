Bush's first defense secretary did have a gift for memorable phrases. One of them - \"weakness is provocative\" - explains the predicament we again find ourselves in with Russia's belligerence against Ukraine and NATO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's recap how we got here.</p><p>* In August 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and took control of two of its provinces. The Bush administration protested but did almost nothing. After Barack Obama won the White House that fall, he pursued a \"reset\" with Russia. In 2012, he cut U.S. force levels in Europe to their lowest levels in postwar history and mocked Mitt Romney for calling Russia our principal geopolitical threat.</p><p>* In September 2013, Mr. Obama famously retreated from his red line against Bashar Assad's use of nerve gas in Syria, accepting instead a Russian offer of mediation that was supposed to have eliminated Assad's chemical arsenal. That arsenal was never fully destroyed, but Vladimir Putin took note of Mr. Obama's palpable reluctance to get involved.</p><p>* In February 2014, Russia used \"little green men\" to seize and then annex Crimea. The Obama administration protested but did almost nothing. Russia then took advantage of unrest in eastern Ukraine to shear off two Ukrainian provinces while sparking a war that has lasted seven years and cost more than 13,000 lives. Mr. Obama responded with weak sanctions on Russia and a persistent refusal to arm Ukraine.</p><p>* In 2016, Donald Trump ran for office questioning how willing America should be to defend vulnerable NATO members. In 2017 he tried to block new sanctions on Russia but was effectively overruled by Congress.</p><p>The Trump administration did ultimately take a tougher line on Russia and approved limited arms sales to Ukraine. But Mr. Trump also tried to hold hostage military assistance to Ukraine for political favors before he was exposed, leading to his first impeachment.</p><p>Which brings us to Joe Biden, who ran for office promising a tougher line on Russia. It has been anything but. In May, his administration waived sanctions against Russia's Nord Steam 2 gas pipeline to Germany, which, when operational, will increase Moscow's energy leverage on Europe. Since coming to office, the administration has done little to increase the relatively paltry flow of military aid to Ukraine. In the face of a Russian invasion, it will be as effective as trying to put out a forest fire by peeing on it.</p><p>Then there was the fiasco of our withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"In the aftermath of Saigon redux,\" I wrote at the time, \"every enemy will draw the lesson that the United States is a feckless power.\"</p><p>The current Ukraine crisis is as much the child of Mr. Biden's Afghanistan debacle as the last Ukraine crisis was the child of Obama's Syria debacle.</p><p>Now the administration is doubling down on a message of weakness by threatening \"massive consequences for Russia\" if it invades Ukraine, nearly all in economic sanctions. That's bringing a knife to the proverbial gunfight.</p><p>Imagine this not-so-far-fetched scenario. Russian forces move on a corner of Ukraine.</p><p>The U.S. responds by cutting off Russia from the global banking system. But the Kremlin (which has built its gold and foreign-currency reserves to record highs) doesn't sit still. It responds to sanctions by cutting off gas supplies in midwinter to the European Union - which gets more than 40% of its gas from Russia. It demands a Russia-Europe security treaty as the price of the resumption of supplies. And it freezes the U.S. out of the bargain, at least until Washington shows goodwill by abandoning financial sanctions.</p><p>Such a move would force Washington to either escalate or abase itself - and this administration would almost certainly choose the latter. It would fulfill Mr. Putin's long-held ambition to break the spine of NATO.</p><p>It would further entice China into a similar mindset of aggression, probably against Taiwan.</p><p>It would be to America's global standing what the Suez Crisis was to Britain's. At least Pax Britannica could, in its twilight, give way to Pax Americana. But to what does Pax Americana give way?</p><p>What can the U.S. do instead? We should break off talks with Russia now: No country ought to expect diplomatic rewards from Washington while it threatens the destruction of our friends.</p><p>We should begin an emergency airlift of military equipment to Ukraine, on the scale of Richard Nixon's 1973 airlift to Israel, including small arms useful in a guerrilla war. And we should reinforce U.S. forces in front-line NATO states, particularly Poland and the Baltics.</p><p>None of this may be sufficient to stop Russia from invasion, which would be a tragedy for Ukrainians. But Putin is playing for bigger stakes in this crisis - another sliver of Ukrainian territory is merely a secondary prize.</p><p>What he really wants to do is end the Western alliance as we have known it since the Atlantic Charter.</p><p>As for the U.S., two decades of bipartisan American weakness in the face of his aggression has us skating close to a geopolitical debacle. Mr. Biden needs to stand tough on Ukraine in order to save NATO.</p><p>Bret Stephens is a New York Times columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Associated Press: Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was once quoted as saying that \"weakness is provocative.\" A series of events and America's response to those situations may have gone a long way toward emboldening Russian President Vladmir Putin's aggressive stance toward Ukraine.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-22011874317871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64JT-Y731-DYRS-T3GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 P.G.

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?  <br/> It was January 1983 and raining in San Francisco.  <br/>The summer before, I'd moved here from Portland, Ore., a city known for its perpetual gray drizzles and, on the 60-odd days a year when the sun deigns to shine, dazzling displays of greenery. My girlfriend had spent a year convincing me that San Francisco had much more to offer me than Portland did for her. <br/>Every few months, I'd scrape the bottom of my bank account to travel to San Francisco and taste its charms. Once, I even hitched a ride on a private plane. (Those were the days!) In a week's visit, she'd take me to multiple women's music[4] concerts\u2014events you'd wait a year for in Portland. We'd visit feminist[5] and leftist[6] bookstores, eat real Mexican food, and walk through Golden Gate Park in brilliant sunshine. The sky would be clear, the city would be sparkling, and she convinced me that San Francisco would indeed be paradise. Or at least drier than Portland. <br/>So, I moved, but I wuz robbed! I knew it that first winter when, from December through March, the rain seemed to come down in rivers\u2014atmospheric rivers[7], in fact\u2014though none of us knew the term back then. That would be my initial encounter with, as a Mexican-American friend used to call it, 'el pinche[8] ni\u00f1o.' El Ni\u00f1o is the term meteorologists give to one-half of an oscillating cyclical weather phenomenon originating in the Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o usually brings drought[9] to the southern parts of North America, as well as Central America, while deluging Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. La Ni\u00f1a[10] is the other half of that cycle, its effects roughly flipping those of El Ni\u00f1o geographically. (As for the meaning of 'pinche,' go ahead and Google it.) <br/>San Francisco sits in the sweet spot where, at least until the end of the last century, we would get winter rains at both ends of the cycle. And boy, did it rain that winter! I soon began to wonder whether any amount of love or any number of concerts could make up for the cold and mud. Eventually, I realized that I couldn't really blame the girlfriend. The only other time I'd lived in San Francisco was during the then-unusual drought year of 1976. Of course, I came to believe then that it never rained here. So, really, if there was a bait-and-switch going on, I had pulled it on myself. <br/>Still, looking back, as much as the rain annoyed me, I couldn't have imagined how much I'd miss it two decades into the 21st century. <br/>But Is It Climate Change? And Would That Actually Be So Bad? <br/>Along with the rest of the western United States, my city has now been in the grip of a two-decade-long megadrought that has persisted through a number of El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a cycles. Scientists tell us that it's the worst for the West and Southwest in at least the last 1,200 years[11]. Since 2005, I've biked or walked the three miles from my house to the university where I teach. In all those years, there have probably been fewer than 10 days when rain forced me to drive or take the bus. Periodic droughts are not unknown in this part of the country. But climate scientists are convinced[12] that this extended, deadly drought has been caused by climate change.  <br/>Current Issue <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-20-27-2023-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-20-27-2023-issue/</url><br/>It wasn't always that way. Twenty years ago, those of us who even knew about global warming, from laypeople to experts, were wary of attributing any particular weather event to it. Climate-change deniers and believers alike made a point of distinguishing between severe weather events and the long-term effects of changes in the climate. For the deniers, however, as the years went on, it seemed that no accumulation of symptoms\u2014floods, droughts, heat waves, fires, or tornadoes\u2014could legitimately be added together to yield a diagnosis of climate change. Or if climate change was the reason, then human activity didn't cause it[13] and it was probably a good thing[14] anyway. <br/>Not that long ago, it wasn't even unusual to encounter 'climate-change-is-good-for-you' articles in reasonably mainstream outlets. For example, the conservative British magazine The Spectator ran[15] a Matt Ridley[16] piece in 2013 that began: 'Climate change has done more good than harm so far and is likely to continue doing so for most of this century. This is not some barmy, right-wing fantasy; it is the consensus of expert opinion.' It turned out that Ridley's 'consensus of expert opinion' derived from a single economist's (and not a climate scientist's) paper summarizing 14 other economists on the subject. <br/>'The chief benefits of global warming,' Ridley wrote then, 'include: fewer winter deaths; lower energy costs; better agricultural yields; probably fewer droughts; maybe richer biodiversity.' He added that, were the world's economy to continue to grow by 3% annually, 'the average person will be about nine times as rich in 2080 as she is today. So low-lying Bangladesh will be able to afford the same kind of flood defenses that the Dutch have today.' <br/>There was so much wrong with those last two sentences (beginning with what 'average' means), but I'll content myself with pointing out that, in October 2022, historic floods covered[17] one-third of Pakistan (next door to Bangladesh), including prime farmland the size of the state of Virginia. Thirty-three million people were affected by those floods that, according to[18] The New York Times, 'were caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains and glacial melt.' And what led to such unusual rain and melt? As the Times reported: 'Scientists say that global warming caused by greenhouse-gas emissions is sharply increasing the likelihood of extreme rain in South Asia, home to a quarter of humanity. And they say there is little doubt that it made this year's monsoon season more destructive.' <br/>It seems unlikely those floods will lead to 'better agricultural yields.' (If only Pakistan had thought to build dikes, like the Dutch!) <br/>Maybe it's easy to take potshots at what someone like Ridley wrote almost a decade ago, knowing what we do now. Back then, views like his were not uncommon on the right and, all too sadly, they're not rare even today. (Ridley is still at it, having recently written a piece[19] twitting the British Conservative Party for supporting something as outr as wind power.) And of course, those climate change denials were supported (then and now) by the companies that stood to lose the most from confronting the dangers of greenhouse gases, not only the fossil-fuel industry[20] (whose scientists knew with stunning accuracy[21] exactly what was already happening on this planet as early as the 1970s), but electric companies[22] as well.  <br/>Back in 2000, an ExxonMobile 'advertorial[23]' in The New York Times hit the trifecta: Climate change isn't real; or if it is, humans (and especially fossil-fuel companies!) aren't responsible; and anyway it might be a good thing. Titled 'Unsettled Science,' the piece falsely argued that scientists could not agree on whether climate change was happening. (By that time, 90 percent of climate scientists, including ExxonMobile's[21], had reached a consensus that climate change is real.) After all, the ad insisted, there had been other extended periods of unusual weather like the 'little ice age' of the medieval era and, in any case, greenhouse gas concentrations vary naturally 'for reasons having nothing to do with human activity.' <br/>We shouldn't be surprised that ExxonMobile tried to keep climate change controversial in the public mind. It had a lot to lose in a transition away from fossil fuels. It's less common knowledge, however, that the company has long bankrolled climate denial[24] 'grassroots' organizations. In fact, its scientists knew about climate change as early as the 1950s and, in a 1977 internal memo[20], they summarized their research on the subject by predicting a one- to three-degree Celsius average temperature rise by 2050, pretty much the future we're now staring at. <br/>Water, Water, Anywhere? <br/>California has been 'lucky' this fall and winter. We've seen a (probably temporary) break in the endless drought. A series of atmospheric rivers[25] have brought desperately needed rain to our valleys and an abundance of snow to the mountains. But not everyone has been celebrating, as floods have swept away homes, cars, and people up and down the state. They've shut down highways and rail lines, while forcing thousands to evacuate. After years of thirst, for a few weeks the state has been drowning; and, as is so often the case with natural disasters, the poorest people[26] have been among those hardest hit. <br/>I've always enjoyed the delicious smugness of lying in a warm bed listening to wind and water banging at my windows. These days it's a guilty pleasure, though, because I know how many thousands of unhoused people have suffered in and even died during the recent storms. In Sacramento, rain marooned[27] one tent encampment, as the spit of land it occupied became an island. In the city of Ontario, near Los Angeles, flash floods washed away people's tents and may have drowned[28] as many as 10 of their inhabitants. <br/>My own city responded to the rains with police sweeps[29] of unhoused people hours before a 'bomb cyclone' hit on January 4. In such a 'sweep,' police and sometimes other officials descend suddenly to enforce city ordinances that make it illegal to sit or lie on the sidewalk. They make people 'move along,' confiscating any belongings they can't carry off. Worse yet, shelters in the city were already full. There was nowhere inside for the unhoused to go and many lost the tents that had been their only covering.  <br/>The same climate change that's prolonged the drought has exacerbated the deadly effects of those rainstorms. Over the last few years, record wildfires have consumed[30] entire communities. Twenty years of endless dry days have turned our forests and meadows into tinderboxes, just waiting for a spark. Now, when rain bangs down in such amounts on already burnt, drought-hardened land, houses slide down hills[31], trees are pulled from the earth, and sinkholes[32] open in roads and highways[33]. <br/>There is one genuine piece of luck here, though. Along with the rain, more than twice as much[34] snow as would accumulate in an average year has covered the Sierra mountains of Northern California. This is significant because many cities in the region get their water from the Sierra runoff. San Francisco is typical. Its municipal water supply comes from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, near Yosemite National Park, fed from that runoff. For now, it looks as if a number of cities could, for the first time in a while, have extra water available this year. But there's always the chance that warm weather early in the spring will turn snow to rain, melting away the snowpack and our hopes. <br/>Much of northern California's water comes from the Sierra mountains, but it's a different story in the south. The 9.8 million residents of Los Angeles County, along with most of southern California, get their water from the Colorado River. A century-old arrangement governs[35] water use by the seven states through which the Colorado runs, along with 30 tribal nations and parts of northern Mexico\u2014about 40 million people in all. Historically, the 'northern basin' states, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, have been allocated 7.5 million acre-feet of water a year. Nevada, California, and Arizona have received 8.5 million and Mexico has treaty rights to 1.5 million. Dams on the two lakes\u2014Mead in Nevada and Powell in Utah\u2014provide hydroelectric power to many people in those same states. <br/>The megadrought has drastically reduced the levels of these two artificial lakes that serve as reservoirs for those seven states. The original agreement assumed that 17.5 million acre-feet of water would be available annually (each acre-foot being about what two households might use in a year). For the last three years, however, the flow has fallen below 10 million acre-feet. This year, the states have been unable to agree[35] on how to parcel out those allocations, so the Biden administration may have to step in and impose a settlement. <br/>Both lakes are at their lowest historic levels since they were first filled. Several times, while working on a midterm election campaign in Reno[36], Nev., last year, I noticed stories in the local press about human remains[37] being uncovered as Lake Mead's shoreline recedes, some of them apparently victims of mob hits in decades past. <br/>Less water in those giant lakes means less water for agriculture and residential consumption. But the falling water levels threaten a further problem: the potential failure[38] of their dams to provide electric power crucial to millions. Last summer, Lake Mead dropped to within 90 feet of the depth at which its dam can no longer generate power. Some estimates suggest that Lake Powell's Glen Canyon dam may stop producing electricity as soon as July. <br/>Earthquakes, Drought, and Disaster <br/>The woman I moved to San Francisco for (whom I've known since I was a young teen in the 1960s) spent her college years at the University of California-Berkeley. I remember her telling me, in the summer of 1969, that she and a number of friends had spent the previous spring semester celebrating the coming end of the world as they knew it. Apparently, some scientists had then predicted that a giant earthquake would cause the San Francisco Bay Area to collapse into the Pacific Ocean. Facing such a possible catastrophe, a lot of young folks decided that they might as well have a good party. There was smoking and drinking and dancing to welcome the approaching apocalypse. (When a Big One did hit 20 years later, the city didn't exactly fall into the ocean, but a big chunk of the San Francisco Bay Bridge did go down[39].) <br/>Over the last months, we Californians have experienced both historic drought and historic rainfall. The world as we knew it really is ending faster than some of us ever expected. Now that we're facing an imminent catastrophe, one already killing people around the globe and even in my state, it's hard to know how to respond. Somehow, I don't feel like partying though. I think it's time to fight. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com\">http://www.tomdispatch.com</url>/ [ 2]: <url

It not only covers the cost of repairing or replacing damaged property in home, but also covers the costs of accommodations for the houses that are vacant or not in usable form.</p><p>Fire insurance is a type of insurance which is used to cover the residence and most of the household belongings against fire and natural calamities like forest fire, thunderstorm, and others. Furthermore, the IRDAI Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has mandated all fire insurance companies to introduce 3 standardized products namely, Bharat Griha Raksha Bharat, Sookshma Udyam, and Suraksha, and Bharat Laghu Udyam Suraksha against SFSP i.e. Standard Fire and Special Perils for homeowners and enterprise from April 1, 2021. This policy will cover home building, home content, plant, machinery, stocks, and other assets, and can apply as per risk perception.</p><p>Increased demand for insurance policies, rise in need for financial safety in case of increase in uncertainties, and surge in number of properties are the major factors that drive the growth of the global fire insurance market. Moreover, lack of awareness regarding fire insurance policy, and high premium cost hamper the growth of the market. Furthermore, implementation of technologies in existing products and service lines and government initiatives regarding fire insurance policies are expected to provide lucrative opportunity for the market expansion during the forecast period.</p><p>The fire insurance market is segmented on the basis of coverage, enterprise size, industry vertical and region. In terms of coverage, it is fragmented into standard coverage and optional coverage. Depending on enterprise size, it is divided into large enterprises and small and medium enterprises. Based on industry vertical, it is classified into manufacturing, healthcare, energy &amp; utilities, retail &amp; consumer goods, IT &amp; telecom, hospitality and others. Region wise, the market is analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA.</p><p>Key Benefits</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The study provides an in-depth analysis of the global fire insurance market along with the current trends and future estimations to elucidate the imminent investment pockets.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Information about key drivers, restraints, and opportunities and their impact analysis on the global fire insurance market size is provided in the report.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Porter's five forces analysis illustrates the potency of the buyers and suppliers operating in the industry.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The quantitative analysis of the market from 2021 to 2028 is provided to determine the market potential.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Market Dynamics</p><p>Drivers</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Rise in need for financial Safety in case of increasing uncertainties</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Innovative products and services offered by major fire insurance players</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Increased demand for insurance policies</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Restraint</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Lack of awareness regarding fire insurance policy</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Opportunity</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Government initiatives regarding fire insurance policy</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Implementation of technologies in existing products and service lines</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Key Market Players</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Amica</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Allianz</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Allstate Insurance Company</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>AXA</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ASSICURAZIONI GENERALI S.P.A.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>GEICO</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Liberty Mutual Insurance</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>USAA</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>For more information about this report visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5341557/fire-insurance-market-by-coverage-enterprise?utm_source=BW&amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;utm_code=6l9cq7&amp;utm_campaign=1548712+-+Worldwide+Fire+Insurance+Industry+to+2028+-+Government+Initiatives+Regarding+Fire+Insurance+Policy+Present+Opportunities&amp;utm_exec=jamu273prd\">https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/yc9bpj</url></p><p>View source version on businesswire.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210610005709/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210610005709/en/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com<br/>Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager<br/><url normalizedValue=\"mailto:press@researchandmarkets.com\">press@researchandmarkets.com</url><br/><br/>For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470<br/>For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630<br/>For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900</p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BWIRE-20210610005709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62WG-8DW1-DXY3-049S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7924</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"612\"/><timeReceived>3:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Business Wire</publicationName><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businesswire.com\">http://www.businesswire.com</url><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 10, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Drought Response Committee, meeting via conference call on June 9, 2021, upgraded the drought status to Incipient Drought for six South Carolina counties: Clarendon, Florence, Georgetown, Horry, Marion and Williamsburg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As designated by the South Carolina Drought Response Act, Incipient is the first level of drought, followed by: Moderate, Severe and Extreme. The general discussion among the Committee focused on how recent rain came just in time to keep more counties out of drought. The Committee requested to meet again in two weeks, recognizing that without persistent, widespread rainfall conditions can quickly deteriorate during the hot summer months.</p><p>Clint Elliott with Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority requested the Committee consider upgrading Horry and Georgetown counties.</p><p>\"Horry and Georgetown have had some severe dry conditions since March,\" Elliott said, \"and while the rains in the last couple of weeks helped, most of it came down quickly and subsequently was seen more as runoff than soaking. What was absorbed helped green up things, but more would be needed to get us back to a more normal state.\" Elliott also discussed the low flows in the Waccamaw River.</p><p>The Waccamaw River in Horry County was significantly impacted by the dry spring, with flows dropping from 1,000 cubic feet per second on April 1 to 18 cubic feet per second on June 1. The Northeast Drought Committee decided there was enough support to upgrade Florence, Horry and Marion counties to the first level of drought, and the Central Drought Committee followed by also upgrading the neighboring counties of Clarendon, Georgetown and Williamsburg.</p><p>According to State Climatologist Hope Mizzell, many locations across the Pee Dee received less than 5 inches of rain over the three-month period from March to May, which for some areas set a record for the driest ever. The drought was rapidly intensifying and spreading, then the pattern changed and much-needed rain arrived. Florence Regional Airport recorded only 4.28 inches from March to May, which is 50 percent of normal and the second-driest on record. Turn the calendar to June, and over the last nine days Florence received 3.07 inches of rain.</p><p>Priyanka More, SCDNR hydrologist, provided an update of the hydrologic conditions showing that improved streamflow levels across much of the state from recent rains along with groundwater levels remaining at or above normal status support the no-drought status for most counties. However, streamflow levels on the Waccamaw River continue to remain well below normal and support an incipient status for Horry, Florence and Marion counties.</p><p>The Committee also considers forest health and forest-fire threat before making its declaration. Darryl Jones, Forest Protection chief for the S.C. Forestry Commission, said South Carolina had an active spring wildfire season due to the dry conditions, with above-normal numbers of fires in both April and May. However, recent rains have helped spur new growth, and that has reduced the fire danger in the short term. While some areas are still dry, the chance of new wildfire ignitions is generally much lower now.</p><p>The West Drought Management Committee came to its decision quickly that conditions at this time did not warrant a drought declaration for the Savannah River Basin. While there was more discussion from the Southern Drought Committee, it also voted to maintain a no-drought status.</p><p>The Committee is cautiously optimistic based on the normal- to above-normal rainfall forecast, but will reconvene on June 23 to re-evaluate conditions statewide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124519351</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62X4-T2G1-JCBF-S03F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 9, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Collectively the scientists analyzed more than 1,000 published papers going back more than 100 years.</p><p>\"Exceptionally hot, dry weather has already fueled dozens of fires across the west in 2021, including the 400,000-acre Bootleg fire in south central Oregon,\" said Krawchuk, a forest ecologist who has been researching approaches for societal adaptation to fire for years. \"A hundred years of federal policy that prevented regular surface fires in these forests has led to forests that are too dense and packed with brush and allow fires to ignite and spread easily. Our team wants to give land managers and others across the region a clear picture of the best available science and how they can use it to make good decisions about managing landscapes.\"</p><p>Krawchuk, Merschel and Johnston collaborated with lead author Keala Hagmann of the University of Washington and others to provide a framework for assessing changes in landscape conditions since suppression became the basis for federal forest fire policy following the Great Fire of 1910. That blaze killed 87 people, destroyed several towns and burned an area roughly the size of Connecticut \u2013 3 million acres of forest in Idaho, Montana, Washington and British Columbia.</p><p>\"We helped summarize knowledge about how fire shaped the landscape for hundreds of years using a variety of sources, including historical records and tree ring research,\" Johnston said. \"We've shown that millions of acres of forest have significantly departed from their historical condition and need restoration.\"</p><p>Vegetation patterns in fire-excluded areas tend toward homogenous, with generally more dead vegetation both on the ground and in the canopy, which means more fuel.</p><p>\"Current conditions are much more vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of seasonal and episodic increases in fire and drought, especially in a climate that's rapidly warming,\" Merschel said. \"But management that realigns or adapts fire-excluded conditions to the increases in fire and drought can help ecosystems and human communities.\"</p><p>Merschel notes that at nearly 414,000 acres, the Bootleg fire covers almost half as much acreage as burned in Oregon during the entire 2020 fire season and describes it as an \"ecological catastrophe.\"</p><p>\"Early reconnaissance indicates an almost total mortality of trees, most significantly the old growth trees that make up the structural backbone of forest ecosystems,\" Merschel said. \"This didn't have to happen and similar disasters don't have to happen again if we as a society decide to invest in ecologically based forest restoration and climate and wildfire adaptation strategies. Those sorts of investments would dampen the intensity of the fires and create more options for communities and forests.\"</p><p>Merschel said that historical records for nearly 1 million acres of fire-dependent ponderosa pine forests show that prior to 1918, a surface fire burning more than 200,000 acres happened about every 15 years. The frequent fires resulted in minimal fuel accumulation and led to forests that were resistant to fire and drought, with trees commonly 300 years old or older.</p><p>\"Ignoring how frequent fire made those outcomes possible will continue to have tragic consequences,\" he said. \"We can't rely on suppression to prevent megafires in fire-dependent forests. We need restoration that includes careful reintroduction of low-intensity surface fires as part of a viable strategy for adapting forests and communities to climate change, and our window for implementing them is closing fast.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-231093626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639D-77H1-F11P-X15R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 4, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp;

We believe that we are going to be opening up a market segment with always-on connectivity, making mobile [communications] global.\"<br/><br/>Indeed, Meijers said that pre-orders for the u8 antenna \u201chave exceeded our expectations.\"<br/><br/>Lilac Muller, Kymeta\u2019s vice president of product, said enthusiasm for the u8 also has been evidenced during the company\u2019s beta trials.<br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019re actually having a different problems with the betas, in that customers don\u2019t want to give the product back at the end of the beta trial,\" Muller said during an interview with IWCE\u2019s Urgent Communications. \u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty good indication that we have something that they need.\"<br/><br/>Meijers said Kymeta officials anticipate two primary groups of u8 customers. Those with personnel trained in satellite communications\u2014for example, many military and government entities\u2014simply will purchase the u8 antenna and handle the satellite and cellular subscriptions themselves. But enterprises that lack the training and communications-provider relationships can subscribe to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://urgentcomm.com/2020/08/25/kymeta-readies-full-service-offering-further-growth-with-62-million-bill-gates-led-funding-round/\">Kymeta Connect service</url> that provides the u8 antenna hardware and Kymeta-negotiated satellite and cellular subscriptions as part of packages that start at $999 per month.<br/><br/>\u201cThe customers who really understand satcom, they largely just want our hardware,\" Meijers said. \u201cFor customers who really have not used satellite connectivity and just want to always be connected, \u2026 we\u2019re offering this end-to-end [Kymeta Connect] service where we bundle this hardware together with broadband satellite and cellular connectivity to give them an end-to-end service offering.<br/><br/>\u201cWe bring them the end-to-end service, and we make it really easy for them to use. We don\u2019t want them to have to worry about which satellite operator they need to go to in order to get service or which cellular operator they need to connect to. We give you a turnkey service.\"<br/><br/>With this approach, Kymeta believes the u8 platform can address the connectivity needs for new enterprises, such as bus fleets. However, critical-communications entities are expected to be the primary early users of the satellite-cellular antenna.<br/><br/>\u201cGovernment and military need the most reliable and seamless connectivity to safely fulfill their missions,\" Kymeta President and COO Walter Berger said in a prepared statement. \u201cThese men and women often go to the most remote or disaster-stricken areas of the world, and they need reliable communications to rescue lives, keep property safe, and complete missions.<br/><br/>\u201cOur government, military, and commercial customers trust Kymeta solutions. The enhanced performance of the u8 is helping our customers make fast, easy, and reliable mission-critical communications on the move a reality.\"<br/><br/>Muller noted work that the company is doing with an ambulance service in the Middle East.<br/><br/>\u201cThey want to be able to not only get access to data when they\u2019re out in rural area where there\u2019s very little connectivity, but they also want to be able enhance the performance of the ambulance service by being in contact with the hospital and doctors as they are making journeys to and from the patient,\" Muller said.<br/><br/>Meijers noted that the u8 is able to support FirstNet connections in the U.S.<br/><br/>Tim Dunfee, deputy forest fire chief for the U.S. Forest Service, said his agency was impressed by the performance of the u8 platform during trials.<br/><br/>\u201cMy team works in some of the most densely populated, rugged, and steep forest terrain in the U.S.,\" Dunfee said in a prepared statement. \u201cThere are places across our varied terrain that have been engulfed by fires and communications cell towers that have been destroyed causing loss of all communications. When we tested Kymeta\u2019s solutions, we could use FaceTime and make voice calls for the first time.<br/><br/>\u201cWe now have a Kymeta antenna installed on one of our vehicles and deploy it to every forest fire, because we know it has reliable communications wherever it goes.\"<br/><br/>In addition to direct connectivity to a vehicle that typically has a Wi-Fi \u201cbubble\" around it, Muller noted that the u8 platform is flexible enough to help support other communications.<br/><br/>\u201cThe other great thing about this product is that we also have an Ethernet connection out,\" Muller said. \u201cSo, you can actually hook that up to a small cell or other land-mobile radio to extend your own communication network and use the satellite-cellular ESA really as backhaul \u2026 to extend connectivity to places you don\u2019t have it.\"<br/><br/>When users switch between satellite and cellular coverage, the transition is done so quickly that the user does not notice, according to Muller.<br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s almost seamless,\" she said. \u201cThey just know that they\u2019re connected.\"<br/><br/>Muller also noted that the design of the u8 enables both reliable performance and smooth upgrades as technologies evolve.<br/><br/>\u201cThe Navy got in a boat doing 60 knots on the water\u2014doing donuts\u2014and they were unable to break the connection with the satellite,\" Muller said. \u201cIt is absolutely incredible how fast and reliable the tracking is, based on our electronic beam-steering technology.<br/><br/>\u201cBecause its electronically beam steered, it\u2019s basically a software-defined antenna, which means that we can upgrade and improve it over time by pushing software updates, much like your phone and other type of platforms out there. That\u2019s truly innovative for the satcom world. Satellites don\u2019t change very frequently, but our antenna can change and improve over time, when more features are added and more capabilities are provided to our customers that purchase this technology.\"<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MOBRT-567445</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MOBRT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FH-YW11-JBKS-P3VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261825</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1070\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Informa Business Media, Inc.

(AP) \u2014 The ancient massive trees of Sequoia National Park\u2019s famed Giant Forest were unscathed Tuesday even though a wildfire has been burning near them on the western side of California\u2019s Sierra Nevada for nearly two weeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAs of right now we don\u2019t have any damage to any of our trees,\u201d said fire information officer Mark Garrett.</p><p>The KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked fires that merged, has spread over more than 39 square miles (101 square kilometers), feeding on other types of trees that also live on the high-elevation slopes of the mountain range.</p><p>Giant Forest is home to about 2,000 sequoias, including the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world\u2019s largest by volume and is a must-see for visitors to the national park.</p><p>The fire recently entered the perimeter of Giant Forest near a cluster of huge trees called the Four Guardsmen but their bases had been wrapped in fire-resistant material and crews had raked and cleared vegetation that could help spread the fire, Garrett said.</p><p>Firefighting crews monitored as what was described as a \u201clow-intensity fire\u201d passed through and made sure it did not affect the sequoias, he said.</p><p>For decades, Giant Forest has been subjected to prescribed fires that are carefully set and controlled to burn away vegetation that could otherwise become fuel for a fire like the KNP Complex and allow it to become established.</p><p>The next-closest sequoia grove is Redwood Canyon, but it is at least 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) away and the fire would have to travel up and down terrain to get there, Garrett said.</p><p>\u201cBut like Giant Forest, that one has also seen prescribed burn treatments for several decades since the late \u201960s so that grove is also well-equipped to transform a high-intensity fire into low-intensity fire,\u201d he said.</p><p>To the south, another forest fire in sequoia country was showing minimal movement.</p><p>The Windy Fire in the Giant Sequoia National Monument area of Sequoia National Forest and on the Tule River Indian Reservation covered more than 42 square miles (108 square kilometers) and was 5% contained.</p><p>\u201cThe fire behavior is not as extreme as it was a couple of days ago,\u201d said Thanh Nguyen, a fire information officer.</p><p>On the Trail of 100 Giants, one tree known as the \u201cnatural bench\u201d sequoia because of the shape of its base was confirmed to have sustained some burning.</p><p>Several sequoia groves have been impacted by the Windy Fire but it\u2019s not clear whether any other sequoia trees have been burned.</p><p>Nguyen said fire can move through a grove by burning other types of trees and vegetation rather than sequoias and assessments will come later.</p><p>The largest trees on the Trail of 100 Giants are on average 220 feet (67 meters) tall, 20 feet (6.1 meters) in diameter and 1,500 years old, Nguyen said.</p><p>\u201cThose trees are beloved,\u201d he said.</p><p>Firefighters have been hand-digging control lines and spraying water to protect the trees and have worked to protect several evacuated communities. The only structure lost so far was the Mule Peak fire lookout structure, which burned in the early stages of the fire even though it was wrapped in fire-resistant material.</p><p>More than 7,500 wildfires have scorched about 3,600 square miles (9,324 square kilometers) in California so far this year.</p><p>Nearly half of that land \u2014 1,505 square miles (3,898 square kilometers) \u2014 was burned by the Dixie Fire across five counties in the northern Sierra and southern Cascades region. It is the second-largest fire on record in California and was 90% contained after destroying 1,329 homes, businesses and other structures since July 13.</p><p>South of Lake Tahoe, the 342-square-mile (886-square-kilometer) Caldor Fire is three-quarters contained after destroying 800 homes and commercial properties. Highway 50, the main route between the San Francisco Bay Area and the south end of the alpine resort lake, reopened to the public on Tuesday for the first time in weeks.</p><p>Historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-17e4bbbf3537110ddf51b3a42ca26ec720210921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63NF-VTD1-DYMD-61N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><timeReceived>7:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 21, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The choking haze isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, all eyes on Florida where a grand jury of the Trump classified documents case heard for another witness just today. \"The Washington Post\" reporting that if Trump is indicted, a majority of the charges will be brought in Florida. So, what does that mean?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Ukraine gaining back ground around Bakhmut as the chief of Russia's private army admits there will be major Russian losses in Ukraine and inside Russia itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's go OUTFRONT.</p><p>And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.</p><p>OUTFRONT tonight, the hazardous air now choking more than 75 million Americans. It's an unbelievable situation. These are live pictures I put up on the screen of New York. Thick smoke from wildfires burning hundreds and hundreds of miles away is now smothering the city, that more than eight million affected just there. And it's way bigger than New York. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Syracuse -- all of them the images that you see there as I said, 75 million Americans are suffering from the hazardous haze.</p><p>It is so bad particularly in New York City that the air quality index there which basically is a measurement of pollution, that they get from a range of zero to 500. Zero to 500, was a 352 this afternoon.</p><p>Okay, that sounds bad. It is bad. It's not only the worst since the EPA began recording air quality measurements, but it is the absolute worst on the entire planet today. I mean, it is amazing.</p><p>And I want to show just how quickly the situation deteriorated in New York. Those of us who were here sort of saw it. I mean, it was like at the sending doom. This was the scene at 11:00 a.m., within three hours. The skyline goes from being covered in haze too bright orange. It felt like being on Mars, and it smelled like being in a sauna.</p><p>New York's governor telling people, quote, don't go out if you don't have to. Officials recommending avoiding outdoor physical activities of any sort. Schools canceled recess, the New York Yankees postponed tonight's game, and the three major airports and they are continue to post delays.</p><p>And right now, there is no immediate end in sight. The forecast has the smoke expected Tuesday for the next several days.</p><p>We have Athena Jones and Bill Weir standing by.</p><p>I want to start with Athena OUTFRONT in New York.</p><p>And, Athena, you have been outside obviously double mask, N95, otherwise probably would be impossible to even swallow at this point reporting on these conditions all day. What are you seeing now?</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, Erin, it's better than it was before but it's still not good. I'm standing on the edge of Manhattan and the eastern edge is looking over the shoulder over the East River into Queens.</p><p>You can see some of the buildings. You can certainly make other 59th Street Bridge, but there a lot more buildings behind us that you can't see. And in fact, you are talking about the air quality index. Mayor Eric Adams just gave us an update just a few minutes ago. He said by 5:00 p.m., or as of -- at 5:00 p.m., the air quality index in New York City have 484.</p><p>BURNETT: Wow.</p><p>JONES: That is hazardous. That is the highest most hazardous level that you can have. At this, moment according the tracker on my, phone two hours later it's now about to 290. But that's still very unhealthy, and it means there's a risk of health effects for everyone. Not just for people who are vulnerable.</p><p>This is why city and state officials are urging everyone to stay inside.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES (voice-over): From New York --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've never experienced anything like this before. Never to this degree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It did shock me how quickly it came in last night.</p><p>JONES: To Cleveland, Ohio, and even as far south as Raleigh, North Carolina -- unhealthy air, blanketing a large swath of the United States. From over 400 active wildfires burning in Canada, more than half of them determined to be out of control. According to the Canadian interagency forest fire center.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: Last year and this year, the worst wildfire season that we've ever had right across the country. JONES: Canada's wildfire season got off to an unusually early and intense start in May, picking up aggressively this month, largely in Quebec. More than 9 million acres have burned in Canada so far this year, 15 times the normal amount. Smoke from those fires shelving within 500 miles to blanket New York City.</p><p>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: From that gloom over Yankee Stadium to the smoky haze scarring our skyline. We can see, it we can smell it and we felt it. And it was alarming and concerning.</p><p>JONES: The air quality index reaching levels that could be harmful for everyone. New Yorkers being urged to stay indoors as much as possible, or wear a high quality mask.</p><p>ADAMS: This is not the day to train for a marathon or to do an outside event with your children.</p><p>[19:05:04]</p><p>Stay inside closed windows and doors. Use air purifiers if you have them.</p><p>JONES: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter or PM2.5, among the tiniest and most dangerous pollutants, it's able to infiltrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream and has been linked to conditions like asthma and heart disease.</p><p>School districts in central New York, not far from the fires in Quebec, among the first to cancel all outdoor activities. Public schools in New York City and Montgomery County, Maryland, doing the same.</p><p>Officials warning the smoke will continue to impact much of the East Coast until at least the weekend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We expect this to be a multiple day event. So, we expect that advisory to remain in place for the next few days.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES (on camera): Now, New York Governor Kathy Hochul says the state will be making available 1 million N95 masks in the public for folks who want to protect themselves. She also said they expect the smoke will move west and so Buffalo, other parts of Western New York will be in the crosshairs soon. They are expecting this to be possibly over the weekend, but that doesn't mean it won't come back.</p><p>And according to CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray, this could be something we deal with off and on throughout the remainder of the summer -- Erin.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Athena. And I guess it's sobering to hear that, but given how Athena is describing it, right? Out of control fires, masks, right? It does not just stop.</p><p>So, let's go to Bill Weir. He's in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. And, Bill, you know, here's the thing, you are longtime New Yorker, so am I. I've never experience anything like this. I've never seen anything like this. And it does frankly feel pretty unsettling.</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: It really is, it really is. We are watching this orange sun going down over Manhattan. And I tell you when I walked out of the door this morning, Erin, it reminded of the times I've gotten off the planes in New Delhi, or Jakarta, or Beijing back in the day, populations, place, cities with four times the people of New York City and none of the air regulations that we enjoy. And I usually take those moments and say a word of thanks for the Clean Air Act, because there was a day when you can taste the air in Los Angeles, but we don't have that anymore.</p><p>But this is just a reminder of how precious a blue sky can be especially in the ages of the climate fight. But yet, today was just surreal, to see the way it changed, you show that time lapse -- midday. The street lights came on in Central Park. Of course, they cancelled the Yankees game tonight. The Phillies game down in Philly, even a WNBA game here in the city because trying to keep people inside today.</p><p>I have to apologize with not wearing my N95. I was talking to the head of pulmonary medicine at NYU Langone. He said, look, wear what you can, as it gets worse, N95 is much better as you mentioned, Athena mentioned the city's giving out a million of those as well.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah.</p><p>WEIR: But you can feel it, you can taste it, and then any sort of exertion, you feel it.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah, and you could -- yeah, and it's got that smell, that the distinct smell literally as if you are in a sauna, which is truly bizarre.</p><p>So, Bill, please stay with me. I want to Joseph Allen into the conversation, professor of Harvard University School of Public Health.</p><p>And, Joseph, let's to show again what Bill referenced, that time lapse of smoke blanketing New York City today.</p><p>You know, I was here, it just started to get dark, you started to notice the smell in the darkness. It was really like an eclipse, okay? Except for smoke. And, you've been talking about studies showing emergency visits to the E.R. go up on days like this.</p><p>How dangerous is it really to be breathing this air in?</p><p>JOSEPH ALLEN, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Well, Erin, so thanks so much for having me on the show again. And this is an extraordinary event. I mean, those of us who study this topic, this -- study particles in the help that expand a field of public health, you know, the health limits about 12 microgram per cubic meter. We get excited if we see 50 or 100. Today in New York City, it hit 700 micrograms per cubic meter. That's like the worst air pollution day in Beijing. That's like you can see the end of the runway bad, as everyone in New York has experienced. Never seen anything like this, I'm from New York, too.</p><p>And when these events happen, certainly people experiencing things like headaches, and eye irritation. We also know we're going to see an uptick in emergency department visits. We see this every time there's a wildfire, smoke event. They'll be admitted for things like respiratory disease, COPD, and asthma attacks.</p><p>And in fact, Erin, I put a number on it. There's a recent study that showed that at the admissions to emergency departments for asthma doubled when the outdoor pollution levels at 50 micrograms per cubic meter. And today hit over 700. So, this is that serious as an air pollution event as it can get.</p><p>BURNETT: It's incredible, and frankly, just as a regular citizen, I don't think we have any citizen of how quickly are about it would be, right? It's not something you can leave from. I mean, so just -- you know, the mayor of New York City, not alone in telling people to stay home. You know, you're hearing that across many of the affected areas, including Philadelphia.</p><p>[19:10:05]</p><p>But you say that's not the answer?</p><p>ALLEN: Well, you know, I think it's good advice but there's -- the dirty secret about your air pollution as I've been calling it as that outer air pollution penetrates indoors. And because we spend the majority --</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah.</p><p>ALLEN: And because we spend the majority of our time indoors, it turns out that the majority of exposure to outdoor air pollution occurs indoors. I think most people find that totally shocking.</p><p>So I think it's good advice to say, avoid time outdoors for the concentrations are high. It has to be paired with the message that indoor exposures are also high and there are steps you should take. If you're in a building with mechanical HVAC system, you have to upgrade to MERV 13 filters.</p><p>This will be familiar to people. We've been talking about MERV 13 filters for COVID.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah.</p><p>ALLEN: Same filters can -- respiratory, particles, they also capture particles from wildfire smoke.</p><p>If you don't have a mechanical system, or you want to supplement, that use portable air cleaners with that HEPA filter. We've been talking about these for COVID for the past three years. So I'd love to see the mayor and everybody else pair that message with don't spend too much time outside, no vigorous activity. That's great, wear a mask if you're outside, but also, think about that indoor exposure where you're actually breathing more of the outdoor air pollution as surprising as that seems.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah. Well -- and also show the indoor, no panacea shutting the door.</p><p>Bill, here's the thing, right? Obviously, we're talking about the wildfire season in Canada. But back to the fact, people lived here with decades, like us have not experienced this. And now, you're hearing these numbers that Joe is sharing, right, and normally you see 12, you're seeing 700. Worst air pollution event in known history with -- is this -- is this climate change playing any role here? What's the macro picture, Bill?</p><p>WEIR: Absolutely, absolutely. The Arctic, the northern top of the planet has been warming up four times faster than the rest of the planet. When I do those reports, I can almost hear the viewers and it's glazing over. Like what do I care about what happens in the Arctic?</p><p>This is directly related to that. There was a heat anomaly in May over Canada, look like a giant red blob of paint where they had temperatures in the high 90s, way sooner than is normal, that dries things out, one lightning strike sets that off like a tinderbox. And that's why there's over 100 fires burning in central Quebec.</p><p>And then the weather patterns connect us. Now, we're breathing the results of a climate in crisis. And you think about the cost of doing nothing. About 10 percent of the economy happens in New York City, and if these folks who work and live here cannot go to work, are locked in their houses or whatever's as result of these sorts of things, that has a knock off effect financially. It's just devastating in ways we can think about, and there's a limited adaptation.</p><p>I mean, if the new world is this, how do you adapt to this, Erin? So, a lot of questions to think about as we're stuck inside waiting for this to blow past.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah. All right. Thank you both very much.</p><p>And next, some breaking news. We are letting prosecutors have officially informed former President Trump that he is a target of a criminal investigation into his handling of classified documents. Those details are next.</p><p>Plus, the head of Putin's private army, tonight predicting that Putin's generals may soon face firing squad, execution squads because of their failures on the battlefield.</p><p>And live pictures tonight from Iowa where CNN's town hall with former Vice President Mike Pence is about to begin. The event coming on the same day Pence launched his campaign for president. And this time, he didn't hold back when it comes to taking on Trump. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:17:19]</p><p>BURNETT: Tonight, breaking news federal prosecutors have notified former President Trump that he is now the target of a criminal investigation in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. This is federal prosecutors are wrapping up their investigation and a potential indictment could come really at anytime at this point.</p><p>We are also learning that the DOJ is planning on bringing a significant portion of any charges in the case at a federal court in south Florida. Now, that's according to \"The Washington Post\". We're going to talk about more about what that means in the moment.</p><p>I want to begin with Paula Reid OUTFRONT with so much of this reporting.</p><p>What are you learning, Paula?</p><p>PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, Erin, we have learned that former President Trump has been informed that he is the target of a federal investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.</p><p>Now, this is a sign that prosecutors could be moving closer to possibly indicting the former president. We are told that this legal team was informed via a target letter that he is now the focus of this investigation. Multiple sources have learned about the letter having it described to them, though none of the sources have directly or personally seen this letter.</p><p>It really crystallizes the fact that special counsel Jack Smith in this investigation is focused on former President Trump and not just the people around him. Usually, if you are the recipient of a target letter, it means that you have the opportunity, if you would like, to go before a grand jury. Now, it's unclear if the former president would do that, though it does seem unlikely.</p><p>His legal team would advise that. It's also something that he was offered up in Manhattan, the recent civil case and opted not to do that. Now, we know his attorneys met with the Justice Department earlier this week, to discuss what they believe are problems with this case. And as we know, former President Trump has repeatedly said that he has done nothing wrong.</p><p>BURNETT: So you also get some breaking details, I know, Paula, about Steve Bannon, and the other investigation about January 6th. What's that?</p><p>REID: That's right, and the special counsel's other investigations into January 6, we learned that former White House adviser and longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon has been subpoenaed to testify, though it's unclear how cooperative a witness he will be. Of course, he was recently convicted for being in contempt of Congress. He's facing a potential prison sentence there. It's unclear if he's going to play ball. It's a little differently as the federal investigation.</p><p>But it's also the opportunity if he so chooses to plead the Fifth. It is, of course, a significant witness for them to call, we have learned in terms of a more cooperative witness, our colleague Zach Cohen and I broke the story today, that those investigators in the January 6 investigation also recently spoke with Alyssa Farah Griffin.</p><p>She is, of course, a top communications adviser in the Trump White House. She's brought on by Mark Meadows. And it's interesting, she just had an interview with investigators. She didn't go before the grand jury.</p><p>But one of the things we learned is that investigators are very interested in Trump's state of mind. They had a lot of questions about that, specifically, Erin, they wanted to know whether Trump really believes in the lies that he was pushing in and around January 6. So, notable, that's what they're asking about right now, but also a sign, Erin, that the January 6 investigation is perhaps not as far along as the classified documents probe.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Paula, and, obviously, that is a big question. When this come if they come together and those details could mean so much.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>And, of course, I should note Alyssa Farah Griffin, as Paula was reporting, speaking to prosecutors, choosing to do so and do so forthrightly as she always does in a role as you see her here, so frequently, is a contributor.</p><p>All right. OUTFRONT now, Stephanie Grisham, former Trump White House press secretary, Jon Sale, former assistant special Watergate prosecutor and former SDNY assistant attorney. He turned down an opportunity to represent Trump. And Ryan Goodman, the former special counsel at the Department of Defense.</p><p>So, thanks very much to all of you.</p><p>Ryan, let me start just at the very basics here. Trump being informed that he is a target of the investigation. Obviously, it's -- I know people are saying, okay, sure we knew that but we didn't know that formally, and he didn't know that formally. How significant is this step procedurally?</p><p>RYAN GOODMAN, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL AT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: Well, it's similar because we all thought that it is the case --</p><p>BURNETT: Yes.</p><p>GOODMAN: -- and in some ways it's the raison d'etre for having special counsel because he's investigating matters of the heart of Donald Trump. It was never stated explicitly, because it could just be that he thinks that it's criminal conduct of classified documents being in Mar-a-Lago, but who is a target?</p><p>BURNETT: Right.</p><p>GOODMAN: The timing of it is suspicious. The fact that he is being told that he is a target at the end of the investigation, there's no way that he wants to hear that or his defense counsel wants to hear that. It does suggest an indictment is coming down the pike for it to be told to him at the stage.</p><p>And it is told to him right before the meeting between his lawyers and the Justice Department. Maybe they wanted to alert him, when your lawyers come here to meet with us --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: You should know. So, we know at least by Monday.</p><p>All right. So, Jon, where do you think we are in terms of an indictment or indictments?</p><p>JON SALE, FORMER ASSISTANT SPECIAL WATERGATE PROSECUTOR: The special counsel is appointed with certain regulations. And he is subject to the policies and procedures of the Department of Justice.</p><p>And there's something called the justice manual. It's a book. Every assistant U.S. attorney has it. And it says, if somebody is a target, you usually inform their counsel. Maybe you send them a target letter.</p><p>And any good lawyers when they receive that we'll ask for an opportunity for a meeting and will present their arguments why the indictment should not be brought. And this case, apparently, they are also have grievances what they claim prosecutorial misconduct.</p><p>BURNETT: Right.</p><p>SALE: And I think we can assume that the department, that the special counsel has rejected those arguments. Now, remember, it still has to go to the attorney general. It's ultimately Merrick Garland can approve a recommendation or disapprove of it.</p><p>But it seems like the grand jury, particularly in Florida, is moving ahead. It doesn't look like that they are closing up shop and saying, no, we're not indicting. It looks like they are.</p><p>BURNETT: All right.</p><p>SALE: And let me tell you what the target means. It means we believe there is sufficient evidence, I want to jury can find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>BURNETT: Beyond a reasonable, and important to mention the standard there.</p><p>All right. So, Stephanie, Trump is posing on social media no one has told me I'm being indicted. Of course, the reporting is otherwise.</p><p>What do you make of how he is handling it? STEPHANIE GRISHAM, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, it's typical, Trump right? He's going to try to get ahead of the story, and deny anything. What I thought was interesting that he listed all of the things he has been accused of which obviously communications 101, you just quit listening the negatives. He continues to do that.</p><p>It really -- it hit me that, you know, I am reading it all and I thought again, no sane person is going to continue to see all of these issues he is having and think, it's a big conspiracy.</p><p>BURNETT: So, Ryan, what do you make of -- Paula is suggesting that by the timing of what you are seeing here, the testimony still occurring in the south Florida, grand jury, that maybe the January 6 of this is lagging, the classified documents. They don't come altogether.</p><p>How -- do you see it that way and how does that play out then?</p><p>GOODMAN: Definitely see it that way. It seems as, though, the -- if by all accounts, all reports, the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation is about to wrap up.</p><p>BURNETT: Uh-huh. Unclear whether, though, and just to be clear, whether that's just obstruction or also espionage, all of that would go in that Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>GOODMAN: Right.</p><p>BURNETT: And that one bucket, we don't know what charges. That's that bucket. Okay, then?</p><p>GOODMAN: Then, the idea that today we find out that the special counsel has subpoenaed Steve Bannon very recently. It's a little shocking, that that would be this late in the game. The January 6th congressional committee identified Steve Bannon as central to their investigation.</p><p>So that seems like that is pretty late, why is that happening now? This team is oh there's a lot more time on the clock for that investigation to reach its conclusion, whatever that conclusion will be.</p><p>BURNETT: Okay. So, Jon, the federal grant jury, as I mentioned in South Florida. Obviously, you live there, you practice law there, and you know this.</p><p>So, \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that a significant amount of charges in the documents case, again, the Mar-a-Lago silo that we're talking about would be brought in Florida.</p><p>[19:25:01]</p><p>What does that say to you? And is that better for Trump or worse for Trump than it coming out of the Washington?</p><p>SALE: Well, this may surprise you, but I think it's better for Trump. The national media talking about that this case, if it's indicted, it's still an \"if\", will be returned in Miami-Dade County, where the demographics may not be so favorable to Trump. Well, it will not be in Miami-Dade County.</p><p>Our chief judge issued an order impaneling a grand jury, routine, not a Trump grand jury, it's another grand jury. And it's sitting in Miami-Dade, but it's a Palm Beach County grand jury. They don't sit in Palm Beach because since COVID, there is no safe room for them to sit in. This will actually be if it's indicted, will be a Palm Beach County case where the demographics are a lot better for Donald Trump.</p><p>I need to say one thing, though, I always try to do this. The Constitution that he said he might suspend will protect him. It should protect him.</p><p>And we should remember, he's presumed innocent now. If he's indicted, he remains presumed innocent. It's a government who has to prove him guilty. And --</p><p>BURNETT: The burden of proof is on that side.</p><p>SALE: Absolutely. And any of these defenses, whether documents are classified, if they're not, prosecutorial misconduct, they can all be aired out if he's indicted. So I think a fair trial is all we can expect and to be protected by a court.</p><p>BURNETT: And we should all -- and we should all, as you point out, hope for, right? That the whole point here is the rule of law and the Constitution and upholding it.</p><p>SALE: And we need to renounce this rhetoric which might be called to violence. Everybody has to say, we don't want. He has the right to free speech, but not to incite violence.</p><p>BURNETT: Stephanie, obviously, you know, we can only imagine how he will respond when this happens. I guess if it's anticipated, it likely happens. I know you spoke to investigators about a year ago in the January 6 case, which is, as Ryan is pointing out, seems to be moving more slowly here than the documents case.</p><p>So, that's my question. Have you spoken to prosecutors about the Mar- a-Lago documents case at all?</p><p>GRISHAM: Yes, I have voluntary cooperated with that investigation.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. So, now, Ryan, just to make this clear, if she -- Stephanie saying she's also testified in that one. Where do you think those -- majority of the charges we're understanding will come from south Florida -- okay, what does that mean for espionage? Does the espionage portion, if it is included, come from Washington?</p><p>GOODMAN: So, they could go either way. They could do what the Justice Department did with Paul Manafort, divide it up into two jurisdictions. So, they could be big charges in D.C., big charges in Florida. Or it sounds like maybe the center of gravity is going to be in Florida. The Espionage Act could be in Florida because what is the Espionage Act? Willfully retaining the documents. Where did he retain? Florida.</p><p>BURNETT: In Florida, right. I understand.</p><p>And, Stephanie, what was your experience with those prosecutors? How do their demeanor, their professionalism, is there anything you can share?</p><p>GRISHAM: Yeah, I can't share much about what was discussed, obviously. I want to -- I agree with your guests that everybody is innocent until proven guilty. So I want to respect the legal process and Donald Trump.</p><p>But I can say they're very professional and they were very even- handed. And, you know, I spoke to them at length for quite awhile.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Well, thank you very much, all of you. I appreciate your time.</p><p>And next, Ukraine gaining ground near Bakhmut tonight. The head of Putin's private military meantime predicting that Putin's generals could soon find themselves in front of a firing squad.</p><p>And Mike Pence taking on Trump directly, talking about his former boss more than a dozen times as he officially launches his 2024 campaign.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:31:48]</p><p>BURNETT: Tonight, a firing squad. Chief of Russia's private army, Yevgeny Prigozhin, saying he's certain there will soon be major Russian losses on the battlefield in Ukraine, and a loss of territory inside of Russia. And Prigozhin predicts that those losses this will be so significant that firing squads will be ordered to execute the generals responsible for Russian failures, and across a popular revolt that will rise over the military's mistakes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER CHIEF (through translator): We will now suffer serious losses. I am absolutely certain of. It, now we are certainly losing some Russian territory, this part being in the Russian Federation.</p><p>There will either be a popular revolt or the state Duma will make a decision for capital punishment and gun them the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) down. And, by the way, I can tell you honestly, I think we're two to three months away from the firing squads.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: This comes as Ukrainians are making gains around the key city of Bakhmut.</p><p>And, Sam Kiley is OUTFRONT.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine's third assault brigade is an action near Bakhmut, and they claim they are making advances around the city. But their attack is dependent on Soviet era weapons. Modern equipment from the USA and NATO is apparently being held in reserve for Ukrainian offensive.</p><p>Do you have a name for your grad?</p><p>UKRAINIAN SOLDIER (translated): This truck's called Pensioner.</p><p>KILEY: Is it good enough for this fight?</p><p>UKRAINIAN SOLDIER (translated): It's good enough. But I'd like something newer.</p><p>KILEY: Ukraine gets no help at all with aircraft. Not so far. This Soviet-era helicopter is ancient, but in combat, almost every day, flying dangerously low to avoid missiles and Russian jet hunter killers.</p><p>UKRAINIAN SOLDIER (translated): These helicopters are probably older than my parents and maybe even like my grandparents' age. To fly them -- they are very reliable machines.</p><p>KILEY: These aircraft will fly more sorties as fighting intensifies. In a relentless cycle of war, Ukraine has now got added range and what it's calling a Russian eco-cide.</p><p>This part of Kherson has suffered Russian bombardment across the river for months. Now, near total destruction from upriver.</p><p>Russia is widely blamed for the collapse of the dam, at Nova Kakhovka, which has been under its control since March last year. Civilians who survived the Russian occupation of their town and an offensive to free it are now facing down a new horror. Thousands have no drinking water. Here, a drone delivers help -- an adaptation of a system originally designed not to save life but to take it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KILEY (on camera): Now, Erin, these recent successes that the Ukrainians are claiming may well be in part as consequence of effectively mutinous behavior by Mr. Prigozhin who just the other day captured the commander of the 72nd mechanized brigade, a Russian brigade, the neighboring unit to Wagner in Bakhmut. Beat him up, forced him into a online confession in which he was told to say that he had been drunk and opened fire on Wagner troops.</p><p>[19:35:28]</p><p>It's just that kind of collapse of law and order within the Russian ranks that the Ukrainians be absolutely delighted by. If you couldn't -- if Prigozhin didn't exist, I think the Ukrainians would've wanted to make him up -- Erin.</p><p>BURNETT: It defies belief.</p><p>All right. Thank you very much, Sam, reporting live from Kyiv tonight.</p><p>And let's go now to the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan.</p><p>Ambassador Sullivan, I'm so glad to have you back.</p><p>So, you know, Sam is talking about what the Russians do. They have control of that dam. In fact, they've had control of that dam for months and now they have not provided a single shred of evidence but they are keeping up a narrative that it is Ukraine's fault.</p><p>This does seem absurd. It seems to defy credulity, does it?</p><p>JOHN SULLIVAN, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: Absolutely, Erin, and you hit the nail in the head. They're in the control of this dam because they invaded Ukraine, in February of 2022, and this war would end and there would be no dam collapse if the Russians have not invaded Ukraine. It's ultimately Russia's fault.</p><p>BURNETT: So you obviously saw Putin. You knew him, up close, as ambassador to Russia. So, better than anyone, you have a sense of how he operates, how he thinks. You've got a counteroffensive now seemingly, you know, in full swing. You have attacks on Russian territory. You've got Prigozhin saying all sorts of things. What is Putin's mindset like right now? As best as you can imagine?</p><p>SULLIVAN: Well, I think from his background in his training going all the way back to his KGB days, it would never show it. The more difficult it gets, the cooler and calmer that he will try to appear. He is under enormous stress now, Erin. There is no doubt about that.</p><p>Secretary Blinken recited in a speech last week in Helsinki how this war has been a strategic catastrophe for Putin and Russia. And day-by- day, whether it's the dam collapse, whether it's Prigozhin, the head is have you accurately described it, Putin's private army, talking about seeing Russian generals being executed. This is calamitous for Russia and for Putin.</p><p>BURNETT: Let's talk more about what Prigozhin said, right? He predicted those firing squads in Russia within 2 to 3 months which will target Russia's top generals. Putin's generals. He also suggested Putin might detonate a nuclear weapon in Russia, in Belgorod. I don't know whether it's a false flag, or what, but he said that. He's claimed to take a Russian commander, a top Russian commander hostage as a POW.</p><p>I mean, this seems to be reaching some sort of a breaking pit, breaking point even for someone whose actions and words have frankly been quite shocking for a long time.</p><p>SULLIVAN: They have been, Erin, and it's -- it's a growing cascade of crazy statements by Prigozhin. I mean, months ago, he was calling the minister of defense and the chairman of the Russian general staff, cowards and traitors. Their children, cowards and traitors.</p><p>It has been a further escalation. Every time he speaks, there's something more outrageous and he says, in part to get attention. And the important thing to note, Erin, is how dependent Putin is on him now.</p><p>You described in the opening of this segment, this is Putin's -- this is his private army. The success they had in Bakhmut, the Russian government itself just a couple of weeks ago attributed that success at least in part to Wagner, who's dependent on those soldiers that Prigozhin leads.</p><p>BURNETT: It's amazing. All right. Thank you very much, Ambassador Sullivan. I appreciate your time as always.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Thanks, Erin.</p><p>BURNETT: And next, former Vice President Mike Pence slamming Trump, saying he is unfit to be president as Pence launches his own 2024 campaign. We have new reporting on what Pence sees as his path through the White House. Prosecutors tonight trying to convince the jury that a school security officer should be held criminally responsible for failing to try and stop a gunman who killed 17 students and staff.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:43:20]</p><p>BURNETT: You're looking at live pictures from Des Moines, Iowa, where CNN's town hall with former Vice President Mike Pence will begin in just a little bit here. The event comes at the same day Pence formally launched his 2024 campaign for president, directly taken on Trump for his actions on January 6.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: President Trump's words were reckless, endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol. I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. And anyone who asked someone else to put them over their Constitution should never be president of the United States again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: OUTFRONT now, Gloria Borger, our senior political analyst.</p><p>And, Gloria, you spoke with the top Pence adviser. He's obviously now the latest Republican to announce this White House campaign.</p><p>So, the big question is, what do they see as Pence's path to actually winning the GOP nomination?</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, his point to me was that no one else in the field is a traditional conservative. Which is the way Pence sees himself today. He talked about Ronald Reagan for example. This is another important thing he said. No one else has the same combination of experience and character.</p><p>And today, what we heard from Pence is a lot of talk about character and about civility and we also heard his wife introduce him and talk about who he is and a funny way, even though he is vice president, they feel the need to re-introduce himself to the American public. She was talking about, you know, you may not know this body spent 12 years in the House, four years as governor, and then another four years as vice president.</p><p>[19:45:05]</p><p>So, look at this man, you see that he is clearly got the experience to become the next president.</p><p>BURNETT: And they're trying to make that argument. Obviously, they want to -- I guess in a sense reintroduce him so and maybe wash some parts of it away.</p><p>And, to that point, Gloria, we know for a long time, Pence was hesitant to criticize Trump. He was very careful. He was very guarded.</p><p>He started inserting it a little bit more. But it wasn't until today that it was a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right? More than a dozen times he brings him up in his announcement. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE: Donald Trump and others in this race are retreating from the cause of the unborn. What President Trump and others are forgetting is that our administration succeeded not because we compromised or abandoned conservative principles, but because we acted on them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: So, Gloria, how big of a shift is this in this message?</p><p>BORGER: Oh, I mean, he crossed the Rubicon today. We have really not heard him take on Donald Trump. And he did it in every way. And he did it even on foreign policy.</p><p>He talked about Ukraine. And it was quite strong when he said, you know, former President Trump described Putin as a genius. And then he went on to say, I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal.</p><p>So, you can see that, at this point, Mike Pence has decided that he is not going to hold back anymore because what he's got to do is differentiate himself. And he also, Erin, spent an awful lot of time going through exactly what happened on January 6th. Every single detail -- and you heard before, you know, his life was in danger, his family's life was in danger, but he went into great detail about how he felt that he could not go against the Constitution, and if he had to make a choice, he would always choose the Constitution over Donald Trump. And I think you are going to hear him talk about that.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Gloria. And, of course, don't miss -- you will hear him tonight, CNN's town hall with Mike Pence, moderated by Dana Bash. That is tonight at 9:00.</p><p>And next, a former school resource officer now on trial for not confronting a mass shooter who killed 17 students and staff in Parkland, Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The defendant will never leave that (INAUDIBLE) while the shooter is in the building.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: And Pope Francis in the hospital tonight after undergoing surgery.

And the defense's opening statement, Peterson's attorney said Peterson didn't know the exact location of the shooter and reacted as best he could.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got 22 witnesses under subpoena who are coming here and tell you that they too heard the same shots my client did, and could not discern precisely where the shots were coming from.</p><p>SUAREZ: And painted a timeline of Peterson's whereabouts that morning.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is not in dispute at all is that when the shooter is on the first floor, killing faculty and children, my client was not even on the scene yet.</p><p>SUAREZ: Peterson is the first law enforcement officer to be prosecuted for failing to act during a school shooting. And his defense attorneys made a point of highlighting his credentials.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, what we have here is a man with a decorated history of serving the community for 32 years, and literally four minutes and 15 seconds, you are claiming he became a criminal.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURNETT: And, Carlos, obviously, a hard story on a lot of levels. What could Peterson face if convicted?</p><p>SUAREZ: Well, Erin, six of those child neglect charges carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison if Peterson is convicted. He could also lose his pension. And, Erin, as you can imagine, this case is drawing plenty of national attention, in large part because of the police inaction in Uvalde, Texas, but also because of the quake police response at the Covenant School shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier this year.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Carlos, thank you very much. And next on \"AC360\", her book was restricted at a Florida school, and now a former young poet laureate, Amanda Gorman, she is now speaking out against the censorship of her work. She joins Anderson starting at 8:00.</p><p>And meantime, next, new concerns about the health of Pope Francis, who is now in the hospital after undergoing a surgery.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURNETT: And finally tonight, Pope Francis hospitalized, but now recovering. He underwent intestinal surgery. The procedure was to treat a hernia that had been getting painful. According to sources it was likely related to his surgery back in 2021 that the pope underwent to remove half of his colon. Doctors say the pope, who is 86, is now awakened back at work. He is expected to remain in the hospital, though, for the next ten days. The pope did not only have half of his colon removed two years ago. He also had part of a lung removed after suffering from pneumonia as a young man.</p><p>And, as we said again tonight, though, they say he is back to work. And we wish his speedy recovery.</p><p>Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>\"AC360\" starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2023060701CNV31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-1GB1-F072-X1SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 7, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pollution</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DOJ</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mar-a-Lago</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ukraine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Defense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>War</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mike Pence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Now please set your DVR so you never ever, ever, ever miss an episode of Hannity, news anytime all the time every time foxnews.com hannity.com. That's all the time we have left. In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Here's Laura with a killer show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hey, Sean. How are you? Hi, guys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HANNITY: Great to see you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: By the way, he's going to tell everybody like when they go to the wide shot of the audience, you can tell them they don't have to hide the shot glasses. OK, I can see them in the audience. They look fine. They look good. No wonder they're in such a good mood.</p><p>HANNITY: That's a secret. I am giving out Jell-O shots and every break. Jell-O shots and footballs.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Well, Sean, it's great to see you tonight. And we'll continue where you left off.</p><p>HANNITY: Have a great, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I am Laura Ingraham. All right. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. Vote Democrat or you're a racist. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now, have you noticed a growing trend in America? White supremacist organizations are popping up all over. North, South, East, West racist groups are gaining traction. Now, I'm talking about white supremacist book clubs, white supremacist bowling leagues, white supremacist garden clubs. Even edgy new fashion trends for white supremacist Spring Breakers.</p><p>There are white supremacist daycare centers where the snacks are obviously white rice, milk, yogurt, potatoes, you get the point. Now, if you believe any of that, turn off the TV, go to bed and call your doctor in the morning. Of course, all this is ridiculous. True white supremacist real racists have been thankfully shunted to the extreme fringes of society.</p><p>But to listen to the Democrats messaging heading into 2024, you think our nation is about to be taken over by men and white hoods. Even if there are no white hoods, and they suppose that racists are black and brown people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Being Hispanic or being black, does not or being anything, does not make you immune from being racist, from being radicalized, from being a white supremacist.</p><p>PAOLA RAMOS: Part of understanding the Latino blog is understanding that we too can be racist. You too can fuel white supremacy.</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: We've seen a number of individuals who are clearly Latino, or at least a Latino heritage who are white supremacists.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, of course, racial bias exists, it always will, sadly, and it does to this day. But what the press surrogates for the Democrats are getting at here it goes much deeper. This is an effort to inflate its prevalence or to excuse or deflect from the destruction brought by Democrat policies. Where? In our cities, our schools, the culture, the economy everywhere. So rather than offer real solutions, the left returns to its dog eared playbook. Racism is systemic.</p><p>It's structural. It's somehow explains why parents and students, even one, two or minorities themselves, are complaining about sexual propaganda in our schools. Now the speakers you're about to hear at the Montgomery CountyMaryland school board meeting are what the left considers the new white supremacist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm here to testify on behalf of my elementary aged cousins. They are encouraged to wear pride clothing and rainbow wigs. That seems odd to me as I don't remember a Jewish day where we were all encouraged to wear a kippah or a Christian day where we all were we were encouraged to wear a cross or a Muslim day where all kids were encouraged - -</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thanks for your testimony.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's done.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: His young Muslim former student. Now the new bullies are the racial and sexual propagandists who defame anyone who disagrees with their twist admission as white supremacist.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Over 40 kids that I know who don't want to learn this and really want to be here talking today but can't because they are being bullied. They are the ones being bullied when they say we don't want to learn this. They are the ones being bullied when they say this is wrong. They are the ones being bullied when they say this is against my religion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Another young Muslim American. Now it's appalling that anyone has to go through this. Which brings us to TL, typical leftist Christian mink. Now this is the type of angry feminist who uses her county position as the ultimate power trip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KRISTIN MINK, MONTGOMERY COUNTY COUNCILMEMBER: This issue has unfortunately put -- it does put some, not all of course but some Muslim families on the same side of an issue as white supremacists and outright bigots.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now if you can stomach it, look in the mirror sweetie because you're the bigot, an anti-religious fanatic who has no business near our schools. Now who's more eloquent Ms. Mink or the students she'd prefer to silence?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The issue of gender and sexuality are influenced by our faith and we should not be caricatured as intolerant. And tolerance of the faith community threatens to erode support for religious freedom, therefore eroding the benefits it provides for everyone.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now remember, to question the left's Cultural Marxism is to be called white supremacist, pure and simple, or of course anti-gay. To question quotas, well, the same thing.</p><p>BEN COLLINS, NBC NEWS REPORTER: Does not mean DEI, it means black and gay people. Frankly, that's what it means. It's a -- it's a fear of the other.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Fear of the other. Well, by now, it's pretty obvious right that the Democrats knew once Biden was elected, America would be in for a lot of suffering and a lot of sacrifice. So what's the political party to do to stay in power at that point? Everything has gone down the tubes, we all know it. It's to smear anyone and everyone who gets in their way. Even if it means alienating some of their traditional supporters. Latinos, Muslims, even blacks. Now we see this in their attacks on Ron DeSantis, as well.</p><p>Last year, he was reelected with major support among Latinos in his state. Remember, he won by 20 points overall. So how to beat him in the presidential contests? Pretty popular guy, right. Well use the white out strategy. Focus on his laws against critical race theory and sexualized curricula. Use your press buddies then to frame it all as rank bigotry. On May 20, this headline blasted across the internet, the NAACP issues a travel advisory for Florida. Now, the obscene idea that the state is hostile to black Americans.</p><p>Yes, this is part of the plan. Then three days later, stick with me, a gay rights travel advisory, OK, just along with one warning immigrants not to head to the Sunshine State as well. Notice they left out the term illegal. Then came the crowning glory from that bunch of frauds over at the Southern Poverty Law Center. It's a leftist front group by the way that exists to smear conservatives. They put the benign group, Moms for Liberty in their extremism list.</p><p>Now, of course, if any group is extremist and should be on that list, it's the SPLC itself. So this is all coordinated. The Human Rights Campaign declared a state of emergency then, nationwide for LGBTQ people don't leave your homes. Then today, obviously, feeling left out of all the fear mongering The Associated Press of all places, runs with this story claiming that gay and black kids now feel less safe in schools. You see this right, don't you? This is all carefully orchestrated.</p><p>It's a disinformation campaign meant to intimidate good people from speaking out. And those same good people from trying to influence things like school boards or their local governments. If kids feel under siege, it's precisely because groups like Gilson and HRC have turned our educational institutions into their own sick playgrounds for left wing community organizing. And along the way, they've shown their own vicious intolerance against parents and students of faith, who just want a good education, not indoctrination.</p><p>But remember, go back to the original. This is all the Democrats have to offer in 2024. They're going to avoid addressing things like the invasion of our southern border, why the schools are so dangerous in the inner cities, why the kids aren't learning, why they fallen behind. And instead, they're going to keep fanning the fake white supremacy flames.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Domestic violent extremism is our greatest threat right now. And regrettably, we have seen a rise in white supremacy.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: And the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is White supremacy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: You know, the most dangerous threat to our homeland is? How about a guy who often can't think, can't walk or can't start a sentence being able to actually start a nuclear war? That's pretty scary. The party of FDR, the party of JFK has become a mockery of itself. Soon it will be up to the voters, they'll want it to see if they want to return to economic growth and prosperity or do they want more of this white out acid that the left is slinging? And that's The Angle.</p><p>Now, I just mentioned this disturbing allegation that Muslim parents and their children, former students who want to opt out of the sexualized curriculum in our schools are now akin to white supremacist. Joining me now is one of those parents, Kareem Monib. He's the president of Coalition of Virtue, an organizer of the rally over this issue.</p><p>Kareem, you and I were talking before the show, and us Catholics and other Christians, other people of faith had been waiting for the Muslims to step up on this issue in so many others and you really are doing it in your community what is your response to some of what we just shared in that Angle.</p><p>KAREEM MONIB, CONCERNED MUSLIM PARENT: Well, first of all, I want to thank all of the brave, heroic parents that came out to the rally. There's a lot of fear of standing up, as you've mentioned, and we want to break through that wall of fear and want people get motivated in power to -- to raise their voices for what everybody recognizes is reasonable.</p><p>And so I want to thank those parents, if you're watching Parents of family rights for religious freedom, as that's the local Montgomery county parent group, thank you so much. You're brave, and everybody's watching and your actions are having an effect.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And the young students who spoke out I was so impressed with them.</p><p>MONIB: Amazing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I mean, they documented and recounted how they've been bullied for actually saying, well, wait, I'm a -- I'm a person of faith. I'm not perfect, but I'm a person of faith. And this offends my sensibility. Yes, they're the ones being targeted in the schools, yet they still spoke out.</p><p>MONIB: That's right. It drew crowds, a lot of bravery. One of the students I recall from their testimony said, isn't that why people came to this country for religious freedom. And, and now that's been taken away from us. And he had mentioned also that what is the meaning of freedom? Freedom is the ability to do what you want uninhibited. And that is clearly not the case.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, Kareem, I want to play more from this Montgomery county council member Kristin Mink from yesterday, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MINK: The scientific and medical community has come to a clear consensus that LGBTQIA plus people exist. When we have children's books that represent, you know, a child who has you know, who is transgender, that is the reality. And so, MCPS has the responsibility to include and reflect that reality in our curriculum.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, Kareem, this is a school district that we fought tooth and nail to open up those schools. One of the many left wing school districts that that really hurt kids during this COVID pandemic, they were never held accountable. In fact, they reelected their county executive. Mr. Elrich so what do you make of her -- This is all consensus. It's already established.</p><p>MONIB: It's absolutely right. You know, that's ridiculous. It's not a consensus. There's no scientific consensus that says a boy can become a girl simply by declaring something with his -- with his voice. And that's it's, it's rejected by science, it is rejected by every faith tradition. And so, you know, these kinds of arguments are silly. I want to say that what coalition of virtue, our vision is to bring together people of all faiths.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All faith which I love.</p><p>MONIB: And we want to restore the moral consensus that we had in this country since its inception. And we want to bring people of all faiths and even those who may not belong to any particular --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Traditionalist, perhaps.</p><p>MONIB: Traditional, reasonable people. I think that if we come together, we can become a political force in this country that can save -- save us from what's happening,</p><p>INGRAHAM: You, Kareem, and all of those kids who spoke out and former students, you all petrify the left. And so now they claim that you're the white supremacist, that's how low they have gone, but you don't seem too worried about it?</p><p>MONIB: It's absolutely ridiculous assertion. I mean, most of the people out there were like, as you said, brown or black. So it's offensive. It's only going to galvanize.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Impower, yes.</p><p>MONIB: Because more people know what's going on now.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Kareem, thank you for coming in. And thank you for doing what you're doing, and I'll help you in any way I can. OK.</p><p>MONIB: Thank you. Coalitionofvirtue.org if you want to join our -- Thank you very much.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Thank you. Great to see you. Now as the FBI and these activist groups seek to silence intimidate us cream said demonize these involve parents and students. They're turning a blind eye to the real threats to children's innocence and wellbeing. Threats that are right under the nose. According to the researchers at Stanford University and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Instagram is allowing users to search by hashtags related to child sex abuse, using graphic terms that we're not even going to state here on this show.</p><p>What's worse, though, is that the platform didn't just allow this. It encouraged it. Think of it this way Mark Zuckerberg the man who spent $400 million tipping the last election of the Democrats made some of that money on the backs of these pedophiles. Joining me now Charlie Hurt, Washington Times Opinion Editor, Fox News Contributor.</p><p>Charlie, you and I've talked about the you know the -- the renaming of pedophilia into something that's more acceptable you know, minor attracted persons, the hashtag on that was on Twitter for the longest -- it might still be for all I know, but this is mainstreaming something which is sick and frankly, felonious.</p><p>CHARLIE HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES OPINION EDITOR: Yes, at some point, you have to stop and wonder if it's not all intentional, because it sure does seem like it's all intentional. And I think that the degree to which you have a lot of people on the left and these social media companies talking about white supremacy, and trying to promote this idea that they're all these white supremacists that are all over the internet and all over taking over our country.</p><p>Meanwhile they're ignoring real criminal acts like in this case with Instagram and this study where you have child pedophilia, you have child pornography being distributed on their platform. And as you point out this, you know, imagine how much maybe Mark Zuckerberg might have been able to clean up his own website from peddling this crap, if instead of spending a half billion dollars to hijack the 2020 election, he had spent trying to clean it up.</p><p>But the other thing I think is interesting here is, you know, the reason Democrats don't care about this, and you went through all of that in your monologue brilliantly, the reason they don't care about it is because they can't weaponize it to their advantage. They want to talk about this stuff, they want to talk about the evils out there, only if they can create a boogeyman that not only silences as you point out, silences, their opponents, but also frightens their followers into thinking that the other side is out to get them.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think, Charlie, you're making such a great point. And it reminds me, this is why they really get their -- their hair up on their backs, when you say you're trying to groom these kids. What else do you call this? What else is this -- You're telling six year old, no, you're not a boy, you're a girl. Good. Let's change your name. Get the skirt on. Everyone, you have to call this boy by the new -- it's ridiculous.</p><p>And it's and it's an attempt to get kids used to being sexual beings, before most of them can do basic math and reading. That's what this is all about. I am going to say it till I'm blue in the face. I don't care who the hell complaints.</p><p>HURT: Yes, and forcing the children to participate in their fantasy charade. And what you know, one of the things that this study found on Instagram, was that before child abuse images would pop up, Instagram would provide a warning, saying that this search result could result with pictures of child abuse, but then gave the user the option to ignore it and go ahead and look at the at the child abuse photographs anyway. So my goodness, what are these people doing? They're not even pretending to care about this stuff.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And they use children as political pawns. That's in the end that's all they are to them. Now Meta, which of course owns Instagram, Facebook, they're claiming that they're taking action to try to stop this problem. They're forming, of course, they all stand by the task force to investigate how the app facilitates the spread and sale of child sexual abuse material.</p><p>Where's the Attorney General here, Charlie? Are they still worrying about you know, they're getting the next Grand Jury against Trump? Where's it -- where is our Attorney General? Who says that white supremacy is the biggest problem facing the country? We've got kids being trafficked.</p><p>HURT: You know, that's a great -- Yep. No, it's -- It's and it's just it's black and white. It's child abuse and it's bullying, and it's disgusting. But if they can't use it to benefit them, then politically, they do not care.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, Charlie, if they can't use it to ballot harvest. It's not a problem for the day, right. We're going to put it off for the next -- next year. Charlie, thank you for this. We appreciate it. Now, why the latest 2024 entrance represent the last gasp of the old guard. Newt Gingrich will explain that. Plus a judge just stood on the side, well stood up for the side of child mutilators. We will tell you who that judge is. What do you need to know. Now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now did you'll notice the last 36 hours while the Republican field for 2024 expanded to include candidates, little to no chance of winning the nomination? So we were wondering tonight what is motivating them? Pray tell. Well, Chris Christie threw his hat in the ring. And it's pretty obvious. He's just trying to be the flame thrower against Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a baby, whatever you want to criticize him. I mean, anyway, that's the way he responds. If we had a child who conducted themselves like that, we'd send them to the room. Yes, not to the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: No dinner. Well, Pence centered today as well. And he thinks that he can surge and well in the categories for both populace and maybe the establishment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE: President Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution. Now voters will be faced with the same choice. I chose the Constitution. And I always will.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And then there's Doug.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG BURGUM: We need a leader who's clearly focused on three things, economy, energy, and national security. And that is why today I'm officially announcing I'm running for the president of the United States of America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining me now is former Speaker of the House Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. He's also the author of March to the Majority. All right, Newt, let's start with Mike Pence. What do you think is driving his entry into the race at this point?</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Well, I mean, look, Pence has been a good congressman, a governor, a vice president. He's young, fit, smart. Has a nationwide base of people who admire his traditional conservatism. And I think he sort of thinks why not.</p><p>I mean, a lot of these guys are focused on the idea that somewhere down the road, whether it's in the Justice Department indictment that we were told today is about to occur, or it's the Atlanta indictment, or it's some other thing, that magically, Trump will disappear. And then there'll be a wide open race. And frankly, in a wide open race, Mike Pence is very attractive, just as governor DeSantis is very attractive.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I don't agree with you. I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. I mean, I love, I love Mike Pence as a person. And I adore him as a person, actually. And I think he's done a lot of great things for the country. But Pence for some reason, still caught in the old establishment GOP wing, more of the kind of Bush wing of the party. I think he played populist with Trump. He's not really a populist.</p><p>I like -- I like him a lot. I mean, DeSantis, yes, because he's a populist. He's more of an America first conservative. But if Trump goes away, Trump's views are still going to be dominant in the party. Newt, that's my point. So all these guys can say everything they want about the rah rah Reagan days of the GOP, but that old coalition is gone. That coalition does not exist anymore.</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, you may be right. On the other hand, maybe you're not. The fact is, I'm not, I'm not sure the average voter, goes out there and says to themselves, gee, am I part of the Reagan coalition? What the average voter wants to know is, are you going to help fix inflation? Are you going to help fix the economy? Are you going to control the border? Are you going to fix our schools? Are you going to knock down the weird left wing woke ism?</p><p>I mean, they have a series of things they want. And any of these candidates potentially, could make a case we're including the governor of North Dakota, who is a self-funding billionaire, and an interesting guy. And again, your -- your environment --</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's a globalist. And he's a globalist. I mean, I think, again, he's interesting. But, Newt, you come on this show week after week, which we love. And we've pointed out on the border, on trade, on China, on all these issues that the establishment GOP got so screwed up for this country, ushering in Obama and all the disasters that he brought from the wars on out, they're still clinging to those. If they could, they'd do another surge in Iraq, I'm telling you.</p><p>So I think that clinging to that old vision of it, not Reagan, but the old vision of, you know, wars of choice, of massive immigration amnesty, that's just not going to play. I think that blows up the Republican coalition as it currently exists, if that's the way we go, and I think we lose if that's the way we go.</p><p>GINGRICH: But Laura, I think if candidates stupid enough to take the positions you just described, has no hope. Now all of them can do polling, all of them can look at the information, all and go out on the stump. Very few people are going to run out and say hi, I'm a globalist.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They are not going to say that.</p><p>GINGRICH: They are not going to say, I really love having an open border. But -- but the -- to me, the interesting thing is, look, I have a two Lake theory of what's going on. There's a very large lake that has all the Trump voters. There's a much smaller lake that has the non-Trump voters, all of these candidates, including DeSantis, who's failed to sort of make the cut. All these candidates are in the non-Trump Lake fighting for about 40 percent of the party.</p><p>Trump, I suspect, is popping champagne corks at Mar-a-Lago every time there's a new candidate, me what he wants, is 15 or 20 candidates out there making a whole range of noise and one person that the country identifies with. And if he gets that. He could be the nominee by March.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, I think that you're right about that. I mean, the bigger the field, the bigger the gift to President Trump and he will be popping champagne corks. And all of those people are better than any Democrat. We know that, Newt. I love your analysis. I'm going to have to debate you sometimes. Otherwise, I just agree with everything you say. And it's just like nodding.</p><p>GINGRICH: I don't mind.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I know, Newt. It's great to see you. I know. It's great to see you. See you at the diner. All right, good to see you. All right, while Florida is trying to protect children, one radical judge there is making it easier for kids to get a sex change. Federal Judge Robert Hinkle, a Clinton appointee temporarily blocked parts of Ron DeSantis' law that bans minors from receiving puberty blockers and other cross sex hormones. Now, the ruling is focused on three cases, two 11 year olds and one eight year old. Let that sink in for a moment.</p><p>Now the judge who has no medical background, of course that we could find, went so far as to write in this ruling that quote, \"gender identity is real\". Joining me now Carrie Severino, President of the Judicial Crisis Network. Carrie, this is the old playbook right they did it on same sex marriage. They went to the court, sidestepped the state legislatures regardless of what certain state legislatures thought. And they won this ultimately in the courtrooms across this country all the way to the Supreme Court. It seems like the same thing is happening here.</p><p>CARRIE SERERINO, JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK PRESIDENT: Yes, and we're about to celebrate the anniversary of the demise of Roe vs. Wade, same thing. Inventing a new constitutional right out of out of whole cloth. And, you know, I thought we were out of the business of unelected judges being a de facto medical board. But here now this guy again no medical training is trying to substitute himself for the Florida Medical Board which has real concerns about the use of these hormones in not -- not even everyone but just miners need we need to look at this.</p><p>Great Britain, Finland, Sweden have all gone back on the saying actually the -- the -- the ProCon evidence is not convincing on this, we need to start pulling back because there are serious consequences. But above and beyond like the intended consequences of sterility, and removing healthy body parts for -- for children using this. So -- so this is a medical judgment the judge has overruled.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, the judge for all of you non lawyers out there to get an emergency order from the court, you have to show irreparable harm. That's one of the things you have to show. This judge found irreparable -- irreparable harm. Let me quote this from The Opinion, the plaintiffs' adolescent children will suffer irreparable harm, the unwanted and irreversible onset and progression of puberty in their natal sex, etc, etc. So what's irreparable harm is being the person that you were born as, that's the irreparable harm that is wild.</p><p>SERERINO: This opinion is -- is really absolutely nuts to read, because I'm reading and going, this one is kind of sounding like a ham handed attempt at an argument in the plaintiff's briefs. It -- I would I would kind of be a little embarrassed to submit that as a plaintiff briefs, but this is the judge writing some of this stuff. Even his gender is real stuff. Like that's a heading in a court case. No one's arguing is gender identity, real or not. That's not the question.</p><p>The question is, are these drugs? Should these be being used? What's really experimental treatment being used on minors. And is the state of Florida free to say, let's -- let's hold off on that until we actually understand this more. And this judge is like, nope, nope, I'm all in for this.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Which is, which is the irreparable harm.</p><p>SERERINO: Right. They are worried about irreparable harm. That's why it's a problem.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Carrie, we featured so many former transgendered persons on this show over the last few years, especially since if I could do anything, I would turn -- I would turn the clock back. I've done permanent damage to my -- to myself in my body, my psyche. I mean, it is a heartbreak. And for this judge, this will be repeated across the country, though, right. I mean, the Republicans have to win more seats on these federal district courts.</p><p>SERERINO: Well, yes, the good news is, there's a lot of great judges in the 11th circuit. We had some really good nominees in that circuit. So the next this next step, I'm certainly optimistic the 11th circuit is going to get this right. But you know, it absolutely is going to be repeated across the country, because there's a lot of states who have this concern. I think 19 states have laws like this. Again, just like places who, you know, real right wing strongholds like Sweden, right, who, again, are questioning this.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Europe.</p><p>SERERINO: So I mean --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Most of Europe.</p><p>SERERINO: So -- so this is something we're we need to get again; the judges need to get out of the medical business. Let that let -- let the doctor's kind of figured this out.</p><p>INGRAHAM: People who are thinking about the election next year have to think about what they're going to be voting for if they vote for the Democrats. This is what they are voting for.</p><p>SERERINO: This kind of judge. Exactly.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Carrie, great to see you as always. All right, Prince Harry Reimagined, plus, could your next flight include someone's derriere in your face? Raymond Arroyo has it all. Unfortunately, it's Seen and Unseen, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's time for our Seen and Unseen segment where we reveal the cultural stories of the week. And for that we turn to Fox News Contributor Raymond Arroyo. All right, Raymond, I know you're excited about this. But Prince Harry, he's appearing in court this week. Wow.</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO: Laura, he -- he already is locked in a legal dispute with a tabloid that he claims tapped his phone between 1996 and 2011. Now, the tabloid denies those claims. Well, this week, Harry became the first royal to appear in court, Laura, since 1891. Only cameras weren't allowed. So a British news network hired an actor to recreate his testimony.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe that again, as a child, every single one of these articles played an important role. Destructive role in my growing up. Unfortunately, stories that you've only -- that I've only shared with one or two people within my inner circle, ends up front page of newspaper or any page. Your circle of friends starts to shrink and diminish rather rapidly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's bad acting.</p><p>ARROYO: Court sketches and voice over, Laura. I mean, though with Prince Harry, I'm surprised they didn't hire Nicholas Hoult or some A lister to play him.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, that wasn't a very convincing acting job there, Raymond. I mean, he had the hair kind of right but he -- he kind of looked like that actor from Modern Family a little bit. He didn't -- I am not buying that.</p><p>ARROYO: But -- but -- but Laura if -- if Prince Harry is so concerned about public exposure, stop writing books about your family and doing Netflix documentaries. I mean, that's one way to stop it. You know, this is like the stripper who complains about public exposure. That's what you do. So I mean --</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's not writing anymore books. Yes, they said no more books about the family. No more books.</p><p>ARROYO: OK. Anyway, speaking of books, there's is a bestselling book by a former child actress, Laura, it's called, I'm glad my mom died. Well, in the New York Magazine interview, talk show host and child actress Drew Barrymore seems to agree with the sentiment of that book. She says of her friends, quote, all their moms are gone. And my mom's not. And I'm like, well, I don't have that luxury. But I cannot wait. Now --</p><p>INGRAHAM: What!</p><p>ARROYO: Now brace yourself. Drew Barrymore took to Instagram this week to try to clear things up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DREW BARRYMORE: To all you tabloids out there, you have been (BEEP) with my life since I was 13 years old. I have never said that I wished my mother was dead. How dare you put those words in my mouth? I have been vulnerable, and tried to figure out a very difficult, painful relationship, while admitting it is difficult to do while a parent is alive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Are you following that, Laura?</p><p>INGRAHAM: I didn't even know that was Drew Barrymore. She didn't -- I didn't even know that was she. But I prefer when she's --</p><p>ARROYO: Yes, that's the at Home Edition.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, well, she has her hands above her head and she was screaming for ET. I prefer that Drew Barrymore, she was adorable.</p><p>ARROYO: The problem with this is I mean, she clearly is saying until a parent is dead when you have this kind of complex relationship, you can't heal. But it sounds like you're -- you're begging for the death of your mother. And I'm sorry, therapy should be confined to the therapist's room, not broadcast for everybody to see and hear. And I realized she's had a lot of trauma. She and her mother, her mother was taking her to clubs at eight years old. She was in rehab at 13.</p><p>So I get it, but this is not the way to deal with these issues. And certainly it's not a broadly held experience. Anyway, finally, Laura, I have another Ray's Rule for travel. Be aware of novel redesigns of Aircraft Interiors. I give you the in-flight Double Decker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You put your legs up and reclaim, stretching your legs fully forward. Taking advantage of the double decker and allowing for the passenger on top of recline and not advantageous, dangerous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Now, Laura, I want to point out, a stranger's butt is in your face. Now imagine that it's that lady we talked about a few weeks ago who was asking the airlines to accommodate her. You remember her? She said the aisles were too small. If you hit turbulence, this flight could be all over. I mean, you could take out several rows behind you. I also hate the idea of having that wall in front of you in this design. It's like flying in the toilet with a low roof. I don't want this</p><p>INGRAHAM: But, Raymond, speaking of the air -- speaking of the airline toilets, have you noticed that they're now so small, the sink is kind of a little tiny triangle. Like you can't -- I can't even get one digit into the sink to wash it up. They're so tiny. I don't know how people even fit; I can barely fit in there.</p><p>ARROYO: Well, they're getting so small, pretty soon the commode will be the only place to do your business and wash your hands, there'll be nowhere else. I don't know what they're trying to do. They're very uncomfortable.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, it'll be an interesting summer, Raymond. Invariably we will have to travel for this show. And we will have more travel nightmares and horror stories to share with the audience at large. Raymond, great to see you.</p><p>ARROYO: No double deckers for us.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Not for us. Good to see you. No double deckers. Now, how the climate crazies are trying to use a Canadian forest fire as yet another excuse to take your freedom, take your power and take your money. The video next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Breaking news. The air quality is bad. Places like Washington, Philly Wilmington. Watch out, Joe. And it's really bad in New York. It is bad, look at it. But is this really a novel occurrence for our country or is it only getting coverage the type it's getting because it's happening along the east coast where all the elites live?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATY TUR, MSNBC HOST: Don't breathe the air, the air is bad.</p><p>DEREK VAN DAM, CNN HOST: Looks like to me a dystopian climate change movie.</p><p>GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): I'm calling it an environmental health crisis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's not forget the climate crisis and climate change which is bringing all this to us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything is amped up a little bit everything's on steroids because of what we've done to our planet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Looks like the marijuana corner is in New York. Obviously that hazy. Well beyond that the apocalyptic coverage in the New York Times today was just absolutely nice laughingly hilarious, needs its own underscore music, but this will have to do. \"As smoke darkens the sky, the future becomes clear. A month ago I wrote about one of the scariest revelations of the new wildfires science: There's nowhere to escape the smoke.\"</p><p>CNN's Bill Weir, no stranger to hyperbole himself, used the event to call for action to electrify every car in the United States for humanity's sake.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Just by eliminating the kind of pollution that comes out of tailpipes and dirty fuel power plants would save over 80,000 lives almost 90,000 lives. It would prevent 2.2 million asthma attacks. Or by 2050 it would save almost 11 million lost workdays. This also affects folks' communities of color disproportionately around the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, there it is going back to the beginning of the show, right? The inevitable intersection of climate and race. If you don't agree with Bill, at some point they are going to call you a white supremacist. Joining me now Steve Milloy, Senior Legal Fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute and Trump Era Transition team member. Steve, no one's denying it is unpleasant. My eyes are pretty itchy and watery, yesterday and a little bit today and it might go on for a couple more days. But is this wholly out of the ordinary?</p><p>STEVE MILLOY, ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT LEGAL INST: No, this happens anytime there's a wildfire in the west and it's unusual in the east, but the air is ugly, it's unpleasant to breathe. And for a lot of people, they get anxiety over it. But the reality is there's no health risk. OK, there's EPA research.</p><p>They've done lots of clinical research on asthmatics, on elderly, asthmatics, on children, on elderly with heart disease, not a cough or wheeze from any of them. We have this kind of air in India and China all the time. No public health emergency.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Speaking of -- do you notice like an all the coverage of you know, Bill Weir, the tailpipes all this? They never ever mentioned the fact at the top that China is the number one polluter in the world. Never.</p><p>MILLOY: Yes, this is like clean air in China. I mean, it's really bad. You know, they in the winter, they never turn on their scrubbers for the air pollution because they don't care. Weir has no idea what he's talking about. This doesn't kill anybody. This doesn't make anybody cough. This is not a health event. This has got nothing to do with climate. First off, these are this is wildfire smoke, this is natural. This is not because of climate change.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Amazing!</p><p>MILLOY -- Fossil fuel, you know, internal combustion engines. He just has no idea what he's talking about.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All day by the way, it seemed like the media figures that we've become accustomed to seeing on television during this crisis, they seemed like they were back in their element in kind of almost enjoying the moment of wearing masks -- masks again. Didn't they? They seemed to have a little pep in their step for those masks? Now, they talked about the dangers of something called particulate matter from the smoke. Here's CNN earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Consider wearing a mask and that is because of the particulate matter in the air. This is among the tiniest, most dangerous kind of pollutants and it's the kind of thing found in this wildfire smoke. These are -- these particular -- these particles are so small they can get into the lungs when you breathe them in, get into the bloodstream and cause all kinds of health issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Steve, we're back at the masks. Romaine Ossuary is watching from heaven by the way. Romaine, I know you are. Go ahead.</p><p>MILLOY: Yes, this is crazy. This is all particulate matter but particularly better was not a concern until EPA invented it as one in the 1990's and they've been writing and the Obama administration, now the Biden administration --</p><p>INGRAHAM: What is it? Is it a health concern?</p><p>MILLOY: Part -- no particulate matter, it is very fine soot --</p><p>INGRAHAM: We don't want to be breathing that --</p><p>MILLOY: Well, it's just carbon particles, very innocuous. OK but they're innocuous. There's nothing in them. They have no effect. EPA has all this testing on real life human beings, it shows no effect. This was total junk science to claim this is hurting anybody, it's ugly. You don't want to breathe, it causes --</p><p>INGRAHAM: But didn't they seem a little giddy to be back in the mask?</p><p>MILLOY: They love it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They love the mask.</p><p>MILLOY: They love it. Well, they love all panic, right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, panic porn --</p><p>MILLOY: They love -- some say --</p><p>INGRAHAM: By the way, another moment of panic porn always comes when you see those very dramatic and sad pictures. Not of the polar bears, but of the ice coming off Antarctica, like crashing into the ocean. Is that real?</p><p>MILLOY: No. No. So this week, there was a study. You know, if you use the climate models, they say by now we should have lost 20 trillion tons of ice in Antarctica between 2009 and 2018. But we've actually gained ice. And this is like, you know, they're always wrong. All climate upon --</p><p>INGRAHAM: That came out. Did it not?</p><p>MILLOY: Yes. They've never been right. They're never going to be right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, Steve, from ice to particulate matter only on Ingraham Angle. Steve, thank you. Now why you shouldn't leave dog food in your car. Last bite explained.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, what happens when you have a hungry bear, a pickup truck and some dog food?

In September 2021, in conjunction with then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz, Central Command head Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs ordered a five-month moratorium on IDF operations in Jenin, in the interest of 'strengthening the Palestinian Authority.'</p><p>This week's operation then was geared towards repairing the damage caused by the policies of the previous government and Central Command. As IDF Spokesman R. Adm. Daniel Hagari explained Monday morning in a spate of television and radio interviews, the purpose of the operation wa not to seize control over Jenin or parts of the city. It was not directed against the P.A. It was meant simply to regain the tactical advantage and degrade the capabilities of the terror groups operating in the refugee camp.</p><p>As a limited, tactical engagement, the operation had limited, but important, potential. Over the past several weeks, the Palestinians shot four rudimentary rockets at Israeli communities from Jenin. Although military experts insist these were mere pop guns, the missile industry in Gaza began the same way in 2000. Today, missiles from Gaza have ranges that cover most of the country. The operation in Jenin had the potential to destroy all the rocket workshops and kill or arrest all of the terrorist operatives engaged in the development of the rocket program.</p><p>The operation in Jenin also was capable of disrupting and degrading the Palestinian terror capacity by killing and capturing the terror commanders and foot soldiers who together have been carrying out shooting, stoning, roadside bomb and pipe bomb attacks against Israelis throughout the region. These attacks have made life a crap shoot for tens of thousands of Israeli citizens who live and work in the communities in northern Samaria and the Binyamin region.</p><p>In the hours before the operation in Jenin began, Palestinian terrorists carried out four shooting attacks against Israeli vehicles, communities and IDF personnel in the area around the city. To get a sense of the magnitude of the problem, every day Palestinians from Jenin and the wider area carry out hundreds of stoning attacks against Israeli vehicles on the roads. And according to the Shin Bet, in May alone, Palestinians attacked Israeli vehicles with Molotov cocktails 139 times. They carried out 51 pipe bomb attacks and 11 shooting attacks.</p><p>While some of the terror infrastructure behind these attacks is located in Nablus, and in villages like Huwara and Umm Tzafa, because of the free rein terror groups have enjoyed in Jenin, the bulk of the operational infrastructure is located in Jenin.</p><p>The fact that this week's operation was a tactical engagement doesn't mean that the problem isn't strategic. It is. But unfortunately, the IDF doesn't share the Netanyahu government's understanding of the strategic realities on the ground. And as a result, a wider operation is unlikely</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12269203/US-releases-video-Russian-fighter-jets-harrassing-American-drones-Syria.html\">Russian Warplanes Buzz American Reaper Drones and Drop Flares in Front of Them for the Second Time in 24 Hours Over Syria as US Military Condemns 'Reckless Behavior'</url></p><p>The dangerous maneuvers forced the MQ-9 Reapers to take evasive action, the Air Force said.

But with the Biden administration now reportedly moving forward with sending cluster munitions to Ukraine, Stoltenberg has said that 'Nato does not have a position on them' as some allies have signed up to prohibit their use and some haven't.</p><p>He was specifically asked by a reporter about the wisdom of allowing them to be sent to the Ukrainians. He had further added in response, 'This will be for governments to decide, not for Nato to decide.'</p><p>'We are facing a brutal war, and we have to remember this brutality is reflected, that every day we see casualties, and that cluster munitions are used by both sides,' he sought to justify and explain.

Let me begin by reiterating Pakistan's rejection and strongest condemnation of the highly derogatory remarks by two senior officials of India's ruling BJP party, that were disrespectful towards Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) and have hurt the sentiments of Muslims all over the world. The Indian Charge d' Affaires was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 6 June and conveyed the Government of Pakistan's categorical rejection and strong condemnation of the totally unacceptable remarks. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also condemned the dangerous and hurtful comments emanating from these irresponsible leaders of India's ruling party. Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood individually met the Envoys of P-5 countries; and also held a meeting with the OIC Ambassadors in Islamabad to apprise them of the matter and register Pakistan's strong concern at the sharp increase in Islamophobia and targeting of Muslims in India. </p><p>Pakistan has underscored that BJP's perfunctory and token disciplinary action against those individuals was not sufficient to assuage the pain and anguish they have caused to Muslims worldwide. Nor would any attempt to whitewash rising 'Hindutva' nationalism in mainstream society by calling the BJP Spokesperson a 'fringe element' be of any avail. If India has any moral courage, or democratic ethos, the BJP top leadership and the Indian government must clearly condemn the actions of the responsible BJP officials, and hold them to account through decisive and demonstrable action. That may be a big ask in today's \"saffronized\" India, but this is the least that is being expected of them. ? This is important because it is not about an isolated incident. There are continuing serious concerns about the alarming rise in Islamophobia, and communal violence and hatred directed against Muslims and other minorities in India, who are being systematically stigmatized, marginalized and subjected to a well-orchestrated onslaught from radical Hindu mobs with full connivance and support of the security apparatus across various states in India. Regrettably, the Indian state machinery has remained aloof to the desperate calls for assistance by the local Muslim and minority communities across the country including Sikhs, Christians and Dalits.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>In clear contrast, while India persisted with its reprehensible campaign of \"saffronization\" resulting in victimization and persecution of Muslims and other minorities, Pakistan, in line with its policy of promoting interfaith harmony and religious tolerance, has issued 163 visas to Sikh pilgrims from India on the eve of Martyrdom Day of Guru Arjun Dev Ji, to participate in the annual festival being held in Pakistan from 8-17 June. During the visit, the pilgrims would, inter alia, go to Panja Sahib, Nankana Sahib and Kartarpur Sahib. We welcome the yatrees and wish them a spiritually fulfilling and enjoyable stay in Pakistan.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Coming over to the first visit to Pakistan earlier during the week by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on the invitation of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. During the delegation-level talks, the two sides had an extensive exchange of views on various aspects of bilateral relations with a special focus on enhancing cooperation in the fields of trade and investment, climate change, and renewable energy. In the regional context, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari stressed the need for the international community to come together to address the dire humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. On Ukraine, the Foreign Minister reiterated Pakistan's principled position for immediate cessation of hostilities and for a solution to the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. The Foreign Minister also drew attention to the serious human rights violations in IIOJK, the rising tide of Islamophobia across India and risks posed by these developments to regional peace and stability. Unfortunately, Foreign Minister Baerbock had to cut her trip short after testing positive for COVID-19. We wish her good health and look forward to continuing strong collaboration and future high-level interactions between the two countries. On 8th June, Ambassador of Iran, Seyed Ali Mohammad Hossenei called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The Prime Minister thanked Iran for its timely assistance in controlling forest fire in Balochistan. Ambassador of Iran reiterated felicitations from the Iranian leadership to the Prime Minister on assumption of office and reaffirmed commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation in all areas of mutual interest. Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>On the Public Diplomacy front</p><p>Yesterday, Pakistan and Azerbaijan celebrated 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, with a joint photo exhibition at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs showcasing our strong bilateral relations rooted in shared faith and value system also manifest in frequent high-level exchanges. On 5th June, Pakistan joined the international community in celebrating the \"World Environment Day 2022\" on the theme \"Only One Earth\", and on 8th June we commemorated the \"World Oceans Day\" appreciating national efforts to counter marine pollution and promote sustainable use of ocean resources.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Coming over to the Situation in IIOJK</p><p>In the continuing senseless spate of extra judicial killings by Indian occupation forces, 5 more innocent Kashmiri youth including a student of animal husbandry have been martyred in Baramulla, Kupwara and Shopian areas in the past week. In the same period, dozens of Kashmiri youth have been arrested and summoned in army camps and police stations in fake cordon and search operations. Defying all international norms that guaranteed civil, political and human rights, and the remedies available to people in case of violations, India is continuing to expose its naked agenda that seeks to marginalize its minorities by physically exterminating them, psychologically undermining their spirit and obliterating their identity all while attempting to obfuscate the ugly communal fa ade that lurks under the umbrella of its so called 'secular and democratic' credentials. Ladies and Gentlemen, India can fool no one but itself. Its actions stand totally exposed. Therefore, it would be well advised to halt forthwith the gross and systematic persecution of Kashmiris in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, cease the use of state-terrorism as a policy tool, and let the people of IIOJK determine their own future through a free and impartial plebiscite under the United Nations auspices as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Pakistan also reminds the international community of its obligations and reiterates its call to hold India accountable for its gross and systematic violations of human rights in IIOJK. Let me also update you on Ukraine - Pakistan Embassy has shifted back to Kyiv on 31 May 2022 and remains available for all services to Pakistani nationals in Ukraine and to conduct diplomatic functions to advance our bilateral relations with Ukraine. You would recall that due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Embassy had moved to Ternopil from where it facilitated evacuation of over 1500 Pakistani nationals, including students.? Before I conclude let me also update you on Ukraine - Pakistan Embassy has shifted back to Kyiv on 31 May 2022 and remains available for all services to Pakistani nationals in Ukraine and to conduct diplomatic functions to advance our bilateral relations with Ukraine. You would recall that due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Embassy had moved to Ternopil from where it facilitated evacuation of over 1500 Pakistani nationals, including students.</p><p>I thank you and am ready to take your questions.</p><p>PREVIOUS NEXT</p><p>ABOUT US</p><p>Press Information Department is the principal department of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, headed by Principal Information officer (PIO).

Though many strains of the novel corona virus remain among the population, we have adapted and evolved biologically. The war is not won but mankind fought together to win battles against Covid. The year has also borne witness to some dramatic climatic events across the world. Many places across the world have recorded some of the highest temperatures and most erratic precipitation patterns ever recorded in history of those places. This long-term shift in temperature and weather pattern is known as climate change.</p><p>Let me start with my journey of understanding climate change. Working as a system engineer after my bachelor's degree, climate change came in as part of my general awareness. If I remember correctly the brief understanding included that the earth was getting warmer (process known as global warming), and humans had to keep the temperature below 20 degree C rise in global average temperature to the pre-industrial era. The change in the local temperature may vary from place to place, hence the need for a global average. The change was attributed to the excess emission of green houses gases (GHG) like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Among them carbon dioxide is most prominent contributor of GHG. Many of us could relate to the classic image of the polar bear on a small ice cap which signified the melting polar ice and rise in sea level. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air and planting trees seemed to be a natural solution to combat climate change.</p><p>My understanding of climate change started to improve when a few years later I joined the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM) for my postgraduate diploma in forestry management (PGDFM). At IIFM I started developing a comprehensive view of climate change. As management students we also learnt how the climate action is implemented at the national and international level. Countries have come together to form conference of parties (COP) under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). The COP is the supreme body of the member-states to the convention formed with the objective of responding to the threat of climate change. The third such COP was held in Kyoto in 1997 where the countries agreed to set emission limits. The body cannot directly impose any limits to the level of emission by the member-countries but the convention negotiates between member-states for the global betterment. The developed countries have taken the onus for the greater share in the contribution to climate change and have over time agreed for technology transfer and the investments in developing countries. The Kyoto protocol also gave rise to market-linked mechanisms to offset the carbon emissions. It was understood that if the monetary side of the climate action is not used it would not be implementable. In India the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change was given the charge of forming and implementing climate change mitigation action plan.</p><p>Many of us would think that the rising temperature is the only consequence of the climate change we would feel in our day-to-day life. There are sequences of events that arise from the rise in the temperature of the earth. With climate change two basic elements that govern the weather condition, namely the water cycle and air current get affected. This gives rise to very erratic weather conditions. The unpredictability also makes it challenging for environmental experts and mathematicians to predict such events.</p><p>Whatever your profession, social or economic strata you are from, it is highly likely climate change is going to impact you. With the temperature rise, the summers are warmer and longer in duration. In trying to keep us cool the use of air conditioners, the use of refrigerators for storage has increased significantly which raises our electricity bills. The erratic rainfall patterns impact agricultural output. Cultivation of most staple crops requires an ample amount of water during the initial stages and no heavy showers towards the later stages. Rain or storm in the final stages of the crop, before harvesting, damage the crop. With change in climatic patterns there are drought-like situations in initial stages and rainfall towards harvesting times. Such events will give rise to global hunger. With the rise in crop failure, there is a tendency of the small and marginal farmers to shift to other practices. These farmers would end up migrating to the urban areas as daily wage labours. The migration causes more and more urban slums. Most of the urban areas have population density more than the natural capacity of the place and inadequate drainage systems. The drainage systems are clogged by unnatural rainfalls. This is the habitat for disease vectors like mosquitoes and flies, increasing serious health hazards in urban areas. The increasing temperature dries up land and forests increasing the number of forest and urban fires. Apart from the economic loss forest fire impacts the biodiversity and increases human animal conflict.</p><p>Now that we know the challenges created by climate change, how do we avert it? To answer that we must know what kind of activities are contributing to the release of GHG. Another question sometimes asked is, if climate change happens naturally as well? Climate change happens due to natural processes like sun aging, but the processes are extremely slow compared to the life cycle of mankind. It is inevitable to prevent the release of greenhouse gas and undergo development as most activities like agriculture, raising cattle, driving to the office, using any electric appliance, and construction contribute to the release of greenhouse gases. Human activities annually release 51 billion tons of GHG into the atmosphere. What according to you would be the top contributor of GHG? The idea behind raising the question is whether we ever care how much GHG our activities have released into the atmosphere. Manufacturing activities contribute about 31% to the GHG emission while the production of electricity contributes about 27% to GHG. The production of steel and cement alone contributes about 10% GHG emission and is considered the highest contributor. Manufacturing cement releases an equal amount of carbon dioxide while manufacturing steel releases about double the amount of carbon dioxide. Both steel and cement have carbon dioxide as a by-product of the manufacturing process. Another major contributor to GHG is the burning of fossil fuels, primarily coal and petroleum. Coal is the primary source of electricity generation in many developed countries.</p><p>Tremendous efforts have been made to mitigate the impact of climate change. Climate change can be mitigated by reducing the amount of GHG released into the atmosphere and trapping the existent atmospheric GHG. As we discussed before the most common GHG is carbon dioxide, and the most obvious choice to mitigate climate change seems to be planting more trees which intake carbon dioxide naturally. The market mechanisms we have discussed before are also targeted at increasing the forest tree cover. When COP member countries implement emission rules they have a provision to offset the release by equal amount of plantation. There is, however, a caveat to using this natural carbon dioxide absorber to address climate change. A tree typically absorbs about 25 kg of carbon dioxide every year.</p><p>Say if we have a hectare of monoculture plantation it will absorb about 0.25 million kg of carbon annually. With this assumption, if we plant the entire country of India (328.7 million hectares) it will absorb about 0.1 percent of the total annual emission. If we are considering extensive plantation it impacts the weather conditions. It is hard to predict the exact shift in weather conditions when such large area is planted however, the tree cover is expected to make the area cool which will probably increase the rainfall in the area making the adjoining areas dry. While planting more trees has benefits like improving biodiversity and reducing GHG, it cannot have a significant impact on the 51 billion tonnes of GHG we are releasing. As discussed before, two of the top three GHG emitters are vital for construction and the third is fulfilling our energy demand. There is a lot of focus on renewable and clean sources of energy to mitigate climate change. The global energy demand is approximately 5,000 GW. The energy demand for India is much lower than the global average. There is significant work in progress on how the current demand can be met with renewable sources of energy especially solar. The readers should try and find how much energy is generated through solar energy. Renewable sources absorb power from natural sources which require large geographical areas and suitable locations. If we attempt to compare how much area we need to generate energy from fossil fuel as compared to the area needed to generate the same from renewable sources, it would be in the ratio of 1:100. The most challenging part with renewable energy generation is the cost of setting up storage and transmission infrastructure from such preferred locations. Almost every product ranging from a hair dryer to a car needs energy. Renewable sources of energy are dependent on the natural source which sometimes has erratic supply due to the change in intensity of the natural event used to generate power. This calls for an improvement in storage technology. The other proponent to meet the energy needs is nuclear energy. Bill Gates is an active believer in this theory. The design of nuclear reactors and decomposing the nuclear fuel is the greatest challenge when dealing with nuclear power. Nuclear fusion is considered the best option for generating energy. Nuclear fusion leaves no harmful effects but the process requires a huge amount of energy to start making it a challenge for commercial implementation as of date.</p><p>Overcoming the energy crisis of replacing energy from fossil fuel has garnered significant attention. The efforts are backed by investors helping capitalize on many ideas. However replacing or improvement in manufacturing process of the two major contributors of GHG has not drawn similar attention. GHG emissions from the production of steel and cement are increasing with the rapid increase in construction activities and increase of urban reach. Natural sources like wood and bamboo have been traditionally used for construction works. Use of such natural sources help revert the process of release of GHG. As the tree or bamboo grows they absorb the green house gas and keep it trapped. When they are used for the construction of houses they keep the internal temperature warm in winter and colder than outside in the summer. However, realizing this dream in long run has two caveats. First we need to reduce the life span of trees and bamboo species to meet the demand and secondly we need to improve the qualities of the material so used. Development in genetic science is at the core of the first problem. We at Bah Bet are working on addressing the second problem. Heat and steam can be used to alter the chemical components of wood creating products with desired features. These products could augment the need for efficient construction material. There is already work is progress. There is a significant focus on bamboo as alternate construction material wherever possible. International network on bamboo and rattan (INBAR) is extensively working in this area. North-East India has one of the most varied bamboo vegetations. There is, however, a high focus that is needed in terms of structural integrity in the construction and designs that would be competent at the international level. The removal of bamboo as a forest product and its inclusion as an agricultural product made a lot of changes in the plantation scope of bamboo, easing out harvesting and transport regulations. North-East India is also home to a large number of plant species apart from bamboo. We have to look at fast-growing plant species. The research in the field of genetic improvement has to be accelerated and needs to be backed by adequate funding. After the usable life cycle if the plant degenerates naturally and the carbon doesn't make it to the atmosphere, closing the scope for GHG emissions.</p><p>In the post-Covid times, the East-West divide seems to be on the rise, especially with the Russia-Ukraine war. The world has shifted to a new model of business model called 'friendshoring'. In simple terms, it is doing business with allies. This model would pose a challenge to the technology transfer avenues that came up from the Kyoto protocol. The fight against climate change needs a concerted effort with people from all spheres contributing to it. We can contribute in our way to the fight against climate change. Small decisions we take can make big changes. For example we can use public transport whenever feasible. When we run the AC at 250 degree C and keep the fans on it saves electricity by optimizing the usage. The saving is also reflected in the electricity bill. The use of Bureau of energy efficiency (BEE) four-star or five-star rated products saves electricity and your pockets. There is only one planet we know that sustains life, and we have got to save it at all costs. This is a war we have to fight together. We defeated Covid together and we can win the war against climate change.</p><p>Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa</p><p>(Founder of Bah Bet, advocate of sustainable development)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0059650876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66T2-WNH1-JB5M-W39J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2261\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Omega Printers &amp;

At the same time a number of low-cost air quality monitors have come on the market, allowing consumers to check the pollutant levels in their own homes and neighborhoods. So, air quality scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) wanted to know: are these low-cost monitors any good?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer is: yes - to a degree.</p><p>Published recently in the journal Sensors, their study tested four models of low-cost air quality monitors during actual wildfire pollution events and found that their readings of PM2.5 - or particulate matter under 2.5 microns, which has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular issues - were consistently higher than the reference monitor used by the regulatory agencies; however, since each monitor had a relatively consistent response to the smoke, it is possible to use the readings to estimate true PM2.5 levels. Overall, the researchers concluded that the monitors can provide actionable information.</p><p>\"We compared the low-cost monitors to one that is used by regulatory agencies in air monitoring stations. It turns out their correlations are phenomenally good. When one goes up, the other goes up at the same time, and it is proportional. That gives us a lot of hope for being able to use them for real information,\" said Woody Delp, one of the lead authors of the study. \"And it could let someone know how well their new portable air filter is reducing smoke particles. But from an absolute point of view, it's becoming clear these sensors require some adjustments and checks to use the numbers.\"</p><p>For the study, titled \"Wildfire Smoke Adjustment Factors for Low-Cost and Professional PM2.5 Monitors with Optical Sensors (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/13/3683\">https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/13/3683</url>),\" Delp and co-author Brett Singer tested four low-cost air quality monitors:</p><p>* IQAir AirVisual Pro</p><p>* PurpleAir Indoor</p><p>* Air Quality Egg</p><p>* eLichens Indoor Air Quality Pro station</p><p>These devices, which cost in the range of a few hundred dollars, were compared to reference monitors used by regulatory agencies and researchers, which cost $20,000 or more. They also tested two monitors that are used by researchers and industrial hygienists and cost in the range of $5,000 to $10,000. Additionally, the researchers compared public data from PurpleAir PA-II monitors to nearby regulatory monitoring stations impacted by four wildfires in 2018.</p><p>Calibrations and adjustment factors</p><p>In the past, air quality monitoring has been limited to the high-priced professional monitors, making them inaccessible for personal use. The manufacturers recommend that the devices be calibrated to the specific pollution source of interest because the sensors use an optical sensing technique that responds differently to different sources. Pollution from a backyard barbecue or car exhaust may differ in size and density from pollution from a forest fire, and a forest fire may emit different types of particles than an urban fire.</p><p>The low-cost monitors use the same optical sensing technique - estimating particle concentrations based on light scattering - but use mass-produced optical sensors that are not as precisely machined as those in the professional-grade devices. In contrast, the most expensive monitors, those used by regulatory agencies, are calibrated using gravimetric analysis, which is based on the weight of particles.</p><p>With the air quality monitors deployed at Berkeley Lab inside a well-ventilated single-story laboratory building, the researchers collected data as the Camp Fire burned in Northern California in the fall of 2018. They found that the four low-cost monitors substantially overreported PM2.5 levels, by factors of 1.6 to 2.4 times higher than the readings on the regulatory reference monitor. However, the relative changes correlated well with both the regulatory and professional monitors.</p><p>The researchers calculated an adjustment factor of approximately 0.48 when using PurpleAir PA-II monitors outdoors during the Camp, Carr, and Mendocino Complex Fires in California and the Pole Creek Fire in Utah (meaning the readings should be multiplied by 0.48 to estimate the true PM2.5 level). This correction is very close to one of the data conversion options (\"LRAPA\") given on the PurpleAir website.</p><p>Good for other indoor pollutants too</p><p>In a separate study earlier this year, Delp and Singer, along with first author Zhiqiang Wang, evaluated six low-cost air quality monitors by comparing their output to reference PM2.5 and PM10 measurements from 21 common residential sources, such as frying, grilling, microwaving popcorn, vacuuming, and burning candles. The study, published in the journal Building and Environment, was an update to their 2018 study.</p><p>They found that for most pollution sources, the low-cost monitors tracked with the professional ones within a factor of two for PM2.5. Delp said the consumer monitors \"enable people to identify activities that emit fine particulate matter inside their homes and to determine if operating filters or just keeping windows closed is effectively reducing exposure inside when there is very bad air pollution outside. For these purposes, they work as well as professional grade monitors, and appear to be very reliable.\"</p><p>\"We are impressed and excited by the usefulness and performance of these air quality monitors that cost under $300,\" said Singer, head of the Indoor Environment Group in Berkeley Lab's Energy Technologies Area.</p><p>Both studies were supported by the Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Indoor Environments Division.</p><p>[Category: TNSlinxC]</p><p>Contact: Julie Chao, 510/486-6491, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jhchao@lbl.gov\">jhchao@lbl.gov</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7211729 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7211729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-G4T1-JC11-10PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"988\"/><timeReceived>8:11 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care said in a series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/facebook?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Facebook</url> posts that it got a call from a homeowner who saw the injured cub in their yard. Tamarack was lucky because this area was still under restriction, and rescuers had to get special permission to get him and take him into their healing facility.</p><p>He had horrible red burns on all his feet, but with skin grafts and TLC he is now doing much better, according to vets, Dr. Sheets and Dr. Peyton.</p><p>Officials believe the Tamarack fire started because of a lightning strike. As of Wednesday, it had burned about 68,400 acres.</p><p>A few hundred miles to the south, in California's Sequoia National Forest, another cute bear has escaped actual burns but is still struggling from the effects of the widespread wildfires.</p><p>\"This poor bear cub was spotted in a campground today looking completely defeated as its food and water sources have been ravaged by this year's devastating drought and fires,\" wrote a Kern River Conservancy employee on their Facebook page.</p><p>The brown bear, looking thin and wan, has been pushed into human areas and campsites of the forest, looking for food and water, since its normal sources have been stretched and depleted by fire and drought.</p><p>Up north, in the state of Oregon, the Bootleg fire has burned more than 394,000 acres. A safety officer fighting the perimeter of the fire sighted this adorable cub living in the recently scorched trees and was able to snap a few pictures. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said the cub was around seven or eight months old and looked healthy, if a little scared. Thankfully, its mother was spotted soon after, and the two are now together.</p><p>Also in the midst of the Bootleg fire, we can't forget our feathered friends. They live in trees. And when fires destroyed their homes, where will they go?</p><p>The engine boss of Pacific Oasis, a firefighting operation, found these abandoned baby nighthawks wandering around with no nest, and no parents. When mom never returned, the hawks were brought to a local wildlife rehabilitation specialist and are now under her care.</p><p>Moving on from birds and bears, we go to bobcats. This cutie was clearly once an elegant king of Mount Shasta near Weed, California. Now, thanks to the Lava fire, he's a bit out of sorts but is obviously on the mend.</p><p>According to Shasta Wildlife Rescue &amp; Rehabilitation, who found him, \"He [was] emaciated, weighing only about 50% of his normal 30-35% weight and blood work shows he is anemic.\" He was also found with fourth-degree burns and a puncture wound to his side.</p><p>He's now staying at Gold Country Wildlife Rescue under the care of some very good vets.</p><p>\"Despite his grave condition we are optimistic about his prognosis, but it will take lots of care and support to get him back to normal so he can return to his life in the wild.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> reached out to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for comment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1858564/bootleg-fire.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Bootleg fire</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>MATHIEU LEWIS-ROLLAND/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Massive wildfires are wreaking havoc on humans and animals alike, but nothing can keep these five cute critters who are recovering from dealing with wildfires down.

The network consists of probes placed in the ground that measure and transmit information about the moisture of the soil at existing groundwater-level monitoring stations across the state. The project began in early 2020, and eight of the 15 stations selected for the initial phase of the project have been installed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Soil moisture plays an important role in drought and flood forecasting, agricultural needs, water supply concerns, forest fire prediction and other natural resource activities.</p><p>Creation of the Soil Moisture Network is a result of conversations among Governor Parson's Flood Recovery Advisory Working Group members. It is one of many tangible paths the department is taking in enacting flood resiliency priorities to benefit Missouri and its citizens.</p><p>\"We are very pleased the soil moisture network is being implemented across the state. Interest in measuring soil moisture heightened during meetings with Governor Parson's Flood Recovery Advisory Group in 2019,\" said Dru Buntin, deputy director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. \"Coupled with our Groundwater-level Observation Network, soil moisture data will inform flooding, drought and agriculture planning. Missouri sustained record-level flooding in 2019. More than 80 levees overtopped or breached, 1.2 million acres of agriculture land was flooded, and 470 state highways were closed. Citizens, farmers and businesses were impacted. The result of flooding was devastating and cost millions of dollars in property damage.\"</p><p>Buntin learned about a network maintained by the University of Iowa and suggested, during meetings with the advisory group, Missouri develop a similar network. The advisory group embraced the idea, and the department began moving forward to make this important network a reality.</p><p>Soil moisture probes were placed at eight groundwater-level monitoring stations maintained by staff with the department's Water Resources Center. \"At each station, five probes were placed in the ground at depths of 2, 4, 8, 20 and 40 inches. Site-specific information is collected every 30 minutes and transmitted every hour via satellite and is available on the internet in near real-time,\" said Scott Kaden, Groundwater Section chief with the department's Water Resources Center. \"In addition to soil moisture, some of the probes collect and transmit soil temperature. The first probes our Rolla and Jefferson City staff installed are at our groundwater-level observation station near Hermann.\" The groundwater-level observation stations and soil moisture probes are supplied power via solar technology (solar panels and a 12-volt battery.)</p><p>Staff determined a total of 50 of the department's 150 groundwater-level observation stations are suitable for the addition of soil moisture probes. Fifteen of these stations were selected for this initial phase of the project. Probes at eight stations have been installed. In addition to the site near Hermann, the department installed probes near Jackson, Lebanon, Mt. Leonard, Naylor, Steele, St. Joseph and Tarkio.</p><p>Soil moisture and groundwater-level data, along with precipitation data (where available) are transmitted to the U.S. Geological Survey, where they make the data available to the public online.

But Korzeniowski, of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources forestry office in Little Falls, Minn., has already seen 10 in his area this year.</p><p>\"This period between when our snow leaves and things green up is traditionally our busiest fire time here in Minnesota - and we've got a ways to go yet before we hit green-up,\" Korzeniowski said.</p><p>The Stearns County Sheriff's Office responded to two grass fires Sunday: One burned approximately 7 acres just north of Cold Spring, prompting responders to close a county road due to heavy smoke, and the other burned about 1 acre just south of Holdingford. The causes of both fires are unknown.</p><p>Central Minnesota is considered abnormally dry following a dry fall and winter with below-average snowfall, while northwestern Minnesota is in a moderate drought, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>This week, the DNR announced spring burning restrictions in several northwestern Minnesota counties, meaning the state won't issue burning permits for brush or yard waste in those counties until restrictions are lifted.</p><p>Korzeniowski said he expects burning restrictions in central Minnesota within the next week or two.</p><p>\"We have a lot of grass fuels in this part of the state and they are quite flammable. It's a lot easier to light a patch of grass than it is a forest, in a lot of cases,\" he said. \"We tend to have quick-running fires and they don't put out some of the heat like a large forest fire would Up North or in California, but they can move fast and they can catch people off guard.\"</p><p>The recent precipitation helps, but the moisture is quick to disappear this time of year.</p><p>\"Those light fuels absorb moisture pretty easily but they also lose it pretty easily,\" Korzeniowski said.</p><p>Escaped debris burns are the No. 1 cause of fires in the state. While lightning strikes cause occasional wildfires, most are caused by people burning leaves or brush, and even fewer are sparked by farm equipment or other machinery.</p><p>\"That's why we issue these restrictions,\" said Casey McCoy, DNR fire prevention supervisor, in a news release. \"They really work - we've reduced wildfires by nearly a third since we started spring burning restrictions.\"</p><p>McCoy suggests alternatives to burning such as composting, chipping or taking brush to a collection site, especially during the months of March, April and May.</p><p>\"Things like [burning] a brush pile to clean up the yard - we put those on hold,\" Korzeniowski said. \"They'll burn in June just as well as they can burn in April.\"</p><p>The Little Falls region - Stearns, Benton, Sherburne, Wright, Todd, Morrison, Mille Lacs and Kanabec counties - typically sees 100 to 120 wildfires a year, Korzeniowski said. From 2015 to 2019, the state had between 600 and 1,100 wildfires annually.</p><p>The state's fire danger and burning restrictions maps are updated daily on the DNR website.</p><p>Jenny Berg \u00b7 612-673-7299</p><p>Twitter: @bergjenny</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN61978465</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:629D-1B11-DYRH-91BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 26, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NATIONAL OCEANIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FIRE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSIS</classCode><className>COMPOSTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N922120TM</classCode><className>SHERIFFS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSIS</classCode><className>COMPOSTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000041</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Earlier this week the majority of the state was in the midst of a severe drought, the effects of which can include loss of crops, governmental water restrictions and a shortage of water. Parts of Aroostook County and nearly all of York County faced an extreme drought, which is one level above severe. This includes widespread water restrictions and shortages as well as a guarantee of massive crop loss. Due to the recent wind and rain storm on Wednesday, Sept. 30 the drought has become less critical. The local drought and wildfires across the nation have impacted people, but the effects on animals and ecosystems will be more damaging in the long run.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Students in the wildlife ecology program feel that the drought and wildfires, both locally and nationally, will impact their course of study. Brennan Gunster, a third-year wildlife ecology student is focusing his studies on endangered shorebirds and Atlantic salmon.</p><p>\"Ecological events such as droughts and wildfires happen naturally but the frequency and intensity has been increasing,\" Gunster said. \"These are symptoms of climate change, and an example of ecology as we as humans have gone beyond the global carrying capacity. Finding ways to use resources based on sustainability and stock is an ecological solution to some of these problems. Due to this and more human factors, such as habitat fragmentation, we now live in the sixth mass extinction. We are losing species forever at an extremely fast rate and many ecologists have gone into conservation because of this, I would guess these programs will only become more necessary as we continue our population and resource use growth.\"\u00a0</p><p>Gunster shared that humankind's dependency on fossil fuels and overpopulation are its biggest downfalls, and unless people choose to focus more efforts towards family planning and green energy, the world will not be headed towards a good place. Gunster also expressed concern for Maine's economy, as the state relies heavily on trees for the lumber industry; however, he isn't concerned about the jobs in wildlife ecology because he sees the drought creating more jobs.\u00a0</p><p>\"The drought itself will have exotic impacts... The trees will not grow as well and a large part of Maine's economy is lumber,\" Gunster said. \"Continued drought would only compound economic and wildlife issues and if climate change gets worse it will likely do just that. The drought hasn't affected any work or internships, in fact I'm guessing that many ecologists are taking population surveys to see precisely how animals are dealing with the drought. We will need the population information even more when we see changes in population so we can better understand how a species is affected by its environment.\"\u00a0</p><p>Josie Miller, also a third-year wildlife ecology student, disagrees with Gunster's statements on abundant job opportunities.\u00a0</p><p>\"The job market for wildlife ecology is already not great. This is mostly because, -- especially regarding government jobs-- there isn't a lot of funding for those types of jobs so there aren't that many,\" Miller said. \"Hopefully people will become more aware of these problems and will start to want to see a change. The people who are working to try to help wildlife populations can't do anything without funding, and they will only get funding if the public is aware of the problem and wants to help fix it.\"\u00a0</p><p>Both Miller and Gunster agree that the more climate change causes adverse events like droughts and wildfires the more people will begin to understand the drastic effects and want to create positive change. Additionally, as issues become more local to Maine, like this drought, people will begin to see more of an impact in their community and work to better their surrounding area.\u00a0</p><p>\"Climate change has caused Maine's summers to be hotter than normal, and along with the droughts we have been having, that combination has caused an increase in forest fires. I know that there have been significantly more forest fires in Maine this year than last year, and the fires in the West Coast are getting worse and more prevalent as well,\" says Miller.\u00a0</p><p>As far as the forest fires are concerned, there were actually two small ones reported late in the summer that occurred in UMaine's forests. Forest Manager Keith Kanoti shared that the fires burned less than half an acre. One fire was caused by human behavior and the other is under investigation but Kanoti speculates it was caused by human behavior as well. According to Kanoti, UMaine has an excellent relationship with the Maine Forest Service Protection Division and the local fire departments who are all trained on how to combat forest fires. Kanoti urged people to use caution when engaging in activities like smoking during a dry spell. UMaine does not permit people to build fires in their forests.\u00a0</p><p>Miller and Gunster agree that individuals can take steps to help reduce climate change and its adverse effects, although it is important to note that corporations and the government must cooperate with the individual efforts.\u00a0</p><p>\"Average people can understand that there is a major problem with climate change and that these droughts are likely to get worse unless we change things on the governmental level as well as the individual level,\" Gunster said. \"Reduce use of plastics and petroleum products, reuse when you can and recycle. Buy sustainably-sourced and local food. This will not solve the drought, but limit the severity and frequency of future droughts.\"</p><p>Miller wants people to be aware of their surroundings, echoing Kanoti's pleas to not engage in an activity that could spread a forest fire when it is windy and dry outside. She notes that large bonfires will require a permit, and says its always a good idea to have water near the fire. Hopefully increased awareness around ecological issues will help Maine prevent another extreme drought or forest fire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4773966</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610R-PT81-DY7P-T3RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Main Campus: University of Maine</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 5, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Orono</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>ME</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

The list of benefits goes on and on. Trees can be a tremendous educational resource, too, teaching us about a region's ecological and environmental history. But to find that information, you have to look inside, at a tree's rings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not easy to get there, but that's what Stockton Maxwell, Ph.D., does.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a dendrochronologist, Maxwell focuses much of his research on vegetation dynamics and fire disturbance history using tree-ring analysis. He's cored trees for research all across the United States, from Virginia to Maine to California, and exotic locations around the world, helping with efforts in Peru, Brazil and Zambia.</p><p>Maxwell is a teacher, too, willing to talk with anyone, of any age or stature, about the science that captured his imagination nearly 20 years ago.</p><p>\"I can show a tree sample to my son's fourth-grade class and ask them to spot the differences in the rings and what causes the difference between the big rings and small rings,\" Maxwell explained. \"So, I'm teaching small kids a really tangible science to get them excited about the environment.</p><p>\"It also works for big kids, too,\" he said with a smile, referring to the students he teaches at Radford University, where he is an associate professor of geospatial science and directs the Tree Ring Laboratory in Reed Hall, just a few steps away from his office.</p><p>Most of the students he teaches major in geospatial science or a related field. But sometimes, students from other majors enroll in a dendrochronology class because, as one political science major claimed, \"I just thought it was interesting.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, it is interesting,\" Maxwell said enthusiastically.</p><p>Maxwell first fell in love with tree ring science while working on his master's degree in forestry in the mid-2000s. During the process, he attended the North American Dendroecological Field Week workshop in Idaho. A few years later, colleagues asked Maxwell to be an instructor at the workshop. He eagerly agreed and now regularly teaches and organizes the workshop's tree-ring analysis sessions.</p><p>Maxwell's summers are usually consumed with teaching and research. In July 2021, he taught a tree-ring analysis workshop at Yellowstone National Park, and in October, he traveled to Zambia to teach and help launch new projects there. In December, Maxwell worked with a small group of conservationists in Brazil to study Brazil nut trees \"and what they can teach us about the past climate in the PeruvianAmazon,\" he explained.</p><p>That's not all. Maxwell and a colleague help organize training for researchers in Congo, Zambia, South Africa, Namibia and Ghana.</p><p>\"We had a couple of dozen professors, graduate students and researchers come in for two weeks of training so we could show them how we do it in the United States,\" Maxwell explained. \"If you look at a map of where all of the tree-ring analysis projects have occurred, the entire continent of Africa is almost empty. We are helping them launch a network where they can build on this science.\"</p><p>Maxwell hopes to soon give his Radford University students similar opportunities and access to this important research across the world.</p><p>\"It is a great way to teach students of any age and interest to better understand their environment,\" he said while further explaining, in a brief Q&amp;A, the importance of his research and teachings.</p><p>What can be learned from tree rings?</p><p>\"How long you got?\" Maxwell asks jokingly and with a laugh.</p><p>\"Some of my research focuses on learning about past environments in terms of what has happened in the ecosystem. I have projects right now looking at wildfire history. For example, I just published a paper in 2021 on wildfire history in West Virginia, in the northern part of the state.</p><p>I also have a project in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, and there we have a record of fire history for over 1,500 years. We have really long-living trees there that have been recording for centuries. One of the things that we found out west was that not only were fires really frequent, but they often occurred during the really dry years. And that's not a really novel thing because the fuels get really dry, and that's when the fire can get going.</p><p>We've made these long-term connections between fire and climate. If we want to put good fire - prescribed fire - back on the landscape, to help maintain a healthy and resilient ecosystem, we can now, from our research findings, tell resource managers, here's how often you should probably burn the forest and maintain a healthy ecosystem because this is what happened in the past before humans disrupted the fire cycle.</p><p>How can tree rings be used to reconstruct past climates?</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just released its new reports this year and over the past year, and it basically says the climate is warming, and we have to deal with it now.</p><p>We know the climate is warming right now, but we have to put it in the context of something. In the past, maybe in the hundreds or thousands of years ago, what were the temperatures? Well, we didn't have thermometers back then.</p><p>Trees are a good substitute or a proxy for not having a thermometer or a rain gauge. We use the trees to help us understand past climates, and the relationship is fairly straightforward. In the eastern U.S., a big tree ring means we had a wet year, and a narrow ring means you had a dry year. Maybe in high mountain environments, a small ring is a really cold year, and wide rings are a really warm year. We can use that pattern of narrow and wide rings to help us interpret the past climate.</p><p>Large worldwide reports can say that the Earth is warming, and we know it's true because we have reconstructions of climate, precipitation and temperature for the past 2,000 years or longer that we can find in these trees. That's why tree rings are really good to give us this long-term perspective on climate and environments.\"</p><p>Are we experiencing more wildfires than usual in the Appalachian region?</p><p>\"Some of my colleagues did a study in the 1990s [in the Brush Mountain area near Blacksburg, Virginia], and it showed that, historically, before humans started building neighborhoods there, fires used to burn on average of five to 10 years - maybe up to 15 or 20 years in some cases. Low-level, low severity fires would burn through there. These same ecosystems extend down into Tennessee and North Carolina, where you have steep slopes and pine trees. Fire was historically common; we know that from the tree-ring data.</p><p>We can learn lots from the tree-ring research to help inform resource managers throughout the Appalachian Mountains. We live in a pretty rural and forested area, and it would be naive to think that a big forest fire is not going to happen to us here. We can prepare for it now and be fire-aware.\"</p><p>What can Radford University students learn from conducting research in the Tree Ring Lab?</p><p>\"I teach them from start to finish how to build a project. We go out and core trees at Selu Conservancy. Once we have the samples, the first step is to prepare the samples, sand them down and make them nice and polished. Then, we scan the samples at a high resolution on a flatbed scanner, so we can zoom in and mark the boundaries between the rings and measure them. I teach students how to date the samples, and at the end of the semester, they can present their work at one of the campus research forums to show and explain their projects.</p><p>The Tree Ring Lab space gives us a really great opportunity to work with students. I think everybody should have some exposure to these types of research and scholarship opportunities.\"</p><p>Contact: Chad Osborne, 540/831-7761, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:caosborne@radford.edu\">caosborne@radford.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>null-7854671 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7854671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65M7-71T1-JC11-12H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1322\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 4, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In November, the council approved an update of the city's Climate Action Plan, which contains a host of strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change-related ordinances that have won council approval in recent years include ones that eliminate the use of gas-powered leaf-blowers, plastic bags and Styrofoam containers.</p><p>Encinitas ought to prioritize actions that can help reduce global warming concerns, council members have said, because it's a coastal city and climate change will result in sea level rises that threaten coastal areas.</p><p>Councilman Tony Kranz said he was supporting the climate emergency declaration because he wanted to make the world a better place for his grandchildren. He said local governments need to step up and take action because the nation's current leaders are not.</p><p>Encinitas is far from the first California city to enact a climate emergency. Large cities that have done so include Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, a city staff report notes, adding that the neighboring towns of Del Mar and Solana Beach also have recently taken the action.</p><p>\"The first such declaration was made in December 2016 in Australia, and since then over 1,400 local governments in 28 countries have made climate emergency declarations, including 73 in the United States,\" the staff report states.</p><p>In other action, the council voted to:</p><p>? Give final approval to a new permit system and regulations for group homes, including sober living houses where people stay while they are undergoing treatment for drug or alcohol addiction.</p><p>? Spend up to $50,000 to both obtain the necessary environmental permits and then remove an estimated 300 to 500 cubic yards of sediment from a San Elijo Lagoon-area culvert that's causing community flooding problems.</p><p>- Barbara Henry is a freelance writer for The San Diego Union-Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-0C6JIMCP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63WV-YK61-DXXV-3110-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union-Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 1, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp;

The list of benefits goes on and on. Trees can be a tremendous educational resource, too, teaching us about a region's ecological and environmental history. But to find that information, you have to look inside, at a tree's rings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not easy to get there, but that's what Stockton Maxwell, Ph.D., does.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a dendrochronologist, Maxwell focuses much of his research on vegetation dynamics and fire disturbance history using tree-ring analysis. He's cored trees for research all across the United States, from Virginia to Maine to California, and exotic locations around the world, helping with efforts in Peru, Brazil and Zambia.</p><p>Maxwell is a teacher, too, willing to talk with anyone, of any age or stature, about the science that captured his imagination nearly 20 years ago.</p><p>\"I can show a tree sample to my son's fourth-grade class and ask them to spot the differences in the rings and what causes the difference between the big rings and small rings,\" Maxwell explained. \"So, I'm teaching small kids a really tangible science to get them excited about the environment.</p><p>\"It also works for big kids, too,\" he said with a smile, referring to the students he teaches at Radford University, where he is an associate professor of geospatial science and directs the Tree Ring Laboratory in Reed Hall, just a few steps away from his office.</p><p>Most of the students he teaches major in geospatial science or a related field. But sometimes, students from other majors enroll in a dendrochronology class because, as one political science major claimed, \"I just thought it was interesting.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, it is interesting,\" Maxwell said enthusiastically.</p><p>Maxwell first fell in love with tree ring science while working on his master's degree in forestry in the mid-2000s. During the process, he attended the North American Dendroecological Field Week workshop in Idaho. A few years later, colleagues asked Maxwell to be an instructor at the workshop. He eagerly agreed and now regularly teaches and organizes the workshop's tree-ring analysis sessions.</p><p>Maxwell's summers are usually consumed with teaching and research. In July 2021, he taught a tree-ring analysis workshop at Yellowstone National Park, and in October, he traveled to Zambia to teach and help launch new projects there. In December, Maxwell worked with a small group of conservationists in Brazil to study Brazil nut trees \"and what they can teach us about the past climate in the PeruvianAmazon,\" he explained.</p><p>That's not all. Maxwell and a colleague help organize training for researchers in Congo, Zambia, South Africa, Namibia and Ghana.</p><p>\"We had a couple of dozen professors, graduate students and researchers come in for two weeks of training so we could show them how we do it in the United States,\" Maxwell explained. \"If you look at a map of where all of the tree-ring analysis projects have occurred, the entire continent of Africa is almost empty. We are helping them launch a network where they can build on this science.\"</p><p>Maxwell hopes to soon give his Radford University students similar opportunities and access to this important research across the world.</p><p>\"It is a great way to teach students of any age and interest to better understand their environment,\" he said while further explaining, in a brief Q&amp;A, the importance of his research and teachings.</p><p>What can be learned from tree rings?</p><p>\"How long you got?\" Maxwell asks jokingly and with a laugh.</p><p>\"Some of my research focuses on learning about past environments in terms of what has happened in the ecosystem. I have projects right now looking at wildfire history. For example, I just published a paper in 2021 on wildfire history in West Virginia, in the northern part of the state.</p><p>I also have a project in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, and there we have a record of fire history for over 1,500 years. We have really long-living trees there that have been recording for centuries. One of the things that we found out west was that not only were fires really frequent, but they often occurred during the really dry years. And that's not a really novel thing because the fuels get really dry, and that's when the fire can get going.</p><p>We've made these long-term connections between fire and climate. If we want to put good fire - prescribed fire - back on the landscape, to help maintain a healthy and resilient ecosystem, we can now, from our research findings, tell resource managers, here's how often you should probably burn the forest and maintain a healthy ecosystem because this is what happened in the past before humans disrupted the fire cycle.</p><p>How can tree rings be used to reconstruct past climates?</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just released its new reports this year and over the past year, and it basically says the climate is warming, and we have to deal with it now.</p><p>We know the climate is warming right now, but we have to put it in the context of something. In the past, maybe in the hundreds or thousands of years ago, what were the temperatures? Well, we didn't have thermometers back then.</p><p>Trees are a good substitute or a proxy for not having a thermometer or a rain gauge. We use the trees to help us understand past climates, and the relationship is fairly straightforward. In the eastern U.S., a big tree ring means we had a wet year, and a narrow ring means you had a dry year. Maybe in high mountain environments, a small ring is a really cold year, and wide rings are a really warm year. We can use that pattern of narrow and wide rings to help us interpret the past climate.</p><p>Large worldwide reports can say that the Earth is warming, and we know it's true because we have reconstructions of climate, precipitation and temperature for the past 2,000 years or longer that we can find in these trees. That's why tree rings are really good to give us this long-term perspective on climate and environments.\"</p><p>Are we experiencing more wildfires than usual in the Appalachian region?</p><p>\"Some of my colleagues did a study in the 1990s [in the Brush Mountain area near Blacksburg, Virginia], and it showed that, historically, before humans started building neighborhoods there, fires used to burn on average of five to 10 years - maybe up to 15 or 20 years in some cases. Low-level, low severity fires would burn through there. These same ecosystems extend down into Tennessee and North Carolina, where you have steep slopes and pine trees. Fire was historically common; we know that from the tree-ring data.</p><p>We can learn lots from the tree-ring research to help inform resource managers throughout the Appalachian Mountains. We live in a pretty rural and forested area, and it would be naive to think that a big forest fire is not going to happen to us here. We can prepare for it now and be fire-aware.\"</p><p>What can Radford University students learn from conducting research in the Tree Ring Lab?</p><p>\"I teach them from start to finish how to build a project. We go out and core trees at Selu Conservancy. Once we have the samples, the first step is to prepare the samples, sand them down and make them nice and polished. Then, we scan the samples at a high resolution on a flatbed scanner, so we can zoom in and mark the boundaries between the rings and measure them. I teach students how to date the samples, and at the end of the semester, they can present their work at one of the campus research forums to show and explain their projects.</p><p>The Tree Ring Lab space gives us a really great opportunity to work with students. I think everybody should have some exposure to these types of research and scholarship opportunities.\" For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4121280</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65M0-37J1-JDKC-R2PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1327\"/><timeReceived>9:32 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 HT Media Ltd.

Rising air temperature and fuel availability over the past 41 years indicate that conditions in Earth's largest terrestrial biome are becoming more favorable for intense burning and fire growth.</p><p>This image shows the buildup index (BUI) trend in June for the 19792019 period. The buildup index, an element of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, is a numerical rating of fuel availability for fire consumption. Surface temperature, relative humidity and 24-hour rainfall totals all go into the BUI. Brown colors reflect an increasing trend in the availability of fire fuels, while purples reflect a decreasing trend in fuels.</p><p>When the BUI reaches certain levels, fires can burn more aggressively and intensely. The widespread increase in the BUI in June in the higher latitudes of both North America and Asia reflect conditions that are becoming more favorable for fire growth. These trends in the availability of dry, flammable fuels for wildfire growth are consistent with wildfire projections for the next century. Up to a four-fold increase in burned area across the higher northern latitude ecosystem by 2100 is projected under a range of different climate scenarios.</p><p>In the northern high latitudes, trees aren't the only fuel available to burn. During the short growing season, thick deposits of moss and dead vegetationduffaccumulate on the ground without decaying. Under the right conditions they may form deep layers of peat. When these fuels catch fire, they can burn for long periods, sometimes even persisting as so-called \"zombie fires\"deep, hot ash pits that overwinter under the snow and emerge again as fires the following spring.</p><p>The risk of wildfires extends beyond the immediate threat to life and property. Smoke can worsen air quality, limit visibility, and keep fire suppression aircraft grounded. Black carbon, created by the burning of plant material, can travel thousands of miles across the Arctic, darkening snow and ice where it settles and accelerating melt. And the fires themselves can cause the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases and speed up the destruction of permafrost. Thawing permafrost across the higher latitudes can lead to sinking land and changes in the way water moves through the region.</p><p>The occurrence and size of wildfires across the far north can vary greatly on a year to year basis due to the variable nature of weather systems and human activity, but when it comes to fuel availability, the trend is clear.

The company ultimately pled guilty to manslaughter for each of the deaths of those who died because of the fire.</p><p>\"PG&amp;E's rap sheet of manslaughter and mayhem is unmatched among electric utilities in the U.S. and could very well be the cause of more fatalities and property destruction this summer and beyond,\" said EWG President and longtime Bay Area resident Ken Cook.</p><p>\"With advances in decentralized power generation and storage, notably rooftop solar installations and community microgrids, this latest admission from PG&amp;E ought to confirm two conclusions. First, PG&amp;E is not a company to be trusted to safeguard the environment or human health,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"Second, the era of all-powerful, monopoly electric utilities should be brought a swift close in California and replaced with bold, sustainable, localized energy systems that both power and empower communities across the Golden State,\" he added. \"This transition cannot happen soon enough in the case of PG&amp;E. It is literally a matter of life and death.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, the utility - reviled by many ratepayers - petitioned the PUC for a $3.6 billion rate increase for its 16 million customers for, ironically, wildfire prevention measures.</p><p>The only concrete way to prevent future wildfires caused by PG&amp;E and other large utilities is to reform the current model of centralized electricity distribution that sends energy hundreds of miles through often unmaintained and dilapidated power lines over dry, drought-ridden central and Northern California landscape covered in brush that fuels these fires.</p><p>Locally generated and distributed renewable electricity, primarily from solar, would dramatically reduce rolling blackouts initiated by utilities to prevent fires that are often triggered by power lines traversing the state, like the one that PG&amp;E admitted could be the cause of the Dixie Fire, which doubled in size in the past 48 hours.</p><p>But PG&amp;E, along with Southern California Edison and San Diego Power &amp; Electricity, are pushing the PUC to quash the state's rooftop solar program, which allows homeowners and businesses to sell back surplus energy to the state's utilities. The three big investor-owned utilities are furious over having to pay their customers for the excess energy generated from rooftop solar panels.</p><p>The popular program was deployed to reduce the state's reliance on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in order to help combat the climate crisis. And it helps mitigate the risks of fires caused by downed or damaged power lines.</p><p>\"PG&amp;E is actively plotting to kill this critical component of California's energy policy that, if allowed to continue growing throughout the state, could reduce the risk of wildfires,\" added Cook. \"The PUC and Gov. Gavin Newsom should use their authority to block this outrageous power grab by PG&amp;E and the other utilities.\"</p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Contact: Alex Formuzis, 202/667-698, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:alex@ewg.org\">alex@ewg.org</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7545704 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7545704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6360-PBN1-DYG2-R3GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 20, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is one of the few countries in the world that has done so. In the 1980s, Costa Rica had lost most of its primary forest and had only 21% of its land covered by forest as a result of having the highest deforestation rates in the world. Today, the country has 52% forest cover and protects more than a quarter of its territory,\" said the President of the Republic, Carlos Alvarado referring to the PES.</p><p>For the past 25 years, Costa Rica has maintained a PES scheme with an investment of more than 15 billion per year. With the actions of the strategy and the REDD+ Results-Based Payments Project, the protection and sustainable management of forests will be expanded in more than 500,000 ha of private forests, including approximately 150,000 ha in Indigenous Territories.</p><p>\"This is a historic moment: the culmination of incredible efforts by communities across Costa Rica to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with deforestation, making the country a huge \"carbon sink,\" said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.</p><p>Of the total resources, US$41 million will be transferred to inhabitants of the country's forested areas, where some of the most marginalized districts with the lowest social development index are located, such as the coastal regions and forested areas in general.</p><p>The project will improve and expand public policies related to the implementation of Costa Rica's Forestry Law, climate action, conservation and empowerment of rural women, youth and indigenous peoples over the next five years.</p><p>\"This project demonstrates that it is possible to address the climate crisis and at the same time support vulnerable communities to build sustainable livelihoods, reduce poverty and promote gender equality\", emphasized Yannick Glemarec, Executive Director of the Green Climate Fund.</p><p>The project will specifically contribute to maintain the reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation at a level of 6 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year until 2024. An will bring relief to the country's successful PES scheme, following budget cuts due to the public finance situation, as well as the reduction in fuel tax collection, which represents 93% of the annual revenues of this FONAFIFO-led program.</p><p>To learn more about the initiative, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cr.undp.org\">www.cr.undp.org</url> or write to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comunicaciones.cr@undp.org\">comunicaciones.cr@undp.org</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124489103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62SR-4N81-JCBF-S4X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 24, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

University issued the following news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prescribed burning can reduce house loss during bushfires so long as it is targeted close to houses, the latest review by the Bushfire Recovery Project has reported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The effectiveness of fuel reduction burning, however, is greatly reduced on high fire danger days and we're experiencing 10 times as many high fire danger days as we were in the 1960s,\" said Professor Brendan Mackey, Griffith Climate Action Beacon Director and a coordinating lead author for the International Panel on Climate Change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is one of many key findings of an expert review of 72 scientific papers about bushfire and infrastructure loss by the Bushfire Recovery Project, a joint initiative between Griffith University, the Australian National University and the Great Eastern Ranges Initiative.</p><p>The key findings were:</p><p>* To reduce loss of houses and other buildings/infrastructure, the location of fuel reduction burning is much more important than the number of hectares burned;</p><p>* Prescribed burning is effective when very close (1km) to houses, however is only effective for around five years;</p><p>* The effectiveness of controlled burning is likely to go on decreasing substantially as the climate continues to heat, due to the reduction in winter rainfall in southern Australia with climate change, the drying the fuel load, the hotter springs and the lengthening the fire season;</p><p>* Most house losses occur on days when the fire danger rating is severe or higher and;</p><p>* Australia is now experiencing 10 times the number of extreme fire danger days it experienced annually it in the 1960s - 143 in 2010s versus 14 in the 1960s.</p><p>The report is the last in a series by the Bushfire Recovery Project, established with philanthropic co-investment from the Griffith Climate Change Response Program to use a scientific understanding of critical forest fire issues to inform post-fire forest management in an era of climate change.</p><p>Having previously reported that fuel load dryness is much more important than the amount of fuel, Professor Mackey said the evidence from the latest report was that targeted fuel reduction burning of relatively small areas was most effective.</p><p>\"Targeted burning within 1km of houses and towns can help to protect them from bushfire, but it must be done every three years.</p><p>\"The evidence shows fuel reduction burning was once much more effective than it now is, because we faced far less extreme fire weather 50 years ago.</p><p>\"There has been an irreversible change in fire weather conditions since the 1970s - put simply, the game has changed.\"</p><p>ANU Bushfire and Landscape expert Professor David Lindenmayer AO agreed the climate was now completely different to what it was in the 1970s and that the effectiveness of fuel reduction burning was hugely reduced on these very hot days.</p><p>\"The peer-reviewed evidence is that burning forest miles from houses doesn't protect those houses,\" Professor Lindenmayer said.</p><p>\"Multiple strategies are needed to reduce the risk of infrastructure loss due to bushfire, but even then, the risk of losing houses and infrastructure to bushfire in Australia can be reduced, but not eliminated.\"</p><p>The Bushfire Recovery Project also analysed satellite data to map the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfire footprint, including the fire intensity and developed an app that enables bushwalkers, members of land care groups, amateur naturalists, rangers, etc., to upload to an interactive map observations of the forest regrowth, habitat features and wildlife following the fire.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>C20-RajeshS-7418841

My name is Sameera, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vermilion Energy Q2 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]</p><p>Thank you. Mr. Dion Hatcher, you may begin your conference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Sameera. Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. I'm Dion Hatcher, President of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars Glemser, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerwin, Vice President, International and HSE; Bryce Kremnica, Vice President, North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p><p>We will be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss our Q2 2022 results and our return of capital framework we announced this morning. Presentation can be found on our website under Invest with Us and Events and Presentations. Please refer to our advisory on forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today, and outlines the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>As shown on Slide 2, we delivered another quarter with record fund flows of CAD453 million and record free cash flow of CAD340 million, which is over CAD2 a share. That's up 16% and 12%, respectively from the previous quarter. The increase was mainly driven by strong commodity prices, as global oil prices and North American gas prices were strengthened during the quarter. European gas prices remained strong in Q2 and relatively consistent with the prior quarter with TTF in excess of CAD38 per mmbtu. Over the past several months, European gas forward prices have nearly doubled, which will bode well for Vermilion. I will review the fundamental drivers for this later in my presentation.</p><p>Production during Q2 averaged 84,868 BOEs a day, which is down slightly from the previous quarter, mainly due to planned and unplanned downtime. Key notable event during the quarter was the closing of the Leucrotta acquisition on May 31. We have successfully integrated the Leucrotta assets and assembled a Mica asset team, which is now focused on completing a six-well pad that was drilled in Q2. We're excited to have these high-quality assets in our portfolio, and look forward to scaling up our development. The Leucrotta acquisition was mostly funded by free cash flow generated in the quarter. As a result, net debt increased only slightly in Q2, CAD1.6 billion. However, our net debt to fund flow ratio decreased to 1.1 times as a result of our increasing fund flows from operations. We remain on track to achieve our next debt target of CAD1.2 billion by the end of 2022. With this clear line of sight, we are pleased to outline our return of capital framework.</p><p>Before I get into the details of our return of capital framework, Slide 3 reviews some of the key strategic objectives we accomplished over the last two [Phonetic] years that will position Vermilion to deliver very strong returns over the long term. These objectives were part of the strategic plan we developed during the 2020 downturn.</p><p>Our Number 1 financial priority was to reduce debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We have reduced debt by approximately CAD1 billion relative to Q2 2020 by the end of this year, while also funding over CAD1 billion of strategic acquisitions without issuing any equity. We increased our international weighting in European gas exposure through the Corrib acquisition, which we expect to close in Q4 this year. Our international assets now represent over a third of our production base and contribute approximately two-thirds of our fund flow and free cash flow. This international diversification is what differentiates Vermilion from our peers.</p><p>We reinstated a base dividend in Q1 of this year. And today, we're excited to announce a 33% increase in our Q3 quarterly dividend to CAD0.08 per share. The dividend is very resilient at less than 3% of our fund flows and leaves ample room for ratable increases over time. We completed Leucrotta acquisition in Q2 as Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory, which will further enhance our free cash flow profile and underpin our long-term return on capital.</p><p>And finally, we said that we would increase our return of capital when we achieved the line of sight to our CAD1.2 billion mid-cycle debt target. With less than two quarters remaining in 2022 and robust outlook for 2023, let me now return -- review return of capital framework on Slide 4. Vermilion has a long history of returning capital to its shareholders. In the past, this has been primarily through base dividends, which we've delivered over CAD40 a share.</p><p>Going forward, base dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework. However, we want to ensure the base dividend is resilient over the long term through the commodity cycles, while allowing for ratable increases over time where they placed a burden on our business or the balance sheet. With this philosophy in mind, we plan to limit the annual base dividend outlay to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle fund flows. For reference, this would equate to approximately CAD100 million based on the current asset base, but could increase if our asset base grows or we see a fundamental shift in our mid-cycle commodity price assumptions.</p><p>In conjunction with our Q2 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 quarterly dividend to CAD0.08 per share. This equates to an annual dividend of CAD0.32 per share or approximately CAD53 million based on the current number of shares outstanding. At this dividend per share level, we have the capacity to increase the base dividend, and we look forward to provide ratable increases over time.</p><p>With our debt approaching target levels, we will pivot from allocating free cash flow for debt reduction to the return of capital. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a core principle of Vermilion and we will remain focused on that going forward. We plan to enhance our return of capital to shareholders going forward, while continuing to reduce debt to a target of CAD850 million by the end of 2023, which implies approximately another CAD350 million of further debt reduction beyond our year-end 2022 target. It also implies we will be undrawn on our CAD1.6 billion credit facility, leaving just our termed U.S. notes outstanding.</p><p>The amount of free cash flow available for return of capital will increase, as debt levels decrease based on the illustrative grid outlined of Slide 4. The grid is not intended to be prescriptive quarter to quarter, but will be used as a tool to guide near-term return of capital allocation decisions, while taking into account other capital requirements such as further debt reduction, asset retirement obligations and acquisitions. As you can see from this grid and near-term debt targets I discussed, a significant portion of our future free cash flow will be available to the return to shareholders. Based on our return on capital allocation grid, recent commodity strip and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of free cash flow in the second half of 2022 and up to 50% to 75% of free cash flow in 2023, while achieving our debt targets.</p><p>Our goal is to return capital in the most beneficial method to shareholders. We will consider various options to return capital, including share buybacks to the normal course issuer bid, regular and special dividends, and as potential substantial issuer bid. Based on our review of a number of data points, we will initially allocate the vast majority of this capital return to share buybacks.</p><p>Given the structural improvements in our business, combined with the strong fundamental outlook for global commodities, we believe Vermilion is very well positioned to generate significant free cash flow in the years ahead. However, we do not believe this value proposition is accurately reflected in our share price today, and therefore, at this time, we view share buybacks as the most compelling use of free cash flow that will benefit long-term shareholders.</p><p>In early July, we announced the approval of our normal course issuer bid for the purchase of up to 16 million common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for CAD35 million. As it reduces our share count, this will also enhance our ability to increase the base dividend while adhering to our annual dollar limit of 10% mid-cycle fund flows. We look forward to providing continued updates on our return of capital initiatives through the second half of this year and through 2023, as we carefully weigh capital allocation decisions against various uses of excess free cash flow with a view of acting in the long-term interests of our shareholders.</p><p>Slide 5 is from an Investor Relations presentation, where we provide an updated financial outlook for 2022 based on the actuals to date and our estimates for the balance of the year using the current commodity strip. As you can see, on a pro forma basis, including the full-year impact from the Corrib acquisition, we are forecasting pro forma fund flows of CAD2.4 billion and free cash flow of CAD1.8 billion or approximately CAD11 per share. We also show our year-end debt target at CAD1.2 billion, which incorporates the return of upwards of 25% of free cash flow in the second half of this year. We have not yet provided any formal guidance for 2023, but if you assume production has held flat at our exit rate forecast of 95,000 BOEs a day to 100,000 BOEs a day, today and you honor the backwardation in the commodity price forward strips, we are looking generating similar amounts of free cash flow in 2023, which is consistent with the analyst estimates.</p><p>As outlined on Slide 6, looking at our cumulative free cash flow over a three-year period from 2022 through 2024, assuming flat production from existing asset base and applying the forward pricing, we expect Vermilion to generate over CAD5 billion of free cash flow over this time, representing by the blue bars.</p><p>This amount of free cash flow is equal to our current market capitalization. The gray bars show the cumulative free cash flow we currently plan to allocate to debt reduction. And as you can see, the majority of the free cash flow was allocated to debt reduction in 2022, including the funding of over CAD1 billion of acquisitions, whereas for 2023 and '24, we will pivot and majority of the free cash flow will be available for return of capital to shareholders now that we have a much stronger balance sheet.</p><p>As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, the fundamentals for European gas are very strong. Slide 7 shows historical pricing of European gas and Asian LNG, which have traded in the similar band since 2015, compared to the Canadian benchmark price of April. The blue bars represent the average premium that Vermilion receives on its total gas sales relative to April. This premium was approximately CAD6 an mmcf in 2021, and is forecast to be approximately CAD19 in 2022. We also show the forward pricing for the balance of 2022 and 2023, which has increased significantly from historical levels.</p><p>Second half 2022 TTF is CAD75 per mmbtu, and 2023 is now over CAD70 per mmbtu. For every dollar increase in Euro gas prices, this adds in an incremental CAD37 million of fund flows to Vermilion on an annual unhedged basis. Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people and our hope is that a negotiated settlement can be achieved quickly. The tragic events in Ukraine are undoubtedly contributing to the price increase, however, the underlying fundamental drivers for high European gas prices were in place prior to the invasion.</p><p>Chart on Slide 8 shows the 2023 and 2024 forward price for TTF and how much it has increased since the beginning of the year. The calendar year 2023 TTF price has increased from under CAD20 at the beginning of the year to over CAD60 today. This will have a significant impact on Vermilion's fund flows in 2023, and we have been adding more European hedges in 2023 in recent weeks. We believe the structural drivers will be supportive for European gas prices for many years to come. Europe consumes approximately 45 Bcf a day to 50 Bcf a day of natural gas with approximately 40% of that being supplied from Russia in 2021.</p><p>With recent events, the EU is now trying to significantly reduce its dependence on Russian gas. EU recognized natural gas as a transition fuel, which really will help facilitate the permitting and development of domestic supplies over time as countries increase use of natural gas for power generation. Examples of this transition include Germany shutting down nuclear and accelerating a phase out of coal from 2038 to 2030, and Ireland committing to build nine gas fired power generators by 2024.</p><p>With domestic supply in Europe continuing to decline, the only viable option to replace Russian gas is to increase LNG imports, but there is limited new LNG supply coming on the market prior to 2025 and 2026. These new projects require significant and longer-term contracts, significant capital. So in order to attract LNG to Europe, buyers need to compete with Asian, which is driving European gas prices even higher. Short-term, we expect Asian LNG demand to increase as they look to build inventories prior to this winter, but more importantly, mid to longer-term Asian demand for LNG is forecast to significantly increase.</p><p>As I mentioned, we are starting to layer in more 2023 European gas hedges to lock in some of our fund flows at these higher prices. As shown on Slide 9, since our last update, we have increased our 2023 Euro gas hedge position from 32% to 45%. Those recent hedges were executed primarily with wide collars with an average floor of about CAD40 and ceiling of about CAD70. Through the higher gas prices, we may further increase our 2023 Euro gas hedge position to 60% to lock in even more fund flows. At the corporate level, given our low debt levels and current outlook, we tend on keeping our total hedge percentage at the lower end of our target range of 25% to 50%, which will leave us with the exposure to sustain higher oil prices.</p><p>Going back to our Q2 results, we have provided a brief summary of our operational highlights on Slide 10 and 11. Most notable activity in our international operations in Q2 was our offshore drilling program in Australia. This program was scheduled to start early in the second quarter, but was delayed approximately one month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on a third-party contracted rig. During routine inspection prior to moving the rig to our location, the operator identified some maintenance requirements and had to mobilize the rig to Singapore for repairs. We commenced drilling late in the second quarter and drilling operations are progressing, although the delay did result some deferred production and higher cost. We expect to finish drilling in early September and will start the wells shortly thereafter.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet quarter in Europe, as the teams focused their efforts on preparing for our second half 2022 drilling campaign, which will include two wells in the Netherlands, three wells in Hungry and two wells in Croatia. Subsequent to the quarter, a forest fire near our Cazaux field in southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 barrels of production being temporarily shut-in. Our staff in France worked closely with emergency responders to ensure the safety and security of our employees, our contractors and installations, ensuring there were no HSE incidents. We are in the process of making necessary repairs and bringing this production back online. However, this will have an impact on our France production in the second half of 2022.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet quarter in Canada, as drilling and completion activities in West Central Alberta, Southeast Saskatchewan was limited during the second quarter due to spring breakup. Following the announcement of the Leucrotta acquisition in late March, we assembled our Mica asset team and focused on integrating the assets and working closely with the Leucrotta team in drilling the first six-well Montney pad. Drilling was successfully completed during the second quarter, and the team is now focused on completion activities that is progressing as per plan.</p><p>In the U.S., we drilled four wells of our planned six operated Turner wells, and completed two wells during the second quarter. One well was brought on production during the second quarter where the remaining wells will be completed and brought on production during the third quarter. Overall results today are in line with expectations. Subsequent to the quarter, we successfully executed drilling and completion activities on three -- two mile laterals, which are significantly more economics than the one mile laterals.</p><p>Moving to Slide 12. Our Q3 2022 capital program is well underway, and in Europe, we will start our drilling campaign later this month and continue through the fourth quarter. As mentioned, the forest fire here in Cazaux field in Southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 barrels a day of production being temporarily shut-in, and we expect to have most of it back online by the end of the year.</p><p>Looking at our Q3 production forecast, we will benefit from a full quarter contribution from the Leucrotta acquisition and new production from the U.S., Southeast Saskatchewan drilling programs, partially offset by the Australia drilling program delay and fire-related downtime in France. Taking all this into account, we expect Q3 production to be in line with Q2.</p><p>As a result of the forest fire-related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by CAD50 million to CAD550 million. We are maintaining our annual production guidance of 86,000 to 88,000 [Phonetic], excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes. We plan to update our production guidance once we have greater certainty on the timing of the Corrib close, which we expect to occur in Q4. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 BOEs a day to 100,000 BOEs a day, including Corrib acquisition bonds remains unchanged.</p><p>Before we open it up for Q&amp;A, I want to make some closing remarks on our upcoming leadership changes. As we announced earlier this year, Vermilion's Executive Chairman and Co-founder, Lorenzo Donadeo will be retiring from the Company effective September 1. Lorenzo was instrumental in creating what Vermilion is today along with creating significant value for our shareholders during his tenure. On behalf of the whole organization, I would like to thank Lorenzo for his leadership and guidance of the Company over the 27 years. You will be greatly missed by everyone at Vermillion. But if anyone deserves a long, happy and fulfilling retirement, it is Lorenzo. We wish you all the best, and look forward to providing a regular quarterly updates as a meaningful shareholder of Vermilion for many years to come.</p><p>As previously announced, Mr. Bob Michaleski will assume the role of Independent Chairman on Lorenzo's departure. Bob has 41 years of experience and oversaw Pembina's pipeline transformation from a [Phonetic] Alberta-based oil company into one of North America's leading integrated energy transition service companies. He served as the President and CEO of Pembina for 13 years. He joined Vermilion Board in 2016, and was appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee in 2020. Vermilion's executive committee structure will continue and will fill the role -- we will fill the role of the Chief Executive Officer. It will be led by myself and will include all the existing members.</p><p>Well, that concludes my prepared remarks. Well, with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Menno Hulshof with TD Securities. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a question on Corrib. If we assume that it does close, what is your best guess in terms of the purchase price net of accrued free cash flow? We've run some numbers on this end and our estimate is very low, but any thoughts here would be helpful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Menno. I'm going to pass it over to Lars to address that one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, good morning, Menno. I think you're thinking about it the right way in terms of cash to close at December 31 of this year from a modeling perspective and then obviously full access to the cash flows in 2023. I think the number that is good to use for year-end this year would be a purchase price of CAD100 million to CAD150 million, if it were to close at the end of 2022. And that would be inclusive of the contingent payment that is in the money for 2023, which was $25 million. So I think that's the best way to model it and a good way in terms of how you're thinking about it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Terrific. Yeah. Thanks, Lars. And then on acquisitions, in the past, you've talked about smaller Euro gas packages potentially becoming available, and I know there's -- there are limits to what you can say here, but like at a high level, what are the boxes that need to be checked to pull the trigger on -- in other Euro package? And do you see these opportunities being able to compete with buybacks at the current share price?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thanks, Menno. I'll pass it back to Lars to address what we're thinking about that relative to our return of capital framework.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks, Dion. And maybe I'll just rewind a little bit Menno with the return of capital grid, what we really wanted to do was shift focus back to the CAD11 per share of free cash flow that we're generating. Dion mentioned CAD1.8 billion of free cash flow in 2022, that's on a pro forma basis. That's probably not a bad proxy to think about free cash flow for 2023.</p><p>And then what the return of capital grid is going to do is create discipline in terms of where we are allocating capital. There's flexibility in there in terms of how we return capital. At this point in time, we'll be doing it through share buybacks. And as importantly, in terms of acquisitions, when it comes to North America, nothing big. We think that we have done the heavy lifting in terms of hydrating the inventories here in North America. It'll be more tuck-in bolt-ons in terms of our existing position within North America.</p><p>And then Europe, I think we've had good success, a good track record there of making acquisitions. Now that those acquisitions will continue to compete with returning capital to shareholders, we will be looking for I'd call it, deep value type opportunities in Europe as we move forward here. Some acquisition -- sorry, some announcements have been made in the past in terms of potential opportunities in jurisdictions like Netherlands, but again, it's going have to be competitive in terms of where we return capital.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>We'll take our next question from Greg Pardy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the rundown, Dion and Lorenzo, just all the very best in your -- I guess it's your second shot at your retirement. Couple -- maybe just -- one maybe modeling question is, what kind of book tax rates should we sort of think about on a consolidated basis? And Lars, I want to ask that -- just that tax question. Is it still, I don't know, 11%, 12% or so pre-tax?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so I think for 2022, and I'll sort of correlate these tax rates to the pro forma numbers. So we're referencing CAD2.4 billion of cash flow for 2022. In the context of that, 10% to 11% is still a good way to think about it, Greg. For 2023, I would say that rate has gone up in the context of current strip pricing. I would sort of peg it at 13% to 15% for full-year 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. What about book sort of like 30%-odd or so just as a book tax rate?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Sorry. Could you repeat that, Greg?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, just your book tax rate. What would you sort of be thinking? I know you're giving me the cash taxes, but just as a book tax rate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So I think a good way to think about it is in the 30% range.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. And maybe just sort of related to Menno's question. With Europe now kind of thinking very differently about gas as a transition fuel as you mentioned, are there -- are policymakers or governments now starting to come to you as one of the longstanding developers in Europe in terms of just encouraging domestic supply growth as opposed to just relying upon imports?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Greg, I'll take this one. I think what's happening when you look over the last several quarters with crisis, I believe it is an energy crisis in Europe. The policy makers have triaged their approach with -- starting with LNG, which is material albeit at longer timelines. Next, there's been discussions around offshore, and that leads us to your question around onshore. And so, yes, we are having continued engagement in both Netherlands and Germany in particular, questions that would be framed around what could Vermilion as an operator of some of those jurisdictions for decades be able to offer with increased activity.</p><p>What we've done? We always focus on what we can control. So we've added staff in both Netherlands and Germany, technical staff to be able to prepare for higher levels of activity. I would caution that timelines are longer in Europe. And so, the time from a conversation to action and drills, it's longer, but I would say, it's encouraging and somewhat logical that you would see some increased activity associated with the current situation and need for more domestic supply from responsible producers like Vermilion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Terrific. Thanks very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>And we'll take our next question from Patrick O'Rourke with ATB Capital. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick O'Rourke:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, guys. Good morning, and congratulations to Lorenzo. Obviously, a long and well story career here at Vermilion, so appreciative all of your work. Guys, maybe just to build on Greg's question there, you talked about sort of the regulatory regime and timelines in Europe. As we get into the 2023 budgeting cycle and as you look at the portfolio, sort of what are the other hurdles to bringing on production in Europe? Where could you allocate capital to sort of capture this windfall gas price that we're seeing over there in sort of the quickest manner? Is it in the Netherlands? Is it in the CEE? What are sort of the infrastructure constraints? I don't think that you would have any in the Netherlands there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thanks, Patrick. I think, first of all, the acquisition with Corrib to bring on that 7,700 BOE a day is probably the most impactful thing that in hindsight was very well timed and are excited to close that at the end this year. So again that's 7,700 BOEs there. From an organic point of view, we're focused on every BU to look for opportunities. I think in Germany, we do have a deep inventory of drilling prospects. That, again, we've added resources back to look at some of the more, I would say larger targets, but a little more higher risk. So that's something we're reviewing. CEE is an area once we get these permits in place like SA-10, we're able to follow through and drill wells in shorter timelines. And then Netherlands, we used to drill four to six wells in Netherlands. We're drilling two in the second half of this year or so. Our view would be less work back to those higher levels of activities.</p><p>So I would say all jurisdictions. Netherlands does have the potential to increase activity as well as Germany. We drilled three wells earlier this year, and we're looking at on the gas side what we might be able to do in late 2023 and into 2024. So quite excited to be having those conversations. And again, our near-term focus is getting more staff in those to be used to be able to react, once it aligns with the regulatory framework to be able to put more capital into those business units.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick O'Rourke:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then maybe shifting over to the return of capital framework here, and in particular the dividend. You guys referred to ratable dividend increases, the pro forma math that we have on today's dividend increase with sort of the sub-4% of 2023 free cash flow. So I wonder in terms of -- maybe you can provide some goal posts around what you mean with respect to ratable and also sort of the cadence or review period like how frequently you plan to review the dividend going forward here?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>I'll pass that one to Lars to talk about our thoughts on the base dividend.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, thanks, Patrick. The way we have framed the base dividend component is not -- look to not exceed 10% of our cash flows at mid-cycle pricing. And I think that's some discipline that we want to continue to have in the business to ensure that that base dividend is resilient. Based on our current numbers with the increase today, we're about CAD50 million to fund the increased dividend that we did announce today. So that is where there is ample room to continue increasing that and still be in line with our -- not to exceed 10%.</p><p>Now in terms of the cadence or how we will do that, I would say, at this point, we're looking for ratable type increases over time. We think that also with the return of capital framework that we announced today, there is flexibility in terms of how we return that capital. The base dividend will be one mechanism that we use or one medium that we use. It will not be the majority of capital that will be returned through that. So that's where we have flexibility in terms of share buybacks, variable dividend, special dividends. We will err towards buybacks at this point in time, just based on the data points that we're reviewing, where we think capital is best allocated. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of clarity in terms of the fixed based dividend will be one component of a return to capital, but we truly want to make sure that that base dividend is fixed and resilient in prices that are much lower than what we're seeing today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick O'Rourke:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Josef Schachter with Schachter Energy Research. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, everyone. And thanks so much for taking my question. In Europe, we're seeing a lot of demand management, UK talking about preparing for blackouts, Germany telling certain industries you may get cut back certain percentages of gas, assuming the Russians are aggressive in terms of cutting back. Is there anything going on, on the supply management side where they're asking you to hold back and put into storage near consuming areas gas to bring on later? Or if you have new wells coming on, bring them on close to the winter. Is there any supply management stuff going on that would impact Vermilion in Q3, Q4 and into Q1 of next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Josef. I'll take that one. Quick answer is no. We're selling all the gas that we're producing, and there's no discussions around us storing or restricting our production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Good, thanks. That's it. Thanks for me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Josef.</p><p>With that, I think that we have no more questions. So I guess, Sameera, we would like to thank everyone again for participating in our Q2 conference call and look forward to future updates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-bef5b21bd4e051f0a96b7b73c4f33c19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB1-CR53-RTH9-W3XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 AlphaStreet Inc.

Four of the casualties were firefighters.</p><p>Authorities are using relatively benign conditions forecast in southeast Australia for a week or more to consolidate containment lines around scores of fires that are likely to burn for weeks without heavy rainfall. The reprieve from severe fire conditions promises to be the longest of the current fire season so far.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government was developing a national disaster risk reduction framework within the Department of Home Affairs that will deal with wildfires, cyclones, floods and drought. The government was working through the details of the framework with local governments.</p><p>Morrison later announced that $52 million would be spent on providing psychological counseling for firefighters and fire-affected communities as part of a previously announced $1.4 billion recovery fund.</p><p>Perry writes for The Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0107190172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYM-WWD1-JBM5-R18T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"304\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>AS--Australia-Wildfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Needham's 18th Annual Technology and Media Conference. My name is Anna Andreeva. I'm a senior analyst covering consumer e-commerce here at the firm. And next up, we're very excited to have Revolve. From the company, we have Mike Karanikolas, who is the Co-Founder and co-CEO. Welcome, Mike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MIKE KARANIKOLAS, CO-CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, REVOLVE GROUP, INC.: Thank you. Happy to be here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Great. So I figured we should start with -- Revolve is pretty unique, having been in the business for over 20 years now and having lived through various economic cycles. Can you talk about some of the learnings from the previous downturns that could help educate the company, how to navigate the current environment best, and how do you think Revolve has differentiated in this environment?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. I think the biggest learning living through past cycles, particularly the Great Recession of 2008, is that while those periods can be difficult, it's really an opportunity for businesses to separate themselves from the pack. And that was something that we saw in 2008, 2009, even though it was a very difficult period for us, it ended up being even more difficult for our competition.</p><p>And so when we got out on the other side, it was really fertile ground for us to grow on. It was like a forest fire had swept in and swept out a lot of the competition or weakened them significantly. And so I think that's the biggest learning just from a strategic direction perspective.</p><p>I think beyond that, certainly, there's a lot of stock market scenes around us, but when times are tough, you see really who has a good business that operates well and who doesn't. And so we've always prided ourselves on being great, not just from a growth perspective, but from a fundamentals perspective, from a profit perspective, and from a focus on the long term where we're never sacrificing the long term for something that's going on short term. I think that's really helpful entering a period like this.</p><p>And then I think the last thing we learned from that period, and it was many years ago when we were much younger and with not as much experience, but it's the importance of having a strong balance sheet. And that was one thing at the time that our balance sheet was not as strong.</p><p>We were self-funded. We had taken no investment up into that point and growing rapidly. And so cash was always tight, even when we were generating profits left and right. And so I think that's a big difference for us this time around where we've made sure we have a really strong balance sheet entering this period.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Perfect. You reported the first quarter a couple of weeks ago, and you talked about slowing trends as the quarter progressed and also weaker results in April as this younger consumer is pulling back. And this is what we hear across the industry, of course, as well.</p><p>The big silver lining from the print, in our view, was that the net ads of active customers continues to be really strong. And this was during the quarter when you pulled back in advertising. Can you talk about how do you see the composition of these new customers, full price versus clearance compared to last year, and just anything to call out in terms of LTV of these consumers versus your historic levels?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. As you say, that was a great aspect of the quarter that we're really happy with. Along with the inventory rebalancing and the cash generation, the new customer ads were a great aspect of the quarter. And for us, it's just kind of further validation that there's just a general weakening going on in terms of what we saw from some of the other customer cohorts, which I'd still say are still performing actually better than even the pre-COVID period, but just kind of comping towards last year when the consumer was still feeling quite strong.</p><p>So yeah, we were really happy to see that. And there's a couple drivers of it. One would be certainly we did have increased markdown product, which in general is not something we want, but there are periods we have to deal with that. And so that was helpful in driving new customer ads.</p><p>And then the other big thing that was helpful in driving new customer ads, which has been helpful for many quarters and is on a really nice growth trajectory, is our beauty segment, which is still quite small compared to the rest of the business, but historically has been a great driver of new customer ads. And that was a major source.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. That's great. And yeah, the beauty trends have definitely been pretty encouraging. Anything that you see regarding the churn of the customer base lately, how do you guys think about retention and just the opportunities to continue to have her coming back to the site?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. So, first of all, it's with retention, we think in terms of higher strategic North stars of, try to create the best experience for the consumer in the space. And if you do that well, your retention is generally going to be good over time. There'll be certainly cycles where it's up or down, certainly the depths of COVID was one of those down examples, but you'll do really well over the long term. And historically, our retention numbers have been terrific.</p><p>So, in terms of retention of these recent cohorts, we'll have to see how it plays out. Historically, markdown retention is slightly worse than full-price retention, but it's still quite great, even in isolation. I think most -- many companies would kill to have those retention numbers that we even have on the markdown segment. So, we feel great about those ads. And again, we've been through many business cycles before, and we think every change is an opportunity, even if in the short term, there's a little bit of pain.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: As the inventory correction continues, and you already made a lot of progress here in 1Q, and you're expecting more of a full-price business in the back half, how do you think about the net ads as we go through the year? Do you think there is a risk that more clearance consumer potentially drops off as the brand becomes less promotional, as again, the inventories are reined in, in the back half of the year?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, I mean, there certainly is a risk there. I mean, I might frame it as like, that definitely will happen. And it's overall a good thing. As much as we like to have more new customer ads, we like having healthier inventory, even more so. We still expect that number to be positive through the year, in terms of the active customers, but we do expect to see that number decel as we progress, as there's less markdown inventory available.</p><p>And of course, we'll have to see what happens economically. Obviously, it's a time, and I guess we've been seeing this for, many people have been seeing it for a number of quarters now, but it's only a time where there's risk the consumer gets weaker. And so if that happens, that will certainly affect our business.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: There's been definitely some evidence of intensive promotional environment out there. I think across the board, if you look at the brands, if you look at the bigger players, department stores, et cetera. What are you seeing across the environment? And as inventories are getting gradually braved in, which I think some of the bigger players are definitely making progress there. Do you see any normalization in discounting quite yet?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, I mean, I think it depends on the segment, I think discounting has improved a bit in sort of the premium price points that Revolve operates at versus maybe a couple quarters ago, but it's still elevated compared to what we might normally see. And then if you look kind of in the more of the luxury price point, I think it's still quite elevated, and we're not really seeing any kind of alleviation there in terms of the level of discount that other luxury players are doing.</p><p>So I think that'll take longer to play out. And that's, I think, generally been true. Historically, it's actually a little bit more competitive, just because those brand names on the merchandise are so strong, and consumers sometimes follow the brand name versus the store that they buy from in terms of the level of price competition we see in the luxury space. So Forward will probably be impacted for a bit longer than Revolve.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: And I think it's more of that aspirational consumer, right, that's been dropping off, probably both at Revolve and Forward?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. We've seen the higher-end consumer segments hold up a bit better than the more aspirational consumers, particularly on Forward. But that said, we are seeing, I'd say weakness across the board versus what we'd like to see, and certainly versus early last year, which was still kind of part of that post-COVID bull run. But certainly greater weakness in the aspirational consumer.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: The one exciting aspect recently was seeing the first AI-generated billboard campaign that came out last month. How else are you thinking about potential for AI across the brands?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, we're incredibly bullish and excited about it. And granted, we're certainly technologists at heart. That's my background, actually, computer engineering. And we didn't talk about it much on this call, but we certainly have in the past just how much of a technology-led organization we are kind of through and through in terms of our DNA, how we go about things.</p><p>So, yeah, we're incredibly excited and bullish. And I don't get excited about every technology trend. This one, I'm quite excited about. The billboard campaign, I think, perfect example of it being put to great practical use where if you look at the speed that we're able to put that campaign together, if you look at the cost, if you look at the creative level and production level, we would not have been able to do that with traditional techniques on really any of those measures in the same way. And so it's really empowering there.</p><p>And as we look across the organization, it's really almost every aspect of the organization that has the potential touch. And in some areas, we are further along than others. And we've talked about how we've already been using it various places on the website, whether it's kind of fraud detection or various kind of personalization algorithms. But the step up in capabilities within the past 12 months on AI is just mind-boggling. And so for us, you know, continue to improve in those areas that I just mentioned.</p><p>Another big area that we're looking at with really great internal kind of initial results is on the fashion design side, assisting kind of in the design of products. I think in terms of search capabilities and different ways for the customer to browse the site, again, we've seen some really incredible things internally that aren't quite ready for prime time yet, but are really, really close. And really just every aspect of the business.</p><p>Again, it can touch, whether it's assisting customer service, whether it's kind of assisting operational areas. So we're excited about it. We're investing in it in a big way. And we think it can provide a competitive advantage to companies that are nimble and quick there.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Do you think inventory management could also benefit from that?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: 100%. Yeah, kind of, as I said, it's really hard for me to think of an area of the business that it does not have the potential. And not just like one in a thousand chance, but like, reasonable potential to make a pretty big impact.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: We noticed there was a limited-edition capsule launch as part of the AI campaign. Can you talk about that and some of the learnings from that?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, we were really excited with that capsule launch. And again, one of the learnings was certainly that it can be really powerful on the fashion design side. And on that case, we were just leveraging kind of the creative art, right. So it's more kind of leveraging it for the graphic arts with fashion design and graphic prints. But we felt like that capsule collection was really strong. We're really pleased with the results.</p><p>But then for us, we're using it internally to do some really cool design things that go beyond just graphic prints. And again, there's just a ton of potential. So we're excited for the coming month quarters. And I don't even think we're talking years here in terms of the impact that it can make.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Great, terrific. I know driving overlap between the two brands, Revolve and Forward is a pretty important initiative for the business. Can you talk about what you're seeing lately with that overlap and any new initiatives to drive that further? I think on the last call, you mentioned working on some navigation enhancements and inventory sharing between the two brands, which was new.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So those are two key things that we introduced. I think from a consumer standpoint, the navigation is going to be quite critical in the coming months and quarters. Just kind of bringing the websites a little bit closer together again, where it's much easier from the navigation for them to kind of cross back and forth between the two sites. And there's more sort of graphical emphasis placed on that capability.</p><p>So we ran tests on that. We found that it was really positive results and success. So we think that's going to provide lift going forward. From kind of an operational standpoint, really leveraging shared inventory capabilities, we think is going to be important for maximizing efficiency. So those were two key additions.</p><p>And then another thing that we have in the works, I think a good chance of it launching soon is within the Forward Renew program. We think there's an opportunity to bring that product to Revolve as well, which is, I think, not just an opportunity to expand the Renew program itself.</p><p>But again, just another one of those things that can bring Revolve and Forward closer together in the consumer's eyes, which will allow us to tap into that quite minimal current overlap between Revolve and Forward, right? It's kind of mid-single digits, sort of 5% range. And we think over the longer term, it has the potential to be 50%-plus in terms of the overlap. So it really has a long way to go.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: I actually, I wanted to follow up on Forward Renew, as you're in a resale business now, which is definitely very interesting and timely. Can you talk about just any performance there? And just so making sure I heard this correctly. So you're thinking about a resale program for Revolve as well?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, it would essentially be bringing the same program over. With the Forward handbags in general, we think those are a really great sell to the Revolve customer. And then certainly if you're talking sort of the pre-owned handbags even more so. So we think it's a natural fit. We want to do it with similar branding. So again, it just kind of brings those two sites together. So it wouldn't necessarily be Revolve just completely separately also selling handbags. It would be part of the same program. So yeah, we think that's a big opportunity.</p><p>And then Renew, it's still quite small, but we think it has a lot of momentum. Obviously, the market there is huge. The handbag market is huge. The pre-owned handbag market is huge. We've seen a lot of good early metrics there.</p><p>And from a growth perspective, again, off of a small base, but I think the most recent quarter was 50%-plus quarter-over-quarter growth within that program. So we're hopeful we can drive that to much bigger places in the coming quarters.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: And does it currently encompass only bags? And if yes, would you consider additional categories?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, we would consider additional categories. We think bags are the easiest, most natural fit. So that's certainly where we'll start. There's other things like watches or certain accessories that I think are natural there too.</p><p>I think it's less likely, at least certainly in the short term and even the midterm that we would get into apparel categories and things like that, with the exception of special vintage pieces. That's certainly the kind of thing that we could bring in something that's particularly special and unique. But in general, just the pre-owned apparel category, more broadly, we're not looking to get into it as big a way just because the economics are a little bit trickier there than I think with the handbags and some of the logoed accessories.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Understood. Okay, terrific. I wanted to ask about the own brands for the company. Just update us where you are with that. How are the brands performing? And you just announced a new one, a new collab with an international influencer, Cindy Kimberley. Just anything to pull out with that?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, we're super excited about the launch and in general, doing these influencer and celebrity collaborations is something that we want to do even more of. It really combines two skill sets that we're great at. Obviously, the brand marketing that we're known as kind of being a leader and innovator there and in connecting with these younger generations. And then also kind of the buying and design side in terms of the capabilities we're able to bring when partnering with the influencer to help create amazing designs that our customers are going to love. So we're super excited about that launch and we're looking to do more partnerships like that in the coming.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay, terrific. Revolve pulled back on the number of events during the quarter. Can you talk about how are you planning events as we go through '23 and just any update on the initiatives to reach and acquire customers today? Obviously, efficacy of marketing has become more choppy. You're one of the innovators for sure when it comes to using influencers and you mentioned brand marketing is something Revolve is very strong at. So we'd love to hear your thoughts.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Definitely. So I wouldn't characterize it as a pullback. The brand marketing cycle in particular has always come down to sort of timing of specific events and where we think there's opportunities. And you also have to stay fresh and exciting and interesting with brand marketing. There's some things that are mainstays like Revolve Festival, but we also try to mix things up every year.</p><p>So last year, we introduced some new events in the first quarter. Some of those were quite great, including a Super Bowl party in LA. This year, Super Bowl wasn't in LA and we decided it might not have the same impact in Phoenix doing that same party. So it's really just a timing issue. There'll actually be increased brand marketing activities in Q2 compared to Q1. So no pullback there. And we're always looking to invest in the long term through business cycles and certainly review those brand marketing investments as long-term investments.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Terrific. Can you talk about the category of performance? We love that you guys disclose fashion apparel and dresses and others. And those two have been more difficult just given the environment out there. And you also mentioned some of the going-out categories now are softer and this is on top of very strong business in those categories last year. So what are you doing to re-energize demand in those categories, specifically within apparel?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Definitely. For us, we're all about going where the consumer is going and where the consumer is. Obviously, we always want our sales to be as high as possible in any quarter and in every category as high as possible. But we're also disciplined. If we look at this year versus last year, post-COVID, there was just this huge boom in going out apparel and dresses and things of that nature. A lot of pent-up demand and things overshot a little bit. And so as a comparison, it's relatively weaker this year versus last year. That's fine. Wherever the consumer wants to go with the category she's interested in, that's where we'll go.</p><p>I think it can certainly be interesting from an analyst perspective because obviously different companies index differently in those categories. But for us, it's not anything we're trying to force. We're happy to provide the consumer whatever it is she's looking for.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: And how big do you think the beauty category can get to the business? I know it's a relatively new initiative, typically high gross margin type of a category. And it has been doing well and is very additive in building baskets. Just curious, any thoughts on that?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah. So over the long term, we would look to drive beauty to call it 10%-plus of the business. And we kind of look at what players in the space that have had a multi-decade head start on us have been able to do with categories like that. And that would be our goal there.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Anything specific to call out about just the performance there? Is this a new customer to Revolve coming in? Do you see it more as existing customers adding to baskets? Just curious about that.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, no, it's both. And it's one of the reasons we love the category so much. It's really great for bringing in new customers just because there's so many different products and brand names you can carry in there that can help introduce someone to Revolve. And then it's also great with existing customers in terms of increasing basket size and cross-shopping capability.</p><p>And yeah, a lot of things going on in beauty. We think we've done quite well with what we have, but we know we're missing a lot of key pieces. There's a number of key brands that we're missing, and we feel like we're making good progress behind the scenes, increasing that assortment, getting those brands in. And we're very hopeful that's going to happen over time.</p><p>From just a capability standpoint, we know we have work to do in terms of the various tools and ways to present those products to the customer on the website, right? Because our focus has been apparel, and so we're going to be making investments there.</p><p>And then obviously, I think from a brand perspective, continuing to invest in the right brand messages to make consumers think more of Revolve first over time when they're thinking about beauty versus -- Right now, we have some decent beauty share, but for a lot of our customers, we're certainly not their number one place to go for beauty, and we have the right investments and marketing messages that will change over time.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. No, terrific. That makes sense. You guys are still expecting, I think, a modest increase in AOV for the year. Can you talk about how you think about that? Is that going to be driven more by units? We mentioned the beauty category, seeing momentum, so that's probably part of it. Or do you think it's more about improving average unit retail in the back half as the business becomes less promotional?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah. So that projection is more centered around improving average unit retail, which we think should happen as the year progresses and as the inventory position.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. Makes sense. Switching gears to margins, the one big positive takeaway from the print was recalibrating of the inventory position while improving the cash flow for the business as well. Can you talk about how you feel about inventories by brand, Revolve and Forward, and just any categories that the brands are still long in at the moment?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah. So we feel like we've made a lot more progress on the Revolve side. The Revolve inventory is in a fairly good place, and certainly, I'd like to get it in a great place, but I think compared to where we were a couple of quarters ago, Revolve is in a really nice place right now. And again, the trends there are looking really good for the business.</p><p>For Forward, it's a bit behind Revolve, and I kind of mentioned that -- or alluded to that maybe from a competitive standpoint. And there's just different dynamics in the luxury realm. Again, there can be increased discounting when things turn a bit, and then also it can just take a little bit longer to cycle through the inventory because the turns are naturally slower than we've been with.</p><p>So that'll take a few more quarters. The Forward inventory isn't quite as healthy as the Revolve segment, but we've certainly been through this many times over operating the business for 20 years. So we're confident we can get that inventory to a good place. It might just take a few more quarters than Revolve.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. But all in, should we still be expecting inventories to be more in line with sales? I think you said starting in the back half of the year?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think we said on the call that end of Q2, we feel like we should be in a fairly good place.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. Okay. Makes sense. Return rates have edged up for the business. And going back to the call, it sounded like there is a bigger strategic focus now for Revolve to affect that without compromising the consumer experience. And we thought that was a pretty big deal for Revolve potentially going forward. Could you talk about what that means? And do you think there are any investments that are necessary to see that? And what would be the rough timing for the company to affect? Because obviously, return rates are pretty important.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, 100%. So return rates have always been quite important for the business, but it hasn't been as big a focus the past three years, particularly 2020 and 2021. There were bigger things that we're focused on. And also return rates were depressed in that period. But certainly, with the recent increase, it has a meaningful impact on the financials of the business as we've seen.</p><p>So it's a huge area of focus. I'd say prior to the current period, again, there was a little bit of effort, but nothing major. It's not a major initiative within the organization.</p><p>When I say investments, I don't mean large capital expenditures. But there are things that have the potential to hit the margins, affect profitability in the short term. But I think long-term dividends will be paid over time.</p><p>When I say investments, I'm mostly talking organizational time and focus, as well as R&amp;D efforts. Because the one thing with return rates is, aside from maybe putting some things in place on high-return customers that are maybe a little bit lower-handed and more tangible, it is a little bit more R&amp;D in nature in that the ideas are more speculative.</p><p>But the things we have cooking, I think, look really good. I'm very hopeful that we're going to have some ideas that can hit in a really nice way, which the nice thing is if we have success there, it really impacts the business twofold, where not only do you get better operational margins, but you also get a revenue boost as your net becomes a lot higher percentage of the growth.</p><p>So big focus going forward. We're hopeful in the coming quarters we'll have some nice things to share there.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. Some companies in the space have seen success using restocking fees. Of course, not something that the consumer loves, but at the same time, maybe unnecessary evil in this environment. Is that something that Revolve would consider? Not to put you on the spot.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, no. I'm just trying to think of the right way to sort of respond to it. We certainly already have a version of that in kind of extreme cases. But in general, I don't love stocking fees. And in general, where I want the organization's time and focus is on these win-win things. So I think there are some things we can do at the margins on some of those higher return rate customers.</p><p>But for me, it's about building long-term value a short-term number. And I want to help our customer. And so that's what I emphasized as we work on this. Figure out ways to help the customer, not to penalize them. I think we keep that North Star in mind. We're going to come up with really good things.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. Terrific. Yeah, we look forward to hearing about that for sure, because that's a big deal. One interesting thing also you mentioned was cost savings from shipping and logistics initiatives, as you guys are doing some work when it comes to logistics. Can you provide some more color on that? And when do you think it might manifest as a positive impact to profitability?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. So on the earnings call, I think we mentioned some directional goals. And in terms of the number of basis points, we could shave on a run rate basis by the end of the year. I think also if you look at our implied guidance, it includes some reductions there.</p><p>So we have a number of things that we're working on. The full list is actually quite long. It's, call it, dozens of things that we're working on. But broadly, I'd maybe put things into three or so different categories.</p><p>So one would be things to kind of optimize our carrier utilization. So making sure we're using the right carrier, making sure we're negotiating with carriers in the right way, and in some cases, switching carriers. Particularly on the international side, we have opportunity to do that. And I think even on the domestic side, in some cases, that's one area we're working on.</p><p>Another area we're working on is just, call it, logistics optimization and location optimization. So the East Coast Pennsylvania warehouse is one of those things in that bucket. And that's much closer to operating at full capacity today than it was even, call it, two months ago. So we're hopeful that's going to provide some leverage on the bottom line.</p><p>There's other things I'd put in that bucket as well. We're actively pursuing a refulfillment center in Europe to help save on those costs. And as we scale, that's the kind of cost that should scale is our business scales there.</p><p>And then we're working on other things as well, like direct line hauls is something that we're looking into with a lot of promising early results. So it's a host of things. I mentioned returns as being a prime focus in the business. Optimizing these logistics in distribution costs is a prime focus as well.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Have you guys said what the time frame might be for a European fulfillment center?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, I don't think we've committed to a specific time frame, but I'd say that project is moving along, but at this point, we don't want to commit to a specific time.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay, understood. On international, you reported pretty strong results there and you talked about newer markets like India and also with China reopening. Could you talk about what are you seeing in more established markets? The macro picture I think continues to be still pretty difficult in Europe. Just curious what you're seeing there.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. In established Western markets and in developed markets, we're seeing a pretty similar picture to the US where consumer demand is softer and those markets aren't doing as well as we'd like. So Western Europe, Australia, places like that, we're definitely seeing soft demand trends.</p><p>But the international actually had great growth for the quarter as a whole and it's because internationally that's offset by a lot of these developing and emerging markets. Some of which just have great growth treacherous to begin with for us, but then also many of them haven't been as impacted by the current global economic situation. So areas like the Middle East, Latin America, we saw really strong strength.</p><p>Mexico in particular was quite exciting because it's grown to a fairly large base. It's actually become our fifth biggest country internationally and is growing -- I figure we said on the call, but I think close to triple digits. I can't recall if it's more than triple digits, but we'll call it close to triple digits.</p><p>So really great growth there, really great growth in India. India is still quite small, but still, I believe, we can call it 400%. So again, off of a small base, but quite exciting growth there.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: What does the brand awareness look like in some of those countries for Revolve? I mean, very interesting, your comments on Mexico. So just curious.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, so actually Latin America in general, we have really strong brand awareness. And so now certain regions of Latin America, logistics are quite challenging. Long-term, that's still something we would like to unlock, but like Brazil, for example, from a brand perspective has a lot of potential for us, but we haven't really been able to unlock things from a logistics standpoint there. The tariffs are just outrageous shipping in products.</p><p>Mexico is kind of a sweet spot where it's a large market. It actually has our second largest call it social following among international regions in the world. Our logistics are decent there. We're working on making them even better. So it's really, I think those two pieces coming together in a nice way that are generating the growth.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay, understood. We got a question from an investor. So you've made a lot of progress with the inventories. And I think the low end of your gross margin implies some nice improvement. I think 100 basis points-plus in the back half and easier compares, of course, a part of that. But how do you think about the promotional intensity, whether it's for Revolve or for the industry?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, I mean, I think when the consumer is not in this healthier place, and also when there's broad discounting across the board, it does have impact on both our businesses. We like to say, and we've certainly seen it historically that Revolve is a bit less susceptible to what any particular competitor is doing at a given point of time. Revolve has a lot of whites around it.</p><p>But when there's match discounting, it definitely affects our consumers' mindset and there can be softness on the full price. So I think that'll continue to be a drag throughout the year. Despite that, we expect with the healthier inventory position margins to improve significantly certainly from the first quarter. And so again, we've been through a number of cycles and you just have to play the cycle as it comes and set yourself up for a great growth on the other side.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Right, definitely. The one unique thing about Revolve relative to the industry, so you've maintained profitability, you continue to generate strong cash flows. How do you think about potential for M&amp;A? Valuations have certainly compressed and the buyback and how do you balance those two thoughts?</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, I mean, it's tricky. We take being stewards of capital and people's investments very, very seriously. Another thing we like to say, and it is, I think, very relevant always is that Michael Mente and I are the two largest investors in Revolve and nearly half the company. So when I see that cash on the balance sheet, it's our investors cash, it's our cash and I want to do the best thing with it.</p><p>So I think as always, we're going to be thoughtful, we're going to be disciplined. It's really tough to say what the best use of that cash is going to be, but it's certainly something that we're actively thinking about as it continues to accumulate. Just how do we use it in a way to add the most value to our shareholders?</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay, terrific. Makes sense. We have just a few minutes remaining. Just wanted to ask you, so what are you most excited about as we go through the year? Lots of initiatives, of course, longer term and near term still continues to be a little murky. Just curious on your thoughts.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think one of the things I'm most excited about is actually the opportunity to navigate this period. Certainly, it might be a bit more challenging economically, but what we've seen in the past, as I kind of mentioned in my earlier comments, is it's really time for companies like us to shine and can be a time for us to pull away from the pack, particularly as we get out on the other end of this.</p><p>And so, as is often said, when times get tough, a lot of companies that weren't focused on the right things, they struggle, or in order to survive, they have to cripple themselves in some way. And so, for us, I'm happy that I think it's a great period for us to get recognition for our business model, where we've delivered growth and profitability so consistently over the years. For a number of years, investors were focused mostly on growth. We've delivered both.</p><p>So, yeah, I'm excited. It's a great time for our business model to shine. I think on the other side of this, it can be a really fruitful opportunity for us.</p><p>And then beyond that, in terms of active things we're working on within the business, certainly the return rates, it's a challenge. But I'm incredibly excited about it as well, because it's something we haven't thought about in a big way in a number of years. And as we start thinking about it, realizing there's so much opportunity there.</p><p>And then the other thing I touched on earlier in the call, I know it's a buzzword right now, and I generally hate buzzwords, but I love AI. And not just from a conceptual standpoint, but more importantly, from a business standpoint, I think it's incredibly exciting. It's, I think, an exciting time to live right now in terms of seeing how things are going to change over the coming quarters and coming years. So, we're certainly excited about that as well.</p><p>ANNA ANDREEVA: Okay. Well, perfect. It's a perfect way to end on this note. Thank you so much, Mike, and thank you to everyone who listened in.</p><p>MIKE KARANIKOLAS: Thank you.</p><p>[Refinitiv, an LSEG business, reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

My name is Anna Andreeva, I'm a senior analyst covering consumer e-commerce here at the firm. And next up, we're very excited to have Revolve. From the company, we have Mike Karanikolas, who is the Co-Founder and Co-CEO. Welcome, Mike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you. Happy to be here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Great. So I figured, we should start with Revolve is pretty unique, having been in the business for over 20 years now and having lived through various economic cycles. Can you talk about some of the learnings from the previous downturns that could help educate the company, how to navigate the current environment, best and how do you think Revolve is differentiated in this environment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, definitely. I think the biggest learning living through past cycles, particularly the great recession of 2008 is that, while those periods can be difficult, it's really an opportunity for businesses to separate themselves from the pack. And now, it's something that we saw in 2008, 2009, even though those were very difficult period for us. And then it would be even more difficult for our competition. And so when we got out on the other side, it was really fertile ground for us to grow on. It was like a forest fire had swept in and swept out a lot of the competition or weakened them significantly, and so I think that's the biggest learning just from a kind of strategic direction perspective.</p><p>I think beyond that, certainly and there's lot of kind of stock market seems around this, but when times are tough, you see really who has a good business that operates well and who doesn't. And so, we've always prided ourselves on being very not just from a growth perspective, but from a fundamentals perspective, from a profit perspective, and from a focus on the long-term, we're never sacrificing the long-term for something that's going on short-term and I think that's really helpful, entering a period like this.</p><p>And then you know I think the last thing we learned from that period and it was many years ago when we were much younger and with not as much experience. But it is the importance of having a strong balance sheet and that was one thing at the time that our balance sheet was not as strong, we were self-funded, we've taken no investment up until that point and growing rapidly and so cash is always tight, even when we're generating profits left and right and so I think that's a big difference for us this time around, where we've made sure we have a really strong balance sheet entering this period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. You reported the first quarter a couple of weeks ago and you talked about slowing trends as the quarter progressed and also weaker results in April, as this younger consumer is pulling back. And this is what we hear across the industry, of course, as well. The big silver lining from the print in our view was that the net-adds of active customers continues to be really strong. And this was during the quarter when you pulled back in advertising. Can you talk about how do you see the composition of these new customers, full price versus clearance compared to last year, and just anything to call out in terms of LTV of these consumers versus your historic levels?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Definitely, as you say, like that was a great aspect of the quarter. We're really happy with that and along with the inventory rebalancing and the cash generation that the new customer adds were a great aspect of the quarter and for us, it just kind of further validation that there's just a general weakening going on in terms of what we saw from some of the customer cohorts, which I'd still say, are still performing actually better than even the pre-COVID period, but just kind of copying towards last year when the consumer is still going quite strong. So, yeah, we're really happy to see that.</p><p>And then there's couple drivers of it. One would be, certainly, we did have increased markdown product, which in general is not something we want, but there are periods, we have to deal with that. And so, that was helpful in driving new customer adds and then the other big thing that was helpful in driving new customer adds, which has been helpful for many quarters and is on a really nice growth trajectory is our beauty segment, which is still quite small compared to the rest of the business, but historically, it's been a great driver of new customer adds and that was a major source.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's great. And yeah, the beauty trends have definitely been pretty encouraging. Anything that you see regarding the churn of the customer base lately, how do you guys think about retention, and just the opportunities to continue to have her coming back to the site?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, definitely. So first of all, with retention, we think in terms of sort of higher strategic north stars of try to create the best experience for the consumer in the space. And if you do that well, your retention is generally going be good over time, there'll be certainly cycles where it's up or down, certainly in the depths of COVID was one of those down examples, but we did really well, but long-term, and historically, our retention numbers have been terrific. So, in terms of retention of these recent cohorts, we'll have to see how it plays out, historically markdown retention is slightly worse than full-price retention, but it's still quite great even in isolation, right?</p><p>I think most many companies would kill to have those retention numbers that we even have on the markdown in that segment. So we feel great about those adds and again, we've been through many business cycles before and we think every change is an opportunity even if within the short-term, there's is a little bit of pain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. As the inventory correction continues and you already made a lot of progress here in 1Q. And you're expecting more of a full-price business in the back half, right? How do you think about the net adds, as we go through the year, do you think there is a risk that more clearance consumer potentially drops off as the brand becomes less promotional, as again the inventories are [Indecipherable] in the back half of the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean there is certainly is a risk there. I mean, like that definitely will happen and you know it's overall a good thing is, as much as we'd like to have more new customer adds, we like having healthier inventory, even more so. We still expect that number to be positive through the year in terms of the active customers, but we do expect to see that number, new sellers be progressive as there's less markdown inventory available.</p><p>And of course, we'll have to see what happens economically. Obviously, it's the time and I guess, we've been seeing this for -- many people have been seeing it for a number of quarters now, but we -- it's certainly a time where the consumer gets weaker and so if that happens that will serve to protect our business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>And there has been definitely some evidence of an intensive promotional environment out there. I think across-the-board, if you look at the brands, if you look at the bigger players, department stores, etc, what are you seeing across the environment and as inventories are getting gradually rated which I think some of the bigger players are definitely making progress there, do you see any normalization in discounting quite yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean I think it depends on the segment. I think discounting has improved a bit in sort of the premium price points that Revolve operates at versus maybe a couple of quarters ago, but it's still elevated compared to what we might normally see. And then if you look kind of in the more the luxury price point, I think it's still quite elevated and we're not really seeing any kind of alleviation there in terms of the level of discount and other luxury players are doing.</p><p>So, I think that will take longer to play out and that's I think generally been true historically, it's actually a little bit more competitive just because those brand names on the merchandise are so strong and consumers on the smaller brand name versus the store that they buy from, in terms of the level of price competition we've seen the luxury space. So, Forward will be probably be impacted for a bit longer than Revolve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>And I think it's more of that aspirational consumer right that's been dropping off probably both at Revolve and Forward.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, definitely we've seen the higher-end consumer segments hold up a bit better than the more aspirational consumer briefly on Forward. But that said, we are seeing I'd say weakness across-the-board versus what we'd like to see and certainly versus early last year, which was still kind of part of that was COVID bull run, so but certainly greater weakness of the aspirational.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>The one exciting aspect recently was seeing the first AI-generated billboard campaign that came out last month, how else are you thinking about potential for AI across the brands?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah we're incredibly bullish and excited about it and you know, granted we're certainly technologists in heart, that's my background actually, computer engineering and we didn't talk about much on this call, but we certainly have in the past is how much of a technology-led organization we are kind of through and through, it runs in our DNA and how we go about things. So yeah we're incredibly excited and bullish and I don't get excited about every technology trends.</p><p>This one I'm quite excited about. The billboard campaign I think, perfect example of it being put to great practical use, where if you look at the speed we're able to put that campaign together. If you look at the cost, if you look at the accretive level and production level, we would not have been able to do that with traditional techniques on really any of those measures in the same way. And so it's really empowering there and as we look across the organization, it's really almost every aspect of the organization that has the potential to touch. In some areas, we are further along than others, and we've talked about how we've already been using it.</p><p>I'm various pleased on the website, whether it's kind of fraud detection or various kind of personalization algorithms, but the step-up in capabilities within the past 12 months on AI is just mind-boggling. And so for us continue to improve in those areas that I just mentioned, another big area that we're looking at with really great internal kind of initial results is on the fashion design side a sustained kind of in the design of products.</p><p>I would like -- I think in terms of search capabilities and different ways for the customer to browse the site again, we've seen some really incredible things internally that are quite ready for prime-time yet, but I really believe close and really just every aspect of the business. Again, it can touch whether it's assisting customer service, whether it's a kind of assisting the operational areas. So, we're excited about it, we're investing in it in a big way and we think it can be a -- provide a competitive advantage to the companies that are nimble and quick there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Do you think the inventory management could also benefit from that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>100%. Yeah, kind of, as I said, it's really hard for me to think of an area of the business that it does not have the potential and not just like one in a 1,000 chance, but like the reasonable potential to make it pretty big.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>We noticed there was a limited edition capsule launch as part of the AI campaign, can you talk about that and some of the learnings from that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we're really excited with that capsule launching, and again one of the learnings was certainly that it can be really powerful on the fashion design side. And in that case, we were just leveraging kind of creative art, right? So, it is more kind of leveraging it for the graphic arts with fashion design that includes graphic prints, but we felt like that capsule section was really strong. We're really pleased with the results.</p><p>But then for us, we're using it internally to do some really cool design things that go beyond just graphic prints and again, there's just a ton of potential. So, we're excited for the coming month, quarters and I'd only think we're talking years here in terms of the impact that it can make.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, terrific. I know driving overlap between the two brands Revolve and Forward is a pretty important initiative for the business. Can you talk about what you're seeing lately with that overlap any new initiatives to drive that further? I think on the last call you mentioned working on some navigation enhancements and inventory sharing between the two brands which was new.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, definitely. Yes, yes. So those are two key things that we introduced. I think from a consumer standpoint, the navigation is going to be quite critical in the coming months and quarters, just kind of bringing the websites a little bit closer together, again where it's much easier from the navigation for them kind of to cross back-and-forth between the two sites and there's more sort of graphical emphasis placed on that capability. So, we ran a test on that, we found that it was really positive results and success and we think that's going to [Indecipherable] going forward. From kind of an operational standpoint, really leveraging shared inventory capabilities, I think it's going to be important for maximizing efficiency.</p><p>So, those were two key additions and then another thing that we have, you know, in the works I think good chance of launching soon just within the Forward renew program, we think there is opportunity to bring that product to Revolve as well, which is I think not just an opportunity to expand the renew program itself, but again, just another one of those things that can bring Revolve and Forward closer to get in the consumers' eyes, which will allow us to tap into that. Quite minimal current overlap between Revolve and Forward, it's kind of mid-single digits at sort of 5% range. And we think over the long-term that it has the potential to be 50% plus in terms of the overlap. So it really has a long way to go.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>I actually, I wanted to follow up on Forward Renew as you're in a resale business now, which is definitely very interesting and timely. Can you talk about just any performance there and just making sure I heard this correctly, so you're thinking about a resale program for Revolve as well?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I would essentially be bringing the same program over with the Forward handbags in general, we think those are really great sell to the Revolve customer, and then certainly, if you're talking sort of the pre-owned handbags even more so. So, we think it's a natural fit. We want to do with similar branding. So again it just kind of brings those two sites together. So, it wouldn't necessarily be Revolve just completely separately also selling handbags, which is part of the same corporate program.</p><p>Yeah, we think that's a big opportunity and then renew it's still quite small, but we think it has a lot of momentum. Obviously the market there, it's huge the handbag market is huge. The pre-owned handbag market is huge. We've seen a lot of good early metrics there. And from a growth perspective, again off of a small base, but I think the most recent quarter was 50% plus quarter-over-quarter growth within that program. So, we're hopeful we can drive that much bigger places in the coming quarters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>And does it currently encompass only bags and would you consider, if yes, would you consider additional categories?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we would consider additional categories, we think bags are the easiest and most natural fit. So that's certainly where we'll start. There's other things like watches or certain accessories that I think are natural there too. I think it's less likely, it would be certainly in the short-term and even the mid-term that we would get into apparel categories and things like that. With the exception of special vintage pieces, right, that's certainly is kind of thing that we could bring in, something that's particularly special and unique. But in general sort of just the pre-owned apparel category more broadly, we're not looking to get into as big a way just because the economics are a little bit trickier there than I think with the handbags and some of that little bit of accessories.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Understood. Okay, terrific. I wanted to ask about the owned brands for the company, just update us where you are with that, how are the brand's performing and you just announced a new one -- a new collab with international influencer, Cindy Kimberly, just anything to call out with that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we're super-excited about the launch and in general, doing these influencers and celebrity collaborations are something that we wanted to do even more of it, it really combines two skill-sets that we are great at and obviously the brand marketing that we're known as kind of an innovator there and in connecting with these younger generations and then also kind of the buying and design side in terms of the capabilities, we're able to bring when partnering with the influencer to help create amazing designs, that our customers are going to love. So we're super-excited about that launch and we're looking to do more partnerships like that in the coming months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, terrific. Revolve pulled back on the number of events during the quarter, can you talk about how you're planning events as we go through '23 and just any update on the initiatives to reach and acquire customers today, obviously efficacy of marketing has become more choppy, you're one of the innovators for sure when it comes to using influencers, and you mentioned brand marketing is something Revolve is very strong at, so would love to hear your thoughts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>So. I wouldn't characterize it is as a pullback. The brand marketing cycle in particular has always come down to sort of timing of specific events and where we think there's opportunities and you also have to stay fresh and exciting and interesting with brand marketing. There are some things that are mainstays like Revolve Festival, we also try to mix things up every year. So last year we introduced some new events in first quarter, some of those were quite great including a super bowl party in LA. This year's super bowl wasn't in LA and we decided it might not have the same impact in Phoenix do that same party. So it's really just a timing issue, there are actually increased brand marketing activities in Q2 compared to Q1. So no pullback there and we're always looking to invest in the long-term through business cycles and certainly we view those brand marketing investments as long-term investments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, terrific. Can you talk about the category performance, we love that you guys disclosed fashion apparel and dresses and others. And those have been more difficult, just given the environment out there. And you also mentioned some of that going out categories now are softer and this is on top of very strong business in those categories last year, so what are you doing to re-energize demand in those categories, specifically within apparel?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Definitely, for us, we're all about going where the consumer is going and where the consumer is. So, obviously we always want our sales to be as high as possible in any quarter and in every category, as high as possible, but we're also disciplined, right? So if you look at this year versus last year, post-COVID there is just a huge movement going out in apparel and in dresses and things of that nature. A lot of pent-up demand, right, and things overshot a little bit and so as a comparison, it's relatively weaker this year versus last year, that's fine.</p><p>Wherever the consumer wants to go, the category she is interested and that is where we will go. So, it's I think can [Indecipherable] from like an analyst perspective, because obviously different companies index differently in those categories, but for us it's not anything we're trying to force, we're happy to provide the consumer whatever that she is looking for.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>And how big do you think the beauty category can get to the business? I know it's a relatively new initiative, typically high gross margin type of a category and it has been doing well and it's very additive, right, in building baskets, just curious any thoughts on that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so over the long-term, we would look to drive beauty to call it 10% plus of the business and we are kind of looking at what, players in this space that have had a multi-decade head start on us, have been able to do with categories like that and that will be our goal there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Anything specific to call out about just the performance there. Is this a new customer to Revolve coming in, do you see it more as existing customers adding to baskets, just curious about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no, it's both. And that is one of the reason, we love the category so much, it's really great for bringing in new customers because there are so many different products and brand names you can carry that can help introduce someone to Revolve and then it's also great with existing customers in terms of increasing basket size and cross-shopping capability and yeah, a lot of things going on in beauty. We think we've done quite well with what we have and we know we're missing a lot of key pieces, there is a number of key brands that we're missing.</p><p>And we feel like we're making good progress behind the scenes, increase in that assortment, getting those brands in and we're very hopeful that's going to happen over time. From just a capability standpoint, we know we have work to do in terms of the various tools and the way we present those products to the customer on the website, our focus has been apparel. And so we're going to be making investments there, so and then, obviously I think from a brand perspective continuing to invest in the right brand messages to make consumers think more of Revolve.</p><p>First, over time, when they're thinking about beauty versus right now we have some decent beauty share, but offer a lot of our customers, we're certainly not their number-one place to go for beauty and we have to create investments and marketing messages that will change over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, okay, no terrific. That makes sense. You guys are still expecting, I think a modest increase in AOV for the year. Can you talk about how you think about that, is that going to be driven more by units, we mentioned the beauty category seeing momentum. So that's probably part of it or do you think it's more about improving average unit retail in the back half as the business becomes less promotional?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>So that projection is more centered around improving average unit retail, which we think should happen as the year progresses and as the inventory position.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, okay, makes sense. Switching gears to margins. The one big positive takeaway from the brand was re-calibrating of the inventory position, while improving the cash flow for the business as well. Can you talk about how you feel about inventories by brand, Revolve and Forward and just any categories that the brands are still longing at the moment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so we could have been made, a lot more progress on the Revolve side, the Revolve inventory is in a fairly good place and certainly, I'd like to hit in the great place, but I think compared to where we were a couple of quarters ago Revolve is in a really nice place right now. So and again sort of trends there are looking really good for the business. For Forward, it's a bit behind Revolve and I kind of mentioned that -- alluded that maybe from a competitive standpoint.</p><p>And then just different dynamics in the luxury realm. Again, there can be increased discounting when things turn a bit and then also, it can just take a little bit longer for the cycle to the inventory, because the turns are naturally slower than it looks. So that will take a few more quarters. The Forward inventory isn't quite as healthy as the Revolve segment, but we certainly been through this many times over operating the business for up to 20 years. So, we're confident we can get that inventory to a good place, it might just take a few more quarters and evolve[Phonetic].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, but all in, should we still be expecting inventories to be more in line with the sales, I think you said starting in the back half of the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, exactly, yeah. I think we said on the call that's kind of end of Q2, we felt like we should be in a fairly modest one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, it makes sense. Return rates have edged up for the business. And going back to the call it sounded like there is a bigger strategic focus now for Revolve to effect that without compromising the consumer experience and we thought that was a pretty big deal for Revolve potentially going forward. Could you talk about what that means and do you think there are any investments that are necessary to see that and what would be the rough timing for the company to effect, because obviously return rates are pretty important?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, 100%. Yes, so return rates have always been quite important for the business, but it hasn't been as big a focus the past, call it, three years, particularly 2020 and 2021, there were bigger things that we're focused on and also return rates were depressed in that period, but certainly, with the recent increase it has a meaningful impact on the financials of the business as we see. So, it's a huge area of focus. I'd say prior to the current period. Again, there was -- if there is a little bit of effort, but nothing major -- no major initiative within the organization.</p><p>When I say investments, I don't mean large capital expenditures, but there are things that have the potential at the margins, affect profitability in near term, but I think long-term dividends will be paid over time. When I say investments are mostly talking organizational time and focus as well as kind of R&amp;D efforts, because the one thing with return rates is aside from maybe putting some things in place on high-returning customers that maybe a little bit kind of lower-hanging fruit in more tangible. It is a little bit more R&amp;D in nature in that the ideas are more speculative, but the things we have cooking, I think look really good, as I'm very hopeful that we're going to have some ideas that can hit in a really nice way which the nice thing is, if we have success there it really impacts business twofold and not only do you get better operational margins, but you also get a revenue boost as your net becomes a higher percentage of the growth. So big focused and important, we're hopeful in the coming quarters we'll have some nice things to share there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Some companies in this space have seen success using restocking fees. Of course, not something that the consumer loves, but at the same time may be unnecessary evil in this environment, is that something that Revolve would consider? Not to put you on the spot..</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no, I'm just trying to think of the right way to sort of respond to it. We certainly already have a version of that in kind of extreme cases. But in general, I don't love talking to [Speech Overlap] in general, where I want the organization's time and focus is on these win-win things, so I think there are some things, we can do the margins on some of those higher-return rate customers, but for me it's about building long-term value versus short-term number and I want to help our customer. And so that's what I emphasized, we work on this is really to help the customer, not to penalize them. I think we keep that Northstar in mind, we're going to come up with really good one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Okay, terrific. We look forward to hearing about that for sure, because that's a big deal. One interesting thing also you mentioned was cost-savings from shipping and logistics initiatives as you guys are doing some work when it comes to logistics, can you provide some more color on that and when do you think that might manifest as a positive impact to profitability?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Definitely. So, on the earnings call, I think we mentioned some directional goals in terms of the number of basis points we could scrub shave on a run-rate basis by the end of the year. I think also if you look at our implied guidance, and it's going to include some reductions there. So we have a number of things that we're working on, the full list is actually quite long, it's -- call it, dozens of things that we're working on. But broadly, I'd maybe put things into three or so different categories, the one would be thing to kind of optimize our carrier utilization for making sure we just had the right carrier, making sure we're negotiating with carriers in the right way, and in some cases switching carriers, particularly on the international side, we have opportunity then, I think even on the domestic side, in some cases, that's one area we're working on.</p><p>Another area we're working on is just, call it, sort of logistics optimization and location optimization. So, the East Coast Pennsylvania warehouse is one of the things in that bucket and that's much closer to operating at full capacity today than it was even call it two months ago. So, we're hopeful that's going to provide some leverage on the bottom line. There's other things I'd put in that bucket as well. We're actively pursuing a re-fulfillment center in Europe to help save on those costs. And as we scale, that's the kind of costs that should scale as our business scales there. And then we're working on other things as well like a direct line hauls is something that we're looking into, a lot of promising early results. So it's a host of things I mentioned returns has been a prime focus in the business, optimizing these logistics and distribution costs is a prime focus as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Have you guys said what the timeframe might be for the European fulfillment center?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I don't think we've committed to a specific timeframe, but I'd say that project is moving along. But at this point, I don't want to commit to a specific time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, okay, understood. On international, you reported pretty strong results there and you talked about, newer markets like India and also with China reopening. Could you talk about what are you seeing in more established markets, the macro picture, I think continues to be still pretty difficult in Europe just curious what you're seeing there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, definitely, in kind of established Western markets and developed markets, we're seeing a similar -- a pretty similar picture to the US where the consumer demand is softer and those markets aren't doing as well as we'd like so, Western Europe, Australia and places like that, we're definitely seeing soft demand trends, but the international actually had great growth for the quarter as a whole. And it's because actually that's offset by a lot of these developing and emerging markets, some of which you just have great growth to begin with for us, but then also many of them are -- haven't been as impacted by the current global economic situation.</p><p>So, areas like the Middle-East, Latin-America we saw really strong strength, Mexico in particular was quite exciting, because it has grown to a fairly large base. It's actually become our fifth biggest country internationally and is growing, I think what we said on the call, but I think call it close to triple-digits, I can't recall if its more than triple-digits or close to -- or call it close to triple-digits. So, great growth there, really great growth. India is still quite small, but still I believe growing at, call it, 400%, so again off of a small base, but quite exciting growth there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>What is the brand awareness look like in some of those countries for Revolve and very interesting your comments on mix, just curious?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so actually Latin-America in general we have really strong brand awareness. And so certain regions of Latin-America logistics are quite challenging. In long term, that's still like to unlock like Brazil, for example from our brand perspective has lot of potential for us, but we haven't really been able to unlock things from a logistics standpoint, there the tariffs are just outrageous shipping in products.</p><p>Mexico is kind of a sweet-spot where it's a large market, it actually has our second-largest, call it, social following among international regions in the world. Our logistics are decent there, we're working on making them even better. So it's really, I think, those two pieces coming together in a nice way that are generating the growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, understood. We've got a question from an investor. So you've made a lot of progress with the inventories and I think the low end of your gross margin implies some nice improvement, I think 100 basis points plus in the back-half and easier compares of course, a part of that, but how do you think about the promotional intensity, whether it's for Revolve or for the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean, I think when the consumer is not in his healthier place and also when there's broad discounting across-the-board, it does have impact on both our businesses, we -- I'd like to see -- and we'd like to say and we've certainly seen historically that Revolve is a bit less susceptible to what any particular competitor is doing at any given point in time at all, Revolve has a lot of [Technical Issues] around it, but when there's mass discounting, it definitely affects our consumers' mindset and there can be softness on the full-price, so I think that will continue to be a drag throughout the year, despite that we expect we will be healthier inventory position margins to improve significantly. Certainly from the first quarter and so again, we've been through a number of cycles and you just have to play the cycle as it comes in and set yourself up for a great growth on the other side.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Right, definitely. The one unique thing about Revolve relative to the industry. So, you've maintained profitability, you continued to generate strong cash flows. How do you think about potential for M&amp;A valuations have certainly compressed and the buyback, and how do you balance those two thoughts?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean it's tricky, we take being stewards of capital and people's investments very very seriously, another thing we'd like to say I think very relevant always is that Michael Mente and I are the two largest investors in Revolve and nearly half the company, so when I see that cash on the balance sheet, it's our investor's cash, it's our cash and I wanted to do the best thing with it. So, I think, as always, we're going be thoughtful, we're going to be disciplined. It's really tough to say what the best use of that cash is going to be, but it's certainly something that we're actively thinking about as it continues to accumulate, just how do we use it and maybe to add the most value to our shareholders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so if that makes sense. We have just a few minutes remaining. Just wanted to ask you, so what are you most excited about as we go through the year, lots of initiatives, of course, longer-term, near term still continue to be a little murky, just curious on your thoughts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Karanikolas:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, definitely. I mean I think one of the things I'm most excited about is actually the opportunity to navigate this period. You know, certainly, it might be a bit more challenging economically, but what we've seen in the past is, as I kind of mentioned in my earlier comments is, it's really time for companies like us to shine and time for us to pull away from the pack, particularly as we get on the other end of the business. So, as it is often said, when times get tough, a lot of companies that weren't focused on the right things, they struggle or in order to survive, they have to cripple themselves in some way.</p><p>And so, for us, I'm happy that I think it's a great period for us to get recognition for our business model, where we've delivered growth and profitability so consistently over the years for a number of years investors focus mostly on growth, we delivered both, so yes so I'm excited. It's a great for this business model to shine. I think on the other side of this, it can be a really fruitful opportunity for us. And then beyond that in terms of active things, we're working on within the business, certainly, the return rates is a challenge, but I'm incredibly excited about it as well because it's something we haven't thought about in a big way in a number of years and as we start thinking about it, realizing there's so much opportunity there.</p><p>And then the other thing I touched on earlier in the call, I know it's a buzzword right now and I generally hate buzzwords but I love it, and yeah, no, not just from a conceptual standpoint, but more importantly from a business standpoint. I think it's incredibly exciting -- it's I think an exciting time to live right now in terms of seeing how things are going to change over the coming quarters and coming years. So we're certainly excited about that as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Andreeva:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, well, perfect. It's a perfect way to end on this note. Thank you so much, Mike, and thank you to everyone for listening.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-a518f1b58de359a598fc27e3d2b8d788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTK-K4C3-RS2G-J41T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6333\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 18, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0006X9L</classCode><className>NEEDHAM &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000542</classCode><className>ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000342</classCode><className>COMPANY STRATEGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CP14</classCode><className>CONFERENCE CALLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTlBNzg2RkI1QzZDNDRBM0FCMzYyNDFGMEFBMEEzNTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTIyODNBNjBDNUE4NDYzNDlENzlCMEZENTY3RUVCQkI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>State Regulation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTE1NzVGNUUyQzExNDNCNEEwNzIyNzQ0RjM1NTlEOTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTIyODNBNjBDNUE4NDYzNDlENzlCMEZENTY3RUVCQkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

My name is Sameera, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vermilion Energy Q2 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]</p><p>Thank you. Mr. Dion Hatcher, you may begin your conference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Sameera. Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. I'm Dion Hatcher, President of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars Glemser, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerwin, Vice President, International and HSE; Bryce Kremnica, Vice President, North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p><p>We will be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss our Q2 2022 results and our return of capital framework we announced this morning. Presentation can be found on our website under Invest with Us and Events and Presentations. Please refer to our advisory on forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today, and outlines the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>As shown on Slide 2, we delivered another quarter with record fund flows of CAD453 million and record free cash flow of CAD340 million, which is over CAD2 a share. That's up 16% and 12%, respectively from the previous quarter. The increase was mainly driven by strong commodity prices, as global oil prices and North American gas prices were strengthened during the quarter. European gas prices remained strong in Q2 and relatively consistent with the prior quarter with TTF in excess of CAD38 per mmbtu. Over the past several months, European gas forward prices have nearly doubled, which will bode well for Vermilion. I will review the fundamental drivers for this later in my presentation.</p><p>Production during Q2 averaged 84,868 BOEs a day, which is down slightly from the previous quarter, mainly due to planned and unplanned downtime. Key notable event during the quarter was the closing of the Leucrotta acquisition on May 31. We have successfully integrated the Leucrotta assets and assembled a Mica asset team, which is now focused on completing a six-well pad that was drilled in Q2. We're excited to have these high-quality assets in our portfolio, and look forward to scaling up our development. The Leucrotta acquisition was mostly funded by free cash flow generated in the quarter. As a result, net debt increased only slightly in Q2, CAD1.6 billion. However, our net debt to fund flow ratio decreased to 1.1 times as a result of our increasing fund flows from operations. We remain on track to achieve our next debt target of CAD1.2 billion by the end of 2022. With this clear line of sight, we are pleased to outline our return of capital framework.</p><p>Before I get into the details of our return of capital framework, Slide 3 reviews some of the key strategic objectives we accomplished over the last two [Phonetic] years that will position Vermilion to deliver very strong returns over the long term. These objectives were part of the strategic plan we developed during the 2020 downturn.</p><p>Our Number 1 financial priority was to reduce debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We have reduced debt by approximately CAD1 billion relative to Q2 2020 by the end of this year, while also funding over CAD1 billion of strategic acquisitions without issuing any equity. We increased our international weighting in European gas exposure through the Corrib acquisition, which we expect to close in Q4 this year. Our international assets now represent over a third of our production base and contribute approximately two-thirds of our fund flow and free cash flow. This international diversification is what differentiates Vermilion from our peers.</p><p>We reinstated a base dividend in Q1 of this year. And today, we're excited to announce a 33% increase in our Q3 quarterly dividend to CAD0.08 per share. The dividend is very resilient at less than 3% of our fund flows and leaves ample room for ratable increases over time. We completed Leucrotta acquisition in Q2 as Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory, which will further enhance our free cash flow profile and underpin our long-term return on capital.</p><p>And finally, we said that we would increase our return of capital when we achieved the line of sight to our CAD1.2 billion mid-cycle debt target. With less than two quarters remaining in 2022 and robust outlook for 2023, let me now return -- review return of capital framework on Slide 4. Vermilion has a long history of returning capital to its shareholders. In the past, this has been primarily through base dividends, which we've delivered over CAD40 a share.</p><p>Going forward, base dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework. However, we want to ensure the base dividend is resilient over the long term through the commodity cycles, while allowing for ratable increases over time where they placed a burden on our business or the balance sheet. With this philosophy in mind, we plan to limit the annual base dividend outlay to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle fund flows. For reference, this would equate to approximately CAD100 million based on the current asset base, but could increase if our asset base grows or we see a fundamental shift in our mid-cycle commodity price assumptions.</p><p>In conjunction with our Q2 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 quarterly dividend to CAD0.08 per share. This equates to an annual dividend of CAD0.32 per share or approximately CAD53 million based on the current number of shares outstanding. At this dividend per share level, we have the capacity to increase the base dividend, and we look forward to provide ratable increases over time.</p><p>With our debt approaching target levels, we will pivot from allocating free cash flow for debt reduction to the return of capital. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a core principle of Vermilion and we will remain focused on that going forward. We plan to enhance our return of capital to shareholders going forward, while continuing to reduce debt to a target of CAD850 million by the end of 2023, which implies approximately another CAD350 million of further debt reduction beyond our year-end 2022 target. It also implies we will be undrawn on our CAD1.6 billion credit facility, leaving just our termed U.S. notes outstanding.</p><p>The amount of free cash flow available for return of capital will increase, as debt levels decrease based on the illustrative grid outlined of Slide 4. The grid is not intended to be prescriptive quarter to quarter, but will be used as a tool to guide near-term return of capital allocation decisions, while taking into account other capital requirements such as further debt reduction, asset retirement obligations and acquisitions. As you can see from this grid and near-term debt targets I discussed, a significant portion of our future free cash flow will be available to the return to shareholders. Based on our return on capital allocation grid, recent commodity strip and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of free cash flow in the second half of 2022 and up to 50% to 75% of free cash flow in 2023, while achieving our debt targets.</p><p>Our goal is to return capital in the most beneficial method to shareholders. We will consider various options to return capital, including share buybacks to the normal course issuer bid, regular and special dividends, and as potential substantial issuer bid. Based on our review of a number of data points, we will initially allocate the vast majority of this capital return to share buybacks.</p><p>Given the structural improvements in our business, combined with the strong fundamental outlook for global commodities, we believe Vermilion is very well positioned to generate significant free cash flow in the years ahead. However, we do not believe this value proposition is accurately reflected in our share price today, and therefore, at this time, we view share buybacks as the most compelling use of free cash flow that will benefit long-term shareholders.</p><p>In early July, we announced the approval of our normal course issuer bid for the purchase of up to 16 million common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for CAD35 million. As it reduces our share count, this will also enhance our ability to increase the base dividend while adhering to our annual dollar limit of 10% mid-cycle fund flows. We look forward to providing continued updates on our return of capital initiatives through the second half of this year and through 2023, as we carefully weigh capital allocation decisions against various uses of excess free cash flow with a view of acting in the long-term interests of our shareholders.</p><p>Slide 5 is from an Investor Relations presentation, where we provide an updated financial outlook for 2022 based on the actuals to date and our estimates for the balance of the year using the current commodity strip. As you can see, on a pro forma basis, including the full-year impact from the Corrib acquisition, we are forecasting pro forma fund flows of CAD2.4 billion and free cash flow of CAD1.8 billion or approximately CAD11 per share. We also show our year-end debt target at CAD1.2 billion, which incorporates the return of upwards of 25% of free cash flow in the second half of this year. We have not yet provided any formal guidance for 2023, but if you assume production has held flat at our exit rate forecast of 95,000 BOEs a day to 100,000 BOEs a day, today and you honor the backwardation in the commodity price forward strips, we are looking generating similar amounts of free cash flow in 2023, which is consistent with the analyst estimates.</p><p>As outlined on Slide 6, looking at our cumulative free cash flow over a three-year period from 2022 through 2024, assuming flat production from existing asset base and applying the forward pricing, we expect Vermilion to generate over CAD5 billion of free cash flow over this time, representing by the blue bars.</p><p>This amount of free cash flow is equal to our current market capitalization. The gray bars show the cumulative free cash flow we currently plan to allocate to debt reduction. And as you can see, the majority of the free cash flow was allocated to debt reduction in 2022, including the funding of over CAD1 billion of acquisitions, whereas for 2023 and '24, we will pivot and majority of the free cash flow will be available for return of capital to shareholders now that we have a much stronger balance sheet.</p><p>As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, the fundamentals for European gas are very strong. Slide 7 shows historical pricing of European gas and Asian LNG, which have traded in the similar band since 2015, compared to the Canadian benchmark price of April. The blue bars represent the average premium that Vermilion receives on its total gas sales relative to April. This premium was approximately CAD6 an mmcf in 2021, and is forecast to be approximately CAD19 in 2022. We also show the forward pricing for the balance of 2022 and 2023, which has increased significantly from historical levels.</p><p>Second half 2022 TTF is CAD75 per mmbtu, and 2023 is now over CAD70 per mmbtu. For every dollar increase in Euro gas prices, this adds in an incremental CAD37 million of fund flows to Vermilion on an annual unhedged basis. Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people and our hope is that a negotiated settlement can be achieved quickly. The tragic events in Ukraine are undoubtedly contributing to the price increase, however, the underlying fundamental drivers for high European gas prices were in place prior to the invasion.</p><p>Chart on Slide 8 shows the 2023 and 2024 forward price for TTF and how much it has increased since the beginning of the year. The calendar year 2023 TTF price has increased from under CAD20 at the beginning of the year to over CAD60 today. This will have a significant impact on Vermilion's fund flows in 2023, and we have been adding more European hedges in 2023 in recent weeks. We believe the structural drivers will be supportive for European gas prices for many years to come. Europe consumes approximately 45 Bcf a day to 50 Bcf a day of natural gas with approximately 40% of that being supplied from Russia in 2021.</p><p>With recent events, the EU is now trying to significantly reduce its dependence on Russian gas. EU recognized natural gas as a transition fuel, which really will help facilitate the permitting and development of domestic supplies over time as countries increase use of natural gas for power generation. Examples of this transition include Germany shutting down nuclear and accelerating a phase out of coal from 2038 to 2030, and Ireland committing to build nine gas fired power generators by 2024.</p><p>With domestic supply in Europe continuing to decline, the only viable option to replace Russian gas is to increase LNG imports, but there is limited new LNG supply coming on the market prior to 2025 and 2026. These new projects require significant and longer-term contracts, significant capital. So in order to attract LNG to Europe, buyers need to compete with Asian, which is driving European gas prices even higher. Short-term, we expect Asian LNG demand to increase as they look to build inventories prior to this winter, but more importantly, mid to longer-term Asian demand for LNG is forecast to significantly increase.</p><p>As I mentioned, we are starting to layer in more 2023 European gas hedges to lock in some of our fund flows at these higher prices. As shown on Slide 9, since our last update, we have increased our 2023 Euro gas hedge position from 32% to 45%. Those recent hedges were executed primarily with wide collars with an average floor of about CAD40 and ceiling of about CAD70. Through the higher gas prices, we may further increase our 2023 Euro gas hedge position to 60% to lock in even more fund flows. At the corporate level, given our low debt levels and current outlook, we tend on keeping our total hedge percentage at the lower end of our target range of 25% to 50%, which will leave us with the exposure to sustain higher oil prices.</p><p>Going back to our Q2 results, we have provided a brief summary of our operational highlights on Slide 10 and 11. Most notable activity in our international operations in Q2 was our offshore drilling program in Australia. This program was scheduled to start early in the second quarter, but was delayed approximately one month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on a third-party contracted rig. During routine inspection prior to moving the rig to our location, the operator identified some maintenance requirements and had to mobilize the rig to Singapore for repairs. We commenced drilling late in the second quarter and drilling operations are progressing, although the delay did result some deferred production and higher cost. We expect to finish drilling in early September and will start the wells shortly thereafter.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet quarter in Europe, as the teams focused their efforts on preparing for our second half 2022 drilling campaign, which will include two wells in the Netherlands, three wells in Hungry and two wells in Croatia. Subsequent to the quarter, a forest fire near our Cazaux field in southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 barrels of production being temporarily shut-in. Our staff in France worked closely with emergency responders to ensure the safety and security of our employees, our contractors and installations, ensuring there were no HSE incidents. We are in the process of making necessary repairs and bringing this production back online. However, this will have an impact on our France production in the second half of 2022.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet quarter in Canada, as drilling and completion activities in West Central Alberta, Southeast Saskatchewan was limited during the second quarter due to spring breakup. Following the announcement of the Leucrotta acquisition in late March, we assembled our Mica asset team and focused on integrating the assets and working closely with the Leucrotta team in drilling the first six-well Montney pad. Drilling was successfully completed during the second quarter, and the team is now focused on completion activities that is progressing as per plan.</p><p>In the U.S., we drilled four wells of our planned six operated Turner wells, and completed two wells during the second quarter. One well was brought on production during the second quarter where the remaining wells will be completed and brought on production during the third quarter. Overall results today are in line with expectations. Subsequent to the quarter, we successfully executed drilling and completion activities on three -- two mile laterals, which are significantly more economics than the one mile laterals.</p><p>Moving to Slide 12. Our Q3 2022 capital program is well underway, and in Europe, we will start our drilling campaign later this month and continue through the fourth quarter. As mentioned, the forest fire here in Cazaux field in Southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 barrels a day of production being temporarily shut-in, and we expect to have most of it back online by the end of the year.</p><p>Looking at our Q3 production forecast, we will benefit from a full quarter contribution from the Leucrotta acquisition and new production from the U.S., Southeast Saskatchewan drilling programs, partially offset by the Australia drilling program delay and fire-related downtime in France. Taking all this into account, we expect Q3 production to be in line with Q2.</p><p>As a result of the forest fire-related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by CAD50 million to CAD550 million. We are maintaining our annual production guidance of 86,000 to 88,000 [Phonetic], excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes. We plan to update our production guidance once we have greater certainty on the timing of the Corrib close, which we expect to occur in Q4. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 BOEs a day to 100,000 BOEs a day, including Corrib acquisition bonds remains unchanged.</p><p>Before we open it up for Q&amp;A, I want to make some closing remarks on our upcoming leadership changes. As we announced earlier this year, Vermilion's Executive Chairman and Co-founder, Lorenzo Donadeo will be retiring from the Company effective September 1. Lorenzo was instrumental in creating what Vermilion is today along with creating significant value for our shareholders during his tenure. On behalf of the whole organization, I would like to thank Lorenzo for his leadership and guidance of the Company over the 27 years. You will be greatly missed by everyone at Vermillion. But if anyone deserves a long, happy and fulfilling retirement, it is Lorenzo. We wish you all the best, and look forward to providing a regular quarterly updates as a meaningful shareholder of Vermilion for many years to come.</p><p>As previously announced, Mr. Bob Michaleski will assume the role of Independent Chairman on Lorenzo's departure. Bob has 41 years of experience and oversaw Pembina's pipeline transformation from a [Phonetic] Alberta-based oil company into one of North America's leading integrated energy transition service companies. He served as the President and CEO of Pembina for 13 years. He joined Vermilion Board in 2016, and was appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee in 2020. Vermilion's executive committee structure will continue and will fill the role -- we will fill the role of the Chief Executive Officer. It will be led by myself and will include all the existing members.</p><p>Well, that concludes my prepared remarks. Well, with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Menno Hulshof with TD Securities. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a question on Corrib. If we assume that it does close, what is your best guess in terms of the purchase price net of accrued free cash flow? We've run some numbers on this end and our estimate is very low, but any thoughts here would be helpful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Menno. I'm going to pass it over to Lars to address that one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, good morning, Menno. I think you're thinking about it the right way in terms of cash to close at December 31 of this year from a modeling perspective and then obviously full access to the cash flows in 2023. I think the number that is good to use for year-end this year would be a purchase price of CAD100 million to CAD150 million, if it were to close at the end of 2022. And that would be inclusive of the contingent payment that is in the money for 2023, which was $25 million. So I think that's the best way to model it and a good way in terms of how you're thinking about it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Terrific. Yeah. Thanks, Lars. And then on acquisitions, in the past, you've talked about smaller Euro gas packages potentially becoming available, and I know there's -- there are limits to what you can say here, but like at a high level, what are the boxes that need to be checked to pull the trigger on -- in other Euro package? And do you see these opportunities being able to compete with buybacks at the current share price?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thanks, Menno. I'll pass it back to Lars to address what we're thinking about that relative to our return of capital framework.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks, Dion. And maybe I'll just rewind a little bit Menno with the return of capital grid, what we really wanted to do was shift focus back to the CAD11 per share of free cash flow that we're generating. Dion mentioned CAD1.8 billion of free cash flow in 2022, that's on a pro forma basis. That's probably not a bad proxy to think about free cash flow for 2023.</p><p>And then what the return of capital grid is going to do is create discipline in terms of where we are allocating capital. There's flexibility in there in terms of how we return capital. At this point in time, we'll be doing it through share buybacks. And as importantly, in terms of acquisitions, when it comes to North America, nothing big. We think that we have done the heavy lifting in terms of hydrating the inventories here in North America. It'll be more tuck-in bolt-ons in terms of our existing position within North America.</p><p>And then Europe, I think we've had good success, a good track record there of making acquisitions. Now that those acquisitions will continue to compete with returning capital to shareholders, we will be looking for I'd call it, deep value type opportunities in Europe as we move forward here. Some acquisition -- sorry, some announcements have been made in the past in terms of potential opportunities in jurisdictions like Netherlands, but again, it's going have to be competitive in terms of where we return capital.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>We'll take our next question from Greg Pardy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the rundown, Dion and Lorenzo, just all the very best in your -- I guess it's your second shot at your retirement. Couple -- maybe just -- one maybe modeling question is, what kind of book tax rates should we sort of think about on a consolidated basis? And Lars, I want to ask that -- just that tax question. Is it still, I don't know, 11%, 12% or so pre-tax?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so I think for 2022, and I'll sort of correlate these tax rates to the pro forma numbers. So we're referencing CAD2.4 billion of cash flow for 2022. In the context of that, 10% to 11% is still a good way to think about it, Greg. For 2023, I would say that rate has gone up in the context of current strip pricing. I would sort of peg it at 13% to 15% for full-year 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. What about book sort of like 30%-odd or so just as a book tax rate?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Sorry. Could you repeat that, Greg?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, just your book tax rate. What would you sort of be thinking? I know you're giving me the cash taxes, but just as a book tax rate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So I think a good way to think about it is in the 30% range.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. And maybe just sort of related to Menno's question. With Europe now kind of thinking very differently about gas as a transition fuel as you mentioned, are there -- are policymakers or governments now starting to come to you as one of the longstanding developers in Europe in terms of just encouraging domestic supply growth as opposed to just relying upon imports?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Greg, I'll take this one. I think what's happening when you look over the last several quarters with crisis, I believe it is an energy crisis in Europe. The policy makers have triaged their approach with -- starting with LNG, which is material albeit at longer timelines. Next, there's been discussions around offshore, and that leads us to your question around onshore. And so, yes, we are having continued engagement in both Netherlands and Germany in particular, questions that would be framed around what could Vermilion as an operator of some of those jurisdictions for decades be able to offer with increased activity.</p><p>What we've done? We always focus on what we can control. So we've added staff in both Netherlands and Germany, technical staff to be able to prepare for higher levels of activity. I would caution that timelines are longer in Europe. And so, the time from a conversation to action and drills, it's longer, but I would say, it's encouraging and somewhat logical that you would see some increased activity associated with the current situation and need for more domestic supply from responsible producers like Vermilion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Pardy:</emphasis></p><p>Terrific. Thanks very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>And we'll take our next question from Patrick O'Rourke with ATB Capital. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick O'Rourke:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, guys. Good morning, and congratulations to Lorenzo. Obviously, a long and well story career here at Vermilion, so appreciative all of your work. Guys, maybe just to build on Greg's question there, you talked about sort of the regulatory regime and timelines in Europe. As we get into the 2023 budgeting cycle and as you look at the portfolio, sort of what are the other hurdles to bringing on production in Europe? Where could you allocate capital to sort of capture this windfall gas price that we're seeing over there in sort of the quickest manner? Is it in the Netherlands? Is it in the CEE? What are sort of the infrastructure constraints? I don't think that you would have any in the Netherlands there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thanks, Patrick. I think, first of all, the acquisition with Corrib to bring on that 7,700 BOE a day is probably the most impactful thing that in hindsight was very well timed and are excited to close that at the end this year. So again that's 7,700 BOEs there. From an organic point of view, we're focused on every BU to look for opportunities. I think in Germany, we do have a deep inventory of drilling prospects. That, again, we've added resources back to look at some of the more, I would say larger targets, but a little more higher risk. So that's something we're reviewing. CEE is an area once we get these permits in place like SA-10, we're able to follow through and drill wells in shorter timelines. And then Netherlands, we used to drill four to six wells in Netherlands. We're drilling two in the second half of this year or so. Our view would be less work back to those higher levels of activities.</p><p>So I would say all jurisdictions. Netherlands does have the potential to increase activity as well as Germany. We drilled three wells earlier this year, and we're looking at on the gas side what we might be able to do in late 2023 and into 2024. So quite excited to be having those conversations. And again, our near-term focus is getting more staff in those to be used to be able to react, once it aligns with the regulatory framework to be able to put more capital into those business units.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick O'Rourke:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then maybe shifting over to the return of capital framework here, and in particular the dividend. You guys referred to ratable dividend increases, the pro forma math that we have on today's dividend increase with sort of the sub-4% of 2023 free cash flow. So I wonder in terms of -- maybe you can provide some goal posts around what you mean with respect to ratable and also sort of the cadence or review period like how frequently you plan to review the dividend going forward here?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>I'll pass that one to Lars to talk about our thoughts on the base dividend.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, thanks, Patrick. The way we have framed the base dividend component is not -- look to not exceed 10% of our cash flows at mid-cycle pricing. And I think that's some discipline that we want to continue to have in the business to ensure that that base dividend is resilient. Based on our current numbers with the increase today, we're about CAD50 million to fund the increased dividend that we did announce today. So that is where there is ample room to continue increasing that and still be in line with our -- not to exceed 10%.</p><p>Now in terms of the cadence or how we will do that, I would say, at this point, we're looking for ratable type increases over time. We think that also with the return of capital framework that we announced today, there is flexibility in terms of how we return that capital. The base dividend will be one mechanism that we use or one medium that we use. It will not be the majority of capital that will be returned through that. So that's where we have flexibility in terms of share buybacks, variable dividend, special dividends. We will err towards buybacks at this point in time, just based on the data points that we're reviewing, where we think capital is best allocated. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of clarity in terms of the fixed based dividend will be one component of a return to capital, but we truly want to make sure that that base dividend is fixed and resilient in prices that are much lower than what we're seeing today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick O'Rourke:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Josef Schachter with Schachter Energy Research. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, everyone. And thanks so much for taking my question. In Europe, we're seeing a lot of demand management, UK talking about preparing for blackouts, Germany telling certain industries you may get cut back certain percentages of gas, assuming the Russians are aggressive in terms of cutting back. Is there anything going on, on the supply management side where they're asking you to hold back and put into storage near consuming areas gas to bring on later? Or if you have new wells coming on, bring them on close to the winter. Is there any supply management stuff going on that would impact Vermilion in Q3, Q4 and into Q1 of next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Josef. I'll take that one. Quick answer is no. We're selling all the gas that we're producing, and there's no discussions around us storing or restricting our production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Good, thanks. That's it. Thanks for me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Josef.</p><p>With that, I think that we have no more questions. So I guess, Sameera, we would like to thank everyone again for participating in our Q2 conference call and look forward to future updates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-423e00cae8f15ab5b7e1b5e3daa12aa7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB1-CR53-RTH9-W3Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 AlphaStreet Inc.

About a decade ago, these bodies became increasingly concerned about the rising economic and financial risks from climate change, and the fact that the financial system lacked the information, tools, and markets to manage them. For example, although the Bank of England oversees the world's largest international financial center, including the world's fourth largest insurance sector and the largest reinsurance market, Lloyds of London, we realized that the system did not have access to clear, consistent, and decision-useful information on climate risks.</p><p>Recognizing this was a global challenge, in 2015, the G20 Presidency tasked the Financial Stability Board with assessing the financial stability risks from climate change. Over the following years, a wide range of regulatory authorities and private financial institutions have worked to develop the fundamental building blocks the financial system needs to begin to manage climate-related risks on behalf of their depositors, pensioners, clients and shareholders. This is leading to better climate-related financial disclosure, stress tests and transition planning. Many leading financial institutions are improving their climate risk management and channeling capital to make companies more competitive through investments to reduce their emissions.</p><p>However, while the pace of change has picked up, it is not yet commensurate with the scale of the challenge in America or globally. Due to the undiversifiable nature of climate risks, governments will bear many of the costs of extreme weather and adaptation. Moreover, the longer adjustment is delayed, the greater the impact of climate change on financial stability, inflation, jobs and growth. Conversely, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will reduce the impact of climate change, create the jobs of the future, and promote a resilient financial system.</p><p>Physical impacts of climate change are rising</p><p>Globally, each of the last four decades has been warmer than the decade that preceded it.1 The past eight years were the warmest on record, with each of those years exceeding 1 degree Celsius of warming-or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit-over pre-industrial levels.2 The average sea level has risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in at least 3000 years.3 Extreme heatwaves have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s, as have heavy precipitation events and major storms.</p><p>Data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NASA, among others, provide a snapshot of how climate change is already impacting the United States. To summarize:</p><p>* Since the 1970s, unusually hot summer days have become five times more common on average across the U.S., and unusually hot summer nights have become almost ten times more common.4</p><p>* Since the 1960s, heatwaves in the U.S. have become more common, more intense, and longer lasting.

For example, the National Flood Insurance Program has been the insurer of last resort for most Americans living in flood zones since 1968. Since the 2005 hurricane season, the NFIP has been unable to cover its payouts with premiums.16 Federal flood premiums are expected to increase significantly as the program adjusts its risk ratings. More broadly, with property losses from natural disasters increasing, policy premiums are expected to increase significantly for American families, with one reinsurer estimating that climate-related risks will result in a 22% increase in global property insurance premiums over the next 20 years.17</p><p>* Agricultural output: As anyone who grew up in a farming area--as I did--knows, extreme weather has an acute impact on agricultural production. The increased frequency of drought, heatwaves, freezes, and flooding is likely to significantly impair agricultural production, reducing incomes for American farmers and raising food costs for American families.18</p><p>* For example, a NASA study projects that, absent action, corn yields globally will begin declining over the next twenty years.19 Variability of yields will also increase. So while studies project that every Iowa county will experience production declines of 10% or more by 2050, declines will reach 25% in some counties by 2030 and over 40% in 2050.20 This is because, while growing-degree days are expected to increase by a modest amount, killing-degree days will increase by significantly more-an expected 57% by 2030 and 94% by 2050.</p><p>* Warming is already estimated to have contributed $27 billion, or almost 20%, of national crop insurance losses between 1991 and 2017./21</p><p>* * *</p><p>15 U.S. Global Change Research Program, Coastal Effects.

For example, the Texas deep freeze in February 202122 caused the worst involuntary blackout in U.S. history, closing three major semiconductor plants, which in turn slowed the production of new cars in the U.S.23 In the same vein, in December 2021, an extreme typhoon damaged a large Malaysian port, shutting off semiconductor shipments from Taiwan, leading to semiconductor shortages that caused U.S. car manufacturers to suspend operations.24</p><p>Physical impacts will worsen over time</p><p>These trends are expected to worsen. As the U.S. Global Change Research Program concluded in its most recent National Climate Assessment, \"the severity of these projected impacts, and the risks they present to society, is greater under futures with higher greenhouse gas emissions.\"25 There is ample scientific evidence that with each additional fraction of a degree of warming, extreme weather becomes more frequent and more intense.26 In the U.S., this means more frequent and more intense hurricanes; more frequent and deeper coastal flooding; hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting heat waves; longer-lasting and more frequent droughts, and more of the wildfires that accompany them.27 There are thresholds beyond which warming--and therefore extreme weather--is likely to accelerate rapidly due to unlocking feedback loops, such as the thawing of Arctic permafrost, which would lead to rapid release into the atmosphere of carbon that's currently frozen.28 There may also be certain warming thresholds beyond which catastrophic physical impacts are locked in irreversibly--so called \"tipping points.\" These include the collapse of the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, or the significant dieback of the Amazon rainforest, which could alter the earth's water cycle.29 Scientific modeling has assessed the likeliest temperature and broader climate outcomes under different collective country policy responses. If governments cut emissions in line with their current, stated climate policies, the world will be on track for warming of 2.4 degrees Celsius (or</p><p>4.3 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels by 2100.30 If all governments were to achieve their net-zero objectives on the timelines they have outlined, warming would be limited to 1.8 degrees.31 Even in this optimistic scenario, there would be a substantial increase in extreme weather and economic costs facing America and the world, but we would be less likely to hit irreversible tipping points or activate critical feedback loops.32</p><p>* * *</p><p>22 Judah Cohen et al, \"Linking Arctic variability and change with extreme winter weather in the United States,\" Science 373: 6559, September 2021. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9167\">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9167</url></p><p>23 Jacques Leslie, \"How Climate Change Is Disrupting the Global Supply Chain,\" Yale Environment 360, March 2022. <url normalizedValue=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain#:~:text=Scientists%20say%20that%20such%20climate,and%20perhaps%20more%20%E2%80%94%20by%202100\">https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain#:~:text=Scientists%20say%20that%20such%20climate,and%20perhaps%20more%20%E2%80%94%20by%202100</url>.</p><p>24 Leslie, \"How Climate Change Is Disrupting the Global Supply Chain.\"</p><p>25 U.S. Global Change Research Program, Overview.

GDP is a measure of the flow of income. At the global level, estimates suggest that, over the balance of this century, climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per capita by 10-20% without efforts to limit warming, the equivalent of a decade of no economic growth.33 Similar estimates have been found for the United States.34 While GDP represents a single year's worth of value added in the economy, estimates of the impact of the economic impacts of climate change project that what is lost is likely to stay lost, making climate change the curse that keeps on taking. In other words, these are level effects on GDP that are not recovered, unlike for nearly all other shocks to the economy.</p><p>As economically significant as these estimates are, it is instructive to examine what is not included in them, both 'assets' outside the market economy--such as biodiversity and human health--as well as critical economic channels that have not been modelled, including disrupted supply chains, the very real challenges to monetary and financial stability that increasing climate change will present, and the potential economic impact of rising risks to national security.</p><p>Increased temperatures, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and greater sea level rise can all negatively influence human health, including through heat-related illnesses like cardiovascular complications; easier spread of vector-borne pathogens like West Nile virus; and increased transmission of water-borne illness like diarrheal disease.35 For example, hot days affect human health through several channels, with the most extreme effects-including increased mortality-felt by vulnerable populations such as the elderly and pregnant women. Comparing higher and lower warming scenarios, an EPA analysis found that under a lower-warming scenario, expected additional deaths from extreme heat in 2090 could be cut by half, saving over 4,500 lives and $80 billion in damages per year compared to a higher-warming scenario.36</p><p>* * *</p><p>30 Climate Action Tracker, Warming Projections Global Update, November 2022. <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/1094/CAT_2022-11-10_GlobalUpdate_COP27.pdf\">https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/1094/CAT_2022-11-10_GlobalUpdate_COP27.pdf</url></p><p>31 Climate Action Tracker, Warming Projections Global Update, November 2022</p><p>32 IPCC, Avoiding Regional Tipping Points by Achieving More Ambitious Global Temperature Goals, in Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 -C. 2018. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/\">https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/</url></p><p>33 Mark Carney, 2022 Volcker Lecture at National Association of Business Economists Conference.

With livelihoods and lives of over a billion people directly affected by the spread of lethal climatic conditions, there are very real prospects for significant increases in involuntary migration and conflict over increasingly scarce resources and arable land.37 Government budgets will need to adjust to climate impacts</p><p>As temperatures increase and extreme weather events worsen, the costs to governments-local, state, and federal-will increase further.38 Ultimately, governments bear costs that private households, businesses, and markets are unable to shoulder. That is most evident for natural disasters, with local, state, and federal governments being forced to devote an increasing share of their budgets for meeting emergency needs, financing disaster recovery, and building resilience to future disasters.</p><p>Adapting and building resilience to the changing climate can help minimize some of the worst impacts, but it will be costly. Adaptation will require a wide range of investments in infrastructure and technology to withstand higher temperatures, higher sea levels, more flooding, more droughts, and worse storms. For example, ports will need to be protected against sea level rise and increased storm surge, with total potential costs for these improvements at over $200 billion through 2100, or $100 million per year for the port of Los Angeles.39</p><p>Addressing climate change creates major economic opportunities</p><p>To conclude, the costs to property, agriculture, and livelihoods are already high and are expected to grow materially. The potential hit to GDP growth from unmitigated climate change is expected to be significant. And many of the most severe impacts--to human health, to livelihoods, and our natural heritage--are not included in these calculations.</p><p>But there is one final risk from climate change--a negative risk--better known as an opportunity. Increasing recognition of the risks of climate change is now galvanizing global efforts to address the issue. In recent years, the number of countries committed to achieving net zero has risen from less than one third of global emissions to over 90%.40 In response, many companies are developing net-zero transition strategies, and private financial institutions managing balance sheets representing almost 40% of private financial assets are doing the same. With climate policies, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and RePowerEU, becoming increasingly impactful, and with capital widely available to finance investments for emissions reductions, both carbon efficiency and climate resilience are becoming increasingly important determinants of company and national competitiveness.</p><p>* * *</p><p>37 IPCC, Summary for Policymakers, in Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

These airports also provide essential air services, more so during this Covid-19 pandemic, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, along with the Minister of Health and Member of Parliament for Thunder Bay--Superior North, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, and Member of Parliament for Thunder Bay-Rainy River, Marcus Powlowski, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at the Thunder Bay International Airport.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide almost $12.5 million to the Thunder Bay International Airport for four safety-related projects:</p><p>* Purchase of two aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles - $2,255,729</p><p>* Rehabilitation or airside surfaces and lighting and electrical systems - $8,518,040</p><p>* Construction of runway end safety areas for Runways 07-25 and 12-30 - $1,662,055</p><p>* Installation of airside LED guidance signs - $33,750</p><p>For 2021-2022, Transport Canada has allocated ACAP funding to 63 airports for 86 safety-related projects, including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.1 billion for 1,088 projects at 199 airports across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Our Government recognizes that airports are major contributors to the economic growth and social well-being of smaller communities, and local airport workers. In addition to supporting personal travel, local airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities across Canada. This is more important than ever as we work towards reopening our economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>\"The Thunder Bay International Airport is a critical hub for people in Thunder Bay and the region, connecting us to the rest of the country and the world. This investment will ensure our airport can keep on serving our region, helping Northwestern Ontarians get to work, medical services and more.\"</p><p>The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health and Member of Parliament for Thunder Bay--Superior North</p><p>\"Today's funding is welcome news that will help ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the Thunder Bay International Airport. Thunder Bay has always been a hub for regional transportation, and coming out this pandemic we need to ensure that our city is prepared to meet the transportation challenges of the future.\"</p><p>Marcus Powlowski, Member of Parliament for Thunder Bay-Rainy River</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement (FES) 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* As well, the FES announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airport System (NAS) airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* The eligible NAS airports are: Gander;

In November, the council approved an update of the city's Climate Action Plan, which contains a host of strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate-change-related ordinances that have won council approval in recent years include ones that eliminate the use of gas-powered leaf-blowers, plastic bags and Styrofoam containers.</p><p>Encinitas ought to prioritize actions that can help reduce global warming concerns, council members have said, because it's a coastal city and climate change will result in sea-level rises that threaten coastal areas.</p><p>Councilman Tony Kranz said he was supporting the climate emergency declaration because he wanted to make the world a better place for his grandchildren. He said local governments need to step up and take action because the nation's current leaders are not.</p><p>Encinitas is far from the first California city to enact a climate emergency. Large cities that have done so include Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, a city staff report notes, adding that the neighboring towns of Del Mar and Solana Beach also have recently taken the action.</p><p>\"The first such declaration was made in December 2016 in Australia, and since then over 1,400 local governments in 28 countries have made climate emergency declarations, including 73 in the United States,\" the staff report states.</p><p>In other action, the council voted to:</p><p>? Give final approval to a new permit system and regulations for group homes, including sober living houses where people stay while they are undergoing treatment for drug or alcohol addiction.</p><p>? Spend up to $50,000 to  obtain the necessary environmental permits and then remove an estimated 300 to 500 cubic yards of sediment from a San Elijo Lagoon-area culvert that's causing community flooding problems.</p><p>Henry is a freelance writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-U16JFLJ5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61KJ-SNV1-JBFS-C17R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"484\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union-Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp;

The National Weather Service recently released a list of the 12 wildest weather moments from 2009 to 2019. They were voted on by the staff of the three National Weather Service branches in Colorado - Boulder, Pueblo and Grand Junction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are the final results:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">12. A rare ice storm occurs in Western Colorado (Jan. 9, 2017)</p><p>Roughly 4,600 people are left without power and 200-plus sent to the emergency room as a rare ice storm rolls through La Plata, Garfield, Routt and Mesa counties. Warmer air resulted in falling snow turning to rain before again freezing on the ground. As a result, a thick layer of ice coated seemingly everything, from sidewalks to tree limbs to automobiles. As you might guess, this caused a number of problems.</p><p>11. A tornado strikes in Berthoud, Colorado. (June 4, 2015)</p><p>The strongest tornado to strike Boulder and Larimer counties lands on the evening of June 4. Close to 30 homes are damaged and three are destroyed as this quarter-mile wide twister with wind speeds of up to 140 miles per hour charged down a six-mile path.</p><p>10. The heat wave of summer 2012</p><p>During the summer of 2012, triple-digit temperatures struck multiple times in many spots around Colorado, resulting in extreme drought. By October, the entire state was experiencing some level of drought, with much of the state in \"extreme drought\" or \"exceptional drought.\" This brought wildfire risk to a very high level. During this time, the infamous Waldo Canyon fire burned in Colorado Springs (June 23-July 10), destroying 346 homes and killing two.</p><p>9. Record-setting hailstones land in Bethune, Colorado. (Aug. 13, 2019)</p><p>At roughly 3 p.m. on the 13th, hailstones estimated at 5 inches in diameter pound Bethune in Kit Carson County. The hailstones were officially measured at 4.83 inches, making them the largest hailstones to ever be recorded in Colorado. To put that in perspective, a 4.5 inch diameter hailstone is estimated to be the size of a grapefruit.</p><p>8. The front range blizzard of 2016 (March 23, 2016)</p><p>Dumping more than 3 inches of snow per hour at times, the Front Range Blizzard of March 2016 is one that's hard to forget. Big snow and winds gusting up to 50 miles per hour along I-25 made travel practically impossible with more than 30 inches dropping in some parts of the state. By the time all was said and done, at least 290,000 were left without power, around 2,000 cars had been trapped on I-25, and 1,300 flights were canceled with Denver International Airport (which shut down for the third time ever).</p><p>7. The hailstorms of 2018 (June 13, 18-19, 2018)</p><p>Three major hailstorms rolled through Colorado in the summer of 2018, resulting in approximately $620 million in damage. The first event occurred on June 13, dropping 3-inch hail across El Paso County. The second event hit Louisville, Colorado on June 18, dropping 3-inch hail during a thunderstorm. The third storm was perhaps the wildest, dropping 3-inch hail, generating a tornado, and causing flooding in the Denver metro area.</p><p>6. The 2013 wildfires</p><p>Two wildfires wreaked havoc in Colorado during the summer of 2013, including the West Fork Complex fire and the Black Forest Fire, likely a direct result of the aforementioned 2012 drought. The West Fork Complex fire consisted of three separate blazes totaling 121,806 acres, impacting 52 miles of forest roads and more than 100 miles of trails. The Black Forest Fire burnt a comparatively small 14,280 acres, but destroyed 511 homes, killed two people, caused $463 million in damage, and resulted in the evacuation of 38,000.</p><p>5. The avalanches of 2019</p><p>As massive snow totals started to accumulate in Colorado's high country, this led to big problems. Multiple avalanches covered major roads around the state, including one that buried I-70 in up to six feet of snow. That shies in comparison to Red Mountain Pass mitigation that brought down 40 to 60 feet of snow on the road. During a two-week period, 1,000 avalanches were reported, 87 of which were considered D4 (out of 5, with 5 being the largest avalanche ever known). To put that in perspective, only 24 D4 avalanches occurred in Colorado from 2010 to 2018!</p><p>4. The second costliest hailstorm in United States history (May 8, 2017)</p><p>On May 8, 2017, a massive supercell thunderstorm resulted in large hail dropping in the Denver area, costing around $2.3 billion due to damages. More than 150,000 auto insurance claims were estimated to have been filed. The storm started dropping baseball-sized hailstones around 3 p.m..</p><p>3. The 2019 bomb cyclone</p><p>The result of pressure dropping to the lowest ever record in Colorado, the \"bomb cyclone of 2019\" produced wild winds and snow that brought the Front Range to a grinding halt. Gusts reached up to 100 miles per hour in certain parts of the state accompanied by one to three feet of snow (and 52 inches at Wolf Creek). Despite heavy news coverage beforehand, sunny skies prior to the storm led many to believe forecasters were off. As a result, many became stranded as they tried to commute home amid blizzard conditions. Roughly 5,000 passengers were stranded at DIA overnight, more than 1,000 drivers were stranded on the roads, and 445,000 people lacked power at one point. At least one fatality occurred.</p><p>2. The 2012 wildfires</p><p>The aforementioned severe drought of 2012 brought dangerous wildfire conditions with it, resulting in multiple blazes including Lower North Fork Fire, High Park Fire, and Waldo Canyon Fire. The Lower North Fork Fire killed three people, burnt 4,410 acres, and destroyed 23 homes. The High Park Fire killed one person, burnt 87,415 acres, and destroyed 259 homes. The Waldo Canyon Fire killed two, burnt 18,247 acres, and destroyed 347 homes resulting in $453.7 million in insurance claims - the second costliest in state history to the aforementioned Black Forest Fire.</p><p>1. The floods of September 2013 (Sept. 11-15, 2013)</p><p>Following days of consistent rain in Colorado, the Front Range was hit with torrential downpour on the night of Sept. 11 into Sept. 12. Rainfall continued over the next several days, resulting in major flooding problems. Twenty counties were affected, with floods resulting in nine deaths, 19,000 evacuations, $4 billion in damages, 2,006 homes destroyed, and more than 200 miles of road damaged. Up to 18 inches of rain fell across the Front Range in a matter of days with Fort Carson breaking the state record for rainfall in a 24-hour period at 11.85 inches. A few of the rivers most impacted included Big Thompson River, Cache la Poudre and St. Vrain Creek.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A man begins cleaning up Canon Avenue in Manitou Springs, Colorado, after a flash flood burst through a manhole and sent water rushing down the streets on Sept. 12, 2013.

And within a couple hours, the police came and picked me up in my apartment and brought me here,\" he said.</p><p>President <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Joe Biden</url> on Wednesday issued a federal emergency declaration and ordered federal assistance to supplement state and local resources for firefighting efforts and relief for residents in four counties affected by the fire.</p><p>More than 15,000 firefighters, with help from out-of-state crews, were battling dozens of California blazes, including another large blaze in the same area.</p><p>Major General David Baldwin, adjutant general of California, said the state has also deployed more than 1,000 National Guard soldiers, airmen and sailors and that 10 other states have sent around 1,250 additional Guard members.</p><p>Many of the guard units are providing air support, including 23 aircraft, some equipped with water buckets and others with systems that can drop fire retardant.</p><p>About 65 miles north of the Lake Tahoe\u2013area blaze, the Dixie Fire is the second-largest wildfire in state history at about 1,320 square miles. The weeks-old fire prompted new evacuation orders and warnings this week and was just over 50 percent contained.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1886356/caldor-fire.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Caldor Fire</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 31: Highway 50 is deserted as South Lake Tahoe is under mandatory evacuation due to the Caldor Fire on September 1, 2021 in South Lake Tahoe, California.
