We're suffocating due to the smoke,\" one of the monks told the ANA news agency by phone. <br/> Flames near Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games where the mayor pleaded for back-up Photo:

firefighters, two helicopters and four water-bombing planes were mobilised. <br/> Smoke sits over the Acropolis in Athens from a forest fire raging near the Greek capital Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/> But Dimitris Vourdanos, deputy governor of the region, said that \"we are completely unable to intervene by air or by land\". <br/>\"There are two main fronts which are uncontrollable and several other smaller ones,\" he told the Kathimerini newspaper. <br/> Experts have warned that global warming is increasing both the frequency and intensity of such fires Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/>The deputy mayor of the small town of Mantoudi said there were \"at least 150 houses burnt\". <br/> People on the outskirts of Athens are left to grapple with the devastation caused by forest fires Photo: AFPTV / Will VASSILOPOULOS  <br/>According to deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias, around 40 blazes are raging in Greece as a severe heatwave hits the country, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). <br/> Burnt-out cars after the fire raged through an area at the at the foot of Mount Parnitha, where the fire started Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/>Evia island is some 200 kilometres (125 miles) away from Athens, where more than 500 firefighters, a dozen water-bombing planes and five helicopters battled another wildfire on the outskirts of the city. <br/>The blaze started on Tuesday in a pine forest at the foot of Mount Parnitha, one of three ranges that surround the Greek capital, sending plumes of dark, acrid smoke over Athens and leaving carcasses of burnt-out houses in its wake. <br/>Around a dozen houses have been destroyed in the flames, and dozens of businesses, bars and holiday accommodation have been severely damaged in the suburb of Varympompi, 30 kilometres (20 miles) northwest of Athens, officials said. <br/>On Wednesday afternoon, the blaze was coming under control, Hardalias said. <br/>Authorities in Athens have recommended residents stay indoors and wear a mask to protect against the ash and smoke. <br/>Over in Olympia, around 100 firefighters were battling the blaze, aided by three helicopters and two planes. <br/>Culture Minister Lina Mendoni is due to go there to evaluate the risks to the ancient site. <br/>But Olympia mayor Giorgos Georgopoulos called for back-up on television. \"We need more aerial support,\" he said. <br/>The European Union's crisis management commissioner said it would help, and Cyprus and Sweden were both sending two water-bombing planes to help battle the fires. <br/>Neighbouring Turkey is also suffering its worst fires in at least a decade, claiming the lives of eight people and forcing hundreds to evacuate in southern areas popular with tourists. <br/>Experts have warned that global warming is increasing both the frequency and intensity of such fires.

It's the worst month for fire in the Amazon in over a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Satellite sensors detected over 42,000 fires in 30 days according to Brazil\u2019s national space institute. It is the first time since 2010 that fires in the Amazon surpassed 40,000 in a single month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This September was two and a half times worse than last. Coming at the peak of the dry season, it's usually the worst month not only for fire but also for deforestation.</p><p>The official data for forest loss only goes through September 23 so far, yet is already 14% more devastating than September 2021. In just those three weeks, the Amazon lost 1,120 square kilometers of rainforest (434 square miles), an area larger than New York City.</p><p>The surge in forest fire occurs amid a polarizing presidential campaign. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking a second four-year term against leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who ruled Brazil between 2003 and 2010 and leads in the polls. The first round of the election is on Sunday.</p><p>Despite the smoke clogging the air of entire Amazon cities, state elections have largely i <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/elections-forests-brazil-general-5e0c4701f6b3f8f58ea607aa4bda77b7\">gnored environmental issues</url>. Besides the President, Brazilians will also elect governors and state and national parliaments.</p><p>In Para state, worst for both deforestation and fire, the subject of deforestation was barely touched on during a TV debate among gubernatorial candidates held Tuesday by the Globo network.</p><p>Over an hour and a half, only one candidate mentioned the steep increase in deforestation. Globo, Brazil\u2019s leading television network, did not even select it as one of eight debate topics.</p><p>Protecting the forest is not a high-priority for the population, after years of pandemic and a deteriorating economy, Paulo Barreto, a researcher with the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, told the Associated Press. \u201cBut the fact that journalists don\u2019t ask is an even bigger problem.\" Deforestation can lead to more poverty, he said. \u201cOn the other hand, there are growing economic opportunities related to conservation.\u201d</p><p>Fire in the Amazon is almost always deliberately set, to improve cattle pasture or burn recently-felled trees once they are dry. Often the fires burn out of control and reach pristine forest areas.</p><p>Studies have shown that deforestation rates peak in election years, and 2022 has been particularly intense because of Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-environmental rhetoric, according to analysts.</p><p>\u201cWith a chance of changing the government to one that promises more rigor, it seems that the deforesters are taking advantage of the possibility that the party\u2019s over,\u201d Barreto said.</p><p>Since Bolsonaro took office, in 2019, deforestation has been on the rise, as his administration has defanged environmental authorities and backed measures to loosen land protections, emboldening environmental offenders.</p><p>The far-right leader has repeatedly denied that fire is even increasing, despite official data from his government agency. On Thursday night, during the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-elections-caribbean-presidential-brazil-4de8ccbd0ce3018b95760e1343cd9a1d\">final Presidential debate</url> before the vote, he said that forest fires occur periodically in the Amazon, dismissed the criticism as a \u201cwar of narratives,\u201d and said Brazil \u201cis an example to the world\u201d on conservation.</p><p>It was an answer to Simone Tebet, a senator who is close to agribusiness leaders and considered a moderate in the race. In one the of the few moments free of personal insults, she criticized Bolsonaro's environmental record in a segment related to climate change.</p><p>\u201cYour administration is the one that has set biomes, forests and my Pantanal wetlands on fire. Your administration favored miners and loggers, and protected them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, in this regard, were the worst president in Brazil\u2019s history.\u201d</p><p>During his campaign, da Silva promised to restore law enforcement and gained support from Indigenous and environmental leaders, such as former Environment <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-science-caribbean-forests-brazil-580acb5091b553a5a0b5b7028c818b7a\">Minister Marina Silva</url>. She had broken publicly with the former president over his push to build hydroelectric dams and other development initiatives in the Amazon.</p><p>In announcing her support during a meeting with da Silva a few weeks ago, she called Bolsonaro a threat to Brazil\u2019s democracy. She said the country is facing a critical moment on issues ranging from the environment to the economy.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking a second four-year term against leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who ruled Brazil between 2003 and 2010 and leads in the polls. The first round of the election is on Sunday.</p><p>Despite the smoke clogging the air of entire Amazon cities, state elections have largely i <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/elections-forests-brazil-general-5e0c4701f6b3f8f58ea607aa4bda77b7\">gnored environmental issues</url>. Besides the President, Brazilians will also elect governors and state and national parliaments.</p><p>In Para state, worst for both deforestation and fire, the subject of deforestation was barely touched on during a TV debate among gubernatorial candidates held Tuesday by the Globo network.</p><p>Over an hour and a half, only one candidate mentioned the steep increase in deforestation. Globo, Brazil\u2019s leading television network, did not even select it as one of eight debate topics.</p><p>Protecting the forest is not a high-priority for the population, after years of pandemic and a deteriorating economy, Paulo Barreto, a researcher with the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, told the Associated Press. \u201cBut the fact that journalists don\u2019t ask is an even bigger problem.\" Deforestation can lead to more poverty, he said. \u201cOn the other hand, there are growing economic opportunities related to conservation.\u201d</p><p>Fire in the Amazon is almost always deliberately set, to improve cattle pasture or burn recently-felled trees once they are dry. Often the fires burn out of control and reach pristine forest areas.</p><p>Studies have shown that deforestation rates peak in election years, and 2022 has been particularly intense because of Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-environmental rhetoric, according to analysts.</p><p>\u201cWith a chance of changing the government to one that promises more rigor, it seems that the deforesters are taking advantage of the possibility that the party\u2019s over,\u201d Barreto said.</p><p>Since Bolsonaro took office, in 2019, deforestation has been on the rise, as his administration has defanged environmental authorities and backed measures to loosen land protections, emboldening environmental offenders.</p><p>The far-right leader has repeatedly denied that fire is even increasing, despite official data from his government agency. On Thursday night, during the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-elections-caribbean-presidential-brazil-4de8ccbd0ce3018b95760e1343cd9a1d\">final Presidential debate</url> before the vote, he said that forest fires occur periodically in the Amazon, dismissed the criticism as a \u201cwar of narratives,\u201d and said Brazil \u201cis an example to the world\u201d on conservation.</p><p>It was an answer to Simone Tebet, a senator who is close to agribusiness leaders and considered a moderate in the race. In one the of the few moments free of personal insults, she criticized Bolsonaro's environmental record in a segment related to climate change.</p><p>\u201cYour administration is the one that has set biomes, forests and my Pantanal wetlands on fire. Your administration favored miners and loggers, and protected them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, in this regard, were the worst president in Brazil\u2019s history.\u201d</p><p>During his campaign, da Silva promised to restore law enforcement and gained support from Indigenous and environmental leaders, such as former Environment <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-science-caribbean-forests-brazil-580acb5091b553a5a0b5b7028c818b7a\">Minister Marina Silva</url>. She had broken publicly with the former president over his push to build hydroelectric dams and other development initiatives in the Amazon.</p><p>In announcing her support during a meeting with da Silva a few weeks ago, she called Bolsonaro a threat to Brazil\u2019s democracy. She said the country is facing a critical moment on issues ranging from the environment to the economy.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

There is a persistent need for emergency managers and firefighters across the United States and the world to be prepared and equipped to respond effectively to the latest disasters to prevent casualties and damage to property, infrastructure and ecosystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Images of cities in the Western US blanketed in smoky orange fog in 2020 highlight the impact of fires even to those who might not live directly near areas with major fires. After devastating fire seasons in 2018, 2020 and 2021, the 2022 Fire Season is shaping up to be a challenge as well. Fires in the United States have already burned over 3.4 million acres and killed two firefighters. Wildfires across Southern Europe in Turkey, Greece and Italy have killed 8 people so far.</p><p>With wildfires causing 33 deaths and over $12 billion in wildfire related damage in 2020 in the US, leaders are taking note and acting accordingly. Numerous US states and the federal government are increasing budgets to respond to the growing risk of wildfires. The US federal government spends over $5 billion annually on wildfire management through various agencies including the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, while states like California were set to spend just under over $2 billion in 2021.</p><p>Speakers:</p><p>- Randy Moore, Chief US Forest Service</p><p>Randy Moore is Chief of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, leading a workforce of more than 25,000 permanent employees who sustainably manage 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands; support the world's largest forestry research organization; and work with states, tribes, and others to sustain all of America's forests for the benefit of all citizens, today and in the future. Under his leadership, the Forest Service cares for shared natural resources in ways that promote lasting economic, ecological, and social vitality for all communities nationwide. Randy has been a catalyst for change throughout his 43-year career. As Chief, he contributes to our nation's most pressing challenges: tackling climate change, advancing racial equity and helping the people we serve recover and heal from the global pandemic, in part through connection with our treasured public lands. Randy is committed to seeking new and better ways to address the many issues facing our ecosystems, our communities, and our employees. Randy believes strongly that a leader must adapt and grow, but that there are some principles that always hold true: a leader must be fair, inclusive, willing to listen and trust his employees. He is committed to the Forest Service mission, distilling it to its core of improving forest conditions by bringing together partners running the gamut from industry to the environmental community to private, tribal, and government stewards of the land. Prior to serving as Chief, he served as Pacific Southwest Regional Forester, where he was responsible for 18 national forests in California, covering one-fifth of the state on 20 million acres of land. He also oversaw State &amp; Private Forestry programs in Hawaii and the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands. Randy has also served as Regional Forester for the Eastern Region in Wisconsin, forest supervisor for Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri, and in myriad other roles throughout the agency. He began his 43-year career in 1978 with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service in North Dakota.</p><p>- Mike Morgan, Director Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control</p><p>- Gordon Sachs, Acting Deputy Director, Fire and Aviation US Forest Service</p><p>- Scott Donohoe, Manager - Bushfire &amp; Aviation Fire and Rescue New South Wales, Australia</p><p>- Hans Das, Director, Emergency Management and rescEU, European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations European Commission</p><p>- Tiago Oliviera, Director Agency Integrated Management of Rural Fires (AGIF) Portugal</p><p>- Mark Parrington, Senior Scientist, Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Development Section, ECMWF Copernicus</p><p>Mark Parrington is a Senior Scientist at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Development Section at ECMWF.

Prior to joining ECMWF, in September 2013, he worked on many aspects of applying Earth observation data, in-situ measurements and numerical modelling to atmospheric chemistry and air quality research. His role in the CAMS team is to monitor the near-real-time wildfire emissions and global atmospheric composition products, to diagnose potential issues in the CAMS system and also to identify significant events related to atmospheric composition that are relevant for communication and media.</p><p>- Lara Steil, Coordinator, Department for Interagency and Burning Control Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources</p><p>- Jean-Michel Dumaz, Civil Protection and Crisis Management Attache French Embassy, Singapore</p><p>- Val Charlton, Director LandWorks South Africa</p><p>- Brian Marshall, Director California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES)</p><p>- Ben Miller, Director, Center for Excellence for Advanced Technology Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control</p><p>- Ian Meier, Executive Director British Columbia Wildfire Service</p><p>- Elena Hernandez Paredes, Director, Forest Fire Defense Spanish Forest Fire Service</p><p>- Chuck Turley, Wildfire Division Manager Washington State Department of Natural Resources</p><p>- Ben McGrane, Acting Assistant Director, Incident Procurement Operations, US Forest Service</p><p>- George Geissler, State Forester for Wildland Fire Management Washington State Department of Natural Resources</p><p>- Colonel Christophe Frerson, Deputy Director South Corsica Fire and Rescue Service, France</p><p>- Philip Prins, Director, Integrated Fire Management South Africa National Parks</p><p>* * *</p><p>More information about the event can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idga.org/events-wildfiremanagement?mac=IDGA_Events_Title_Listing&amp;utm_medium=Portal&amp;utm_source=idga\">https://www.idga.org/events-wildfiremanagement?mac=IDGA_Events_Title_Listing&amp;utm_medium=Portal&amp;utm_source=idga</url></p><p>[Category: Government/Public AdministrationEvent]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7751759 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7751759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64V2-R5T1-DYG2-R2F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1080\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These airports also support essential air services including air ambulance services, search and rescue, forest fire response, and delivering essential goods to communities. As Canada works towards recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, investments in our airports continue to be crucial to maintain the safety and security of our transportation sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is investing more than $1.7 million in the Prince George Airport through Transport Canada's Airport Relief Fund to help it maintain important airport operations and essential air services for residents and workers in Prince George and surrounding communities.</p><p>The Prince George Airport also received over $1.4 million from Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program for the purchase of a 4x4 snowplow truck and a wet/dry material spreader. This equipment will help the airport maintain safe operations for aircraft, passengers, crews and airport workers by keeping runways and taxiways clear of snow and ice. The funding will also support the expansion of a shelter to house and protect the airport's aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicle from the elements, ensuring it is ready for immediate use in case of an emergency.</p><p>These investments are in addition to the over $1.4 million in Airports Capital Assistance Program funding provided to the airport in May 2021 for the purchase of an aircraft rescue firefighting vehicle and a runway ice sweeper.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"As we move forward with the safe and gradual return of air travel, it is our government's priority to ensure a vibrant and competitive Canadian air sector that keeps travellers and workers safe. These critical investments will allow the Prince George Airport to have the infrastructure and tools needed to help re-invigorate the aviation industry in the communities it serves, and allow Canadians to feel safe and secure when they travel.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* First introduced in the 2020 Fall Economic Statement, the Airport Relief Fund is part of a federal stimulus recovery plan designed to build a stronger, more inclusive, and more resilient economy post-COVID-19.</p><p>* The Airport Relief Fund, launched in May 2021, provided $64.8 million in funding in 2021-2022 for targeted airports whose 2019 revenues were less than $250 million.</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* The Fall Economic Statement 2020 also announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airports System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* The eligible National Airports System airports are: Gander; Charlottetown; Saint John; Fredericton; Moncton; Thunder Bay; London; and Prince George.</p><p>* Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country. Funded projects include runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife control fencing.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2022/07/government-of-canada-makes-important-investments-at-prince-george-airport.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2022/07/government-of-canada-makes-important-investments-at-prince-george-airport.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-7896848 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7896848</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6607-GYT1-JC11-13CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 21, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That's the only way to make it better,\" she said. \"People working together for a goal to improve the lives of the residents is what makes a great place to live.\"</p><p>The growth of the community where she was raised is a success story for Johnson.</p><p>\"I've seen so much progress over the years, especially over the last two decades,\" she said. \"I'm proud to be from London.</p><p>\"I am honored and humbled by this recognition \u2014 it was certainly not expected,\" she added. \"There are so many amazing people in this community who deserve to be recognized for the many things they do, so this award is especially meaningful for me.\"</p><p>Johnson has four grandchildren \u2014 Hannah, Autumn, Brady and Waylon \u2014 and is expecting her first great-grandchild in September.</p><p>HUMANITARIAN AWARD: London Police Officer Logan Medlock (posthumously)</p><p>London Police Officer Logan Medlock was tragically killed by an intoxicated driver on October 30, 2022 \u2014 the ending of a brief but impactful life.</p><p>At just 26 years old, he was known as a \"legacy officer,\" following in the career path of his father, London Police Major Randy Medlock. His diligence in his job earned him the Governor's Impaired Driving Enforcement Award and the Governor's Occupant Protection Award for 2022 \u2014 marking the first time that one officer received both awards the same year.</p><p>\"Logan treated everyone like family. Every person he interacted with, he viewed as 'what if this was my loved one?' He treated every person like they were somebody, with respect,\" said his wife, Courtney. \"He never met a stranger; I often told him he could talk to a tree. Logan had a very big heart, and was very compassionate. Often times he would come home and be worried about an individual who he had a call on earlier in the night, and prayed that they were okay. You couldn't ask for a better officer, and a better man to represent London in a uniform. I wish Logan was here to see the recognition he deserved.</p><p>\"Being Logan's wife was one of the greatest honors of my life. Logan and I always made time for each other, and for our son Brantley. I'm so thankful for the wonderful memories we made as a family, and the love we shared that I will be able to tell Brantley about as he gets older,\" she continued. \"Logan was quite the comedian at home, and loved to do impressions to get us laughing. He was always wresting Brantley and playing with Nerf guns. Something was always getting broke in our house, but the laughs they shared together was worth it. I treasure those times we shared when I didn't realize those little moments, would be my biggest treasures.\"</p><p>RISING STAR: Maggie Moore</p><p>Maggie Moore is an incoming freshman at the University of the Cumberlands and will be majoring in Elementary Education.

Once her suggestion was approved, Moore couldn't contain her emotion, as tears rolled down her cheeks.</p><p>Thankful for her community, Moore is one young person who truly cares for others and is thankful to live in a community that cares about others as well.</p><p>OUT OF TOWNER AWARD: Silas House</p><p>Recently named Kentucky Poet Laureate by Governor Andy Beshear, Lily native Silas House makes his claim to fame by writing about the Appalachian people.

He is the NEH Chair in Appalachian Studies at Berea College and served a one-year term as Interim Director of the Loyal Jones Appalachian Center.</p><p>BUSINESS OF THE YEAR: Bush Fire Services Inc.</p><p>After serving on the Bush Fire Department for years, the Williams brothers \u2014 Phil, David and Joe \u2014 expanded their realm of emergency response to establish followup services.</p><p>Bush Fire Services, Inc. started when David, Joe and Phil Williams were on a forest fire call in Red Bird, Kentucky while volunteering with the Bush Fire Department in the late 1980s. The US Forest Service requested shower stations be set up for firefighters to use after their shifts. One of the USFS employees told them that in the western U.S., these are frequently used in fire camps and are made in containers such as semi-trailers. Shortly after, the three brothers set out to create the first mobile shower unit in the eastern part of the U.S. Their first official job was Hurricane Andrew in Florida.</p><p>Since 1991, Bush Fire Services, Inc. has provided disaster support to nearly every hurricane site in North America and the Virgin Islands. Their disaster support services were also utilized for clean-up at the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbia Shuttle Recovery and at the World Trade Center (9/11) in New York City.</p><p>With their first mobile shower trailer and two buses, they were called to Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina once again working for the USFS hauling firefighters to and from drop off points to the fire camp where the shower trailer was waiting for them after their shift. This would be the job that started to shape Bush Fire Services as a company.</p><p>Today Bush Fire Services, Inc. has mobile shower units, restroom trailers, laundry trailers, buses, vans, and many other pieces of quick response disaster equipment. This equipment is taken all over the U.S. but is used locally as well, such as at a local wedding and downtown events. Their equipment is still being used over a year later in eastern Kentucky since the flooding in 2022.</p><p>Bush Fire Services, Inc. has been a local business for 30-plus years and continues to provide quick response relief to communities around the country.</p><p>NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION: OPAC (Older Persons Activity Center)</p><p>Established in 1976, the Older Persons Activity Center, more commonly known as OPAC, serves the 60-plus population with a variety of services.</p><p>Donna Stanifer has been the executive director since 2005 and continues to find ways to serve the elderly with their needs.</p><p>\"We have the Center on Fourth Street where people can come in and socialize, have lunch and play games,\" Stanifer said. \"We also have an exercise room and we go on field trips to different places.\"</p><p>When Stanifer took the director's position, she and her husband Randy began refreshing the facility to make it more user-friendly and to continue the mission to assist the elderly with their needs.</p><p>Their services extend far beyond the realm of the building itself, however.</p><p>\"OPAC started out as a place to provide activities and meals for seniors and to help them remain as independent as possible,\" she said. \"Now we provide meals to those who are not able to come to the center.\"</p><p>That includes providing a nutritious lunch to shut-ins and providing transportation for those needing to go to the grocery store or doctor's office.</p><p>\"A lot of the seniors don't have transportation or don't have family to take them where they need to go,\" she said. \"We are not income-based. Anyone age 60 or over can receive services for free.\"</p><p>___ (c)2023 The Sentinel Echo (London, Ky.)

Canadians rely on safe and well-maintained local and regional airports to support vibrant communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in Manitoba.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, 15 airports in Manitoba will receive over $5.1 million from the Government of Canada for projects and equipment that will help maintain safe airport operations for passengers, crews, and airport workers. The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>Berens River</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Bloodvein River</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>* to install wildlife control fencing - $940,655</p><p>Flin Flon</p><p>* to purchase runway friction tester - $6,420</p><p>* to purchase a grader - $438,000</p><p>* to replace runway approach lighting - $90,329</p><p>Gods Lake Narrows</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>* to purchase a loader mounted snow blower - $210,000</p><p>Norway House</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Oxford House</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Pukatawagan</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Red Sucker Lake</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>South Indian Lake</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>St. Andrews</p><p>* to purchase a sweeper - $395,200</p><p>St. Theresa Point</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Tadoule Lake</p><p>* to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>* to install wildlife control fencing - $1,029,573</p><p>The Pas/Grace Lake</p><p>* to purchase a loader mounted snow blower - $234,000</p><p>Thompson</p><p>* to purchase a snowplow - $358,960</p><p>York Landing</p><p>* to install wildlife control fencing - $926,610</p><p>The equipment will be used in maintaining aircraft movement surfaces and the removal and control of ice and snow from airside surfaces such as runways, taxiways and the apron. For airports with a gravel runway, a compactor is used to compress the gravel on the runway, creating a stable surface for safe landing and takeoff operations. The wildlife fencing will keep large mammals away from secure airfield areas.</p><p>This funding is in addition to the more than $20.8 million provided under the Program in 2021 to support safety-related projects at the Flin Flon, Gods Lake Narrows, Lac Brochet, Red Sucker Lake, Shamattawa, and Thompson airports.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Airports play a crucial role in keeping Canadians connected across our vast country, and the last two years have only underscored this. Today's investment of over $5.1 million for 15 airports across Manitoba is great news for the region's air sector and for the communities these airports serve. Investments like these will ensure that our air sector comes out strong as we enter post-pandemic recovery, and help us keep our commitment to building safer, stronger communities.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>\"Our regional airports here in Manitoba keep communities connected and ensure vital supply chains are maintained. The new equipment being used will ensure our airports are safe for travelers, staff, air crew and residents. Our government will continue to be there to support operations at local and regional airports with these important investments, creating economic opportunity, connecting families and friends, and improving the quality of life for all Manitobans.\"</p><p>The Honourable Daniel Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada and Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* The Fall Economic Statement 2020 also announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airports System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country.

According to news originating from Changsha, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"The accurate detection of burned forest area is essential for post-fire management and assessment, and for quantifying carbon budgets. Therefore, it is imperative to map burned areas accurately.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Science And Technology Innovation Platform And Talent Plan Project of Hunan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Central South University of Forestry and Technology: \"Currently, there are few burned-area products around the world. Researchers have mapped burned areas directly at the pixel level that is usually a mixture of burned area and other land cover types. In order to improve the burned area mapping at subpixel level, we proposed a Burned Area Subpixel Mapping (BASM) workflow to map burned areas at the subpixel level. We then applied the workflow to Sentinel 2 data sets to obtain burned area mapping at subpixel level. In this study, the information of true fire scar was provided by the Department of Emergency Management of Hunan Province, China. To validate the accuracy of the BASM workflow for detecting burned areas at the subpixel level, we applied the workflow to the Sentinel 2 image data and then compared the detected burned area at subpixel level with in situ measurements at fifteen fire-scar reference sites located in Hunan Province, China. Results show the proposed method generated successfully burned area at the subpixel level. The methods, especially the BASM-Feature Extraction Rule Based (BASM-FERB) method, could minimize misclassification and effects due to noise more effectively compared with the BASM-Random Forest (BASM-RF), BASM-Backpropagation Neural Net (BASM-BPNN), BASM-Support Vector Machine (BASM-SVM), and BASM-notra methods. We conducted a comparison study among BASM-FERB, BASM-RF, BASM-BPNN, BASM-SVM, and BASM-notra using five accuracy evaluation indices, i.e., overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), intersection over union (IoU), and Kappa coefficient (Kappa).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The detection accuracy of burned area at the subpixel level by BASM-FERB's OA, UA, IoU, and Kappa is 98.11%, 81.72%, 74.32%, and 83.98%, respectively, better than BASM-RF's, BASM-BPNN's, BASM-SVM's, and BASM-notra's, even though BASM-RF's and BASM-notra's average PA is higher than BASM-FERB's, with 89.97%, 91.36%, and 89.52%, respectively. We conclude that the newly proposed BASM workflow can map burned areas at the subpixel level, providing greater accuracy in regards to the burned area for post-forest fire management and assessment.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Development of a Novel Burned-Area Subpixel Mapping (BASM) Workflow for Fire Scar Detection at Subpixel Level.

But as emergency requests are expected to grow because of climate change, the EU plans to invest in crisis-response aircraft, EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic said. <br/>\"These planes will be technically bought by the member states but they will be 100% financed by the European Union,\" said Lenarcic. <br/>Lenarcic declined to name the companies involved as contracts have not yet been signed, but said plans are to relaunch production of amphibious planes that scoop up water to douse fires. <br/>Thousands of firefighters across southern Europe were battling hundreds of wildfires in countries including Portugal, Spain and France on Monday, amid an intense heatwave that has caused hundreds of deaths. <br/>As climate change increases fire weather - heatwaves and dry conditions that mean fires can spread faster and burn longer once ignited - more countries are requesting emergency help to tackle blazes. <br/>The EU has already received five requests for help this year. With the Mediterranean not yet halfway through its typical June-September fire season, Lenarcic said Europe is facing a difficult summer. The EU received nine requests for assistance last year. <br/>The EU sent firefighting planes to countries including Portugal, France and Slovenia this month using the pool of aircraft from countries including Croatia, France and Spain. It also stationed 200 European firefighters in Greece to support local teams. <br/>EU countries are responsible for preventing and responding to forest fires, and request EU assistance only when they need back-up. <br/>Last year was the bloc's second-worst forest fire season on record. Over half a million hectares burned, compared with over a million hectares in 2017, the worst year on record. Already this year, more than 70,000 hectares have burnt in Spain alone, the highest of the last decade, according to Spanish government data. <br/>The EU's civil protection budget, which helps countries invest in preventing and responding to crises, was around 900 million euros in 2021. <br/>\"In the near future, it will have to be strengthened further,\" Lenarcic said, pointing to the increase in calls for assistance with climate-related emergencies, alongside other crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

According to news reporting out of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Created in 2014, the Serra da Gandarela National Park (SGNP), is repeatedly affected by wildfires. This Conservation Unit is located in the Iron Quadrangle (MG), in a transition zone between the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest biomes, and is characterized by a complex mosaic of phytophysiognomies.\"</p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG).<br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Federal University Minas Gerais, \"The aim of this investigation was to compare the performance of two risk mapping models for forest fire in the SGNP and its surroundings, based on two different approaches, being one by multicriteria analysis, AHP method and the other a simple probability method, called Hot Spot History, which provided information on the areas of highest and lowest risk and their environmental and human characteristics. Spatial data from remote sensing and GIS were used to simulate, in sequence, the fire ignition, the fire spread and, finally, the risk of wildfire. The validation of the risk models was performed by the Kappa coefficient (K). The results showed that the model based on the History of Hot Points obtained greater accuracy (0.61) than the model generated by the AHP method (0.54). The Brazilian Savanna, Rupestrian Fields and Field coverings were the most susceptible to wildfire, as they are formed by herbaceous vegetations and are located very close to urban agglomerations and roads.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The slopes oriented to the North and West were important for the prediction of wildfires slope and, on the other hand, the slope of the terrain was not important to discretize the areas of greater and lesser fragility to the referred ecological disturbance.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Susceptibility To Wildfire In a Conservation Unit Located In the Transition Region of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest Biomes, Brazil. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ciencia Florestal</emphasis>, 2022;32(1):451-473. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ciencia Florestal</emphasis> can be contacted at: Centro Pesquisas Florestais, Ufsm, Dept Ciencias Florestais, Campus Univ, Caixa Postal 5096, Santa Maria, Rs 00000, Brazil.<br/> Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting Heitor Carvalho Lacerda, Federal University Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Mg, Brazil.

We feel that Baillarg\u00e9 offers huge opportunities, and we are excited to add results from this region to our tally to go along with the drilling and work being done at Vall\u00e9e, together with our partners at Sayona Mining\u2019s North American Lithium.\u201d </p><p/><p>Figure 1 - CLM Regional Projects Map</p><p/><p/><p>Figure 2 - CLM Baillarg\u00e9 Project Map</p><p>The Baillarg\u00e9 Est Showing</p><p>The Baillarg\u00e9 Est Showing is located just south of Lac Baillarg\u00e9 within the northern half of CLM\u2019s Baillarg\u00e9 Property. Lithium mineralization was first found at Baillarg\u00e9 Est in 1955 by Amos Lithium Corporation Limited (\u201cAmos\u201d) (see Government of Quebec, Ressources Naturelles et For\u00eats, SIG\u00c9OM files GM 3404 and GM 4109-B at <url normalizedValue=\"https://sigeom.mines.gouv.qc.ca/signet/classes/I1103_index?format=COMPLET&amp;type_reqt=U&amp;mode=NOUVELLE&amp;l=A&amp;entt=GM&amp;alias_table_crit=F4E02&amp;mnen_crit=NUMR_INTER&amp;oper_crit=EGAL&amp;valr_crit=5454\">https://sigeom.mines.gouv.qc.ca/signet/classes/I1103_index?format=COMPLET&amp;type_reqt=U&amp;mode=NOUVELLE&amp;l=A&amp;entt=GM&amp;alias_table_crit=F4E02&amp;mnen_crit=NUMR_INTER&amp;oper_crit=EGAL&amp;valr_crit=5454</url>) who completed nineteen shallow drill holes targeting pegmatites just below surface to depths of less than 50 m from surface. The drilling encountered high-grade lithium mineralization in the form of spodumene in holes that targeted what CLM has now named Dyke 1 and Dyke 7.</p><p>Amos intentionally withheld assay results from half of the holes from their drill program from the Quebec Government. However, high concentrations of visible spodumene were reported in Amos\u2019 drill logs from several holes. High-grade lithium intersections were encountered from some holes that tested Dyke 7 that were reported (see Government of Quebec, Ressources Naturelles et For\u00eats, SIG\u00c9OM files GM 4109-B at <url normalizedValue=\"https://sigeom.mines.gouv.qc.ca/signet/classes/I1103_index?format=COMPLET&amp;type_reqt=U&amp;mode=NOUVELLE&amp;l=A&amp;entt=GM&amp;alias_table_crit=F4E02&amp;mnen_crit=NUMR_INTER&amp;oper_crit=EGAL&amp;valr_crit=5454\">https://sigeom.mines.gouv.qc.ca/signet/classes/I1103_index?format=COMPLET&amp;type_reqt=U&amp;mode=NOUVELLE&amp;l=A&amp;entt=GM&amp;alias_table_crit=F4E02&amp;mnen_crit=NUMR_INTER&amp;oper_crit=EGAL&amp;valr_crit=5454</url>). Highlights from the reported assays included 2.48% Li2O over 2.29 m from 8.53 m to 10.82 m in hole DDH#2 and 1.13% Li2O over 2.59 m from 8.07 m to 10.66 m in hole DDH#1. These two drill results were obtained from the Government of Quebec\u2019s Mineral Assessment file GM 4109B. The Company cautions the reader that those drill results are historical and do not necessarily conform to the requirements of National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. However, the Company does not have any reason to doubt the validity of the results, as our own observations show similar results (see channel sampling results below).</p><p>As defined by the outcrop stripping and historical Amos drilling, Dykes 7 &amp; 8 have a current combined strike length of 260 m, Dykes 1 &amp; 2 have a combined strike length of 120 m, and Dykes 3 &amp; 4 have a combined strike length of up to 190 m. These three known dykes are located within an area 375 m wide by 260 m long and all dykes remain open for expansion along strike to the northwest and southeast and at depth (see Figure 3). The Company also believes that the potential for the discovery of additional lithium-bearing dykes exist both between the existing dykes and adjacent to the Baillarg\u00e9 Est showing area.</p><p/><p>Figure\u00a03 - Baillarg\u00e9 Eastern Showing</p><p>Outcrop Stripping Program</p><p>The Company has commenced its Phase II outcrop stripping program to expand the known surface strike extent of the three identified spodumene-bearing pegmatite dyke systems that comprise the Baillarg\u00e9 Est occurrence. CLM undertook Phase I of the outcrop stripping program during the fall of 2022 (see the Company\u2019s news releases dated December 12, 2022 and March 16, 2023, which are also available on the Company\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>). The 2022 program was successful at extending the strike length of the three known pegmatite dyke systems.</p><p>CLM conducted channel sampling of the stripped Dykes 1 &amp; 2 and Dykes 7 &amp; 8 pegmatites during the 2022 campaign. Highlights from the channel sampling program included individual samples that assayed 2.36% Li2O over 0.5 m, 1.09% Li2O over 1.0 m, 0.97% Li2O over 1.0 m and Li2O 0.52% over 1.0 m from Dykes 7 &amp; 8 as well as 0.97% Li2O over 1.0 m from Dykes 1 &amp; 2. For details of the Company\u2019s sample testing procedures, please see the Company\u2019s news release dated December 12, 2022.</p><p>Diamond Drilling Program</p><p>Mobilization of a diamond drill to the property has been completed and drilling is currently underway. The Company is planning to drill up to 4,500 m in as many as 33 holes testing four main target areas at Baillarg\u00e9 Est. The highest priority target is the Dyke 7 &amp; 8 corridor below the high-grade 1955 Amos drill holes, underneath the outcrop stripping area and along strike to the northwest and southeast. Second priority will be the Dyke 1 &amp; 2 corridor, followed by the Dyke 5 area, and finally drill testing under the 2022 lithium-in-soil anomaly defined during the summer 2022 soil sampling program (see CLM news release dated March 16, 2023). Drill holes testing the known dykes will be initially spaced on 100 m wide fences and 50 m spacings to a depth of approximately 100 m. Infill fences at 50 m spacings and holes testing further down dip will be completed should results warrant.</p><p>No outcrop is present in the area of the lithium-in-soil anomaly target which covers an area of approximately 100 m by 75 m located between Dykes 3 &amp; 4 and 7 &amp; 8 (the \u201cBE anomaly\u201d). The BE anomaly is comprised of three B-horizon soil samples collected on a 50 x 50 m grid with samples ranging from 233 ppm Li to 310 ppm Li.</p><p>Soil Sampling Program</p><p>In 2022 the Company undertook a property-wide soil-sampling survey on a 400 x 200 m grid spacing. In addition to the BE anomaly, the Company defined five other lithium-in-soil anomalies where the lithium-in-soil concentration exceeded 200 ppm Li. The density of soil sampling was tightened to a 50 x 50 m grid in the Baillarg\u00e9 Est showing area, helping to further define the BE Anomaly.</p><p>The Baillarg\u00e9 Est pegmatites strike southeast towards the Chubb showing, located immediately east of the east property boundary. From various Quebec assessment reports and public disclosures by the Chubb Showing owner Burley Resources, the Chubb pegmatites strike northwest in the direction towards the Baillarg\u00e9 Est showing. The 1.2 km long area between the Baillarg\u00e9 Est and Chubb showings is located on the Company\u2019s property and has never been explored. A 248 ppm single sample lithium-in-soil anomaly was detected during the 2022 soil sampling program within the 400 x 200 m grid area along the east property boundary adjacent to the Chubb showing.</p><p>CLM will be undertaking a 50 x 50 m spaced infill soil sampling program to follow up this 248 ppm Li anomaly covering the area between the Baillarg\u00e9 Est and Chubb showings to define future drilling targets in the highly prospective Baillarg\u00e9 Lithium Corridor (see Figure 4).</p><p/><p>Figure 4 - 2023 Baillarg\u00e9 Exploration Program</p><p>About Soil SamplingSoil samples were collected from the B-horizon of the soil profile in plastic bags shipping to the laboratory for geochemical analysis. The analysis was undertaken by Impact Global Solutions Laboratory in Delson, Quebec. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the samples were dried, weighed, crushed, and split into subsamples of which one 250 g subsample was pulverized to allow 85% of the material to pass through a 75-micron sieve. The sieved subsample was digested in acid and analyzed using ICP-MS, ICP-OES, and SPF.</p><p>The Company implemented QA/QC procedures to ensure the validity of the sampling by using a series of field duplicates and reference standards in each batch of samples sent for analysis. A review of the field duplicates and reference standards indicate that the soil sample results are likely reasonably precise and accurate.</p><p>The Impact Global Solutions Laboratory is an ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited facility (#889) by the Standards Council of Canada and is independent from CLM.</p><p>Qualified PersonThe scientific and technical information contained herein has been reviewed and approved by Alexandr Beloborodov, P.Geo., an independent consultant that is a \u201cQualified Person\u201d as defined in National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.</p><p>About Consolidated Lithium Metals Inc.

Listen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's not only the first summit I've hosted at Camp David. It's the first-ever stand-alone summit between the leaders of Japan and Republic of Korea and the United States.</p><p>And I can think of no better way to mark our new chapter of our trilateral cooperation than meeting here at Camp David. Our countries are stronger, and the world will be safer as we stand together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: The trio's common goal today is to show unity and force in the face of a rising China and an increasingly provocative North Korea.</p><p>Jim?</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Also overseas, Russia is blaming Ukraine for another attempted drone strike on Moscow today, calling it a terrorist attack. A bit of irony there, given the number of missiles Russia has lobbed at Ukraine.</p><p>Moscow's mayor says the drone damaged a nonresidential building after they say it was shot down by Russian air defenses. The strike forced four Moscow airports to close.</p><p>It marks the third time in the past month that the Moscow district has been struck by a Ukrainian drone.</p><p>These alleged attacks in the Russian capital come as we learn U.S. officials are growing skeptical of another piece of Ukraine's strategy, and that is the decision to ramp up missile strikes specifically on Russian-occupied Crimea in southern Ukraine.</p><p>CNN's chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh, is in Dnipro, Ukraine, for us. Katie Bo Lillis is here in Washington.</p><p>So, Katie, explain the U.S. skepticism about this piece of the Ukrainian plan.</p><p>KATIE BO LILLIS, CNN REPORTER: Yes. So, Jim, it's against the backdrop of this stalled Ukrainian counteroffensive that Ukraine, in recent weeks, has turned to striking Crimea at an increased pace.</p><p>They're using missiles to strike bridges connected to Ukrainian mainland and Russia. They're using artillery to try to strike ammunition depots, logistic hubs and command-and-control hubs.</p><p>[13:35:05]</p><p>And for Crimea -- for Ukraine, the goal is to try to isolate Crimea and try to make it more difficult for Russia to be able to sustain its military operations on the mainland.</p><p>Now, U.S. military and intelligence officials that we've spoken to say it's a little bit too early to tell whether or not this is going to be effective at making it tougher for Russians to stand up to these Ukrainian offenses.</p><p>But more than that, Jim, what we are hearing is that, behind the scenes within the U.S. government, there is a growing sense of skepticism among some Biden administration and military officials that this tactic of hitting Crimea is really a good idea.</p><p>They're concerned that this is essentially spreading the resources too thin. At best, it's a distraction, at worst it is a waste of valuable resources at a time when the U.S. government broadly is worried that Ukraine has spread itself too thin across multiple axes of attack.</p><p>I want to share with you what we heard from a senior defense official who said to us it's knocked the Russians off balance a little bit, but it's not doing anything decisive. And it would probably be better for everyone for them to just focus on the counteroffensive.</p><p>SCIUTTO: See how they make that argument to the Ukrainians. They very much view Crimea as Ukrainian territory. It goes back to the 2014 invasion.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh, you are in Ukraine. As you know, Crimea's something of a bone of contention between the West and Ukraine because there are some in the West who think that may be a bridge too far, even if they do not recognize it as Russian-annexed territory.</p><p>From the Ukrainian perspective, how do they view these strikes that they've been able to carry out on Crimea and other places behind enemy lines, as it were?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, look, I think it's very true that there are concerns in the West that Crimea is a deep red-button issue for Vladimir Putin.</p><p>And that could potentially cause a ration of responses if they felt that significant part of Russia's, I think, pride in what they've tried to do in occupying parts of Ukraine were, indeed, threatened.</p><p>But I don't really get some of the skepticism about why hitting Crimea doesn't assist the counteroffensive. A lot of Russia's occupying military forces are in Crimea.</p><p>A lot of the supply route to the parts of the counteroffensive that the Russians are trying to hold back come up from Crimea and a function on that western part of the southern counteroffensive where a lot of Ukraine's push is happening right now.</p><p>So the strikes we've been seeing on ammo depots in northern Crimea, the northern bridges heading up from Crimea, around that area, certainly could have an impact on Russia's ability to hold Ukraine back south of Orakiv, an important part near that region where I'm standing.</p><p>Plus, also, too, the Kerch Bridge is another supply route that doesn't involve bringing weapons all the way across the Azov Sea, along that land corridor, also in peril potentially, too.</p><p>So I think a lot of what we're seeing here are concerns by the West about Crimea becoming the focus of Ukraine's energies. But, at the moment, that's pretty farfetched.</p><p>They're desperately trying to cut off the land corridor from Russian mainland that heads down to Crimea. In an ideal world, they might be able to push the Russians back to their 2014-2015 boundaries.</p><p>But they're still struggling to get towards the Azov Sea in the first stage of this counteroffensive.</p><p>And I think it's fair to say the Ukrainians see hitting these military infrastructure targets in Crimea as most certainly impacting Russia's ability to defend itself in that key part of the southern front -- Jim?</p><p>SCIUTTO: And Ukrainian forces suffering just devastating losses in that battle on the ground in the east.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh, there in Ukraine, thanks so much.</p><p>Katie Bo Lillis, here with me in D.C.</p><p>Boris, over to you.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Some 20,000 Canadians are fleeing their homes as wildfires are moving in. We have the latest from the region.</p><p>[13:38:55]</p><p>Plus, he's accused of brutally killing four University of Idaho students, and he's due in court today for a hearing focused on his alibi. The details, just minutes away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:43:33]</p><p>SANCHEZ: Now to some of the other headlines we're watching this hour.</p><p>The head of world soccer body, FIFA, getting flack today after telling women's soccer players they should pick the right battles if they want to, quote, \"convince us, men, what we have to do concerning equal pay.\" Yikes.</p><p>According to a recent CNN analysis, soccer players at the 2023 women's World Cup are going to average -- on average, earn just 25 cents for every dollar earned by the men at their World Cup last year. May want to pick his words a little bit more carefully.</p><p>Also, in a sharp break from an Arkansas state order, the Little Rock school district says it will offer an A.P. African-American studies course that will count towards graduation.</p><p>Earlier this month, Arkansas state education officials said the course would not receive graduation credits, citing an executive order signed in January by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p><p>That order prohibited what she described as indoctrination and critical race theory in schools.</p><p>We also want to share this with you, a frightening video captured on board a Southwest Airlines flight in the skies over Houston. Not what you want to see coming out of your plane engine.</p><p>Flames bursting out, forcing the distressed flight to quickly return to the Houston airport shortly after takeoff. Southwest says the plane landed safely and was taken out of service for review.</p><p>Jim?</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes, what a thing to see outside your plane window.</p><p>[13:44:59]</p><p>Well, dangerous fast-moving flames, not in Hawaii but ravaging parts of Canada. An out-of-control wildfire has now forced an entire city to evacuate.</p><p>The city of Yellowknife, home to approximately 20,000 people, the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, is now virtually empty.</p><p>A frantic scene there with hundreds of people lining up to register for emergency evacuation flights. Others had to flee in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the one road out of town. Many worried, not knowing if their homes will still be standing when they come back.</p><p>Officials say the fire has already burned more than 400,000 acres. Could reach the outskirts of Yellowknife this weekend.</p><p>CNN's Paula Newton joins us now from Ottawa with more details.</p><p>This is quite an evacuation underway here, an entire city, the capital of the Northwest Territories. How is it going?</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, the Canadian officials just wrapped, in fact, a press conference. They said that, thankfully, the evacuation is going well so far.</p><p>It has been calm. Traffic on that one highway, as you mentioned, traffic has calmed there. The route out is so far safe.</p><p>And I want to point out, Jim, how harrowing this can be. That route out actually goes right through the forest fire. Smoke has been thick there for several weeks.</p><p>And that is another reason why officials weren't taking any chances. I mean, look, Jim, we just saw what happened in Maui, right?</p><p>And they did not want this community, this large but, again, isolated community, to actually be left at the mercy of a wildfire where they just could not predict where it was going next, largely because of the wind.</p><p>What does that entail, Jim? As you can imagine, the most vulnerable are the concern right now. There is an unprecedented air lift going on right now that involves commercial airplanes but also the military.</p><p>I want you to listen now to Canada's minister of defense as he was just telling us how they are getting the most vulnerable out of the city. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL BLAIR, MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENCE OF CANADA: They have fit-for- purpose aircraft that are able to move people who may be non- ambulatory on stretcher or in wheelchair. And they can also provide medical personnel to provide support and assistance to those who may need it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, those who obviously need medical evacuation are going out on other kinds of aircraft.</p><p>Jim, I also want to point out that, in British Columbia at this hour, in Kelowna, they have another fire that is out of control. Thousands there warned to get out now. Others on alert.</p><p>Again, this is all part of an unprecedented wildfire season. Jim, already the worst in Canadian history.</p><p>And throughout this weekend, people in both the northwest in the United States, the Midwest and the northeast should watch the weather carefully and those alerts.</p><p>They do expect some of the smoke from these fires to dip down into the United States certainly by the weekend -- Jim?</p><p>SCIUTTO: Well, you see events in Kelowna, in Maui, and you see the importance of making evacuation decisions like this.</p><p>Paula Newton, in Ottawa, thanks so much.</p><p>Boris?</p><p>SANCHEZ: Next on CNN NEWS CENTRAL, the suspected killer of four Idaho college students in court right now. The major focus of today's proceeding? Bryan Kohberger's alibi, where he says he was during the murders.</p><p>Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:52:58]</p><p>SANCHEZ: Out for a late-night drive by himself -- that's the alibi attorneys of the accused killer of the slayings of four University of Idaho students are defending during a court hearing underway right now.</p><p>Bryan Kohberger has pled not guilty to four counts of the first-degree murder in the November 13th slayings.</p><p>But the state has argued he must provide a lot more details about his whereabouts that night, but the defense is now fighting that.</p><p>CNN's Jean Casarez has been following the case very closely.</p><p>So, Jean, how are things expected to play out in court today?</p><p>JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, let me tell you, Boris, the hearing has just started. And the defendant has a gray suit and tie, very formally dressed. He sat down very quickly next to his defense attorneys. Now there is argument underway.</p><p>And there are cameras in that courtroom. We are going to be able to see this hearing, every bit of it. But the judge's rule is not until the hearing is over will that video be distributed. So we'll have it as soon as it is culminated.</p><p>One of the big issues is, this trial, this death penalty trial, is supposed to start in about a month and a half.</p><p>Why? Because the defendant has exercised his right to a speedy trial, which means that it has to be held within six months after the indictment. He's even gotten a little bit of an extension.</p><p>Prosecutors, through their filings, want to know, when is this going to start?</p><p>Because we've got victim families that need to be prepared. There are so many reports. And discovery has to be exchanged. Are you sure you want it to start this soon? That's got to be looked at today.</p><p>Second, it's like you mentioned, that alibi. The defendant filed notice that he is seeking an alibi. He will have an alibi that he was not in that house that night when the murders were committed.</p><p>Well, he is supposed to give specifics, exactly where you were, witnesses who will testify their names, addresses, all the information, to state that you were not at that house.</p><p>Here is how the defense has responded in legal filings.</p><p>[13:54:58]</p><p>Quote, \"Mr. Kohberger has long had a habit of going for drives alone. Often, he would go for drives at night. He did so late on November 12 and into November 13, 2022.

We're not going to be vaccinating our way out of this to eight-plus billion people in the world right now.\"Osterholm also cautioned the world must adapt to the grim reality COVID-19 is here to stay.\"We've really got to come to grips with actually living with this virus, for at least my lifetime,' he said, 'and at the same time, it doesn't mean we can't do a lot about it.'Coping with COVID-19 will mean mass vaccinations. Osterholm said effective, safe and somewhat durable vaccines will be critical tools in fighting SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Routine revaccinations, like those for the flu, will be necessary to develop durable immunity to the virus.Osterholm described the global COVID-19 pandemic as a forest fire roaring full steam ahead because it has ample \"human wood\" to burn. </p><p>So long as there are new hosts, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to infect people. The U.S. is currently undergoing spikes in cases where human mitigation strategies ended, \"or they're not adhering to them,' Osterholm said. ' This is just one constant pressure that's occurring.\"Osterholm contends the U.S. has failed in its efforts to control the spread of the disease because it \"declared victory over the virus when we had no business doing so.\" The result is more than 4.4 million cases and 151,000 deaths, according to Thursday's latest figures[2] from Johns Hopkins University.\"It's like a fire crew,\" he noted. 'I only put out half the forest fire but you know, I put out half so we're done. And then look what happened. It's burned more acres since we gave up than it did before we gave up.\"Osterholm's views are similar to those of Dr. Anthony Fauci[3], director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). On July 22, Fauci said it's unlikely COVID-19 will ever be eradicated. He believes global cooperation to combat COVID-19, however, will bring the virus down to 'low levels.\"'I think with a combination of good public health measures, a degree of global herd immunity and a good vaccine, which I do hope and feel cautiously optimistic that we will get, I think when we put all three of those together, we will get control of this, whether it's this year or next year. I'm not certain,' he said.But, 'I don't really see us eradicating it.'

The recent rainfall has provided some relief to the dryness of the vegetation and has mitigated the immediate fire threat. \"Fire conditions have improved in the Southern California geographic area. No large active fires are burning, and resource availability remains at or above normal for this time of year. Initial attack resources remain plenty and readily available\" said Angeles National Forest fire chief Robert Garcia.</p><p>Historic patterns show the most severe wildfire losses occur during the months of Oct. through Dec., however, fire activity occurs throughout the year. The proximity of the forest to large population centers and continuing development within the wildland-urban interface create situations where the potential for catastrophic property damage and loss of life is still a concern for forest officials.</p><p>Moving the Fire Danger Level to Very High will allow campfires and stoves in developed recreation sites.</p><p>Restrictions include:</p><p>1. Building, maintaining, attending, or using a fire, campfire, or stove fire outside of a developed recreation site.</p><p>2. Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, a developed recreation site, or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter that is barren or cleared of all flammable material.</p><p>3. Welding, or operating an acetylene or other torch with open flame.</p><p>4.

But according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/biden-student-loan-forbearance-august-31/index.html\">CNN reporting</url>, he might cancel just $10,000 of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/politics/student-loan-decision-biden-explainer/index.html\">student loan debt</url> per borrower for those earning less than $125,000 a year. That would do little to help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Black Americans have been disproportionately devastated by student loan debt. Four years after graduating, they hold an average of almost $53,000 in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/black-white-disparity-in-student-loan-debt-more-than-triples-after-graduation/\">debt</url>, almost double the $28,000 average White Americans hold. And they typically end up owing 6% more than they initially borrowed, while White borrowers owe 10% less. Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire. It hardly achieves anything - only making a mere dent in the problem.</p><p>Biden must recognize and regard student debt as a racial and economic justice issue. Canceling $50,000 or more per borrower would free millions of Americans, allowing them to become more active participants in the US economy. It would also drastically reduce the racial wealth gap. And, after generations of racial oppression, it would finally open the door for so many Americans to become homeowners and generate wealth, not only for themselves, but also for their children and grandchildren.</p><p>America's economy has made it impossible for countless Black families to build intergenerational wealth, as they have faced discriminatory practices in education, homeownership and employment. Take homeownership, for example. Owning a home is the gateway to achieving the American Dream. It offers the prospect of generating intergenerational wealth. And yet, just 46% of Black Americans own a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/essay/homeownership-racial-segregation-and-policies-for-racial-wealth-equity/\">home</url>, while 76% of White Americans do. The tainted legacies of slavery and Jim Crow continue to further widen the socioeconomic racial gap between Black and White families, with Black neighborhoods continuing to be undervalued and school districts underfunded and lacking in student resources.</p><p>It's a vicious cycle: Because Black Americans have less wealth to start with (Black households have almost 10 times less <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">wealth</url> than White households), they have to take out larger loans, which puts them further behind when they graduate and enter an economy that is already stacked against them. As such, many have depended on predatory student loans, which have only made the problem worse. These loans carry high interest rates and fees, and terms that make them nearly impossible to repay. With little to no access to generational wealth, taking on these high-interest loans is often the only way for Black students to attend college. And with Black students paying their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/economy/unemployment-black-youth/index.html\">debt</url> at an average annual rate of 4%, compared to their White counterparts at 10%, their student debt interest rates only continue to grow over time, resulting in many Black graduates defaulting on their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/continued-student-loan-crisis-black-borrowers/\">loans</url>.</p><p>Many privileged and predominantly White Americans, who inherited generational wealth, have had the fortune of not depending on <url normalizedValue=\"https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RI_StudentDebtCancellation_IssueBrief_202106.pdf\">expensive loans</url> to begin with. They will likely benefit from $10,000 in cancellation to cover the remaining sum. But what about those in our society who did not inherit generational wealth?</p><p>We are fed up. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://naacp.org/campaigns/50k-beyond\">NAACP</url> has been calling for a minimum of $50,000 in student loan debt cancellation because our research indicates it is what is necessary to make a meaningful difference. The goal should be to see the most amount of relief for the highest number of borrowers. Even so, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/biden-student-loan-forbearance-august-31/index.html\">President Biden</url> has indicated that he is not considering a $50,000 debt reduction. But canceling just $10,000 in debt would be bad public policy and a devastating political mistake.</p><p>Racial disparities in the education system have only existed because lawmakers have allowed them to. This is Biden's chance to right the wrongs once and for all, and leave behind a memorable legacy of equity and racial and economic justice.         </p><p>             Opinion by Derrick Johnson and Wisdom Cole for CNN Business Perspectives         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The human-caused fire has burned about 4,000 acres.</p><p>California's biggest fire is the Washburn Fire, located in Yosemite National Park. It was reported on July 7 and has consumed about 3,300 acres.</p><p>Rose said local firefighters are in Utah and Alaska, but that the situation is in good shape overall.</p><p>County Emergency Management Director Thomas Lane said members of the county Fire Co-Op have been able to get some good training sessions completed.</p><p>One included an engine academy at Swan Lake in Flathead County.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Western News (Libby, Mont.)

Uglinica acquired the popcorn wagon from his boss, Jim Seckelmann, owner of the Mulch Center in Volo. Seckelmann told him, \"Do what you want with it,\" Uglinica said. So, when not working as a production supervisor at the center, Uglinica, who also is a Shriner with Medinah Shriners in Addison and married father of four, travels with the popcorn wagon to festivals, golf outings and other events throughout McHenry and Lake counties. </p><p>He sells freshly popped popcorn for $3 a bag (or whatever someone wants to donate). \"My rule of thumb is I don't care what we are raising money for. The only caveat is it has to be for children and there has to be a need,\" Uglinica said. Seckelmann spends about $50 for each event buying popcorn kernels, salt and coconut canola oil. Each event makes a few hundred dollars and every last cent earned \u2014 between $10,000 and $15,000 over the last six years \u2014 goes toward initiatives supporting homeless children and other children in need. Seckelmann hired a craftsman and his assistant from Wisconsin about 10 years ago to replicate an antique popcorn maker, he said. \"This hand-built, one-of-a-kind unit was placed on a 1928 Ford truck,\" Seckelmann said. \"It was our desire to help support the community. I have always been a big fan of popcorn, and now it's my pleasure to give it away.\" More than 10,000 bags of popcorn have been served and he looks forward to giving away many more and continuing to support communities. \"Kids have always been important to me,\" Uglinica said. \"They are just innocent. They can't really help themselves, and kids are our future.\" Between Oct. 1, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2022, out of the 433 homeless clients served by McHenry County, 106 were 18 years or younger, said Joe Davis, the administrator and planning consultant for Homeless Management Information System for McHenry County. About 98% of the time these children are homeless with their families, said Hans Mach, community development administrator for McHenry County. However, the numbers Davis provided do not include what Mach referred to as \"doubled-up\" clients. Those are children who may not have a home of their own and are living with other families. Uglinica sells popcorn at about 30 events a year. He recently sold popcorn at the downtown Richmond Cocoa Walk and all the money he raised through popcorn sales helped pay for holiday meals for about 40 families. He also raises funds at events hosted by police departments, sheriff's offices, local chambers of commerce and masonic lodges. The next scheduled event for the popcorn wagon will be Feb. 25 at the Lake County Craft Beer Festival at the county fairgrounds in Grayslake. \"All that money goes to the community from the community,\" he said of his grass-roots efforts. \"From their hand to my hand right to wherever it needs to go.\" Frank Heabler, head worship master at the McHenry Masonic Lodge, said Uglinica is \"a very involved person.\" \"We appreciate the time and effort he spends with bringing the popcorn wagon,\" Heabler said. \"It attracts people, and kids love the wagon. When we benefit, we let other people benefit. (Uglinica) is all about helping the communities.\" Though each event raises just a few hundred dollars at a time, Uglinica said the greater value is in making connections and raising awareness of the needs in local communities. Therese Matthys, executive director of Chain O' Lake's Area Chamber of Commerce and president of the Wonder Lake Community Club, has invited Uglinica to sell popcorn at various events. \"He has a huge heart,\" Matthys said. \"He is creating a huge amount of awareness of the homeless children (in Lake and McHenry counties).\" She said many are not aware that there is homelessness in their communities. \"The more we are aware of the need in our local communities the more people will step up,\" Matthys said. \"All you have to do is ask (for donations), and it is amazing. You just tell people \u2018here is what we are raising money for.' \" Uglinica, who often brings his daughters along to help sell popcorn, said the popcorn wagon also is about \"making people happy.\" His good works are not lost on his daughters either. \"I like it,\" said his daughter Reese, 10, whose twin sister, Riley and older sister, Amelia, 16, often help sell popcorn at events. \"He helps people.\" Reese said she sees her dad out selling popcorn after his regular job. Sometimes, when her dad sees someone wants popcorn but may not have any money, he gives it away. She said watching her dad inspires her to one day raise money for children. \"I would like go to the hospital and tell everybody, \u2018I'm going to have a charity here and help the kids,'\" she said. Amelia also likes helping her dad at fairs and other events. \"It's really nice being a part of being able to help other people in my community and around me, especially with my dad because it is like a family impact. It inspires me to help people,\" Amelia said. Uglinica hopes one day to start a foundation specifically to raise money to help homeless children.

The fire season is approaching for many. And governments grappling with Covid-19 are rolling back enforcement of environmental protections that are crucial for containing the fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Covid-19 makes the effort to reduce forest fires more urgent, not less. This is especially the case as those who are most affected by smoke from the fires older people, and people with pre-existing heart and lung diseases are also at higher risk if they contract the virus.</p><p>Recognizing how air pollution caused by smoke may increase vulnerability to Covid-19, British Columbia's Environment Ministry recently banned open burning of vegetative debris in areas at high-risk for wildfires. The Canadian province acted on a recommendation from its Center for Disease Control to reduce excess air pollution. In the US, the state of Colorado took similar measures to protect residents.</p><p>But they are the exception. In Brazil, most fires in the Amazon rainforest are intentionally set, often on illegally cleared land, chiefly between June and October. President Jair Bolsonaro's efforts to weaken environmental enforcement have led to a dramatic increase in deforestation, and last year's fires concentrated along these newly razed areas, scientists from NASA and the Brazilian space agency concluded. Environmental enforcement has continued to drop during the pandemic, with preliminary estimates of forest loss up by 50 per cent in 2020 compared with last year, according to government data.</p><p>In Indonesia, rather than relaxing enforcement, the authorities have scrapped regulations that keep illegal logging in check altogether. As of May, exporters will no longer need to obtain licenses verifying that their timber and wood products come from legal sources. The trade minister justified the move as part of a stimulus to boost the timber industry amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.</p><p>It is understandable that some governments might be tempted to reduce enforcement in the midst of the pandemic. But that would be a mistake for several reasons.</p><p>For one, curbing deforestation is essential to mitigate climate change, which in the long term threatens to have catastrophic consequences for human life and public health. As illegal logging and fires combine to shrink forests, they degrade ecosystems that play a crucial role as \"carbon sinks,\" absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming. Moreover, destruction of forests itself releases large quantities of carbon.</p><p>Recent studies indicate that deforestation is driving the Amazon rainforest toward an \"irreversible tipping point\" where it will dry out and degrade into shrubland, releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p><p>In the boreal forests of the northernmost parts of the world --, like the Russian taiga, fires are seasonal but there too, corruption and environmental crime are suspected of amplifying them. As with the Amazon, studies indicate that they might be reaching a tipping point. Absent effective conservation measures, boreal forests could turn into a savannah, and bigger, more frequent fires could cause them to start releasing more carbon than they store, a NASA-funded study found.</p><p>In addition to contributing to climate change, forest fires present a more immediate and very grave threat to public health. Every year, the smoke that rises from burning landscapes causes increased heart and lung diseases health conditions that increase the risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19 as well as thousands of premature deaths among people exposed to the haze.</p><p>In Australia, smoke from the bushfires caused more than 400 deaths and 3,000 hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Brazilian scientists affiliated with the Health Ministry found that, in the areas worst-affected by the fires in 2019, the number of hospitalizations of children with respiratory diseases doubled in May and June, at the very beginning of the fire season, totaling 5,000. Previously, Harvard and Columbia University scientists calculated that haze from Indonesia's fires in 2015 will result in 100,000 premature deaths across Equatorial Asia.</p><p>\"There's evidence that even short term exposure to poor air quality [such as that caused by haze from the fires] could make us vulnerable to respiratory infections,\" Dr. Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Human Rights Watch. Air pollution caused by the fires may lead to more severe symptoms or increased deaths among those with Covid-19, Dr. Bernstein said.</p><p>Other governments should follow British Columbia's and Colorado's lead and step up their own efforts to contain the coming fire season. Such measures will protect health in the short and long term as we fight Covid-19, future viral respiratory epidemics, and the catastrophic health effects of climate change that are already beginning to be felt.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123706684</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYC-XW41-DYTH-G4P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 20, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Gorton Community Center offers a wide range of week-long summer camps for toddlers to teens. We focus on offering exceptional arts and culture to the community, and our summer camps embody that vision. </p><p>Camps run from June to August and encompass a wide range of experiences \u00e2\u20ac\" all taught by local, experienced professionals in our historic building in Lake Forest. Summer Camps at Gorton offer a chance for your child to learn something new, make new friends, build independence, explore talents and express his/her creativity. The camps we offer vary week to week, so you can customize your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camp experience. We will be offering a lunch program again this year, so you can count on Gorton for a full-day camp experience! 'We're thrilled to offer camps at Gorton this summer,\u00e2\u20ac said Libby Johnson, Program Director at Gorton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have worked diligently with our staff and instructors to do this safely. I know summer camp was a highlight of my childhood and it's part of my mission to do the same for this community.\u00e2\u20ac A cornerstone of Gorton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summer camp program is Safety Town. Entering its ninth year as a summer favorite, Safety Town is an interactive safety awareness program. Two sessions are offered for two age groups: From June 9-12, Safety Town Majors (for 5-7 year olds) will take place. Children in this camp learn about everything from stranger danger to fire safety, pet safety and more. The program is taught by certified teachers with hands-on topics led by community guest speakers as well as visits from the Lake Forest Police Department and Lake Forest Fire Department. Teen volunteers lead the children through camp every day and receive valuable training along with obtaining community service hours. Campers learn about pedestrian safety by tricycling through a miniature town complete with streets, sidewalks, buildings, stop signs, and a working traffic signal. From August 11-13, Safety Town Commanders (for 8 to 10-year-olds) will be underway. This camp focuses on everything from gun safety to internet safety and is very interactive with lots of outdoor activities. With the help of community partners like the Lake Forest Fire Department, Lake Forest Police Department and Lake Forest Open Lands Association. This camp is dynamic and engaging, and the content is invaluable! Keep your kids safe and sign up now! All Gorton camps will be conducted within CDC guidelines and we are ready to pivot should we need if there are any mitigations or changes in the status of the pandemic and how it is affecting our community. Learn more about our camps on our website, or by calling us at 847-234-6060.

Biosolids are a product of the wastewater treatment process. Yes, that means sewage. However, the sewage is treated carefully to ensure it has beneficial properties and is not harmful.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biosolids are produced by separating liquids from the solids in wastewater. The solids are then treated to produce a semisolid that is nutrient rich. Jim Ippolito, a professor at Colorado State University, is an expert on the years of work on biosolids and its benefits. He and a colleague, Ken Barbarick, recently reviewed 45 years of biosolids land application research.</p><p>\"All of this research occurred in Colorado, which in and of itself is amazing. Most other states don't have the same level or depth of research history,\" Ippolito says. \"Regardless, we highlight early work where scientists were using basic soil science knowledge to tackle the use of this product. We also discuss current discoveries where biosolids improve soil health in various ecosystems.\"</p><p>The research was published in the Journal of Environmental Quality, a publication of the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.</p><p>When and why did the use of biosolids begin? It can be traced back to the United States Clean Water Act of 1972. The act gave the Environmental Protection Agency a mission to govern potential water pollution. Part of this was setting standards for municipalities to meet when cleaning their wastewater prior to discharge. Cleaning wastewater generates biosolids, which also have federal regulations.</p><p>\"As far as I know, there are no other biosolids review articles that span the timeframe between the creation of the Clean Water Act to present,\" he says. \"This overarching review article is a one-stop shop for anyone interested in the beneficial reuse of biosolids. Our research highlights the benefits of biosolids land application to raise plants to feed animals, to raise crops to feed people, and to do these things safely.\"</p><p>Over the years, scientists have found many benefits of biosolids. One is that biosolids can be applied to semi-arid agricultural areas and supply crops, such as wheat and corn, with more of the mineral, zinc. This means that humans and animals can benefit from zinc consumption by eating these crops. This is particularly useful while billions of people across the world do not get enough zinc in their diet.</p><p>\"Micronutrients, like copper and zinc, found in biosolids actually come from the entire municipal infrastructure, such as copper piping and zinc solder,\" Ippolito explains. \"They are likely also present because they are necessary nutrients for plants, animals, and humans. Furthermore, we shed these and other elements when we go to the bathroom. They concentrate in biosolids along with copper and zinc from the municipal infrastructure.\"</p><p>Many cities have their own biosolids recycling systems.</p><p>Biosolids have been found to improve the health of the soil in semi-arid grazed rangeland settings to allow plant growth as a source of food for cattle. In the face of a rapidly changing climate, it can make the landscape more resilient.

This ban, effective starting Saturday, August 20, includes all campfires at designated campground and picnic areas. Campers at State campgrounds and management areas, as well as State park patrons, will be permitted to use portable gas cooking stoves and grills, liquefied or bottled fuels, and propane/liquid-fueled lanterns in designated areas. These prevention measures are in place to reduce the threat of human-caused wildfires that can seriously threaten life and property. DEM will continue to monitor and evaluate conditions to determine when the ban can be lifted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rhode Island is in an extreme drought and is witnessing increased wildfires with joint fire response from communities. On Saturday, August 20, DEM's Forest Fire Program will increase fire restrictions to Planning Level Stage IV (PL4). This designation follows the National Fire Danger Rating System, which assesses the potential wildfire risk by considering burning conditions, wildfire activity, and the availability of firefighting resources.</p><p>Any outdoor fire is a potential source of wildfire. In 2022 alone, Rhode Island has experienced over 70 reported wildfires, with 42 acres of land burned. People should be cautious not to inadvertently spark a wildfire while cooking outdoors, kindling a campfire, or using fireworks. The following safety tips should be followed to minimize risk:</p><p>&amp;#149; Charcoals used for cooking must be cold before being discarded</p><p>&amp;#149; People who smoke should use ashtrays</p><p>&amp;#149; People should check with their local fire department to obtain a permit to burn. Fire departments have the authority to deny permits when conditions are too dangerous</p><p>&amp;#149; It is important that communities and individual homeowners understand the risks of wildfire and take appropriate steps to protect and maintain to mitigate the impacts of fire in its severity and rate of spread. By staying up to date on DFE's homeowner resources, conditions and exercising caution, we can all mitigate the risk of wildfires.</p><p>People are also reminded of Smokey Bear's basic rules of fire prevention:</p><p>&amp;#149; Only you can prevent wildfires</p><p>&amp;#149; Always be careful with fire</p><p>&amp;#149; Never play with matches or lighters</p><p>&amp;#149; Always watch your campfire</p><p>&amp;#149; (If permitted) make sure your campfire is completely out before leaving it</p><p>Green bonds support what we all love about Rhode Island &amp;#151; clean blue waters, green spaces, and vibrant communities. If approved by the voters, the proposed 2022 Green Bonds (Question 3) will invest in open space, outdoor recreation, land revitalization, green energy, climate resilience, forest, habitat, wildlife conservation, water quality, and new facilities at Roger Williams Park and Zoo. This includes $3M slated for forest health management and wildlife habitat projects at state management areas. Rhode Island's forests and trees may seem like a green backdrop to our landscape, but they are in fact hard at work generating a wide range of services and values. Forests are a place where humans and native wildlife can live and thrive by providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans. They also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion, purify our air, clean our water, and mitigate climate change.</p><p>Keep yourself informed by following Rhode Island Division of Forest Environment, Wildland Fire Control (DFE) for daily conditions updates.

Biosolids are a product of the wastewater treatment process. Yes, that means sewage. However, the sewage is treated carefully to ensure it has beneficial properties and is not harmful.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biosolids are produced by separating liquids from the solids in wastewater. The solids are then treated to produce a semisolid that is nutrient rich. Jim Ippolito, a professor at Colorado State University, is an expert on the years of work on biosolids and its benefits. He and a colleague, Ken Barbarick, recently reviewed 45 years of biosolids land application research.</p><p>\"All of this research occurred in Colorado, which in and of itself is amazing. Most other states don't have the same level or depth of research history,\" Ippolito says. \"Regardless, we highlight early work where scientists were using basic soil science knowledge to tackle the use of this product. We also discuss current discoveries where biosolids improve soil health in various ecosystems.\"</p><p>The research was published in the Journal of Environmental Quality, a publication of the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.</p><p>When and why did the use of biosolids begin? It can be traced back to the United States Clean Water Act of 1972. The act gave the Environmental Protection Agency a mission to govern potential water pollution. Part of this was setting standards for municipalities to meet when cleaning their wastewater prior to discharge. Cleaning wastewater generates biosolids, which also have federal regulations.</p><p>\"As far as I know, there are no other biosolids review articles that span the timeframe between the creation of the Clean Water Act to present,\" he says. \"This overarching review article is a one-stop shop for anyone interested in the beneficial reuse of biosolids. Our research highlights the benefits of biosolids land application to raise plants to feed animals, to raise crops to feed people, and to do these things safely.\"</p><p>Over the years, scientists have found many benefits of biosolids. One is that biosolids can be applied to semi-arid agricultural areas and supply crops, such as wheat and corn, with more of the mineral, zinc. This means that humans and animals can benefit from zinc consumption by eating these crops. This is particularly useful while billions of people across the world do not get enough zinc in their diet.</p><p>\"Micronutrients, like copper and zinc, found in biosolids actually come from the entire municipal infrastructure, such as copper piping and zinc solder,\" Ippolito explains. \"They are likely also present because they are necessary nutrients for plants, animals, and humans. Furthermore, we shed these and other elements when we go to the bathroom. They concentrate in biosolids along with copper and zinc from the municipal infrastructure.\"</p><p>Many cities have their own biosolids recycling systems.</p><p>Biosolids have been found to improve the health of the soil in semi-arid grazed rangeland settings to allow plant growth as a source of food for cattle. In the face of a rapidly changing climate, it can make the landscape more resilient. Ippolito says that findings like these are highly valuable because one third of all land in the United States is rangeland or pastureland.</p><p>Additionally, biosolids have been tested and found to be useful in other applications, such as when a landscape is recovering from a forest fire or when land has been mined. They provide energy for soil microorganisms which, in turn, improve nutrient cycling that helps plants thrive across landscapes.</p><p>\"We've done a lot of good for the state of Colorado and other similar states in terms of beneficially reusing this product that would otherwise be landfilled,\" Ippolito says. \"Why throw away something that is beneficial? I've essentially modeled my career around ways to use biosolids and other products to improve environmental quality in a sound manner.\"</p><p>Jim Ippolito gives special thanks to Dr. Ken Barbarick for creating a legacy in Colorado biosolids land application research.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Journal of Environmental Quality <url normalizedValue=\"https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jeq2.20376\">https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jeq2.20376</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.soils.org/news/media-releases/releases/2022/0921/1440/\">https://www.soils.org/news/media-releases/releases/2022/0921/1440/</url></p><p>[Category: Agriculture]</p><p>Contact: Susan V.

Jimmy Panetta, D-California, issued the following news release on Aug. 17, 2022:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) voted for historic legislation to reduce prescription drug prices, cap out-of-pocket medical expenses for seniors, and substantially invest in clean energy to slash carbon output, and cut the federal deficit. As summarized below, the bill, once signed by President Joe Biden, will make significant investments in clean energy and transportation programs, empower Medicare to negotiate drug prices with drug companies, lower Affordable Care Act premiums, and increase funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) operations to make it work more efficiently and assist with investigations of those who are purposefully cheating on or failing to pay their taxes. The bill contains several tax credits that were authored by Rep. Panetta that are related to electric buses, microgrid controllers, and linear generators and contains a significant amount of increased funding for National Marine Sanctuaries construction advocated for by Rep. Panetta.</p><p>\"For far too long, the United States Government has fallen short when it comes to living up to its claims on climate change, reducing our deficit, and lowering prescription drug prices. With this consequential and bold legislation, we are doing more than just talking or yelling about things, we are actually acting, working, and legislating to incentivize investment in clean energy to reduce our carbon output by 44% come 2030, put a cap on insulin prices and cut drug prices for seniors, and shrink our federal deficit by $300 billion over the next decade,\" said Rep. Panetta. \"As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, I'm proud to have authored several parts of this legislation on tax credits for clean energy buses, microgrids, and linear generators. In my limited time in Congress, what I've come to realize is that no matter how much some people yell and scream on television or post on social media, this job is about legislating for our future. This major legislation and our leadership today will provide the foundation to help fight inflation by reducing the price of health care for our seniors, set a path forward to lowering our federal deficit, and foster a healthier, more sustainable planet for tomorrow.\"</p><p>The new law will include the following summarized provisions:</p><p>Health care</p><p>* Allows Medicare to negotiate directly over the prices of specific high-cost drugs.</p><p>* Extends financial aid established during the pandemic for Affordable Care Act beneficiaries until 2025.</p><p>* Limits the amount of money that Medicare recipients pay out of pocket for prescription medications to $2,000 per year.</p><p>* Caps the cost of insulin at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>Climate Change</p><p>* Incentivizes consumers to participate in clean energy by offering tax credits and rebates to those who reduce their carbon emissions: $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs for low-income households; a net $11,500 in consumer tax credit for low- and middle-income families to buy clean energy vehicles; $1 billion in grants programs to make energy efficient affordable housing.</p><p>* Builds infrastructure designed to reduce carbon emissions: $30 billion investment in solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries.</p><p>* Includes new tax credits for microgrid controllers and linear generators to increase local resiliency, based on Congressman Panetta's MICROGRID Act and Clean Energy Production Parity Act.</p><p>* Includes new clean commercial vehicle credits, including green buses, based on Congressman Panetta's Green Bus Tax Credit Act.</p><p>* Reduces carbon emissions in industrial manufacturing by enforcing a methane emissions reduction program that will reduce methane leaks during the production of gas.</p><p>* Offers $5 billion in grants to support forest fire resiliency and urban tree planning.</p><p>Deficit Reduction</p><p>* Creates a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations with over $1 billion in profits.</p><p>* Provides $80 billion for the IRS to advance auditing capabilities, investigate wealthy tax evaders, improve taxpayer services, modernize technology, and hire more employees with specialized skill sets.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://panetta.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-panetta-votes-landmark-legislation-reduce-prices-prescription-drugs-cut\">https://panetta.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-panetta-votes-landmark-legislation-reduce-prices-prescription-drugs-cut</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-7922541 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7922541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6661-C8K1-JC11-10TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"728\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 18, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is this exact phenomenon that makes building more housing on Manayunk's Venice Island - which sits in the middle of the Schuylkill, the easternmost tip just one mile ahead of the junction with Wissahickon Creek - such a dicey proposition. But it is important to realize the root cause of these developments: rising demand to live in the neighborhoods between the Schuylkill and Wissahickon Creek, coupled with restrictive policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like most Philadelphia neighborhoods, Roxborough and Manayunk saw limited development for decades. Then, seemingly overnight, things changed. A surge of demand hit the neighborhood, sending home values skyrocketing and grabbing the attention of developers. Today, the neighborhood is filled with new construction twins and townhomes, some listed for as much as $900,000. There's also been a boom in apartment buildings, especially along RidgeAvenue and Main Street. As a result, some residents have said, \"Enough.\"</p><p>It is certainly understandable to have a negative reaction to rapid change in a neighborhood you love. Roxborough and Manayunk are hardly alone in seeking to limit multifamily development going forward. Chestnut Hill, Germantown, Society Hill, Mount Airy, Strawberry Mansion, and Point Breeze are just a few of the Philadelphia neighborhoods that have sought to stymie new residential developments by creating historic designations, special zoning districts, and using other restrictions.</p><p>While these changes may accomplish what some of their supporters desire - minimal changes to the built environment of these neighborhoods - they do nothing to mitigate the strong demand for housing. Until that happens, the pressure to create more units will push developers into risky areas, such as Venice Island.</p><p>It would be easier, cheaper, and more profitable to build apartments along Main Street itself, or along Ridge Avenue in Roxborough. Not only are these locations drier than Venice Island, they are in the heart of their neighborhoods, close to the shopping, dining, and cultural attractions that drive the interest of renters and buyers in the first place.</p><p>For years, that's what the zoning called for, too. Mixed-use residential buildings up to 45 feet tall, with the traditional Main Street arrangement of locating housing above retail businesses, were allowed to be constructed along the avenue. Earlier this year, however, the city changed the zoning to make Ridge Avenue into a more suburban-style corridor, where housing is prohibited.</p><p>In addition to downzoning the Ridge, the area has also seen historic districts proliferate. While these districts are popular with some neighbors, they aren't popular with others. As Roxborough resident Kate Riestenberg told me earlier this year, the overlay gives the Philadelphia Historical Commission \"quite a bit of jurisdiction over what we can and can't do with the exterior of our home,\" and can inflate the cost of repairs and renovations. Using a historic district to stymie multifamily development \"doesn't make sense in a world with climate change and a housing crisis,\" Riestenberg said.</p><p>To placate neighborhoods opposed to more construction, Philadelphia has taken a path of least resistance - pushing development away from the heart of our neighborhoods and to the fringes of the city, like the Navy Yard and Venice island. This may make life easier for elected officials, who have to face fewer town hall meetings with angry homeowners, but it is a disaster for the environment<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></p><p>One alternative is infill development - a method of building new housing in previously underutilized spaces, such as vacant lots or abandoned commercial spaces - which has the potential to reduce emissions by up to 40%. The reluctance to do so leads to situations like we're seeing on Venice Island, which is far from the only environmentally risky place that's seen development as a result of anti-infill sentiment. Decades of restrictive zoning in California have been blamed for the increased development of land in forest fire territory.</p><p>Infill development may be a new phenomenon for many Philadelphians, but its existence is a sign that the city is emerging from a long period of economic stagnation and population drought. As Alex Armlovich, senior housing policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, told me, \"Healthy cities permit enough new housing to keep up with job growth and to replace aging or damaged units over time. Any city that doesn't will find itself with an unfortunate combination of scarce and expensive, yet old and dilapidated, housing.\"</p><p>Philadelphia has a choice: Embrace some level of infill development, orwatch the flood of housing demand push into more and more unsuitable areas, like Venice Island.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Daniel Pearson is an opinion staff writer at The <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Inquirer.dpearson@inquirer.com\">Inquirer.dpearson@inquirer.com</email></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">267-854-7798</emphasis> t <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">DPearsonPHL</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20221019Ar01301</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66N7-2PY1-DYJT-20N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 19, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096KO</classCode><className>HOUSING MARKET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

An Agriculture Department program that got an infusion of cash from the Inflation Reduction Act is offering an early test of President Joe Biden's promise to help disadvantaged communities through clean energy. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) received over $2 billion from the climate law to help farmers and rural small businesses install solar, wind and other energy technologies and improve energy efficiency. But the program's long-standing inclusion of biomass energy, as well as changes this year to how projects are selected, has some environmental groups and legal experts concerned about potential negative impacts for low-income and minority communities. The controversy underscores a debate about how agencies should implement the Biden administration's Justice40 initiative, which aims to ensure that 40 percent of federal clean energy and climate funds help communities disproportionately affected by pollution. In particular, is locating clean energy in those communities enough to ensure that nearby residents benefit?</p><p> And which technologies should count as clean? \"It's kind of a new approach, and I think there are some unintended consequences,\" Andy Olsen, senior policy advocate at the Chicago-based nonprofit Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center, said of the Justice40 component to REAP. Justice40 is central to Biden's plan for environmental justice, which aims to reduce environmental harms in low-income communities of color and ensure that those communities benefit from a clean energy transition. Federal agencies are now trying to align long-standing programs with Justice40 as the Inflation Reduction Act's vast array of grants, loans and other funding opportunities start to roll out. To that end, the Department of Agriculture announced changes in March to REAP, which promotes energy independence and clean energy while benefiting farmers and rural areas. Established in its current form in 2008, the program offers grants and loan guarantees to offset the costs of energy projects installed by agricultural producers and rural small businesses. The department will give additional \"points\" under its scoring system to proposed energy projects in disadvantaged communities, such as areas facing high levels of pollution, unemployment and poverty. That would essentially make all eligible energy proposals located in predominantly low-income areas more competitive for REAP grants. \"The changes in scoring criteria announced in March will ensure even more REAP projects are supporting these communities,\" Allan Rodriguez, press secretary for USDA, said in an emailed statement. Adjustments to the scoring process come as REAP has been in the spotlight on Capitol Hill. While the program was historically popular among Democrats and Republicans in Congress, some GOP lawmakers have recently sought to claw back some of its funding. REAP advocates have attributed that push to Republicans' broader criticism of last year's Inflation Reduction Act. The climate law also directed USDA to set aside some REAP funds for \"underutilized\" technologies, which include biomass generated from organic materials such as animal waste, wind, geothermal energy, hydrogen and other eligible projects excluding solar or energy efficiency. While those technologies have long been eligible for REAP grants, the program has predominantly funded solar and energy efficiency in recent years. Of the record $1.055 billion currently available for grants through Sept. 30, 2024, at least $144.5 million will support the designated underutilized technologies, the agency announced in response to the law. That will help diversify the types of projects funded through REAP, said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the American Biogas Council, an industry trade association. \"What you saw in the rule changes with the REAP scoring was [USDA] trying to create an opportunity for some of these technologies to be utilized in rural America,\" Serfass said. \"If you look at different ways of promoting renewable energy on agricultural land, sure, wind and solar are possible, but they're not the only options that are out there.\" Environmental justice advocates, however, say that it's unclear how low-income communities will benefit from hosting more REAP-funded projects, given that there are no requirements laid out in the new rules that communities receive jobs, tax revenue or other specific benefits. \"Based on this new change in scoring, the assumption seems to be that all of these projects are beneficial to the local community, but that's not necessarily true,\" said Ryke Longest, a clinical professor of law at the Duke University School of Law. Sherri White-Williamson, director of environmental justice strategy at the North Carolina Conservation Network, said the changes could incentivize more biomass projects in some rural parts of the state. White-Williamson resides in Sampson County, N.C., where a high concentration of industrial hog farms has spurred growing interest in agricultural-based biogas projects. The projects often involve the use of digesters, which are used to help break down animal waste and capture methane in a form known as biogas. But White-Williamson said these projects can exacerbate ammonia emissions depending on the exact technology used. \"Our concern, seeing what we're seeing on the ground, is that a large industrial farm could go to the USDA and say, 'We're going to put a digester in this [disadvantaged] community,' and for that, they'll get 15 extra points,\" White-Williamson said, referring to the scoring system for REAP grants. \"But that doesn't require that they use the best available technology, and it doesn't protect communities where they're going to be putting the digester.\" Some lawmakers are interested in reforming REAP to ensure that the program is funding climate-friendly projects. On Thursday, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.) and Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) introduced the proposed REAP Modernization Act, which would, among other changes, increase USDA's outreach to small businesses and farmers and make greenhouse gas emissions reductions a central part of the program. Pollutants and revenue Biomass energy can be generated from a range of materials, including wood, pig poop and food scraps. It is generally considered a form of renewable energy, because those materials are abundant and can be regrown or regenerated. \"Biomass is a responsible, carbon beneficial renewable energy source that provides the added benefits of forest fire risk reduction, the utilization of otherwise unusable organic materials, and abundant well-paying rural jobs,\" Carrie Annand, executive director of the Biomass Power Association, said in an email. Still, biomass can have adverse environmental impacts, depending on the technology. The burning of wood pellets for fuel, for example, releases carbon dioxide. Today, a growing number of wood pellet production plants are located in low-income communities of color across the South, said Heather Hillaker, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The plants emit volatile organic compounds and fine particulate matter, worsening smog and air quality, she said. The U.S. Industrial Pellet Association, a trade group for the pellet production industry, did not respond to requests for comment, but it has touted forest biomass as a low-carbon alternative to coal. Several companies that produce wood pellets have received grants from REAP, according to records of past awards. \"This industry has really exploded in the past decade really,\" Hillaker said. \"A lot of these communities that I'm working with are in what we would consider an environmental justice community.\" In the case of biomass derived from farms, livestock waste emits biogas, which is composed primarily of methane. The methane can then be captured and used for heating, electric power or other energy needs and is sometimes referred to as renewable natural gas. A primary technology for facilitating the breakdown of waste on a farm and capturing the ensuing methane emissions is the digester, which USDA has helped fund through REAP grants. In addition to preventing the release of climate-warming emissions, digesters can help reduce odors from industrial farms, said Mark Rice, retired former director of the Animal and Poultry Waste Management Center at North Carolina State University. Still, the technology itself does not solve the other environmental impacts of industrial farm waste, such as the release of excess nutrients and heavy metals into the surrounding environment, Rice said. Nutrient runoff has been a major problem, he said, in North Carolina, the second largest hog-producing state after Iowa and the largest recipient of REAP grants over the years. \"From an environmental standpoint, other than capturing the biogas - the methane and CO2 - you haven't really done anything to protect the environment, especially from a nutrient standpoint, which in my opinion, is the bigger issue in North Carolina from an air quality and water quality standpoint,\" Rice said. But Serfass of the American Biogas Council said criticisms of digesters often miss the mark. Digesters that cover a farm's waste lagoon can bring ammonia emissions from the waste system to \"next to zero,\" he said. Digesters can also help small farmers stay in business by allowing them to sell biogas to utilities or other companies, according to Serfass. \"What biogas systems are doing is adding a revenue stream to these farms while solving an environmental challenge at the same time,\" he said. \"It's no wonder the USDA wants these biogas systems to be deployed,\" Serfass added. \"What's surprising is that [some] environmental groups are against them.\" Responding to criticisms about REAP's funding of biomass projects, Rodriguez of USDA noted that the \"vast majority\" of projects funded the over the years have been solar and energy efficiency projects. \"Each application is reviewed for compliance with the National Environmental Protection Act,\" Rodriguez said. \"REAP is a competitive program, and applications that include evidence of positive environmental impacts receive higher priority.\" Passing the 'smell test' The debate over REAP reflects a governmentwide scramble to allocate an unprecedented amount of energy and climate funds in accordance with environmental justice principles, which may be new for many state and federal agencies, observers said. Gregory Pierce, co-executive director of the Luskin Center for Innovation at UCLA, said he understands why the administration is eager to get money flowing, considering that the Inflation Reduction Act is the largest climate spending package in U.S. history. At the same time, it has been difficult for advocates to keep up with the different environmental justice metrics and definitions that agencies are using, said Pierce, whose research focus includes environmental justice. \"For advocates like myself, there's too much going on for them to provide input on each individual program,\" he said. \"I get the urgency, but it would seem that we'd want to take a little more time.\" In USDA's case, the agency is identifying disadvantaged communities through the White House Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which considers an area's income level, exposure to environmental pollution, health outcomes and other factors. All communities within the boundaries of federally recognized tribes and Alaska Native villages are also considered disadvantaged, USDA's Rodriguez said. USDA is also using a separate index established by the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan think tank, for identifying economically distressed communities. Energy projects in either distressed or disadvantaged communities as identified by the CEQ screening tool would be eligible for the additional points under REAP's scoring system. \"I get why, if you don't have another definition, you just use a project that's located in a disadvantaged community as the definition,\" Pierce said. \"Generally, I think that's pretty crude, but it's also better than using nothing.\" USDA's Rural Development division, which oversees REAP, is incorporating guidance from Biden's environmental justice executive orders, as well. In April, for example, the president signed an order directing federal agencies to increase engagement with underserved communities, conduct new assessments of their environmental justice efforts and coordinate more with other agencies, among other directives. \"Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA Rural Development continues to partner with national and local community leaders to ensure all Americans have access to clean energy systems and infrastructure,\" Rodriguez, the agency press secretary, said in an email. The agency declined requests for a phone interview, but Rodriguez noted that the updated scoring criteria for REAP also include a separate new category for projects that result in environmental benefits. Projects that don't directly emit greenhouse gases, do not convert farmland or contribute to deforestation, and help conserve water could receive some of those points, making them more likely to receive REAP grants. While the environmental benefits category could help ensure that the agency is funding sustainable projects, Longest of Duke University said that USDA will need to vet projects vigorously. \"Given how large this expenditure of money is, how carefully are people going to examine those score sheets to see if it actually passes the smell test?\" Longest said. The agency has been receptive to recommendations regarding how it could further address environmental justice through REAP, said Olsen of the Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center. Still, in the case of grants for facilities that produce or burn wood pellets, there should be a \"standardized, robust carbon analysis\" to ensure that federally funded projects aren't resulting in greenhouse gas emissions, Olsen said. \"If they're carbon positive, they shouldn't be getting the incentives, period,\" he said. As for biogas digesters, the agency should require that projects funded through REAP include technologies to keep ammonia from farm waste systems \"out of the air\" and to protect water quality, according to Olsen. Serfass of the American Biogas Council, however, said that many digesters already separate out the ammonia and that such a requirement could be expensive. \"If we require that extra cost, what happens? Food prices go up. Or, profit margins go down and you put farms out of business,\" Serfass said. As farms and businesses begin applying for funds from REAP, Longest said he hopes that applicants will connect with environmental experts to ensure that their projects are benefiting disadvantaged communities. \"A billion dollars is a pretty loud signal. That's going to attract projects that are primarily premised on an economic rate of return, rather than an environmental benefit,\" Longest said. \"What I want to make sure people understand is there are professionals at EPA, at the state level and at local resource agencies who can help those entities design good projects that will actually achieve multiple environmental benefits and make the community safer.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENWIRE-0000018954dad652a3ed7ede8de20001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6915-W0F1-DYSH-T149-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">477201</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Energywire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 27, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But a chance to experience a wilderness camp leads Addy away from her comfort zone, along with five other kids, and across the country to Paradise Ranch. Out in the California forest, Addy has the opportunity to learn essential wilderness skills. However, her worst nightmare occurs when a deadly forest fire leaves Addy and her friends fighting for their lives in the woods. Now it's up to Addy to take all that she's learned at camp to survive. Rhodes delivers another gripping story about loss, resilience, and healing. Addy's anxiety over her parents' deaths is handled beautifully through her transition from mapper of escape routes to proper wilderness cartographer. Addy's restorative journey is realistically bumpy as she fights to accept that she can't live her life waiting for the worst to happen; rather, she can act wisely, embracing hope. While the environmental message may seem heavy-handed at first, it plays its part well by the end, aiding the final note that humans impact the Earth greatly and need to take this responsibility seriously.

We are soothed by entertainment, by infotainment, by presstitute prestidigitation normalising the unthinkable. Despite a mountain of evidence, we are assured that the crisis is under the management of fundamentally decent, rational leaders. Yes, dear reader, our sense of crisis also abates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are two key responses to news of the latest climate disasters:</p><p>'It's bad, but not that bad. It's manageable and we can carry on pretty much as normal.'</p><p>An alternative take:</p><p>'No, it is that bad. This is just the ball starting to roll - it will gather more and more and more momentum, and it won't stop. We need drastic change now! '</p><p>The second of these is inarguably correct. The first is the underlying message delivered by state-corporate media that have an existential vested interest in the status quo, in discouraging us from seeking serious change. And this is exactly why the level of public alarm does not yet reflect the terrifying, rollercoaster reality depicted in the soaring and crashing graphs measuring temperatures and ice coverage.</p><p>Professor Bill McGuire, Emeritus Professor of Geophysical and Climate Hazards at University College London, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ProfBillMcGuire/status/1669267319640539136\">tweeted</url>  last month:</p><p>'I hope to God I am wrong, but to me, it is looking increasingly as if we have reached some sort of tipping point, with the global temperature, sea-surface temperature, ice loss, and other parameters, all going through the roof.'</p><p>McGuire was responding to reports <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/17/world/four-climate-charts-extreme-weather-heat-oceans/index.html\">headlined</url>  by CNN thus:</p><p>'Four alarming charts that show just how extreme the climate is right now'</p><p>The report noted:</p><p>'We're only halfway through 2023 and so many climate records are being broken, some scientists are sounding the alarm, fearing it could be a sign of a planet warming much more rapidly than expected.'</p><p>The 'four alarming charts' showed that global air temperatures have risen to record levels in 2023. Oceans are also heating up to record levels and show no sign of stopping. Antarctic sea ice is at record lows. And atmospheric carbon dioxide levels hit a new record high in 2023. But many of these records are not merely being broken, they are being obliterated. Brian McNoldy, an expert in hurricanes and sea level rise at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BMcNoldy/status/1667486398436241408\">captured</url>  it exactly:</p><p>'I know there are a million people sharing temperature anomaly charts and maps lately, but there's a good reason for that. This is totally bonkers and people who look at this stuff routinely can't believe their eyes. Something very weird is happening.'</p><p>At around the same time, nearly 110 million Americans in the United States were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/29/extreme-heatwaves-heat-air-quality-warnings-texas-canada-wildfires\">reported</url>  to be living in an area the US weather service flagged as 'experiencing extreme heat', with at least 100 people having died as a result in Mexico where temperatures came close to 50C. So far this year, the overall heat-related deaths in Mexico are almost triple the figures in 2022.</p><p>Professor McGuire <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ProfBillMcGuire/status/1674424076595769346\">tweeted</url>  of this crisis:</p><p>'Unfortunately, you ain't seen nuthin' yet.'</p><p>CNN notes that some scientists 'have said while the records are alarming, they are not unexpected due to both the continued rise of planet-heating pollution and the arrival of the natural climate phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o, which has a global heating effect'.</p><p>Ryan Stauffer, a NASA scientist studying air pollution and ozone, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ryans_wx/status/1674137486900056093\">tweeted</url>  an extraordinary map of the United States with huge swathes of territory impacted by extreme heat while other massive areas are suffering from poor air quality thanks to 500 Canadian wildfires, half of which are still out of control. The fires have burned 8 million hectares of land, almost the size of Austria, releasing 160 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. The area destroyed is greater than the combined area burned in 2016, 2019, 2020 and 2022, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/canadian-wildfire-emissions-reach-record-high-2023-2023-06-27/\">according</url>  to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Indeed, the area is 11 times the Canadian average for the same period over previous years.</p><p>Stauffer commented:</p><p>'What a map. Welcome to the new pyrocene?'</p><p>Three major US cities, Chicago, Detroit and Washington DC, were ranked as the top three worst places in the world for air quality. According to the air tracking service IQAir, all three cities' air being classified as 'unhealthy'. Atmospheric scientist, Matthew Cappucci <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MatthewCappucci/status/1674454906256629760\">commented</url> :</p><p>'D.C. and much of the U.S. will be facing intermittent smoke all summer long - probably until October.'</p><p>In Texas, a vast <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66056330\">heat dome</url>  killing at least 12 people has sent demand for power to a record high as homes and businesses turned up the air conditioning. Under a heat dome, wind patterns trap high pressure in a particular area stretching 5 to 10 miles in altitude and across hundreds or thousands of miles horizontally. These wind patterns are generated by the jet stream, a band of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere, which usually moves in a wavelike pattern. The Financial Times  <url normalizedValue=\"https://archive.fo/T1NHO#selection-2795.0-2795.238\">reports</url> :</p><p>'When the waves become larger, they can move more slowly and eventually become stationary, leading to hot or cold air becoming trapped.'</p><p>Michael Mann, a Professor of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, said that climate change was bringing more persistent 'stuck' summer jet stream patterns, leading to hot sinking air becoming trapped over one region.</p><p>On Democracy Now! science writer Susan Joy Hassol <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TTTMediaXR/status/1674365357560156160\">warned</url>  that a collapse of Texas's overstrained electric grid under the heat dome would result in 'widespread death':</p><p>'The Texas grid appears to be very vulnerable to a heat event like this because it doesn't have the capacity to bring in power from other places. And this heat dome is really expanding. They say 50 million people are already exposed to dangerous heat by this heat dome.'</p><p>Hassol's warning recalls comments made in March 2022, when it was widely reported that both poles of the planet had experienced very extreme heat dome events. While the Arctic heat wave saw temperatures an astonishing 30 degrees C (86 degrees F) above normal, temperatures in Antarctica were 34 degrees C (93.2 degrees F) above normal. Professor Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-reports-of-extreme-temperatures-in-arctic-and-antarctic/\">commented</url> :</p><p>'It seems to be a new weather phenomenon, and it is not included in current climate models. If it happened twice in two years, I'll say it will happen again, and again, in various parts of the globe.'</p><p>As though echoing Hassol, Kargel added that we must ask what would happen if a similar event struck Houston, Texas, say, in the middle of summer, when the normal high is 95 degrees F:</p><p>'Okay, let's just consider the 2021 event The epicenter of the 2021 event was in Lytton, BC, where the worst day reached a temperature 44 degrees F (24.4 degrees C) warmer than the normal high temperature for late June. Just do simple addition: 95 + 44 = 139 F [59.4 degrees C] Considering Houston's normal humidity, I'll venture a guess: step outdoors in that, even in the shade, and you'll be dead in a few minutes.'</p><p>Kargel continued:</p><p>'Now, with temperatures possibly attaining the 130's in Houston, I'll take it as a given that the electrical grid will collapse. So, no cooling of buildings. There will be some thermal inertia which keeps building interiors cooler than the outside daytime high, but will very many people survive high humidity and indoors temperature say, even in the low 120's F?</p><p>'How many people would die if the heat dome spanned from Houston to Atlanta? Or Charleston, South Carolina to Boston? Or New Delhi to Ho Chi Minh City?'</p><p>Happy British Sunbathers Anticipate Another 'Sizzler'</p><p>Meanwhile, in Britain, the UK has just had the hottest June on record, the Met Office <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66084543\">confirmed</url> . The average monthly temperature of 15.8C (60.4F) exceeded the previous highest average June temperature recorded by 0.9C. Previously, heat records were broken by tiny fractions of a degree - almost one degree is an enormous jump.</p><p>Worse may soon be on the way. Over standard pictures of happy sunbathers in deckchairs on Bournemouth beach, a Daily Mirror headline <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-facing-scorching-heat-dome-30325427\">read</url> :</p><p>'UK facing scorching 'heat dome' with the chance of a 40C hot weather blast in just weeks'</p><p>The report noted that 'global temperatures are breaking records - and are likely to continue breaking records'. Jim Dale, British Weather Services' senior meteorological consultant, said:</p><p>' there's every chance we'll break the 35C mark in the second week of July and August. That's a 50/50 chance.</p><p>'The 40C degrees is more likely in August than in July. But there's everything to play for as far as the summer is concerned.'</p><p>The Mirror noted that the first two weeks of August were the most likely time to see a repeat of last year's 40 degree C event that the paper described jovially as a 'sizzler'.</p><p>Responding to our comment on the Mirror' s upbeat focus on happy sunbathers, a tweeter <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hairymarx1/status/1674805027796398080\">replied</url> :</p><p>'Happy working-class people enjoying the summer sunshine. Can't be having that, can we @medialens?'</p><p>To put that comment and the term 'sizzler' in perspective, Juley Fulcher, worker health and safety advocate for progressive non-profit Public Citizen, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66070216\">estimates</url>  that heat exposure is responsible for as many as 2,000 worker fatalities in the US each year and as many as 170,000 injuries - many of them arising from indoor work in restaurants and warehouses, as well as outside jobs. Fulcher said:</p><p>'It's a huge problem. Action is long overdue.'</p><p>Last November, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, the World Health Organisation's Regional Director for Europe, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/07-11-2022-statement---climate-change-is-already-killing-us--but-strong-action-now-can-prevent-more-deaths\">commented</url> of Europe:</p><p>'Based on country data submitted so far, it is estimated that at least 15,000 people died specifically due to the heat in 2022. Among those, nearly 4,000 deaths in Spain, more than 1,000 in Portugal, more than 3,200 in the United Kingdom, and around 4,500 deaths in Germany were reported by health authorities during the 3 months of summer.</p><p>'This estimate is expected to increase as more countries report on excess deaths due to heat.'</p><p>Professional journalists aside, many people are increasingly concerned about climate collapse for a simple, very good reason. A shocking new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/society-of-actuaries-highlights-americans-perspectives-on-climate-risks-301863890.html\">survey</url>  by the Society of Actuaries Research Institute has found that 53% of Americans reported that extreme weather events - including hurricanes, tornadoes, heatwaves, wildfires and flooding - have adversely affected their health. Moreover, more than half of the respondents reported negative impacts on their property (51%), communities (58%) and feelings of general safety (65%) from extreme weather events.</p><p>42% have experienced short-term injury or illness</p><p>23% report complications to an existing chronic condition</p><p>15% have suffered a long-term injury or a new chronic condition.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2022 alone, five oil companies \u2060- ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies \u2060- more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/big-oil-profits-reached-record-high-levels-in-2022/\">doubled their profits</url>  to an all-time historic record of $200 billion.</p><p>How bad is the current situation? Two years ago, Bill McGuire wrote a deeply honest and moving <url normalizedValue=\"https://billmcguire.substack.com/p/an-open-letter-to-all-climate-scientists\">open letter</url>  to his climate scientist colleagues. It could not be clearer from his comments, that climate scientists are not telling the truth (and not in the way the climate deniers mean!):</p><p>'In truth, the reason you have never liked to stick your head above the parapet is for fear of being shot at by your peers. As a fellow scientist I understand that - I really do. There is nothing worse than being ridiculed within your own community. It can, I know, mean loss of prestige, a squeeze on funding, and a closing down of opportunities for advancement. I understand, therefore, why you continue to play down anything that might draw attention, why you lie low, tow [sic - toe] the party line.</p><p>'I know, too, what you really think and feel about climate change, because I have talked to many of you in private, and the response - without exception - has been that the true situation is far worse than you are prepared to admit in public. So, behind the facade, I know that you are torn between speaking out and holding back, that you are as desperate as anyone for the measures to be taken that the science demands. Most of all, I know that you fear, as much as anybody else, for your children's future in the world of climate chaos they will be forced to inhabit.'</p><p>It's not just climate scientists. We need everyone to start speaking out, to expose the corporate media illusion of normality, to demand action immediately.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://dissidentvoice.org/2023/07/i-hope-to-god-i-am-wrong-climate-change-going-through-the-roof/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXDV-DISV118830168856954104325876100150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DISV-118830</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MG-NW01-JCMN-Y3PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2130\"/><timeReceived>3:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Jimmy Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) voted for historic legislation to reduce prescription drug prices, cap out-of-pocket medical expenses for seniors, and substantially invest in clean energy to slash carbon output, and cut the federal deficit. As summarized below, the bill, once signed by President Joe Biden, will make significant investments in clean energy and transportation programs, empower Medicare to negotiate drug prices with drug companies, lower Affordable Care Act premiums, and increase funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) operations to make it work more efficiently and assist with investigations of those who are purposefully cheating on or failing to pay their taxes. The bill contains several tax credits that were authored by Rep. Panetta that are related to electric buses, microgrid controllers, and linear generators and contains a significant amount of increased funding for National Marine Sanctuaries construction advocated for by Rep. Panetta.</p><p>\"For far too long, the United States Government has fallen short when it comes to living up to its claims on climate change, reducing our deficit, and lowering prescription drug prices. With this consequential and bold legislation, we are doing more than just talking or yelling about things, we are actually acting, working, and legislating to incentivize investment in clean energy to reduce our carbon output by 44% come 2030, put a cap on insulin prices and cut drug prices for seniors, and shrink our federal deficit by $300 billion over the next decade,\" said Rep.

Jimmy Panetta:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) voted for historic legislation to reduce prescription drug prices, cap out-of-pocket medical expenses for seniors, and substantially invest in clean energy to slash carbon output, and cut the federal deficit. As summarized below, the bill, once signed by President Joe Biden, will make significant investments in clean energy and transportation programs, empower Medicare to negotiate drug prices with drug companies, lower Affordable Care Act premiums, and increase funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) operations to make it work more efficiently and assist with investigations of those who are purposefully cheating on or failing to pay their taxes. The bill contains several tax credits that were authored by Rep. Panetta that are related to electric buses, microgrid controllers, and linear generators and contains a significant amount of increased funding for National Marine Sanctuaries construction advocated for by Rep. Panetta.</p><p>\"For far too long, the United States Government has fallen short when it comes to living up to its claims on climate change, reducing our deficit, and lowering prescription drug prices. With this consequential and bold legislation, we are doing more than just talking or yelling about things, we are actually acting, working, and legislating to incentivize investment in clean energy to reduce our carbon output by 44% come 2030, put a cap on insulin prices and cut drug prices for seniors, and shrink our federal deficit by $300 billion over the next decade,\" said Rep. Panetta. \"As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, I'm proud to have authored several parts of this legislation on tax credits for clean energy buses, microgrids, and linear generators. In my limited time in Congress, what I've come to realize is that no matter how much some people yell and scream on television or post on social media, this job is about legislating for our future. This major legislation and our leadership today will provide the foundation to help fight inflation by reducing the price of health care for our seniors, set a path forward to lowering our federal deficit, and foster a healthier, more sustainable planet for tomorrow.\"</p><p>The new law will include the following summarized provisions:</p><p>Health care</p><p>Allows Medicare to negotiate directly over the prices of specific high-cost drugs.</p><p>Extends financial aid established during the pandemic for Affordable Care Act beneficiaries until 2025.</p><p>Limits the amount of money that Medicare recipients pay out of pocket for prescription medications to $2,000 per year.</p><p>Caps the cost of insulin at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>Climate Change</p><p>Incentivizes consumers to participate in clean energy by offering tax credits and rebates to those who reduce their carbon emissions: $9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs for low-income households;

The average temperature was 25.6 Celsius, an increase of 2.7 degrees compared to the averages recorded between 1981 to 2010. <br/>A report on the Spanish television station RTVE showed how some Spanish cities have created so-called climate shelters, which are cooled to 26 degrees Celsius. These include libraries, sports centers, museums and schools. The shelters are intended primarily for elderly people, families with small children and babies, and people with chronic illnesses. <br/>Forest fires <br/>In Europe this year, 660,000 hectares of land have gone up in flames. Data from the European Forest Fire Information System shows that the largest area destroyed \u2014 265,000 hectares \u2014 was in Spain. <br/>In order to contain forest fires better in future, on August 1, the Spanish government issued a decree that, as of now, obliges the autonomous communities \u2014 Spain's administrative regions, similar to Germany's federal states \u2014 to draw up plans for preventing and extinguishing fires in the coming year by October 31. The regional governments now have three months to provide specific information on, for example, the number of fire-fighting vehicles, personnel and equipment they will have on standby, and to designate the areas and time periods where and when there is heightened risk. <br/>MITECO has already contracted four companies to reforest the area worst affected by the fires \u2014 the Sierra de la Culebra mountain range in the north-western province of Zamora \u2014 at a cost of \u20ac2 million ($2.04 million). <br/>Falling water reserves <br/>MITECO reports that the persistent heat and drought have caused Spain's water reserves to hit an all-time low. The ministry's monthly data sheet, last updated on August 9, records that they are now at 21,730 cubic meters \u2014 that is just 39% of total capacity. <br/>Consequently, municipalities throughout Spain, as well as autonomous regions \u2014 Galicia, Catalonia and Andalusia in particular \u2014 have imposed measures to limit water consumption. These include restricting the water supply at night and turning off showers at the beach, as well as bans on people watering lawns, washing cars, or filling swimming pools. <br/>Rising sea temperatures <br/>The Mediterranean Sea is increasingly becoming the Caribbean of Europe. According to Spain's Mediterranean Center for Environmental Studies (CEAM), between 1982 and 2021 its average water temperature increased by 1.32 degrees Celsius. <br/>\"Since the 1980s, the sea temperature on the Mediterranean coast has risen twice as much as the air temperature,\" Jorge Olcina Cantos, head of the Laboratory of Climatology at the University of Alicante, told the Spanish newspaper, El Pais. This year, the water temperature on the Spanish coast has been between 28 and 29 degrees since July 20, he said. <br/>Olcina Cantos explained what was causing this: \"Hot air masses from the Sahara accumulate on the water surface, warming it faster and faster. Since 1908, air temperatures in the Mediterranean have risen by 0.7 degrees Celsius, whereas sea temperatures have gone up 1.4 degrees.\" <br/>This also means that temperatures don't drop as much at night, either, because the air is no longer cooled by the breeze coming off the sea. Rising sea temperatures also result in an increase in storms and severe weather. <br/>As a protective measure, Olcina Cantos is calling for a revision of the legislation on coastal development. He says the tourist industry must also urgently adapt to the more extreme temperatures. Cities need more shade, he says, and greenery should be planted to cover the roofs and facades of buildings. <br/>In spring 2021, the Spanish parliament passed the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law, which aims to help the country become climate-neutral by 2050. Goals include increasing the share of renewable energies in electricity generation to 42% by 2030 and phasing out internal combustion engines by 2040. <br/>This story was originally published in German. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109989166067375065625976100018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7827</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:665M-FH41-JCMN-Y374-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><timeReceived>6:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 16, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN  ADOLESCENTS &amp;

Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here[3]. <br/>This story is the third in afour-part Grist series[4]examining how climate change is destabilizing the global insurance market. It is published in partnership with theEconomic Hardship Reporting Project[5]. </p><p><br/>It wasn't the first summer Justin Guay went outside and choked on smoke. Or the second. But by the time wildfire season seemed to last year-round, he decided to move his family away from California and back to Utah, where he'd grown up. <br/>In 2020, Guay bought a house in Wasatch County near the jagged mountains, where he thought the worst climate impacts would be warmer winters with higher snow lines. An avid skier, Guay thought that was bad enough. But this spring, a letter arrived from his homeowners insurance company, brokered through Progressive. 'They were dropping us because they would no longer be providing insurance \u2014 period,' he recalled. <br/>As they scrambled to find new coverage, Guay and his wife were shocked when their first inquiry was rejected. 'They said, 'We no longer provide insurance to homes in your area.'' Other companies at least provided quotes, though they all offered rates at least double his previous policy. Returning to his home state, he hadn't considered fires as a risk. They were never a major issue while he was growing up. Shortly after he moved back, however, 5,000 people[6] were evacuated from a neighboring town during a large burn. <br/>As climate risks upend the insurance market, homeowners like Guay are being caught off guard. Losing his coverage really highlighted 'the limitations of your individual ability to cope or deal with these impacts,' said Guay. It's a nationwide problem he's now turning to at work as the director of global climate strategy for the Sunrise Project, a climate justice nonprofit. <br/>Climate change is now the main driver[7] of the increase in fire weather in the western United States. As conditions get warmer and drier, blazes are burning over larger areas and scorching places once thought of as low-risk. This summer, around 100 people died[8] as flames tore through Maui in one of the deadliest wildfires in American history, leaving behind $3.2 billion[9] in property damage. Across the Western United States, existing dangers are getting worse: Four of the five[10] largest wildfires in California's history have occurred since 2020. Meanwhile, close to a quarter[11] of the Americans now at risk of catastrophic wildfires live in the eastern half of the country, in places that may not be prepared to respond. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-536120850_resized.webp\">http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-536120850_resized.webp</url> The Waldo Canyon Fire burns the mountains above Colorado Springs, Colorado in June 2012. The blaze destroyed more than 300 homes. Photo Gaylon Wampler/Getty Images. <br/>All this damage has racked up quite the bill. Nationally, wildfires caused more than $22.5 billion[12] of losses in 2017, a record surpassed in 2018 when blazes burned through $29 billion, while 2020 and 2021 took third and fourth place in the echelon of damage. Those are just direct costs; a 2020 study[13] found the indirect costs of 2018's wildfires alone \u2014 things like health care costs and disruption to the broader economy \u2014 cost almost $150 billion. <br/>Compounding all this is the boom in people moving to fire-prone places. Between 1990 and 2010, more than 25 million people[14] relocated to areas known as the wildland-urban interface, where human development abuts wilderness. As inflation spikes the costs of rebuilding, those decisions are increasingly expensive: In the last five years, wildfires cost the United States $68.4 billion.[15] <br/>These losses are contributing to the destabilization of the homeowners insurance market. The insurance industry argues that attempts to control pricing \u2014 like California's regulation that required[16] insurers to set their rates based on damages over the past 20 years, rather than looking ahead at future hazards \u2014 have backfired. Many companies have chosen to stop selling new policies in California, while others have dropped existing policies, causing an additional 50,000 people[17] in the state to lose their coverage just this summer. <br/>Yet as Guay found, simply relocating wasn't a solution. Insurance, the financial mechanism that has underpinned the global economy[18] for the last 400 years, is no longer guaranteeing most people's largest asset. 'There's nowhere to run,' Guay said. <br/>In California, many residents find themselves on the leading edge of this crisis. Rural areas were the first to be affected. But now, even people in suburban areas and across a broad spectrum of society \u2014 including politicians themselves \u2014 are seeing their coverage vanish. <br/>The problem itself is pretty simple: Nearly a quarter[19] of Californians now live in areas at risk of catastrophic fire. Knowing what to do about it is a much thornier question. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1062031052_resized.webp\">http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1062031052_resized.webp</url> Paradise, California residents hug after they recover a keepsake bracelet in the rubble of their home destroyed by the Camp Fire in 2018. Photo by Marcus Yam/Los Angeles Times/Getty. <br/>After several close calls with nearby fires, Beth Pratt decided to refinance the mortgage on her home in Midpines, outside of Yosemite National Park, and spent $100,000 \u2014 all the equity in her home and all her savings \u2014 to reduce her risk. She installed a metal roof and built a water storage tank with a fire hose hookup. She completely sided her house in metal, replaced her decking and railings, and cleared brush. Most of these measures went far beyond the basic tree trimming that Allstate requested during her last home inspection. She will now be paying off her mortgage till she is 80. Despite her efforts, she got a letter this July canceling her policy. <br/>In 2018, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium[20] on homeowner policy cancellations for one year in ZIP codes near wildfires, a condition which applied to Pratt's community after a fire in July 2022. Pratt's cancellation arrived this summer almost exactly when that grace period ended, right in the middle of wildfire season. Last year, the state's insurance commissioner required insurers[21] to give discounts for the kind of steps Pratt took, but rather than adjusting her rates, Allstate chose to drop her coverage. (Allstate made a quiet decision[22] last fall to stop writing new policies in California. State Farm followed suit this spring.) 'I feel like I did everything right. But it didn't matter,' she said. <br/>Pratt's mortgage requires her to have homeowners insurance, putting her at risk of eventually defaulting. She tried to find another private insurer to no avail. Eventually, she turned to the California FAIR Plan[23], a state-backed policy that covers people who have been denied private coverage at least three times. Its budget comes from levies on insurance companies operating in the state, but these coffers are shrinking: The FAIR Plan itself announced that it was seeking permission from the state's Department of Insurance to hike premiums by nearly 50%[24]. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_9506_Beth-resized.webp\">http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_9506_Beth-resized.webp</url> Beth Pratt stands outside her home in Midpines, California. She lost her home insurance this summer, despite spending $100,000 on measures to reduce her wildfire risk. Courtesy of Beth Pratt. <br/>Most of Pratt's neighbors in Midpines have also lost their insurance. Some may still qualify for private policies, but can no longer afford them. 'What you're talking about in an area like mine is not rich people or second homes, but working-class people, people who have lived here their whole lives, losing the ability to insure their properties,' she said. <br/>Nationwide, approximately one in three houses[14] is located in the wildland-urban interface. But even documenting the hazards has been contentious: The Oregon Department of Forestry tried to issue a map in 2022 showing 80,000 homes[25] were at risk. But homeowners worried this would decrease their property values and raise their insurance rates protested until the state rescinded it. Or take the 2018 Camp Fire, which began when a spark from an electric transmission line owned by the utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric blew into a firestorm[26] near the town of Paradise. In its aftermath, insurance companies sued PG&amp;E, reclaiming around $11 billion [27]\u2014 or about 85% of their claims. The utility later declared[28] bankruptcy. <br/>There's a long history of insurers going after the entities that caused expensive claims, a process known as subrogation. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, for example, won $18 million[29] in 2001 from Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to cover the medical treatment of smokers. Advocates suggest insurers could take a similar approach to the fossil fuel industry, whose product has helped worsen wildfires[30]. Rather than individuals, or even insurers, said Peter Bosshard, the coordinator of the Insure Our Future campaign, 'it should be the polluters who pay.' <br/>Multnomah County, Oregon, took its first step in this direction in June, suing[31] several multinational oil companies for the heat dome that smothered the region in June 2021, killing at least 69 people in the county, which includes Portland. (The death toll across the Pacific Northwest was much higher: at least 250 in the U.S.[32] and another 400 in Canada.) In addition to $50 million in damages, the county is also seeking $50 billion for research and to implement 'weatherproofing' to help handle future extreme heat. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1408757273_resized-e1696987868383.webp\">http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1408757273_resized-e1696987868383.webp</url> A homeowner, right, meets with a fire safety clearing landscaper at his home in Oakland, California in 2017 after he lost his insurance policy for living in a high-risk region.

Homeowners aren't the only ones finding they're priced out of the insurance they need. Utility companies, for example, are also struggling to find[33] wildfire liability coverage to protect them from lawsuits like the ones PG&amp;E faced. That makes upgrading utility infrastructure even more important \u2014 but that ultimately costs consumers money, too. PG&amp;E is currently improving its transmission network and asked California regulators for a $3.2 billion rate increase[34] this year, or an average bill increase of around $450 a year. Perversely, utilities themselves primarily profit by making these kinds of capital expenditures, so 'every utility in the West is doing this to some degree,' Pomerantz said. <br/>As this system breaks down, everyone's feeling the pressure to guess the future correctly. In most states, the industry standard has been for insurers to use catastrophe models to estimate wildfire or other disaster risk in a region over time, then use those predictions to make decisions about their overall risk, like how much reinsurance to purchase as a backstop. <br/>Technological advances have made it possible to predict hazards not only in your part of town, but also for the exact parcel of land you call home. 'We're entering a new era where you can get at the root cause of mitigating risk, as opposed to just transferring that risk,' said Attila Toth, co-founder and CEO of start-up ZestyAI[35], which uses artificial intelligence to assess properties. The eight-year-old startup has collected satellite data, building permits, and two decades of historical losses to train its AI, developing a model called Z-FIRE. The company claims it can now spit out a wildfire risk score for all properties in the Lower 48, based on specific information about your home, such as what type of roof it has or what vegetation is nearby. <br/>ZestyAI's wildfire model has gained regulatory approval in seven states[36], including as part of a rate filing by the California Department of Insurance. Among the many high-profile companies now using ZestyAI's model is Amica Insurance. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which destroyed 3,000 homes[37] and killed nine people in Santa Rosa, California, Amica realized that it had mistakenly underpriced high-risk properties, leaving it on the hook for major losses in several counties. The company now uses Z-FIRE, a move Amica says[38] 'leverage[s] the power of AI to generate a clear picture of not only how likely it is that a home might be exposed to a wildfire, but also the probability of its damage.' The system has also allowed Amica to 'offer coverage for homes that may have previously been declined.' Farmers Insurance says thanks to Z-FIRE's fine-tuned analyses, it expects to add 30,000 new policies[39] in California. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1592922864_resized.webp\">http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1592922864_resized.webp</url> A family looks for belongings through the ashes of their home in the aftermath of a wildfire in Lahaina, western Maui, Hawaii on August 11. Photo Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images. <br/>Helping both insurers and homeowners get a better sense of their actual risk is long overdue, says Roy Wright, a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Association's insurance administration. He now leads the Insurance Institute for Business &amp; Home Safety,[40] a nonprofit organization that tries to 'translate science into action' for insurance companies and homeowners. It conducts research to provide information on how to prevent damage[41] during disasters. 'We show people what actions make a difference,' Wright explained. The institute has spent decades testing construction design, like intentionally setting siding and roofing materials on fire in the lab to see what helps prevent embers from catching. He is lobbying regulators to add the institute's construction standards to states' building codes. <br/>Wright's organization is now collaborating with ZestyAI to improve its models' accuracy and to better understand new hazards. But some are leery of these kinds of proprietary datasets, saying that nontransparent pricing decisions may increase discrimination[42]. Unless regulators step in, Madison Condon, a corporate and environmental law professor at Boston University, predicts an obvious consequence will be 'huge differentiations in the cost of insurance that could have demographic effects.' <br/>California currently has some of the most transparent policies, requiring companies to publicly disclose when they won't renew a policy and to provide homeowners their risk assessments and an opportunity to appeal them. Washington state, in contrast, does none of the above[43]. But the Golden State is also facing some of the highest losses: Insured claims have outpaced premiums in the state since 2016[44] by more than $4 billion. Insurers, like banks, have to have a certain amount of money on hand, so to sell more policies, they have to increase their capital. Many private companies turn to reinsurers for this, paying them a fee for their financing. But now that risks have increased, reinsurance prices have too: In July, reinsurers increased the cost of U.S. property reinsurance by as much as 50%[45]. <br/>Unlike most other states, California's insurance commissioner prohibits insurers from passing on these reinsurance costs to the consumer. The goal of measures like this, according to Harvey Rosenfield, an advocate who founded the nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog, was to make insurance available and affordable. During the last insurance crisis in the 1980s, the industry claimed that higher losses and a spike in lawsuits[46] were responsible for rising premiums, which Rosenfield alleges led to discriminatory practices in minority neighborhoods, an issue researchers have identified[47] nationwide. To address these issues, Rosenfield wrote California's Proposition 103[48], which passed in 1988. It aimed to rein in costs and increase transparency in the country's largest market, establishing a review process for rate increases and electing a state insurance commissioner. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1059658744_resized-e1696987915721.webp\">http://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1059658744_resized-e1696987915721.webp</url> Firefighters try to keep flames from spreading to a neighboring apartment complex as they battle the Camp Fire in 2018 in Paradise, California. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images. <br/>The insurance industry argues[49] Proposition 103 keeps the market from reflecting true risk and forces companies to offer insurance at artificially low rates. Since 2009, California has seen a 335% j[50]ump in buildings destroyed by wildfires, along with a 270% increase in associated costs. But Rosenfield notes homeowners insurance companies in California earned an average annual return on net worth of 8.8%[51] over the last 20 years, compared to 6.2% nationally. <br/>Consumer Watchdog says what's needed to address the lack of affordable insurance is to enforce existing laws. For example, it says its advocacy challenging consumer rate increases has saved homeowners $2.2 billion[52] since 2002. Long-term, the organization thinks the government should be helping homeowners afford to fortify their property, as well as instituting policies that require companies to sell insurance to all owners who meet certain mitigation measures. <br/>In early September, the president of Consumer Watchdog's advocacy group, Jamie Court, happened to be on the same morning flight to Sacramento as an insurance lobbyist, Michael Gunning. When Gunning began bragging about his efforts to push through a multi-billion-dollar bailout for the industry through California's state legislature at the end of its session, Court started recording their conversation. 'We are trying to jam a bill in the last three weeks,' Gunning can be heard[53] saying. <br/>The bill, which would have absolved companies of responsibility for covering fire claims under the state's FAIR plan, failed to pass[54]. But several weeks later, California's insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, announced[55] he would expedite changes to allow companies to use catastrophe modeling and artificial intelligence to take into account projected impacts of climate change in their pricing. He also signaled he would 'explore' allowing companies to pass on reinsurance costs. In exchange, insurers will be required to write at least 85% of their market share in 'distressed areas,' although those have not yet been identified. Newsom supported the changes, immediately issuing an executive order[56] authorizing the Commissioner's 'emergency regulatory action' to bolster the faltering industry. <br/>Consumer Watchdog says these changes could increase premiums by as much as 50% overnight. 'Insurers are leveraging a real climate crisis with a false crisis of affordability in order to line their pockets,' said Carmen Balber, executive director at Consumer Watchdog. 'If trends continue, and insurers are allowed to continue making those choices on their own, we could be seeing a much more serious crisis for homeowners.' <br/>When these cascading effects hit, it's going to cost those who can least afford it the most. While insurance is ultimately about managing risk for a single business or person, the escalating nature of the climate crisis can only be addressed by action society-wide. Homeowners insurance is increasingly at the crux of this mismatch: Buying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions in someone's life, and it's a long-term investment. But even if you can get \u2014 and afford to pay \u2014 for insurance when you buy a house, companies reevaluate their policies and premiums every year. 'It's not like we need more information,' Condon said. 'We need better ways to think about how to adapt in the face of uncertainty.' <br/>As the stakes rise, the house seems to always win. 'I looked up the revenues of some of these big insurance companies,' Pratt says. Their profits might be declining \u2014 after making 32 cents on the dollar in 2023, Allstate's credit dropped[57] for a second time[58] in 2023, to BBB+, a middling rung on S&amp;P's rating scale \u2014 but it's still 'a lot more than I make,' she said. She paid into a policy with Allstate for 32 years, but never made a claim. 'What's fair about that?' she asked. <br/>Last winter, Pratt's property was without power for a week, and she stayed warm hauling wood for her stove in a sled over record snowfall. Last summer, she was sweating in an extreme heat wave[59], watching a woodpecker gasp for breath at her bird bath. She watched, helpless, as a fire burned 127 homes[60] nearby. <br/>'We are learning to adapt to what it's going to take to live in this time of climate extremes,' Pratt said, noting that while she ultimately found a California FAIR plan, it doubled her cost. 'Rethinking the insurance industry \u2014 in this new regime of climate disruption \u2014 is going to be needed.' <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://grist.org/economics/in-wildfire-prone-areas-homeowners-are-learning-theyre-uninsurable/\">https://grist.org/economics/in-wildfire-prone-areas-homeowners-are-learning-theyre-uninsurable/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://grist.org\">https://grist.org</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_source=partner\">https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_source=partner</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://grist.org/series/insurance-climate-crop-fire-home/\">https://grist.org/series/insurance-climate-crop-fire-home/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://economichardship.org\">http://economichardship.org</url>/ [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parkrecord.com/entertainment/swaner-ecocenter-presentation-looks-at-life-after-parleys-canyon-wildfire/\">https://www.parkrecord.com/entertainment/swaner-ecocenter-presentation-looks-at-life-after-parleys-canyon-wildfire/</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20found%20enhanced,in%20the%20western%20United%20States\">https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20found%20enhanced,in%20the%20western%20United%20States</url>.

Smoke conditions in those regions could last through at least Thursday.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of Wednesday evening, major metro areas such as Philadelphia; Jersey City, New Jersey; and New Haven, Connecticut, had air quality indexes ranging from 200 to 300 - which is considered \"very unhealthy,\" according to government website <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/\">AirNow.gov</url>.</p><p>New York City had an AQI of 484 at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, which is classified as \"hazardous,\" Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Wednesday. That's the highest level on record in the city since the 1960s, he said.</p><p>Air quality conditions are likely to worsen through 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Wednesday evening before they temporarily improve later in the night and into Thursday morning, the mayor said. However, conditions will deteriorate again on Thursday afternoon and evening \"as smoke moves back over the city,\" Adams said.</p><p>\"While there may be potential for significantly improved conditions by Friday morning, smoke predictability that far out is low,\" the mayor cautioned. \"It's difficulty to predict the movement of the smoke... This is an unpredictable series of events and we cannot provide guidance more than a day in advance at this point.\"</p><p>\"This is not the day to train for a marathon or to do an outside event with your children. Stay inside, close windows and doors, and use air purifiers if you have them,\" Adams said earlier on Wednesday.</p><p>Hundreds of miles away, Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland canceled recess and all outdoor activities for Wednesday and Thursday due to the \"influx of smoke\" outside that could pose a health risk, the school district said.   </p><p>Professional sports teams postponed several games on Wednesday in cities impacted by the smoke, including two Major League Baseball games scheduled in New York and Philadelphia. And the wildfire smoke also forced the closure of at least three horse racing tracks on the East Coast.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://\"/></p><p>And the Canadian capital of Ottawa is getting hit with some of the worst air quality, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/\">AirNow.gov</url>, a partnership of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. </p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Joe Biden on Wednesday about the ongoing wildfires and air quality impacts, their offices confirmed.  </p><p>The US has deployed more than 600 firefighters and support personnel as well as other firefighting assets, the White House said Wednesday. Trudeau thanked Biden for the support and cooperation, according to a statement released by Trudeau's office, and \"both leaders acknowledged the need to work together to address the devastating impacts of climate change.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://\"/></p><p>Philadelphia issued a \"code red\" alert Wednesday, warning certain residents should stay indoors. </p><p>The elderly, young children and those who are pregnant or have heart or lung conditions could experience serious health effects from the smoke, said James Garrow, spokesperson for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.</p><p>\"For those who are not considered to be in a sensitive group, we are asking those folks to avoid strenuous activities outdoors like jogging or exercising,\" Garrow told CNN Wednesday.</p><p>\"We are asking folks to avoid unnecessary time outdoors,\" he said. \"But if they need to be outdoors, they should be masked and head inside as often as they need.\"</p><p>Even healthy people can suffer health problems</p><p>The enormous cloud of pollution could cause long-term health effects, depending on the person and amount of exposure, said Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist with NYU Langone Health and <url normalizedValue=\"https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/\">Allergy &amp; Asthma Network</url>.</p><p>\"A healthy person may be able to withstand a day or two without too many issues, but at these levels, even they are at risk,\" Parikh said. </p><p>\"But someone who is vulnerable has much higher risk. Most vulnerable include (the) elderly, children, those with underlying lung issues like asthma, COPD, lung cancer, heart disease and pregnant women.\"</p><p>If people develop and keep having symptoms after the air quality returns to normal, \"then they may have developed asthma or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdc.gov/copd/index.html#:~:text=What%20is%20COPD%3F,Americans%20who%20have%20this%20disease.\">COPD</url> as a result, and that can become chronic,\" Parikh said. </p><p>Experts say wearing a face mask can help - but the type of mask is important.</p><p>\"N95s protect very well from the smoke particles, which are the most hazardous component of the smoke,\" said Linsey Marr, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech university.</p><p>\"You may still smell smoke gases through the mask, but it's still doing its job blocking particles as long as it's a high-quality mask that fits well,\" Marr said. </p><p>\"You definitely want an N95 or KN95 or KF94 to get the best protection. Surgical and cloth masks will provide a small benefit, better than nothing, but if you really want to protect your health, you should wear a 'respirator' such as an N95, KN95, or KF94.\"</p><p>Mandatory evacuations and a state of emergency</p><p>Air quality in the US Northeast deteriorated this week as more than 150 wildfires keep raging in Quebec, according to the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/fire-information\"> Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center</url>. </p><p>The entire Quebecois town of Chibougamau - population 7,000 - is under a mandatory evacuation order Wednesday as fast-moving wildfires wreak havoc across the region. </p><p>\"Given the current situation, the mayor of Chibougamau, Manon Cyr, has declared a state of emergency and announced the mandatory evacuation of the entire town, including the resort area,\" the town posted on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/villedechibougamau/posts/pfbid0oyxSB9W1awB8oiBNxw5HL8n9FK1ZJAH8gc2dAhT7WDa4LHxM8jGxzmvJ532nbzUtl\">Facebook</url> Tuesday night. </p><p>So far this year, Quebec has endured more than 400 wildfires - twice the average for this time of year. </p><p>More than 9 million acres have been charred by wildfires in all of Canada this year - about 15 times the normal burned area for this point in the year.</p><p>And human-induced climate change has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/world/climate-heat-wave-wildfires-weather-explainer-intl/index.html\">exacerbated the hot and dry conditions</url> that fuel wildfires. </p><p>Scientists <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/16/us/western-wildfires-fossil-fuels-study-climate/index.html\">recently reported</url> that millions of acres scorched by wildfires in the Western US and Canada - an area roughly the size of South Carolina - could be traced back to carbon pollution from the world's largest fossil fuel and cement companies.</p><p>Governors urge residents to stay indoors</p><p>New York City had the worst air pollution of any major city in the world at one point Tuesday night, before dropping to second-worst behind New Delhi, India, according to air quality tracker IQair. The city topped the list again on Wednesday - above Lahore, Pakistan - as air conditions remained hazardous, according to IQair.</p><p>The nation's largest public school district <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/NYCSchools/status/1666387607264059392\">canceled</url> all outdoor activities Wednesday, but will remain open. Mayor Adams said all city events outdoors would be canceled and city beaches will also remain closed.</p><p>At least 10 school districts in central New York state canceled outdoor activities and events Tuesday. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Wednesday cities such as Rochester and Syracuse suspended outdoor school activities and urged other cities to \"follow suit.\" </p><p>A school district in Westchester County dismissed all of its students early on Wednesday due to the air quality conditions, according to the Chappaqua Central School District, which serves roughly 4,000 students. And in Monroe County - located northeast of Buffalo - officials closed a zoo and all county parks.</p><p>Hochul said the state is making 1 million N95 masks available to the public, calling the air quality \"unprecedented\" and \"a very serious, dangerous situation.\"</p><p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore also advised residents to stay indoors, as air quality conditions remain at \"unhealthy levels for everyone,\" he said in a statement to CNN.</p><p>New Jersey Gov.

To meet its climate targets, Edmonton aims to reduce emissions from heating and cooling buildings through a 'City-wide decarbonized district energy network' to provide emissions-free thermal energy to connected buildings. The District Energy Strategy was developed to support this objective. In support of the District Energy Strategy, an analysis of housing density was performed to identify which Edmonton neighbourhoods are likely to have sufficient thermal demand density to support a district energy system, coupled with regulatory and economic conditions that support successful district energy implementation. The District Energy Strategy then considered potential risks and mitigation measures to district energy development, and identified action items to ensure successful development over both the short and long-term. </p><p><br/>District Energy and Benefits <br/>A district energy system distributes thermal energy to multiple buildings in an area. This occurs through three components. 1) the production of thermal energy, 2) a piping system to deliver the energy (the energy transfer medium is typically water or steam); and 3) energy transfer stations at each building to supply space heating, domestic hot water heating and/or cooling. This is more efficient than using individual boilers and chillers in each building. <br/>There are also various indirect benefits of implementing district energy such as, decarbonization of the electricity supply, electrical distribution system support, solid waste diversion, forest fire mitigation, negative emissions for hard-to abate sectors, enabling a circular economy and job creation. <br/>Identifying Areas in Edmonton Best Suited for District Energy <br/>Certain conditions are preferred for optimal use of district energy. In creating its District Energy Strategy, Edmonton considered the following when identifying and evaluating district energy opportunities: <br/> High-density, new development (clusters of large buildings). Areas where Edmonton has increased control over the development process through rezoning, development permits and building permits to ensure connection to a District Energy System, or development of city-owned land. Presence of a potential 'anchor' load for a new District Energy System (particularly municipally-owned buildings). Presence of a District Energy-scale low-carbon thermal resource. Voluntary or mandatory GHG emissions regulations for buildings (such as C627 Edmonton's Climate Resilience Policy for city-owned buildings). Presence of existing high-density buildings that may connect in the future. Close proximity to an existing (or planned/developing) District Energy System. <br/>Based on the above considerations, Edmonton has identified certain areas that are best suited for district energy. These areas include 25% of the new housing developments in Edmonton, and thus provides an opportunity for 25% of new housing to have zero emissions heating through district energy. <br/>Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Development <br/>While Edmonton was able to identify numerous areas that met the considerations for potential district energy development, there are still a number of key barriers to district energy development and use in Edmonton. First, without emissions regulations or higher carbon prices, low-cost gas-fired energy provides limited incentives to transition to lower GHG emissions energy like district energy. Second, upfront costs and load risk can be barriers to the development of new district energy systems. Third, development of district energy requires coordination amongst numerous stakeholders, including developers, building owners, utilities and the city. <br/>One strategy for overcoming these barriers is proceeding by way of public (e.g. municipally) owned district energy with a mandatory connection bylaw within a defined service area. This strategy has been successful in British Columbia, but requires the municipality to incur most of the financial risk and responsibility for developing, owning, operating and governing a district energy utility. There are several benefits to such a strategy such as: making it easier to establish mandatory connection requirement; municipally-owned utilities are exempt from economic regulation by the Alberta Utilities Commission (the AUC); municipalities can establish regulation aligned with the size and policy objectives for district energy; municipalities can have a lower cost of capital or longer time horizon; and municipalities can access low-cost financing or grants from governments that may not be available to the private sector. After the district energy system is established, the option exists to divest the system to the private sector. <br/>Another strategy to overcome the barriers is privately owned district energy systems. To utilize this strategy, the risk for private sector investment must be lowered, by incentivizing buildings to connect to district energy and/or introducing other mechanisms to lower initial costs or risks for new district energy systems. Additionally, there must be a framework for identifying and developing district energy opportunities with the private sector. <br/>The District Energy Strategy suggests an evolving framework to address district energy development, to ensure short term opportunities are not missed, while Edmonton develops and implements policies that will encourage more private sector participation in the future. Since Edmonton has no current plans to enforce compulsory GHG emission limits for non-city buildings, a policy of initiating municipally-owned district energy systems with mandatory connection bylaws in priority areas is identified as the primary method for developing district energy in the short-term. The District Energy Strategy outlines that Edmonton can also support district energy development by committing to connect new and existing city-owned buildings as anchor loads on city-owned or privately-owned systems; and Edmonton should consider initiating and de-risking new systems and then divest such systems once established, and re-invest the capital in another new system or expansion. This approach would be transitional as Edmonton works to develop the policy and regulatory groundwork for more private sector investment in the future. The District Energy Strategy goes on to note that over the near and medium term, Edmonton should make proposals to the AUC seeking decisions to ensure appropriate economic regulation of privately-owned district energy systems, and clarity around the AUC's approval criteria/process for franchise agreements. <br/>The District Energy Strategy concludes by identifying several short-term action items to support district energy development in Edmonton. <br/> Ensure buildings are ready to connect to district energy. Lead district energy development. Build a district energy database, identifying opportunities and collect energy data. Develop supporting policies and advocate for appropriate regulation. <br/>See our earlier blog titled: No Complaint to Complaint Based Regulation: Alberta Utilities Commission Decision 26717-D01-2022[2] relating to the Downtown District Energy Centre located in Calgary. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edmonton.ca/sites/default/files/public-files/District-Energy-Strategy.pdf?cb=1666469467#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Edmonton%20City%20Council,rise%20to%201.5%20%C2%B0C.#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Edmonton%20City%20Council,rise%20to%201.5%20%C2%B0C\">https://www.edmonton.ca/sites/default/files/public-files/District-Energy-Strategy.pdf?cb=1666469467#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Edmonton%20City%20Council,rise%20to%201.5%20%C2%B0C.#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Edmonton%20City%20Council,rise%20to%201.5%20%C2%B0C</url>.

Among them: How should I interpret air quality ratings? How does smoke affect my indoor air quality? Is it safe to walk my dog or head out for a hike today? <br/>Montana Free Press put those questions and others to public health officials and researchers. While the answers are sometimes tricky to navigate \u2014 and leave plenty of space for personal choice \u2014 the bottom line is that there are plenty of resources available to help you make decisions about your health and comfort this wildfire season. <br/>HOW DO I DETERMINE HOW BAD THE AIR QUALITY IS? <br/>You can check public websites, either the state of Montana's Today's Air page[1] or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Air Now website[2]. Both present sensor data from specific monitoring locations and report air quality ratings based on PM2.5 readings, which measure the concentration of small airborne particles at monitoring sites. <br/>MTFP also summarizes data from the Air Now website on the Montana Fire Report[3], which is updated hourly. Here's the map we publish there: <br/>Most weather apps aren't the best reference because they usually report air quality in terms of ozone levels, not PM2.5 concentrations, and forecast or model conditions instead of using real-time data, said BJ Biskupiak, who runs school-health and asthma-control programs at the state Department of Public Health and Human Services. Another issue with weather apps, Biskupiak added, is that it's not always easy to tell where the data is coming from. <br/>The Montana Department of Environmental Quality offers an email or text update system[4] that alerts users to smoke and wildfires. The Montana Wildfire Smoke web page from Climate Smart Missoula provides guidance on understanding the health impacts of wildfire smoke and making a plan for keeping your indoor air clean[5]. <br/>Missoula City-County Air Quality Specialist Sarah Coefield said she gets lots of questions about differences in the numbers reported by the EPA and the DEQ sites. Both agencies measure the same thing, but present the data differently, she said. <br/>Coefield said people should pay most attention to the colors attached to the ratings, which provide a general indication about how risky the air quality is. <br/>If you live somewhere without an EPA air quality monitor nearby, there may be data available from PurpleAir sensors[6], which are installed at homes or community centers. Coefield said the EPA's Fire and Smoke map [7]converts PurpleAir sensor data to reflect what a more accurate air quality monitor would display. <br/>One benefit of EPA's Fire and Smoke map is the amount of data it includes. The map displays air quality readings from permanent PM2.5 monitors, PurpleAir sensors and even temporary monitors that may be put in place due to nearby wildfire activity. <br/>Kerri Mueller, who also works as an air quality specialist for Missoula City-County, said that she prefers the Fire and Smoke map because it provides this additional data, helping to paint a more complete picture of air quality conditions across the state. <br/>Coefield said that DEQ has been working hard to expand its monitoring network. A new permanent air quality monitor was recently installed in Havre, and additional monitors in Choteau, Eureka, Glasgow and Glendive are expected to go on line by the end of the year. The new monitors will add to the 21 other permanent monitors currently in use across the state. <br/>WHAT IS PM? <br/>PM, or particulate matter, refers to tiny particles \u2014 solid or liquid \u2014 suspended in the air. It comes from a variety of sources, from windborne sand to wildfire smoke. Air currents can carry PM2.5 thousands of miles, Biskupiak said, which is why a fire in Canada can soot up skies over, say, Bozeman. <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 08.24.202308.28.2023  <br/> 08.23.202308.28.2023  <br/> 08.23.202308.28.2023  <br/><br/><br/>Coefield described wildfire smoke as a 'chemical stew.' It consists of gaseous pollutants including carbon monoxide, water vapor, volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs \u2014 which cause stingy eyes, scratchy throats and headaches \u2014 and solid particle pollution, like PM2.5. PM2.5, which is the tiniest version of particulate matter, is the most-often-measured component of wildfire smoke. The 2.5 indicates size \u2014 PM2.5 particles are less than two and a half micrometers in diameter, or about one twenty-fifth the diameter of a strand of hair. <br/>Because PM2.5 is so small, it escapes entrapment by nose hairs, which filter out unwanted particles, and makes its way into the lungs and bloodstream, said Tony Ward, chair of the School of Public and Community Health Sciences at the University of Montana. <br/>Ward said Montana has an extensive PM2.5 monitoring network because it's the most common type of air pollution in the state. <br/>WHAT DO THE U.S. EPA AIR QUALITY CATEGORIES MEAN? <br/>Public health officials sort air quality into six categories based on the amount of particulate in the air. Montana's public health department provides outdoor activity guidelines[8] for each category. Summarized briefly, those are: <br/>Good \u2014 No suggested limitation on activity. <br/>Moderate \u2014 Sensitive people should limit vigorous activity and watch for symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath. <br/>Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups \u2014 Sensitive people should limit outdoor activity to light or moderate exercise and avoid activity that lasts over two hours. <br/>Unhealthy \u2014 Everyone should stay inside as much as possible. Sensitive people should avoid long and intense activities and others should reduce vigorous activity. Consider moving activities inside or rescheduling. <br/>Very Unhealthy \u2014 Everyone should stay inside as much as possible. Sensitive groups should avoid all outdoor activity and others should avoid heavy exertion. <br/>Hazardous \u2014 Everyone should avoid all physical activity outside. Sensitive groups should keep indoor activity levels low. <br/>'Sensitive' refers to how likely a person is to be affected by airborne smoke, Biskupiak said. Children up to age 18 fall into this category because their lungs are still developing, and they inhale more air per pound of body weight than adults. Adults over 60 also tend to have pre-existing lung and heart conditions and less ability to fight off illness. The 'sensitive' group also includes people with chronic illnesses and pregnant people. The EPA has also added people of low socio-economic status and outdoor workers to the list of populations who experience adverse health effects from wildfire smoke[9].  <br/>Examples of 'light' activity include walking, stretching or lounging in the park. Yoga, gymnastics, canoeing and skateboarding are considered 'moderate' activity, and 'vigorous' exercise includes activities like running, mountain biking, wheeling a wheelchair and competitive sports. <br/>IS IT BETTER TO STAY INSIDE? <br/>The EPA says indoor air may actually be worse than air outside[10]. Ward said this is where people need to perform a personal risk assessment. 'There's no safe level of breathing in PM2.5,' he said. <br/>If you don't have air conditioning and open windows to cool your house on a smoky day, that can introduce particles into your living space. Ideally, people would have air filtration units in their homes, Ward said. That can range from installing air purifiers in every room to rigging a box fan to act as an air filter[11]. Air purifiers are rated based on filter size and matched to appropriate room size. Ward said that if your home only has one air filter, the best option is to create a clean-air space in a room where your family spends the most time. <br/>The state health department provides information on how to choose an appropriate HEPA filter[12] for your space and a weatherization assistance program[13]. The Montana Asthma Home Control program[14] also provides free, small HEPA filters to people with asthma. <br/>Coefield said people may need to make a judgment call between managing heat or smoke, especially if they don't have access to air conditioners or air purifiers. She advised letting in as much air at night as tolerable to cool down the house and cleaning it through whatever system is available. Coefield, who doesn't have central A/C, said that she uses air purifiers and a window A/C unit in her bedroom; she knows she has at least one cool, clean space to retreat to.  <br/>'The heat will kill you faster,' Coefield said. <br/>HOW CAN I PROTECT MYSELF (AND OTHERS) DURING HIGH HEAT? <br/>Many of the same principles that apply to smoke also apply to high heat, such as limiting time outside or choosing to stay indoors. <br/>Experts recommend wearing lightweight clothing and staying hydrated, as dehydration can sneak up on you when temperatures are hot. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.fundjournalism.org/donate/?campaign=7018Y000001m2oPQAQ\">https://montanafreepress.fundjournalism.org/donate/?campaign=7018Y000001m2oPQAQ</url><br/>'Don't wait until you're thirsty to drink water,' said Susan Teitelman, climate resiliency specialist at Climate Smart Missoula. Teitelman also advises against drinking sugary drinks and alcohol, as those beverages can dehydrate you. <br/>If temperatures are too high inside your home, going to the river or public indoor spaces like libraries can provide a refuge. <br/>'I always recommend finding indoor activities during those high heat events. Whether you have a gym membership, or can go to the movies \u2014 seek cool air for a little bit,' Mueller said. <br/>Teitelman said it's also important to check on friends and neighbors, especially older adults, and to keep an eye on pets. Waiting to walk pets until evening can reduce the risk of negative effects. <br/>WILL WEARING A MASK OUTSIDE HELP? <br/>Cloth and surgical masks aren't effective against PM2.5. N95 or P100 respirators can work if they're properly fitted and used correctly. If not worn properly, they can leak, which allows smoke to bypass the mask. <br/>IS MY AIR CONDITIONER HELPING OR HURTING? <br/>Air conditioners that bring outdoor air inside to cool and circulate can bring smoke in, too. Ward said having a filter on any A/C intake may help scrub out PM2.5. Alternatively, if your central A/C has a fresh air intake, set the unit to recirculate mode \u2014 that way, the A/C will draw air from inside the house, cooling it and recirculating it. Recirculation is an option for vehicles with air conditioning, too. <br/>HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ENJOY THE SUMMER WHILE KEEPING MY LUNGS SAFE? <br/>It's really about strategy and assessing your personal risk. <br/>If you're training for a marathon, Ward said, it might not be great to stick to your training plan. <br/>Inhaling PM2.5 is 'very harmful for your body not only [in the] short term, but also long term,' he said. Harmful effects include breathing problems, exacerbated asthma, cardiovascular diseases and even lung cancer. <br/>Keep an eye on air quality monitors, follow local smoke blogs and watch the weather. Wind patterns and pressure systems may be indicative of upcoming relief. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.org/montana-fire-report-2023\">https://montanafreepress.org/montana-fire-report-2023</url>/ <br/>WHAT DOES SMOKE ACTUALLY DO TO MY LUNGS? <br/>Respiratory and cardiovascular systems are the first to be affected by wildfire smoke. PM2.5 sinks deep into the lungs and, because it's so small, can dissolve into the bloodstream. People with pre-existing lung or heart conditions are at particular risk for hospitalization or early death after a month of sustained wildfire smoke[15]. <br/>After the 2017 Rice Ridge Fire in Seeley Lake, researchers followed members of the Seeley Lake community for two years to assess the impact of heavy wildfire smoke. Up to two years after the fire, researchers found a significant decrease in lung function[16]. A study out of the University of Montana found that higher PM2.5 concentrations in the summer are positively correlated with an increase in flu[17] the following winter. <br/>WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN IT'S BEEN SMOKY FOR DAYS? <br/>Contiguous days of smoke usually mean you're in close proximity to fires or weather systems that draw smoke into the same region. There will usually be interims of improved air quality even during a lengthy smoke event. When there's a break, Biskupiak said, it is important to open the windows and try to get the smoke out of your home. <br/>Aside from those cleaner-air moments, Biskupiak recommended setting a limit on time spent outdoors, monitoring air quality on a regular basis, using air quality data to adjust exercise routines, and keeping an eye out for symptoms. Coughing, scratchy eyes and throats, shortness of breath, wheezing and chest pain could indicate too much particulate exposure. <br/>Biskupiak said he limits how much time he spends outside during smoke events. He knows he doesn't fall into the 'sensitive groups' category, but when air quality is in the 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' or 'unhealthy' range, he might go on an easy half-hour walk, but that's it. <br/>Being attuned to your individual response to wildfire smoke is important, Biskupiak said, and can serve as a guide for moderating your outdoor activity. <br/>'It's really more nuanced than anyone would like it to be,' Coefield said. The orange 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' category might feel fine for you one day but intolerable a month later. <br/>Human health is a spectrum, Coefield said, and it's important to listen to your body. <br/>Knowing how to adjust to hot, smoky conditions is becoming an essential skill as hotter and drier summers result in increased wildfire activity. <br/>'What used to be every 10 years, every 20 years, now it's every summer that we're dealing with these forest fire issues,' Ward said. 'The more people know how to protect themselves, the better we'll be at adapting to this changing climate.' <br/> LATEST STORIES The veto and the void[18] Gov.

It is the language of authoritarians and corporatists bent on achieving even more centralized political power and economic wealth. It is a scam that explicitly targets and crushes the middle class in developed nations and the entire aspiring populations in developing nations.<br/>What is actually beyond debate is not that we are in a climate crisis but that if we don't stop destroying our conventional energy economy, we are going to be in a civilizational crisis.\u00a0<br/>Energy is the foundation of everything-prosperity, freedom, upward mobility, national wealth, individual economic independence, functional water and transportation infrastructure, commercial-scale agriculture, mining, and industry. And \"renewables\" are not even remotely capable of replacing oil, gas, coal, nuclear, and hydroelectric power. It's impossible.<br/>But it isn't enough to debunk the potential of renewables. It is also necessary to challenge the underlying climate \"science.\" The biased, unceasing avalanche of expert \"studies\" serving up paid-for ideas to special interests that use them to beat into the desired shape every relevant public policy and popular narrative. So here goes.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biased, Flawed Study\u00a0</emphasis><br/>A new study, released May 16, deserves far more criticism than it's going to get. Authored by seven experts primarily affiliated with the leftist Union of Concerned Scientists, this study has the rather innocuous title: \"Quantifying the contribution of major carbon producers to increases in vapor pressure deficit and burned area in western US and southwestern Canadian forests.\" Bursting with charts and equations, and too many links to corroborating sources to count, the study has all the accouterments of intimidating credibility. But serious questions may be raised as to its logic as well as its objectivity.<br/>For starters, the authors can't resist attacking these \"major carbon producers.\" In this revealing paragraph, the study's true intent becomes apparent: it is fodder for litigation.<br/>With the impacts of climate change growing increasingly severe, questions of who is responsible for climate change, how much responsibility each entity bears, and the obligations of those entities to mitigate future climate change and assist financially with climate adaptation are more present than ever in policy negotiations and in courtrooms around the world. These questions are deepened by the fact that the fossil fuel industry was aware of the climate-related risks of their products as early as the mid-1960s (Franta 2018) and, instead of shifting business practices, invested in campaigns and tactics to mislead the public and generate doubt about climate science.<br/>That paragraph has nothing to do with the stated goal of the study. It just shows the political and legal context in which this study is designed to play a useful part. But what about the logic?<br/>To explain what the authors got wrong, it is first necessary to summarize what they did. In plain English, the authors claim that hotter summers in recent years have caused more severe forest fires in the western United States, and fossil fuel emissions are causing the hotter summers.\u00a0<br/>To make their case, the authors have relied on a scientific term that imparts gravitas to the discussion, \"vapor pressure deficit.\" This is a big phrase that simply means \"dry air.\" The point they're making is that it isn't merely heat itself, but the fact that moisture is absent from the air, which causes trees to dry out faster and become easier to ignite and burn. But there are at least two gaping holes in this reasoning.\u00a0<br/>First, the heat waves afflicting western forests in recent years are not unique. Even in modern history, the hottest temperature ever recorded in California was in 1913, when it hit 134 degrees in Death Valley. As for whipsawing extremes, during the 1930s, a decade when hot temperatures rivaled if not exceeded those we experience today, the coldest temperature ever measured in California, negative 45 degrees, was recorded in Nevada County. But the last few centuries are a mere heartbeat in the meteorological history of California.<br/>Last year, the San Jose Mercury breathlessly reported that the drought-over now, by the way-was the \"worst in 1,200 years.\" This raises the obvious question, what about that even bigger drought that occurred 1,200 years ago? This same newspaper in 2014 reported that \"past dry periods lasted more than 200 years.\" And so what about these multi-century droughts? Do we have temperature data for them? Was it hot? What was the vapor pressure deficit during these prehistoric, 200-year droughts? Such questions are not asked, much less answered.<br/>One can go on. Prehistoric Sequoias, the predecessors of redwood trees, first appeared in the fossil record 200 million years ago, when dinosaurs still walked the earth. In their current form, redwoods have thrived in California for over 20 million years. For most of that period, the average global temperatures were considerably higher than they are today.<br/>But what if it isn't just heat, but dry heat, that is unprecedented today? What if the \"vapor pressure deficit\" is worse today than it has been at any time in 20 million years? That is a huge assumption, probably impossible to verify. Even if it's true, it doesn't make up for the study's other flaw, which is the density of forests in California today, which is truly unprecedented. The study's authors acknowledge they don't take this variable into account, writing:<br/>Our results highlight the roles of major carbon producers in driving forest fire extent by enhancing fuel aridity, but do not explicitly account for effects from non-climatic factors such as the prohibition of Indigenous burning, legacies of fire suppression, or changing human ignitions.<br/>The authors go on to contend this omission has \"not modified the climate-BA [burned area] relationship at the scale of this study.\"<br/>They're wrong.<br/>In California, wildlife biologists and forest ecologists who spend their lives studying and managing these timberlands unanimously agree that tree density has increased, thanks to \"non-climatic factors such as the prohibition of Indigenous burning, and legacies of fire suppression.\" The increase is not subtle.\u00a0<br/>Without small, naturally occurring fires that clear underbrush and smaller trees, forests become overgrown. Controlled burns and responsible logging are absolutely necessary to maintain forest health. According to a study conducted in 2020 by UC Davis and USDA, California's mid-elevation Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests used to average 60 trees per acre, and now they average 170 trees per acre according to conservative estimates.<br/>This is not an isolated finding. Observations of excessive tree density are corroborated by numerous studies, testimony, and journalistic investigations. Unlike the subjectively defined algorithms plugged into a climate model, excessive tree density is an objective fact, verified repeatedly by people on the ground. To imply by omission that more than tripling the density of trees across millions of acres of forest would not leave them stressed and starved for soil nutrients, sunlight, and water from rain and atmospheric moisture is scientific malpractice.<br/>Without taking these additional factors into account, it is deceptive to indict fossil fuel emissions for causing wildfires. Perhaps some indirect connection can be established of debatable relevance, but for this study to assign specific percentages and acreages suggests a premeditated purpose: creating material for expert testimony for litigation against oil companies.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Real Reason for Catastrophic Wildfires</emphasis><br/>California's forests are tinderboxes because environmentalists made it nearly impossible to get permits to do controlled burns and because environmentalists decimated the timber industry. In the face of relentless regulatory and litigious harassment, California's timber industry has shrunk from harvesting 6 billion board feet per year as recently as the 1990s to less than 2 billion board feet in recent years. Meanwhile, California's fire suppression industrial complex has grown to gargantuan proportions, pouring billions of dollars into putting fires out before they can spread.<br/>The result is predictable and doesn't require a climate scientist to explain it. We have mismanaged our forests for decades, mostly thanks to the misguided influence of environmentalist pressure groups on the state legislature. California's forests are now overcrowded with trees that are stressed, dried out, and ready to burst into flames, with or without a \"vapor pressure deficit.\"<br/>The solution, according to climate catastrophists, is to empty the dangerous, flammable \"urban/wildland interface\" of human habitation, mandate electric vehicles, and sue oil companies. This will accomplish nothing for the forests, even if every apocalyptic climate scenario were to come true. A rational solution would be to bring back the timber industry, deregulate controlled burns and mechanical thinning, revive responsible grazing of cattle, goats, and sheep to remove excessive foliage, and watch the forests again thrive.<br/>If mismanagement is what's really causing forest superfires, media misinformation is what's preventing policy reform. A Sacramento Bee headline, for example, says, \"Fossil fuel companies to blame for share of California wildfires . . . \" From The Hill: \"Scientists blame fossil fuel production for more than a third of Western wildfires.\" From \"Pulitzer Prize-winning\" Inside Climate News: \"Fossil Fuel Companies and Cement Manufacturers Could Be to Blame for a More Than a Third of West's Wildfires.\" None of these media reports mention tree density.<br/>The monolithic alignment of the scientific and journalistic community in support of an authoritarian, utterly impractical \"climate\" agenda reveals a misunderstanding if not outright betrayal of scientific and journalistic core values. Both disciplines are founded on the bedrock of skepticism and debate. Without nurturing those values, the integrity of these disciplines is undermined. When it comes to issues of climate and energy policy in America, science and journalism are compromised.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fossil Fuel Industry Failures</emphasis><br/>Oil and gas companies today are not willing to challenge the climate crisis orthodoxy, or the myth of cost-effective renewables at scale. They aren't willing to devote their substantial financial resources to debunking this agenda-driven madness that is on the verge of taking down our entire civilization. America's oil and gas companies have adopted a strategy of appeasement. The fact that these companies are failing to make long-term investments to develop new oil and gas fields, and instead are reaping windfall profits as they sell existing production at politically inflated prices, is a crime against civilization.<br/>Ultimately, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the major oil companies are complicit in the destruction of America's energy economy. Because rather than declaring total war on these paid-for, flawed scientific studies and the special interests that fund them, oil companies will engage in theatrical litigation, knowing that the cost of settlements won't even come close to the short-term profits to be had by slowly asset stripping their companies while selling diminishing quantities of fuel at punitive rates.<br/>It's not enough to criticize the \"experts\" that want to destroy human civilization with climate alarmism. We must also recognize and criticize the institutions targeted for destruction. Instead of fighting this lunacy, they are taking their money off the table, along with their life-affirming affordable fuel, and heading for the hills.<br/>This is a shorter version of an article that originally appeared in American Greatness.<br/><br/>Edward Ring is a senior fellow with the California Policy Center, which he co-founded in 2013.\u00a0Ring is the author of\u00a0Fixing California: Abundance, Pragmatism, Optimism\u00a0(2021) and\u00a0The Abundance Choice: Our Fight for More Water in California\u00a0(2022).<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-186768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HN-KTX1-DYY9-015X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2023 California Policy, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>California Policy Center</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 21, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>The Abundance Choice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CalFire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California forest fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>firefighters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>forest management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forests</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Oil &amp;

But the Gucci-shoed sandwich board prophets were wrong. The end is anything but nigh, which is good news for fans of fall foliage. </p><p><br/>Three things you can count on <br/>There's a joke that goes something like this. You can count on only two things in this world: death and taxes. That's no longer true. There are three\u2014death, taxes, and dire Climate Cult predictions that never come to pass. <br/>If it were a foretelling of the second coming of Jesus, they'd have been laughed off the world state decades ago. But they have deep pockets or deep-pocketed backers. A Vatican Bank, if you like, and maybe that bank is in on the scam as well - the end of the world being up their alley. <br/>But these are 'Bums' in Bergdorf Goodman suits, pimping muppets like Greta Thunberg to peddle their bottles of piss. <br/>It's the oldest confidence scam in the book - from before, there were books. The end is nigh. Come into the light to be saved. If you refuse, we shall all be damned to some hell that includes no maple syrup[1], bad apples[2], the end of skiing[3], beachless beaches[4], fewer potatoes[5], more forest fires[6], undermined ancient monuments[7], and less leaf-peeping\u2014a world filled with plagues, shortages, and not enough energy to keep us warm. <br/>They failed so badly at predicting what nature would do that they had to 'man-make it all' themselves. The Gucci-shoed sandwich board prophets engineered a virus (and a more dangerous cure), wrecked the economy, the supply chain, the energy markets, and look: we're running low on things, or they are getting unaffordable. <br/>The climate they were referring to was theirs but look on the bright side. The fall foliage soothsayers think it'll be another good year to get out and watch the leaves die[8]. <br/><br/>Vermont Forest, Parks and Recreation Commissioner Michael Snyder, along with a team of foresters, have put out the state'sfirst weekly fall foliage report[9] of the season. For the next six weeks they will let leaf-peepers know about the progression of the season based on scientific data. The stage is set for another season of resplendent fall color, Snyder and company said in their report from September 12. <br/><br/>It's still game on for autumn in New England. New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Upstate New York predict that New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Upstate New York will be the best places to see the best color this autumn. I won't disagree. Fall in New England isn't just some pretty trees and colder temps (which do not, as a reminder, mean the end of climate change)[10]. <br/>This annual splendor is impossible without change. It is change. Autumn is climate change with or without the Gucci-shoed sandwich board prophets. And this year, not unlike all th others, change looks good (and has nothing at all to do with your western lifestyle). <br/><br/><br/>The post Leaf-Peeping Season Exepected to Be Good Despite Climate

It was the first controlled burn on the Carson since the record-breaking Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire, ignited after two controlled burns escaped control, consumed more than 341,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Willows Piles burn bore a striking resemblance to the Gallinas Canyon pile burn - one of two prescribed fires the U.S. Forest Service conducted in the Santa Fe National Forest that raged out of control west of Las Vegas, N.M., and combined to form the historic wildfire that destroyed hundreds of homes in Northern New Mexico, damaged property and critical infrastructure and displaced thousands of people over four months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But fire personnel on the Carson - and elsewhere in New Mexico and across the country - are operating under new protocols designed to prevent a repeat of the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon disaster.</p><p>The Gallinas Canyon pile burn, which was ignited in January 2022 in wet conditions with heavy snow accumulation high in the mountains, \"smoldered underground for months, persisting through multiple snowstorms and freezing temperatures before resurfacing\" in mid-April, according to U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore. Earlier that month, the Las Dispensas prescribed fire had blown out of control further east amid heavy winds.</p><p>Moore halted prescribed burns in all national forests and ordered a review of Forest Service practices in May, and a National Fire Review later determined the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire was the result of a combination of missteps, including a burn plan based on outdated modeling that didn't account for worsening drought conditions, climate change and extreme weather.</p><p>A report issued in September delivered recommendations to help fire personnel better conduct prescribed burns, which are considered essential to forest management.</p><p>Shorter burn windows</p><p>National forests have reviewed and updated their prescribed fire plans. The Willows Piles burn - slash and woody debris collected in piles from several years of tree thinning associated with a timber sale - moved forward only after an updated burn plan was approved by experts and administrators.</p><p>\"We've been working hard on this, and this is our first burn since our pause,\" said Angie Krall, West Zone deputy district ranger for the Carson. \"We've burned piles in this country for many, many years, but this one feels different. This is a new operating environment for us.</p><p>But what's not new is the need to put fire on the landscape,\" she added. \"We all want to get back to it safely and effectively. At the end of the day, it is forest restoration.\"</p><p>After a recent weather briefing, crews were given the tentative go-ahead to begin the Willow Piles burn the following day.</p><p>As snow fell outside the Tres Piedras Ranger District office on a breezy morning, trainee Burn Boss Una Pesata described why conditions appeared to be ideal for the burn.</p><p>\"You're probably thinking, 'What are we thinking, burning in this weather; it's a blizzard out there' - actually it's intentional,\" she said. \"This precip is not going to last very long, and it's gonna be great conditions for us to burn. We need the wind to help us get these piles burning and to get the smoke up and out.\"</p><p>Pesata highlighted one major difference in prescribed burn operations since the national review: Instead of a window that might have stretched for days in the past, ignition authorizations are now only valid for 24 hours.</p><p>\"It's just today; we only get this prescription for today,\" Pesata said, noting that, with 3 feet of snow on the ground, \"the potential for escape of these piles is going to be very low.\"</p><p>After Pesata traveled to the burn site and confirmed conditions on the ground matched up with the conditions called for by the updated burn plan, a test pile was ignited successfully. It began burning efficiently and under control and with minimal smoke impacts on the ground, and then the final go-ahead was given to light up the rest of the piles.</p><p>Closer monitoring</p><p>To avoid a pile reigniting unexpectedly or a controlled burn escaping, the Forest Service has committed to greatly enhanced long-term monitoring of burn sites, with what West Zone Fire Management Officer Jamie Long called \"a chain of custody identified for the person\" ultimately responsible for keeping tabs on a given controlled burn site.</p><p>\"If George Allalunis, the actual [Willows Piles] burn boss has anything else that he's got to do that will take him away from [the role of] burn boss, we'll identify another burn boss behind him\" to take over, Long said. \"That will continue to where we don't see any smoke, we feel it's good - and then we'll still identify an incident commander to come out here and verify things are still good,\" with on-the-ground confirmation that no piles are still burning.</p><p>Contingencies to allow personnel to quickly respond to out-of-control prescribed burns are now in place, as well. For example, firetrucks must now be able to respond to an escaped burn within 30 minutes, rather than the two- to six-hour variable window that was mandated before the National Review.</p><p>Better communication</p><p>Krall confirmed Monday the pile burn was proceeding as planned, demonstrating another new protocol: increased communication with communities and elected officials regarding individual prescribed burns.</p><p>\"We are currently [still] in the 'ignition phase,' which we started on Feb. 9,\" Krall said, noting piles across 350 acres - \"or about 70%\" - of the 500-acre burn area had been ignited by Feb. 10.</p><p>The earliest next possible window for completing the burn was Feb. 15, she said.</p><p>\"The burn is now in monitor status and being regularly checked by personnel,\" she continued. \"As you saw, we had great results on Thursday, getting the consumption rate we want. During monitoring, our crews are seeing some smoldering, minimal fire behavior and minimal smoke impacts. We are committed now to seeing this project through.</p><p>\"When the ignition phase is over, we will move into our longer-term monitoring plan - now required after the National Fire Review - using a variety of methods with personnel, satellite infrared technology and drones,\" she said. \"As the snow begins to melt off, we will be on the lookout for particular indicators that would potentially trigger our Step Up Plan,\" which she said involves dispatching personnel and equipment to prevent flames from spreading.</p><p>\"In plain language, we will be looking closely at site conditions - snowpack, green-up and weather - as we move into the warmer months,\" she said. \"We will be doing more monitoring over a longer period of time as required in our new policy.\"</p><p>This story first appeared in The Taos News, a sister publication of The Santa Fe New Mexican.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15725683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67KK-TGJ1-DY7H-R36N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1157\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 19, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

These aspects of the thriller genre are especially present in the first trio of feature films written by screenwriter and director Taylor Sheridan, consisting of \"Sicario\" (2015), \"Hell or High Water\" (2016)\u00a0 and \"Wind River\" (2017). As neo-westerns, each of the three films holds the distinction for their grounded nature, hard-boiled action, nuanced performances from A-list stars, and social commentary on the modern American frontier.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having been established as an original and expressive voice in modern cinema, it should not come as a surprise that major companies like Warner Bros. would seek him out. Released in theaters and to HBO Max on May 14, 2021, \"Those Who Wish Me Dead\" is the latest feature film to be both co-written and directed by Sheridan. The film appears to be much more commercialized compared to his previous films; however, the film falls flat due to the degradation of what made his most notable films stand out.</p><p>The film is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by co-writer Michael Koryta. Set in the wilderness of Park County, Montana, the film follows smoke jumper Hannah Faber (Angelina Jolie) as she struggles to cope with an error that led to the deaths of her colleagues and civilian campers during a forest fire. Now a fire lookout, she comes across a boy (Finn Little) in the forest who witnessed the murder of his father at the hands of two ruthless assassins (Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult). In possession of valuable information from his father, the boy takes shelter with Hannah to evade the assassins. Their fight for survival is further complicated by the presence of a raging forest fire.</p><p>Angelina Jolie and Jon Bernthal in \"Those Who Wish Me Dead\" (2021). (Taylor Sheridan/BRON Studios)</p><p>The film's narrative moves at a straightforward pace and does not offer sufficient enough characterization. The opening half-hour sets up an intriguing plot but moves at a slow pace for the sake of exposition. The introduction to Jolie's character humanizes her in a way that doesn't immediately paint her as the hero of the film, but as a flawed individual. The introduction to the pair of assassins is executed well and gives viewers enough visual information about them to emphasize the banterful relationship and cold professionalism between them. The opening hour sets up interesting elements like the employer of the assassins, the vital evidence and Hannah's trauma, but it never feels fully fleshed out as it should be and not much is resolved by the end of the film.\u00a0</p><p>As the latter half of the film turns into an adventure-type film that lacks subtlety or effective tension, the opening hour appears to be an empty promise for a grounded thriller that never happens. The realistic nature of the film is gone as two characters run across a field to evade lighting bolts, or when a character is set on fire and only suffers a minimal burn scar. The characters all turn into unnatural action movie archetypes by the film's end.\u00a0</p><p>In regard to action, most of the shootouts lack a sense of tension or high stakes, save for a notable one in the climax. The forest fire doesn't appear to be a significant part of the film either until the climactic fight scene; for the most part, it just sets up a deadline for the characters to quickly progress through the story. Even then, the fire doesn't function as too big a threat for the characters. Overall, the film's action doesn't feel weighty enough to convey intensity or make it seem as though the characters are really in danger.\u00a0</p><p>Nicholas Hoult in \"Those Who Wish Me Dead\" (2021). (Taylor Sheridan/BRON Studios)</p><p>The cast does well at providing naturalistic performances. Jolie delivers a likability and charisma to Hannah that plays off well with Little's Connor. Their chemistry is highlighted by banter and emotional moments that give audiences incentive to care about their characters.\u00a0</p><p>The supporting cast's performances are fine, but they feel hindered by the limitations of the script. Jon Bernthal does well as the sheriff character, but his character feels unoriginal since he's given overused tropes like the pregnant wife and being the straight-arrow cop without much distinction. Gillen delivers menace as the older assassin while sharing chemistry with Hoult's younger assassin; initially, it seems like there's a layer of dimensions to the characters, especially in the nuances of uncertainty from Hoult, but they aren't fully developed and their characterization doesn't go anywhere interesting.\u00a0</p><p>On another note, a prime example of the script's limitations is the casting of Tyler Perry as the assassins' employer, in what could easily be classified as a cameo due to his short screen time. He only ever appears in the one scene to encourage the assassins to find Connor, and it feels like wasted casting as it feels like a subplot setup that doesn't feel relevant at the film's end. While the performers do good with what they're given, the biggest hindrance is the lack of sufficient characterization.</p><p>\"Those Who Wish Me Dead\" functions as a thriller marked by inconsistency in its narrative, unrealized characters and no thematic resonance. Along with \"Sicario: Day of The Soldado\" (2018) and \"Without Remorse\" (2021), also co-written by Sheridan, the film is the third recent consecutive misfire in his filmography. As the three films branch off of or are adapted from existing works, it is evident that Sheridan's strength may lie in crafting smaller and original films. In a month filled with thrillers, \"Those Who Wish Me Dead\" fails to live up to expectations and stand apart from other films in the genre.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5000633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62PY-G5S1-JBSN-344P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seahawk: University of North Carolina Wilmington</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 19, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Wilmington</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UJC</classCode><className>LITERATURE GENRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009V8J</classCode><className>MYSTERY &amp; SUSPENSE LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VKZ</classCode><className>FILM GENRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009UM7</classCode><className>DRAMA LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N512107MM</classCode><className>MOVIE INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VKZ</classCode><className>FILM GENRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N512100CC</classCode><className>MOVIE &amp; VIDEO INDUSTRIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DS3V</classCode><className>NICHOLAS HOULT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>PE0009TR4</classCode><className>ANGELINA JOLIE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D277</classCode><className>WILMINGTON, NC, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS149</classCode><className>NORTH CAROLINA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS142</classCode><className>MONTANA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

From the forests of Portugal, to the woods of California, to the recent devastation of the Australian bushfires, widespread fires are often a regular, annual concern. Worsening climate conditions only continue to make these fires more prevalent and deadlier. For researchers, firefighters, and policymakers working to address this problem, the goal is to minimize damage as much as possible both to the environment and to the people living nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the best ways to minimize the probability of large-scale fires is through the use of prescribed burns. Through the natural lifecycle of a forest, tree branches, dried leaves and other organic debris build up on the forest floor. When wildfires do break out, it is this debris that serves as some of the primary fuel, helping fires spread more quickly. By using prescribed burns, forest managers can go into an area and eliminate this organic fuel with smaller, low-temperature fires. When the next wildfire starts up, it has less fuel to burn and can be contained much more easily.</p><p>But while these burns have been shown to help reduce the physical damage done by the fires themselves, Coty Jen, assistant professor of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, is concerned that using these burns might just be trading one kind of damage for another.</p><p>\"Prescribed burns are currently the most effective method we have to manage forests in the western United States,\" said Jen. \"But burning such a large amount of built-up fuel feet of duff and tree litter on the forest floor will significantly impact the regional air quality. My group is interested in understanding how the smoke from managing the unmanaged forest is different in chemical composition from that of the wildfires themselves. Is it more toxic to human health? We are working with forest managers to understand this difference.\"</p><p>Part of the problem is that not all forest litter is created equal. Depending on the makeup of a particular area of forest, a wide variety of debris could be present, from fallen branches to different shrubs or grasses. As Jen's research has discovered, the presence of different organic fuels can lead to very different outcomes.</p><p>\"We've so far found that certain types of fuel produce way more organic smoke white smoke as opposed to black, sooty smoke than other fuels,\" said Jen. \"We also found that certain plants produce more toxic compounds. One example being manzanita, a common shrub in coastal California, just spews unhealthy hydroquinone when burned. Unfortunately, the vast majority of compounds we found in smoke have not previously been studied for health impacts, so understanding just how toxic these compounds are to humans has to be the next step.\"</p><p>While the differences between these toxic compounds are still unclear, the negative health impacts of burning organic material have been known for a long time. Certain atmospheric particles known as organic aerosols particles released when organic materials like trees and other plant matter are burned have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and even death.</p><p>In addition, we know that chronic lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, which can be brought on or exacerbated by wildfire smoke inhalation, are risk factors that could potentially make one more susceptible to contracting a more severe case of COVID-19. This ongoing crisis makes research in this area more important than ever, and Jen and her lab are beginning to look into how best to ensure wildfires don't make the problem worse.</p><p>Next, Jen and her research team intend to travel to the forests of California, working with the University of California, to study these different emissions in the field and characterize the different compounds present in the smoke from these prescribed burns, in both previously managed and unmanaged forests.</p><p>\"Overall, we know that these prescribed burns are the best way we have to mitigate the spread of wildfires, and they should be done,\" said Jen. \"What we need to do now is figure out where and how to prescribe these burns to best manage the forest while minimizing the human health risks posed by the smoke.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123717099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600N-S4N1-DYTH-G43J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"728\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 26, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The timber harvest would take approximately five years to complete, while the other work could take up to 10 years.</p><p>About 9,712 hundred cubic feet of commercial timber is projected, with an estimated value of $490,000.</p><p>Two hiking trails would be affected by the work, trail Nos. 80 and 83, although the impacts are expected to be short-term and minimal.</p><p>Less than a mile of temporary roads would be used and rehabilitated following timber harvest activities, while approximately 3.4 miles of  roads would be constructed and made impassable following the work.</p><p>Overall public motorized access would not change.</p><p>Forest officials says the project is aimed at improving forest health in this remote area, reducing tree density and forest fire fuels, while also sending some logs to local mills.</p><p>\"One goal is to shift the forest back to a historical stand structure. We want to decrease stand density, improve forest health, and increase the presence of fire-tolerant species such as ponderosa pine so that our forests are more likely to survive future wildfires and pest outbreaks,\" said Spotted Bear District Ranger Scott Snelson.</p><p>Forest officials report that a lack of wildfire in the project area has resulted in an overly dense forest and a shift in species from ponderosa pine to Douglas fir. The crowded Douglas-fir dominated forest is more susceptible to insects and disease, and root disease are active in the project area.</p><p>The project was first announced in November 2021.</p><p>\"We received comments both in favor and against the project,\" said Snelson. \"We are anxious for feedback now that a draft environmental assessment has been prepared.\"</p><p>A map, project information and instructions for how to provide comment is posted online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=61010\">www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=61010</url></p><p>___ (c)2022 the Daily Inter Lake (Kalispell, Mont.)
