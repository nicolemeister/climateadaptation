THIESSEN \"@marcthiessen</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HOUSE Speaker Nancy Pelosi is, once again, playing politics with impeachment. On CBS News' <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">60 Minutes</emphasis> on Sunday, she warned that President Donald Trump has to be removed because he poses an imminent threat to the country. We have a \"deranged, unhinged, dangerous president of the United States, and we're only a number of days until we can be protected from him,\" said Pelosi.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, if Trump is that dangerous, why didn't she call the House back immediately to pass articles of impeachment, and then challenge the Senate to come back into session and hold a trial this week? Instead, she waited until Wednesday - a full week after the U.S. Capitol riot - to hold a House vote. House Majority Whip James Clyburn suggested this weekend that Pelosi could wait until well into the Biden presidency before sending impeachment articles to the Senate. \"Let's give President-elect [Joe] Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,\" Clyburn said. \"And maybe we will send the articles sometime after that.\"</p><p>Pelosi is politicizing what are very serious and weighty questions: Did the president of the United States engage in impeachable conduct? And is it prudent to impeach him when the Constitution will remove him from office in a matter of days?</p><p>On the first question, the answer is clearly yes. It is true that, as some legal scholars have pointed out, Trump would never be convicted of incitement in a criminal court. As former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, who successfully prosecuted \"blind sheikh\" Omar Abdel Rahman for incitement, told me, \"An incitement case is very difficult in criminal court. ... You have to intend that a violent crime take place.\" McCarthy points out, however, that the issue in impeachment is not criminal liability, but whether the president committed what Alexander Hamilton described as political offenses that call into question his fitness for office. And by that standard, McCarthy says, what Trump did was \"clearly an impeachable offense\" and \"a deep betrayal of his obligations as president ... to protect our elections, rather than undermine them, and to protect Congress.\"</p><p>For more than six weeks, Trump ginned up anger among his supporters, telling them they had reelected him in a landslide and that their victory was being stolen from them. He then brought a massive crowd to Washington on the day that Congress was meeting to confirm Biden's Electoral College victory, and urged them to march on the Capitol. He might not have intended for his supporters to storm the building, but he recklessly stoked a throng of people who did just that -and five deaths occurred.</p><p>Instead of immediately rushing to the cameras to call off his supporters, Trump sat back and watched them ransack the Capitol. An hour after they had overwhelmed police barricades, Trump poured gasoline on the fire, tweeting, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country.\" (Indeed, Trump never even bothered to call to see whether the vice president was safe.) Only at 2:38 p.m. did Trump feebly tweet urging the already violent mob to \"Stay peaceful!\" It was not until 4:17 p.m. - nearly three hours into the assault - that Trump finally posted a video telling his supporters, \"You have to go home now.\" Even then, he spent more time claiming his \"landslide\" election was \"stolen\" than calling for calm.</p><p>And while Trump might not have intended to provoke violence, he intended to send a crowd to coerce Pence into committing an unconstitutional act by invalidating electoral votes cast for Biden. That is an abuse of power. Trump told the crowd that \"all Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president.\" They swarmed into the Capitol chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" when he refused. Trump played with matches and started a forest fire - that makes him culpable for the death and destruction that ensued, even if he didn't intend to set the fire.</p><p>The second question is more difficult. If Trump had nine months left in office, rather than nine days, there is no doubt that he should be removed from office. It is unclear, however, whether at this late date, an impeachment trial is in the country's best interests. It would divide the country, turn Trump into a martyr, and keep him front and center for months into Biden's term. There is also the risk that he might be acquitted because some Republicans might decide they cannot convict a president who has already left office, while others fear alienating constituents who just voted to give Trump a second term. Trump could then claim vindication.</p><p>The best thing might be to let him simply leave in ignominy. But Pelosi seems to care more about politics and retribution than what is best for the country.</p><p>Marc Thiessen writes a twice-weekly column for the Washington Post on foreign and domestic policy.

That's when I know I better find cover.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A moment later, the air vibrates, and a static hum reaches her ears. Sheets of gray rain across the upper South Fork of the Sun River advance toward Ms. Duffey's 1962 U.S. Forest Service lookout building here in \"The Bob\" - Montana's Bob Marshall Wilderness. Her border collie, Mae, leads the way up the steps and through the tattered screen door.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The southeast wind picks up and finds the cracks between the wood and 107 windowpanes. Each fragile piece was carried on a mule up the winding 6-mile trail from the valley. The radio sputters with trail crews checking in.</p><p>\"The cabin shakes when the wind hits 25 miles per hour,\" she says, leaning against the shuttering western wall. \"I think I can feel it coming.\"</p><p>As the room darkens beneath the clouds, her grin anticipates the collision between the storm and her shelter, giving away her comfort with wilderness extremity.</p><p>For the past 26 wildfire seasons, since the age of 21, Ms. Duffey has served as a fire lookout for the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest. Decades of legendary solo bushwhacking trips across ridges and drainages have resulted in intimate knowledge of her fire district and beyond. This \"ground truthing\" helps her pinpoint smoke and flames with acute accuracy.</p><p>After watching the American West burn summer after summer from her perch\u00a0above tree line, she's developed a complex view of environmental responsibility, informed by a palpable joy in the wilderness and ethical introspection on the interactions between the human and nonhumanworld.\u00a0</p><p>\"This place has a value in and of itself without humans. The intrinsic value of wilderness is wilderness,\" she says. \"My duty is to try to interpret, report, and provide experiences for people where they understand that. And beyond that privilege is the joy of getting up every day and looking at this landscape.\" \u00a0</p><p>The sweep of that terrain comes into sharp focus as the battering gusts and fat rain on the trembling windows let up after only half an hour. As the storm rolls east out of the mountains and onto the prairie, the strobe of cloud-to-cloud lightning above Haystack Butte brightens its dramatic pinnacle and steep sides for an instant.</p><p>It started with a grizzly encounter</p><p>Bears padded quietly across the forest floor near a tent where a 16-year-old Samsara and her mother slept. The two had backpacked into Indian Point in The Bob the day before and hung their food packs high in the trees after dinner.</p><p>\"We didn't know when we arrived, but there were habituated grizzly bears in the area,\" the fire spotter today explains, noting that the bears had become accustomed to humans and their food. The commotion of the bears discovering their packs woke mother and daughter, but in the dark night neither of them could see the animals. Morning light revealed their supplies strewn across the pine needles, torn by teeth and claws.</p><p>\"They were so comfortable around humans, the Fish, Wildlife, and Parks killed the sow, and the cubs were sent to a zoo in Little Rock, Arkansas,\" says Ms. Duffey.</p><p>That incident shaped her sense of responsibility for her impact on the natural world: \"I felt it was my fault,\" she says, her voice cracking. \"And so, a lot of what I've done through my work is to try to keep that from happening.\"</p><p>Spurred by her commitment to wild places and creatures, and hoping to prevent more human-animal conflict, she majored in wildlife management at the University of Alaska Fairbanks after high school in Helena, Montana. A few semesters into her studies, she realized that the science of wildlife management - \"the counting and counting\" - didn't interest her, but she still earned her bachelor's in wildlife biology. The ethics of how the human and nonhuman world interact grip her to this day.</p><p>In 1997, home in Montana for the summer and searching for work, Ms. Duffey learned that the lookout job at Patrol was open. With her sister located at the Prairie Reef lookout 12 miles (as the crow flies) from Patrol, she jumped at the opportunity.</p><p>While not the highest peak in the range, the mountain still offers an expansive view of the U.S. Forest Service's 1,200-square-mile fire district - an area the size of Rhode Island. The view of the land she's responsible for in the Patrol district, and beyond, is carved and buckled by Straight Creek and the South Fork of the Sun River drainages, Sugarloaf Mountain, Scapegoat Plateau, and countless limestone cliffs.\u00a0</p><p>Yet even these sweeping vistas aren't temptation enough to draw many hikers up the trail to the lookout - on average 60 to 80 a summer sign Ms. Duffey's guest book at the summit. In just 6 miles, from the Straight Creek trailhead on the dirt Benchmark Road, the path ascends nearly 3,000 vertical feet and includes a slick-stoned creek crossing that runs cold with snowmelt. It's also her only maintained route to civilization. \u00a0</p><p>This unique summer job was federally established more than six decades before Ms. Duffey was born. A series of rampant fires burned 3 million acres in Montana, Idaho, and Washington in 1910. \"The Great Fire,\" as it was called, sparked the Forest Service to prioritize fire detection in protecting the nation's natural resources.\u00a0</p><p>Lookout towers were built across the country, and by the 1940s, around 5,000 fire lookouts stewarded the national forests. However, most of those posts have closed due to advances in technology such as planes and satellite imaging. The Forest Fire Lookout Association estimates around 400 fire lookouts are still operational today.</p><p>Ms. Duffey's 12 weeks of work fall roughly between July 1 and Sept. 20 every year. The four-days-on, three-days-off rotation consists of 10-hour shifts when she monitors trail crews, fields questions from the Forest Service in Great Falls, and scans the expansive landscape for smoke. On the days she turns the radio off, Ms. Duffey explores the wilderness just off the steps of her wooden cabin.\u00a0</p><p>Priceless ground truth</p><p>The gurgling summer flows of the South Fork of the Sun River were interrupted by the jingling straps and buckles of a pack train headed into the backcountry over a decade ago. Montana writer Hal Herring had moved to the Rocky Mountain Front only a few years prior and was still learning the lay of land. Accompanied by some friends, Mr. Herring was bound for the White River, deep in The Bob. Their mules were loaded with a week's worth of camping supplies tucked in panniers. A sharp bend in the trail revealed a woman drinking water in a snowberry patch, her running shorts and shoes out of place on a remote path on which most people are burdened by backpacks and boots.\u00a0</p><p>\"The people I was with knew her, so they all said hello,\" says Mr. Herring, who waved as he passed. \"I asked them at our next break, 'Who was that in the shorts?'\"</p><p>\"Samsara, the Patrol Mountain lookout,\" his companions chorused, explaining that on her days off, she sometimes runs to a neighboring lookout at Prairie Reef to visit.\u00a0</p><p>\"I turned and couldn't even see Patrol from where we were,\" Mr. Herring laughs. \"I asked the party, 'Isn't that really far?'\"</p><p>\"Not for her,\" they replied.</p><p>Ms. Duffey has an extraordinary ability to read the land and feels comfortable exploring off trail.</p><p>\"I see a mountain, ridge, or basin I want to reach, and I just hike. Used to run more,\" she laughs. \"There doesn't necessarily need to be a trail. I used to look at a lot of topographic maps, but now I know the landscape well. If I really need to make time, more than 20 miles in a day, I'll stick to the trail. But when I'm exploring, I'll take old, no longer maintained trails or animal paths.\"</p><p>Unless she's hiking through a recent burn, Ms. Duffey negotiates forests littered with blowdown - dead trees toppled by wind that make walking more like climbing through a jungle gym. Lodgepole pines are notorious for remaining flexible after death, and their sharp branches catch skin and clothing as a hiker scrambles over, under, and around. Even maintained trails have fallen trees, and because The Bob is federally designated wilderness, trail crews aren't allowed to use chain saws to remove the fallen timber, resulting in slower clearing. Ms. Duffey has learned her landscape through blood, sweat, and worn-out shoes.</p><p>\"It helps me know the place I'm responsible for,\" she says. \"All the hiking is forpleasure, but it helps me be better at my job.\"</p><p>With this knowledge of \"ground truthing\" - providing direct observation on-site to confirm mapping images - she can isolate smoke quickly and report flames with familiar detail, which is invaluable to her supervisors in Great Falls.</p><p>\"A fire lookout's knowledge and presence on the landscape is pretty priceless,\" says Michael Kaiser, Helena district fire management officer. \"They can guide folks into the fire they spotted either through trails, roads, or landscape features. And when they have eyes on the fire, they can provide updates to make sure folks on the ground don't get into a bad situation.\"</p><p>One such fire Ms. Duffey spotted in 2021 burned near Danaher Cabin, an 1800s homestead now used as a Forest Service patrol station, which is beyond her district boundary. \"Scrambling through that country helped me develop a feel for the distances when reporting the fire,\" she explains, \"and I could tell that the smoke was on the west side of the mountain coming from somewhere near the cabin.\"\u00a0</p><p>The \"jolt\" of recognition</p><p>The sky was empty except for drift smoke from far-off fires one summer day in 2019. Ms. Duffey sat at the radio knitting, not expecting any storms until later in the afternoon. Then, like a tulip unfurling in the morning, a thunderhead suddenly blossomed to the south. Without the warning of thunder, it dropped a single strike, then fizzled back into the blue not 10 minutes after it appeared. The spontaneous cloud left her delighted and awed at the dynamic nature of the sky she monitors.</p><p>\"This is a good place to look at clouds,\" she says.</p><p>In the mountains Ms. Duffey stewards, human-caused fires are rare due to the remote nature of the forest. Lightning strikes are the most common igniter, and knowing the different clouds helps her prepare for incoming weather and possible fires.</p><p>\"When I see some wispy virga, that indicates strong winds up high. When I get completely overcast, it's a midlevel stratocumulus, which is just a solid layer. And then there are the orographic or ground-effect clouds like lenticular clouds,\" she explains, the scientific descriptions animating her face as she talks.</p><p>But what happens when the watching becomes witnessing - when her big sky reverie is interrupted by that plume of smoke she's commissioned to look for.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's a jolt,\" she says.</p><p>\"No matter how many I spot, there's a similar rush every time,\" she confesses. \"And because of that initial rush, my first step is to grab my binoculars and make sure it is smoke. Even after 50-some fires, I'll get excited over blowing pollen, which can mimic smoke. There's another phenomenon right after a storm called 'waterdogs' that can look like smoke as well.\"\u00a0</p><p>Once smoke is confirmed, she uses her Osborne fire finder to pinpoint the location of the fire. Despite being developed in the early 20th century - the model in the Patrol lookout was made in 1934 and sports an updated map from 1967 - this technology is still one of the modern fire lookout's most important tools.\u00a0</p><p>Installed in the heart of the cabin, the fire finder is a map of the surrounding landscape with a hole at the epicenter marking the lookout. The map is bordered by a graduated measurement ring. And to determine the bearing of a fire, Ms. Duffey peers through a sighting hole on one side of the tool's rim.\u00a0</p><p>Using a welded handle on the measurement ring, she rotates her sight until it's aligned with the wire crosshairs on the far side. The crosshairs must zero in on the smoke or flames. Then, using the map and her expertise of the landscape she's watched and walked, Ms. Duffey can estimate roughly how far away the fire is from the lookout. The heading to the smoke is called an azimuth, the horizontal angle or direction of a compass bearing.\u00a0</p><p>She then fills out a smoke report, radios the dispatch operator in Great Falls, and continues to monitor the smoke.</p><p>\"Once I call it in, everything is out of my hands. I'll take note and be available,\" she says of the surprisingly businesslike process that flows from the initial jolt of a fire.</p><p>Indeed, her decades of stewardship here have shaped her manner in both the short and long view: Ms. Duffey holds a calm and accepting attitude.</p><p>Despite having been on watch as the West experiences the engulfing effects of climate change - fires growing more frequent and burning hotter, fire seasons lengthening, and snowpack shrinking across the Rocky Mountains - Ms. Duffey continues to find hope in the natural world. She accepts what the seasons bring, but the shadow of climate change doesn't darken her experience of the world she loves deeply.\u00a0</p><p>\"It contradicts with how I feel about the political situation of our country, and everything going on ecologically, but I still find daily joy,\" she says peering out her window. \"Three days ago, that flower wasn't there\"; she points to the snowfield on the lee side of the ridge. \"Now all of a sudden there's a blossom. That's amazing.\"</p><p>Her intimacy with the land results in an idiosyncratic perspective of the blazes she's entrusted to spot.\u00a0</p><p>\"This is a fire-adapted landscape,\" she explains. \"There are plants and animals who need fire to come through this place. I report the fires, but I don't feel as if I'm saving the trees when I call it in. They've burned before and will again.\"\u00a0</p><p>Do right by the deer and lichen\u00a0</p><p>Because she can't leave the mountain as easily as many Americans leave their workplace, she continues her responsibility to the mountains beyond her punched timecard.\u00a0</p><p>\"This is where I get to live and work,\" says Ms. Duffey. \"It's a privilege to be here and work here. I love this landscape, and I want to do right by it.\"</p><p>But, she clarifies, \"this isn't my home. It's the deer's, lichen's, and eagle's. I don't want to cause any more harm than I have to.\"</p><p>The way she mitigates her impact while she occupies the shelter displays her humility before the wilderness. She collects her plastic and organic trash - no bear attractants allowed outside the shelter - which must be carted off the mountain on the mule train that arrives to resupply her food and water every three weeks. All her paper and \"dry\" trash is burned in the wood stove just often enough \"so it doesn't get too stinky.\"</p><p>Her ground toilet - \"the out,\" as she calls the open-air commode - offers a grandiose view northeast toward the Sun River, and with only one main user, the privy can naturally decompose all waste.</p><p>Once a week, she washes her hair and uses baby wipes for what she calls \"spit baths.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I don't know what it is,\" she says with a chuckle over her isolation, \"but for some reason, most people happen to show up while I'm taking a bath.\"</p><p>The accrued quotidian experiences of her 26 summers here have given her an outlook and deep-rooted sense of place that she believes can inspire others - the visitors to her lookout, students in the classrooms where she substitute teaches in the winter, or people she leads on tours in Yellowstone National Park - to learn more about their homes.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think most people would struggle to name and identify their state tree,\" she says, prefacing her conviction that the connection to nature is essential for everyone. \"That's something little, but it grows into the problem of people not being connected to where they live, which is why we have the idea that wilderness is not necessarily a good thing. The settlers that came to the United States believed that they had to subdue the wilderness. They were proud to cut their homes out of the woods, plow the fields, and dominate and subdue the landscape.\"</p><p>While Ms. Duffey feels more comfortable in the crowd of ravens and ground squirrels here than in a busy bar, she says most people might perceive her as lonely.</p><p>That's not how she sees herself: \"There's a difference between being lonely and being alone.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I mean there's always Mae,\" she laughs as the border collie opens her eyes from a nap. \"But I see such incredible things when I'm alone. There are so few people who get to see wolverines. I was sitting out there on the Honeymoon Basin rim one day, quiet, and a wolverine walked within 30 steps of me. Didn't even know I was there until I moved.\"\u00a0</p><p>She considers that the stillness and patience of being by oneself must be relearned in our increasingly connected and stimulated society. Those who separate willingly are often misunderstood.\u00a0</p><p>\"As children, we aren't given the tools to learn how to be comfortable with ourselves,\" she says. \"Particularly girls and women who are always told that their value, safety, and happiness are based on men. We aren't encouraged to develop introspection, critical thinking, or the ability to hang out by ourselves. When we spend that time alone, we receive the message back: Really? Are you OK?\"</p><p>Even in her married life, Ms. Duffey must spend time alone. Her husband is a smokejumper supervisor in West Yellowstone, where they make their home.

Like most domestic programs in Biden's overall $1.5 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, the recommendations for increased spending on conservation and climate goals are a dramatic turnaround following four years of cutbacks during the Trump administration. The administration is requesting[1] $17.4 billion for the Interior Department, a $2.4 billion increase from what's now in effect for the current budget year, which is fiscal 2021. The proposed 16% increase is in line with the overall increase the administration is asking for all non-defense discretionary programs. </p><p>Interior would also see $1.7 billion for high-priority hazardous fuels and forest fire resilience programs, a nearly $500 million boost from fiscal 2021. A news release from the Interior Department highlighted the request's proposed increases for tribal programs. 'President Biden's funding request provides much-needed resources to Tribal Nations, prioritizes racial justice and equity, and invests in healthy lands, waters, and a clean energy economy that will create good-paying jobs,' Interior Secretary Debra Haaland said in a written statement. The request calls for $4 billion for tribal programs, a roughly 17% increase from fiscal 2021, to be used for tribal schools, law enforcement and clean energy development. It would increase funding for climate mitigation, resilience and environmental justice programs in Native American communities by $450 million.  THE MORNING NEWSLETTER   Subscribe now.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://wisconsinexaminer.com/newsletter\">https://wisconsinexaminer.com/newsletter</url> The funding would 'strengthen self-determination and self-governance programs to bolster Tribal sovereignty,' the Interior release[2] said. Friday's document is a preliminary budget from the administration, which is usual in a new presidency. A more detailed budget plan, which will include revenue estimates, is expected later this spring. Congress never adopts a presidential budget request in its entirety, but Biden's is more likely to succeed at least in part in a Congress controlled by Democrats.Climate goals across the governmentFriday's request reflects the administration's prioritization of climate change and its whole-of-government approach to addressing it. The administration requested a $14 billion increase for 'major new climate' spending 'across nearly every agency.' The word 'climate' appears 151 times in the 61-page document. Several federal departments would see additional funding for climate science and research. The administration asked for $4 billion 'to fund a broad portfolio of research across multiple agencies.' It would spend $1 billion to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate and in the existing Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to fund clean energy and climate resilience research. As part of its climate agenda, the administration has pledged to protect 30 percent of U.S. land and water by 2030. The request offers few new details on that initiative. It calls for 'significant investment' for conservation efforts on public and private lands through the U.S. Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both agencies within the Department of Agriculture. Part of the funding 'would encourage voluntary conservation across the Nation's forests, farms, and ranches, while allowing land owners to continue to work their land,' the request says. The administration didn't provide details on how it would encourage voluntary conservation on private lands. Sarah Greenberger, the senior vice president for conservation policy at the conservation and bird advocacy group National Audubon Society, said the USDA could help farmers and ranchers adopt best practices and provide financial assistance. The proposal would provide $6.5 billion in lending for 'additional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects in rural communities.' In addition to climate action, several sections of the request refer to environmental justice, and programs to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate change on disadvantaged communities.Abandoned wells, displaced workersParts of the request mirrors items in the administration's infrastructure and jobs agenda[3] it laid out last week, though at lower spending levels. The Interior section includes $550 million to cap orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mineral mines. That figure is more than triple the fiscal 2021 funding, but below the average yearly target for such efforts that the administration laid out in its proposed infrastructure and jobs legislation last week. The infrastructure framework calls for $16 billion over 10 years for abandoned wells and mines cleanup. Friday's request is intended to be seen as a separate but complementary document, an administration official said Friday. The request also calls for funding a new Civilian Climate Corps, another item in the infrastructure proposal. Friday's request asked for $200 million for Interior programs that promote science-driven conservation, including for the new jobs program. The infrastructure proposal asked for about $1 billion per year for the Civilian Climate Corps alone. The lower annual spending levels in the budget request likely reflect that the proposals would grow over time, not that the administration was lowering its spending goals. The request would fund a new multiagency program to help displaced workers in the oil and gas industry transition to jobs in cleaner forms of energy. Greenberger praised the request's focus on economic factors as part of its approach to climate. 'The budget is a demonstration of commitment to conservation, to climate action\u2014which obviously we care deeply about\u2014but also to people,' Greenberger said. 'For conservation to be successful, communities need to be successful.'

He started working in the kitchen as a kid alongside his dad. And today, Marc runs three restaurants and is building a fourth as he constantly refines his approach to simple but exceptional American cuisine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEFF GLOR: On a scorching summer day, you`d think the last thing you`d need is a portable wood oven blasting out even more heat. It`s always nice to be surprised. As we watched Chef Marc Forgione begin assembling a masterpiece, starting with the best dough in the world.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: I mean, I couldn`t have planned this any better. I mean, obviously, you can see that she wants to be on TV.</p><p>Creating a sourdough starter and keeping, I called her-- her alive, it`s almost like a baby. You have to feed her every day. I sing to her sometimes. You know, there`s been times where she doesn`t look so good, and like I, you know, I talk to the-- to the jar. This is not the dough that you throw six feet in the air.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Sourdough is different because it gets its yeast from the air, making each chef`s so-called starter unique in flavor and texture. Pizza made from sourdough is tangy and temperamental.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: As you can tell, she has an attitude. So if you start throwing her around, she is going to get upset.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Done right, it`s also sensational.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: The first dough that I threw into our wood-burning oven at Peasant, I mean, I literally started to do like the jig after-- after I tasted the dough. I couldn`t believe it. I mean, it was--</p><p>JEFF GLOR: It`s good.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: --it was-- it was just like, ah.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Forgione`s work with sourdough comes a decade after his arrival on the national cooking scene.</p><p>MAN #1 (The Next Iron Chef; Food Network): And historic Next Iron Chef final challenge is over here in Kitchen Stadium.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: At age thirty-one, he became the youngest Iron Chef winner in history.</p><p>MAN #2 (The Next Iron Chef; Food Network): Chef Forgione.</p><p>(Crowd cheering)</p><p>JEFF GLOR: He was already running Restaurant Marc Forgione opened in 2008, but the Iron Chef victory propelled him to superstardom. Early this year, he turned his attention to a New York institution--Peasant. Peasant serving rustic Italian food in Lower Manhattan was run by the legendary Frank DeCarlo, until DeCarlo decided to step aside late last year.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: I mean, it`s a crazy Hollywood scripted story. He-- he called me in like August and he was like, you know, hey, Marc, remember you said you-- you loved Peasant so much? And I was like, yeah, of course. You know, why? He`s like, you want it? And I said, yeah, well, sure. And, you know, I think this was like on a Wednesday. And he`s like, I need to know by Friday. And I called him back on Friday, and I said okay.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: DeCarlo`s last service at Peasant was New Year`s Eve. Forgione took over the first week of January. Two months later, the pandemic hit and changed everything.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: I`m looking at this crisis right now, you know, probably the best way I think I can look at it is like a forest fire. And after the forest fire, you know, from the ashes comes life.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Forgione`s restaurants like so many others right now are doing limited outdoor seating. So, we had time to ask him to make us a feast.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: Cheers, brother.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Thank you.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: And thank you so much for having us.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Burrata with cherry tomatoes from the vine. Chicken with roasted onions and oregano. Eggplant sandwiches with buffalo mozzarella, rigatoni mezzi arrabbiata, and Aperol Spritz with orange garnish. And most importantly, the pizza.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: I mean, look at that thing. Gorgeous. And then something that I do even with my plated dishes, I kind of like to take the ingredients that we`ve used and almost do them in like a raw state. So, we had the roasted zucchini. So then I`ll just put--</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Okay.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: --some raw zucchini, and the heat will just kind of almost wilt it because we slice them real thin. And then obviously we had the pecorinos that was grated, then cooked, I just take a little fresh pecorino, it gives a little texture. And then just to remind everybody that this is a beautiful wood-burning oven, I take some smoked salt and obviously we hit it with oil right before it went in. This is just so you get that gorgeous grassy notes from the olive oil.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: You`ve done this a few times.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: And then this is up for debate, how much slices you want to cut this into. If it`s just two people, you can get away with four. But this is a good way to share. And then this is the beauty--</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Oh, look at that.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: Oh. Yeah. This is the beauty of setup. First of all, no flop.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Yeah.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: Okay.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: No flop.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Look at that.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: And then look at the crumb, you see that?</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Gorgeous. Gorgeous.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: It`s almost like a-- like a souffle, like a cake.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Yeah.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: I mean, it`s just, you know, we-- we actually serve this, believe it or not, with a side of arrabbiata sauce so that after you`re done eating the pizza you can then take the crust and dip it into the arrabbiata sauce. So some say Papa John`s invented that, but we`re just trying to make it a little better.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: It looks a little bit better with respect to Papa John`s.</p><p>MARC FORGIONE: With respect to Papa John`s.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Now, I`m starving.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: Are you kidding me that you didn`t bring any?</p><p>JEFF GLOR: I didn`t.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: That`s ridiculous.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: Now that--</p><p>JEFF GLOR: That he`s made fresh.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: That should have been--</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Oh, here we go.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: --that should have been my dish, Jeff, because arrabbiata is my thing.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Oh.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: The dipping, every spice, oh, oh.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: That`s how the restaurants I go to-- oh, my gosh.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: I love the arrabbiata sauce.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Nice.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: We`re done with you, Glor.</p><p>JEFF GLOR I like that.

Like most domestic programs in Biden's overall $1.5 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, the recommendations for increased spending on conservation and climate goals are a dramatic turnaround following four years of cutbacks during the Trump administration. The administration is requesting[1]$17.4 billion for the Interior Department, a $2.4 billion increase from what's now in effect for the current budget year, which is fiscal 2021. The proposed 16% increase is in line with the overall increase the administration is asking for all non-defense discretionary programs. Interior would also see $1.7 billion for high-priority hazardous fuels and forest fire resilience programs, a nearly $500 million boost from fiscal 2021. A news release from the Interior Department highlighted the request's proposed increases for tribal programs. 'President Biden's funding request provides much-needed resources to Tribal Nations, prioritizes racial justice and equity, and invests in healthy lands, waters, and a clean energy economy that will create good-paying jobs,' Interior Secretary Debra Haaland said in a written statement. The request calls for $4 billion for tribal programs, a roughly 17% increase from fiscal 2021, to be used for tribal schools, law enforcement and clean energy development. It would increase funding for climate mitigation, resilience and environmental justice programs in Native American communities by $450 million. The funding would 'strengthen self-determination and self-governance programs to bolster Tribal sovereignty,' theInterior release[2]said. Friday's document is a preliminary budget from the administration, which is usual in a new presidency. A more detailed budget plan, which will include revenue estimates, is expected later this spring. Congress never adopts a presidential budget request in its entirety, but Biden's is more likely to succeed at least in part in a Congress controlled by Democrats. Climate goals across the government Friday's request reflects the administration's prioritization of climate change and its whole-of-government approach to addressing it. The administration requested a $14 billion increase for 'major new climate' spending 'across nearly every agency.' The word 'climate' appears 151 times in the 61-page document. Several federal departments would see additional funding for climate science and research. The administration asked for $4 billion 'to fund a broad portfolio of research across multiple agencies.' It would spend $1 billion to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate and in the existing Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to fund clean energy and climate resilience research. As part of its climate agenda, the administration has pledged to protect 30 percent of U.S. land and water by 2030. The request offers few new details on that initiative. It calls for 'significant investment' for conservation efforts on public and private lands through the U.S. Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both agencies within the Department of Agriculture. Part of the funding 'would encourage voluntary conservation across the Nation's forests, farms, and ranches, while allowing land owners to continue to work their land,' the request says. The administration didn't provide details on how it would encourage voluntary conservation on private lands. Sarah Greenberger, the senior vice president for conservation policy at the conservation and bird advocacy group National Audubon Society, said the USDA could help farmers and ranchers adopt best practices and provide financial assistance. The proposal would provide $6.5 billion in lending for 'additional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects in rural communities.' In addition to climate action, several sections of the request refer to environmental justice, and programs to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate change on disadvantaged communities. Abandoned wells, displaced workers Parts of the request mirrors items in the administration'sinfrastructure and jobs agenda[3]it laid out last week, though at lower spending levels. The Interior section includes $550 million to cap orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mineral mines. That figure is more than triple the fiscal 2021 funding, but below the average yearly target for such efforts that the administration laid out in its proposed infrastructure and jobs legislation last week. The infrastructure framework calls for $16 billion over 10 years for abandoned wells and mines cleanup. Friday's request is intended to be seen as a separate but complementary document, an administration official said Friday. The request also calls for funding a new Civilian Climate Corps, another item in the infrastructure proposal. Friday's request asked for $200 million for Interior programs that promote science-driven conservation, including for the new jobs program. The infrastructure proposal asked for about $1 billion per year for the Civilian Climate Corps alone. The lower annual spending levels in the budget request likely reflect that the proposals would grow over time, not that the administration was lowering its spending goals. The request would fund a new multiagency program to help displaced workers in the oil and gas industry transition to jobs in cleaner forms of energy. Greenberger praised the request's focus on economic factors as part of its approach to climate. 'The budget is a demonstration of commitment to conservation, to climate action\u2014which obviously we care deeply about\u2014but also to people,' Greenberger said. 'For conservation to be successful, communities need to be successful.'

With a collective $70 billion in FRF remaining,[1] states can use these funds to build healthier, more equitable, climate-resilient communities. Sixteen states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have allocated a combined $2.1 billion of their FRF toward environmental initiatives,[2] including cleanups of industrial pollution and preservation of natural habitats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Targeting Fiscal Recovery Funds (FRF) to environmental investments can be part of an equitable, antiracist pandemic recovery.\"</p><p>Climate change and other environmental challenges pose a serious risk to people's health and well-being, especially those with low incomes and communities of color. Some state and local governments are confronting these challenges head-on, using Fiscal Recovery Funds to invest in efforts to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency, stem pollution, clean up environmental hazards, and mitigate or reduce harm to habitats from a variety of sources. States are actively monitoring environmental needs and changes to preemptively mitigate the consequences of climate change, which can result in costly remediation and long-term health effects.[3] States also can protect and restore the natural environment by mitigating and reversing harm to habitats through solar or wind energy projects.</p><p>Additional environmental spending should be targeted to those who routinely experience disproportionate harm from environmental challenges and other crises, such as recessions and public health emergencies. Individuals and households with low incomes and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) who have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic also have been the most impacted by climate change and industrial pollution.[4] Thus, targeting FRF to environmental investments can be part of an equitable, antiracist pandemic recovery.</p><p>State Investments Can Advance Environmental Justice</p><p>Environmental justice policies and practices aim to reduce or eliminate environmental harm under the guidance of communities that experience climate change's consequences firsthand. Communities with low incomes and Black and brown communities disproportionately face many of these impacts, such as community displacement, geographic deterioration, and agricultural disruption.[5] For example, individuals with low incomes are likelier to live in homes that are more vulnerable to natural disasters and experience property damage, homelessness, and physical and financial impacts.[6] States, localities, and families are often left to cover these aftermath expenses.[7]</p><p>Targeting environmental investments to people with low incomes and communities of color is critical to redressing past injustices and advancing racial equity. Harmful environmental policies and regulations are often rooted in systemic racism and other forms of oppression.[8] For example, policymakers and private industrial interests in Louisiana have since the mid-1800s concentrated petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River in predominantly Black communities, which increases the rate of cancer and respiratory illnesses, and high pollution levels prevent residents from selling their homes.[9] State investments in policies to improve environmental conditions can help build more equitable communities, advancing environmental justice nationwide.</p><p>Fiscal Recovery Funds Support Range of Environmental Initiatives</p><p>The Fiscal Recovery Funds present a historic opportunity for states and localities to fund transformative, long-term investments in the environment, with a focus on communities that have been most severely impacted by pollution, climate change, and natural disasters. The following are examples of climate-related investments states and localities are making.</p><p>Energy Efficiency</p><p>Energy efficiency investments are a cost-effective approach to fighting climate change and to helping households with low incomes afford energy bills. Households with low incomes typically pay about 13.9 percent of their income in energy costs, compared to 3 percent for other households, a 2020 study found.[10] Weatherization, electrification, and solar initiatives can reduce energy costs and pollution's harmful effects. For instance, electrification replaces fossil fuels such as propane, heating oil, and gasoline to provide cleaner air while helping homes to reduce their overall emissions and energy bills.</p><p>D.C. invested $8.2 million in grant funding for senior care facilities, hospitals, K-12 schools, universities, and hospitals to conduct energy audits, and $11 million toward the D.C. Green Bank's[11] clean energy projects such as stormwater infrastructure, low-cost solar energy, and LED lighting for efficient energy use to help D.C. reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption.[12] The District also allocated $17 million for community solar projects, which allow people who live in apartments or have roofs that cannot support solar to invest in off-site solar panels and receive a credit on their monthly electricity bill for the energy they generate.</p><p>Maine appropriated $50 million in funding to award grants to accelerate weatherization and home efficiency upgrades, particularly for residents with low incomes. Schools, municipalities, and community organizations can also secure these grants by providing matching funds to support energy efficiency measures.</p><p>Maryland used $30 million for its Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which provides funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and alternative transportation projects. In 2019, the program[13] funded residential and commercial projects such as solar canopies (elevated structures that host solar panels and provide shade) and geothermal heating and cooling systems, using an underground system to convert and transfer heat between buildings and the ground.</p><p>Massachusetts appropriated $3.3 million to pilot a geothermal technology program.[14] It also allocated over $16 million for the Greening Cities Program[15] to reduce households' heating and cooling energy use by increasing tree canopies.</p><p>Industrial Pollution and Fossil Fuels</p><p>Industrial operations degrade the environment including polluting the air, drinking water, and soil and emissions from burning fossil fuels are a persistent concern. A few states are addressing the harmful consequences of industrial waste and fossil fuels in their communities.</p><p>Florida appropriated $50 million to clean up petroleum tanks.[16] At the beginning of 2018, there were an estimated 19,000 underground petroleum storage tanks that served no use and were potentially leaking into the state's drinking water.[17]</p><p>New Mexico used $3.5 million to implement a program to identify oil and natural gas wells that energy extraction companies have abandoned and failed to plug. The state has 708 such wells, with an estimated $24 million cleanup cost, which, left unaddressed, would lead to contaminated water and methane air pollution.[18]</p><p>Vermont invested $11 million in the Brownfields Program[19] to identify former industrial properties, manufacturing facilities, vacant land, office spaces, and gas stations that may be contaminated or have harmful pollutants. Brownfields' redevelopment reduces health and safety hazards while creating opportunities for quality housing, recreation space, and economic development.[20]</p><p>Preservation of Local Habitats</p><p>To develop resilient, healthy communities and help maintain local ecosystems and protect threatened native habits, some states and territories are increasing FRF spending to actively monitor environmental changes and create effective mitigation plans.</p><p>Florida allocated $100 million to strengthen coastal mapping efforts in collaboration with coastal communities to develop resiliency against flooding, erosion, and habitat changes. Coastal mapping includes gathering seafloor data for mapping habitats, restoration projects, resource management, emergency response, and hazard studies.</p><p>Hawai'i appropriated $2.5 million to the agency charged with enforcing protections for historic sites, state parks, forest reserves, wildlife, marine life, and other natural resources.[21]</p><p>Puerto Rico invested $10 million in environmental conservation initiatives, including protecting endangered species and ecosystems.</p><p>Research Studies to Assess Environmental Needs</p><p>A few states are using modest amounts of FRF to explore research for environmental needs. This can allow communities to assess environmental needs prior to undertaking larger environmental programs and policies. For example, some states are exploring and investing in offshore wind projects,[22] which have the potential to deliver large amounts of clean, renewable energy but also require strategic planning prior to developing the infrastructure.[23]</p><p>Connecticut used $20,000 to study air quality in the town of Sherman, citing the impact of social, environmental, and economic conditions on health outcomes.</p><p>New Hampshire appropriated $250,000 for a study to assess the potential impacts of developing[24] offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine.</p><p>Texas allocated $300,000 to analyze the Coastal Texas Study[25] and assess the feasibility of constructing a coastal storm risk management and ecosystem restoration.</p><p>Topics:</p><p>State Budget and Tax, Climate Change</p><p>End Notes</p><p>[1] This report reflects data collected by CBPP on state uses of Fiscal Recovery Funds. It relies in part on extensive Fiscal Recovery Fund tracking conducted by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p><p>[2] This total includes FRF weatherization investments, which CBPP also categorized under housing repairs, but excludes $9.8 billion in water and sewer infrastructure spending for all states, D.C., and the U.S. Territories.</p><p>[3] Hurricanes Ida and Sandy represent two examples of the danger and fiscal costs that severe storms, which are expected to become more common due to climate change, pose to communities. Hurricane Sandy caused an estimated $70 billion in damage.

Like most domestic programs in Biden's overall $1.5 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, the recommendations for increased spending on conservation and climate goals are a dramatic turnaround following four years of cutbacks during the Trump administration.  THE MORNING NEWSLETTER   Subscribe now.  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/newsletter\">https://coloradonewsline.com/newsletter</url> The administration is requesting[2] $17.4 billion for the Interior Department, a $2.4 billion increase from what's now in effect for the current budget year, which is fiscal 2021. The proposed 16% increase is in line with the overall increase the administration is asking for all non-defense discretionary programs. Interior would also see $1.7 billion for high-priority hazardous fuels and forest fire resilience programs, a nearly $500 million boost from fiscal 2021. A news release from the Interior Department highlighted the request's proposed increases for tribal programs. 'President Biden's funding request provides much-needed resources to Tribal Nations, prioritizes racial justice and equity, and invests in healthy lands, waters, and a clean energy economy that will create good-paying jobs,' Interior Secretary Debra Haaland said in a written statement. The request calls for $4 billion for tribal programs, a roughly 17% increase from fiscal 2021, to be used for tribal schools, law enforcement and clean energy development. It would increase funding for climate mitigation, resilience and environmental justice programs in Native American communities by $450 million. The funding would 'strengthen self-determination and self-governance programs to bolster Tribal sovereignty,' the Interior release[3] said. Friday's document is a preliminary budget from the administration, which is usual in a new presidency. A more detailed budget plan, which will include revenue estimates, is expected later this spring. Congress never adopts a presidential budget request in its entirety, but Biden's is more likely to succeed at least in part in a Congress controlled by Democrats.Climate goals across the governmentFriday's request reflects the administration's prioritization of climate change and its whole-of-government approach to addressing it. The administration requested a $14 billion increase for 'major new climate' spending 'across nearly every agency.' The word 'climate' appears 151 times in the 61-page document. Several federal departments would see additional funding for climate science and research. The administration asked for $4 billion 'to fund a broad portfolio of research across multiple agencies.' It would spend $1 billion to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate and in the existing Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to fund clean energy and climate resilience research.  As part of its climate agenda, the administration has pledged to protect 30% of U.S. land and water by 2030[4]. The request offers few new details on that initiative. It calls for 'significant investment' for conservation efforts on public and private lands through the U.S. Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both agencies within the Department of Agriculture. Part of the funding 'would encourage voluntary conservation across the Nation's forests, farms, and ranches, while allowing land owners to continue to work their land,' the request says. The administration didn't provide details on how it would encourage voluntary conservation on private lands. Sarah Greenberger, the senior vice president for conservation policy at the conservation and bird advocacy group National Audubon Society, said the USDA could help farmers and ranchers adopt best practices and provide financial assistance. The proposal would provide $6.5 billion in lending for 'additional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects in rural communities.' In addition to climate action, several sections of the request refer to environmental justice, and programs to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate change on disadvantaged communities.Abandoned wells, displaced workersParts of the request mirrors items in the administration's infrastructure and jobs agenda[5] it laid out last week, though at lower spending levels. The Interior section includes $550 million to cap orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mineral mines. That figure is more than triple the fiscal 2021 funding, but below the average yearly target for such efforts that the administration laid out in its proposed infrastructure and jobs legislation last week. The infrastructure framework calls for $16 billion over 10 years for abandoned wells and mines cleanup. Friday's request is intended to be seen as a separate but complementary document, an administration official said Friday. The request also calls for funding a new Civilian Climate Corps, another item in the infrastructure proposal. Friday's request asked for $200 million for Interior programs that promote science-driven conservation, including for the new jobs program. The infrastructure proposal asked for about $1 billion per year for the Civilian Climate Corps alone. The lower annual spending levels in the budget request likely reflect that the proposals would grow over time, not that the administration was lowering its spending goals. The request would fund a new multiagency program to help displaced workers in the oil and gas industry transition to jobs in cleaner forms of energy. Greenberger praised the request's focus on economic factors as part of its approach to climate. 'The budget is a demonstration of commitment to conservation, to climate action \u2014 which obviously we care deeply about \u2014 but also to people,' Greenberger said. 'For conservation to be successful, communities need to be successful.'

Detroit public schools will probably require them unless everyone in a room is vaccinated. In Pittsburgh, masks will likely be required regardless of vaccination status. And in some states, schools cannot mandate face coverings under any circumstances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19 cases soaring nationwide, school districts across the U.S. are yet again confronting the realities of a polarized country and the lingering pandemic as they navigate mask requirements, vaccine rules and social distancing requirements for the fast-approaching new school year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The spread of the delta variant and the deep political divisions over the outbreak have complicated decisions in districts from coast to coast. Some conservative states, lawmakers have banned districts from requiring masks despite outcry from medical professionals. Schools are weighing a variety of plans to manage junior high and middle school classrooms filled with both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so frustrated that it\u2019s become a political issue because it shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s science,\u201d said Mary Tuttle, who operates an Indianapolis in-home day care center and hopes the city's schools require masks for her daughters.</p><p>She worries that the delta variant could lead to a return to virtual learning, which caused her 10-year-old daughter to become depressed and anxious last year. Another daughter will turn 12 six days after starting 6th grade and will be vaccinated as soon as possible.</p><p>Adding to the concerns is a rise in cases overall \u2014 sharply in some states, including Arkansas, which won't let schools require masks. Public health researchers on Tuesday called Arkansas' rapidly climbing infections and hospitalizations a \u201craging forest fire,\u201d and the state\u2019s top health official warned of significant future outbreaks in schools.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, and it has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>In Mississippi, the leading health official said Tuesday that intensive care units are full in 13 hospitals because of a surge in cases, and he provided an ominous warning in one of the least vaccinated states in the country: \"Y'all, we\u2019re going to have a rough few weeks,\u201d Dr. Thomas Dobbs said.</p><p>Weekly tallies by the American Academy of Pediatrics based on state reports show that COVID-19 cases in kids increased nationally in July after a couple of months of declines. The most recent data shows a 1% increase from July 1 to July 15, representing 43,000 additional cases.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday recommended universal masking in schools, even for those who are vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month recommended mask-wearing indoors only for students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.</p><p>The vaccine has not been approved for children under 12. If it shown to be safe and effective for younger ages, vaccine manufacturers may seek emergency authorization sometime this fall or winter.</p><p>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the fact that some states refuse to allow mask requirements \u201cis just plain wrong.\u201d She said the organization has embraced recommendations from the CDC.</p><p>But school officials say masking decisions have been complicated by conflicting advice from public health officials.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. Parents hear that these are recommendations, and it becomes a delicate dance\u201d because of differing opinions, said Steve Matthews, superintendent of Novi Community Schools, outside Detroit.</p><p>He probably will recommend that the school board make masking optional, although he worries about potential outbreaks because people are gathering for sporting events, family reunions and other activities.</p><p>\u201cIt would be very helpful if there was agreement among the medical community what the approach should be,\u201d Matthews said. When everyone wore masks last year, \u201cit created a sense of community, a sense that we\u2019re all in this together. Now it ends up dividing people.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s part of the reason the academy recommended universal masking in schools, said Dr. Sonja O\u2019Leary, chair of the academy\u2019s Council on School Health.</p><p>\u201cPeople just wanted it to be clearer, masks or no masks,\u2019\u2019 said O\u2019Leary. She said data show COVID-19 infections have not been rampant in U.S. schools, but \u201cwe know masks do curb transmission.\u201d What\u2019s more, keeping track of who has had shots and who has not may be tough for schools.</p><p>School districts that can set their own policies are taking different approaches.</p><p>In Detroit public schools, everyone will likely be required to wear a mask unless an entire room is vaccinated. Officials are developing an identification system, perhaps by wearing lanyards, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, administrators are proposing that all public school students and staff be required to wear masks indoors to protect younger students and because of \"concerns around unknowns from the variant,\u201d spokeswoman Ebony R. Pugh said. Universal masking also protects the privacy of older students who have not been vaccinated, she said.</p><p>In Kansas, most schoolchildren and teachers will not be required to wear masks. The state\u2019s largest district, Wichita, made masks optional starting July 6 and surveyed parents before announcing its reopening plan, said Wichita Public Schools spokeswoman Susan Arensman.</p><p>\u201cA lot of them, their big talking points were about the emotional well-being of students and staff,\u201d Arensman said. \u201cThey still wanted kids to be safe, but they also wanted kids to be back to normal.\u201d</p><p>In Templeton, California, Jenny Grinager said she does not like masks and got an exemption for her 8-year-old son because he has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. She said her son struggles to communicate with people who wear masks because he's unable to see their facial expressions. Last year, he said he didn't have any friends in class and was lonely.</p><p>\u201cFor him, it is the relationship, the interaction that causes him to remember who somebody is,\" said Grinager, who also does not believe vaccination is necessary. She notes that children are less likely to get seriously ill with COVID-19, and she has not been vaccinated.</p><p>In Madison, Wisconsin, Sarah Jedd plans to send her 15- and 13-year old sons back to classes because both are vaccinated, but she will home-school her 9-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter if masks are not required. The district is expected to announce its decision later this week.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really concerned about (them) being inside a school building with lots and lots of kids with no masks on while they\u2019re too young to be vaccinated,\u201d Jedd said.</p><p>Jacky Frechette, who has a son who's vaccinated and a 4-year-old who isn't, said every Madison student should be required to wear a mask rather than having different rules for the vaccinated and unvaccinated, especially when people can so easily lie about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad (wearing masks) has become so divisive that we\u2019ve put our political thoughts and feelings above what experts say,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus, Andrew DeMillo and Lindsey Tanner and contributed to this story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-92f4414ff2b85f98c59aa2a412b1cdcd20210721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6364-NK01-JC5B-G4HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><timeReceived>12:42 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 21, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Mike Chapman of Port Angeles and state Sen. Kevin Van De Wege of Sequim, covers Clallam and Jefferson counties and the northern half of Grays Harbor County. All three are Democrats.</p><p>Tharinger said top priorities include approval of biennial operating, capital, and transportation budgets, and economic relief funds to quell COVID-19 impacts.</p><p>\"It will be very challenging to develop complicated policy without being able to meet in the hallway and meet on the floor to develop legislation,\" he said.</p><p>Projects such as funding for the Tri-Area sewer in Jefferson County and for a new emergency operations center for Clallam County will be considered in the Capital Budget Committee, which he chairs.</p><p>\"Those are ones that are being requested, but whether (funding) happens or not, I don't know,\" Tharinger said.</p><p>House Democrats have been asked by new Speaker Laurie Jinkins, a Tacoma Democrat and the first woman House speaker, to propose no more than seven bills each, about half their average, so staff is not overwhelmed during the pandemic with bills that won't get considered.</p><p>Tharinger expects to sponsor legislation that would make tribes eligible for a state program under which a payroll tax increase pays for long-term care.</p><p>\"They want to be included in the program,\" he said.</p><p>Also on Tharinger's agenda: Obtaining greater broadband access to remote areas such as the West End in Clallam County.</p><p>The 24th district is unique among the state's 49 districts in having all three legislators chair committees.</p><p>Van De Wege chairs the the Senate Agriculture, Water, Natural Resources and Parks Committee.</p><p>Its duties include oversight over fish and wildlife issues and forest practices and forest fire protection.</p><p>\"My biggest priority will be getting control of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and attempting to bring accountability to them,\" Van De Wege said.</p><p>He wants to eliminate a rule that prohibits steelhead fishing from a boat, calling it \"unfair and foolish;\" wants to get rid of a moratorium on whale-watching of resident orca whales, to limit gill-netting and increase fees on individual salmon fishing licenses.</p><p>He also wants his committee to have more say on the governor's appointments to the fish and wildlife commission.</p><p>Van De Wege is hoping Chapman's new chairmanship of the companion panel in the House, the Rural Development, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, will help him achieve those goals.</p><p>Chapman said some of those ideas are good but will wait to see the legislation.</p><p>He will work on removing a fee charged to yachts that dock for two weeks that could help, for example, the Port of Port Angeles and marine trades that lose business as a result.</p><p>\"My focus will be on legislation like that that restarts and rebuilds our rural economy,\" Chapman said.</p><p>He was chosen by the party caucus to chair the committee. The House has a 58-41 Democratic Party majority but his committee is divided 8-7 along those lines.</p><p>\"The committee is probably the most bipartisan committee of all,\" Chapman said, adding it produces much legislation generated by Republicans that still passes the House.</p><p>Chapman said he expects construction on the Morse Creek curve east of Port Angeles to begin this summer and said the Elwha Bridge project is still on track. But he had few specifics on either effort because he hasn't been able to meet with staff due to COVID restrictions.</p><p>Beyond the budget, \"there's probably not going to be a lot of legislation that going to be passed,\" Chapman predicted.</p><p>\"We have to rebuild the economy and get through the virus.</p><p>\"I'm hoping we can accomplish things. It going to be really difficult to know what we can and can't be done with a remote session.\"</p><p>Chapman, expecting the session Monday to last just a few hours, was still worried about protesters despite the apparent removal of one threat of disruption.</p><p>\"My fear is they are going to protest at our homes, and that will be a bigger dynamic,\" he said.</p><p>\"They know where we all live.

That intention was echoed by several people who broke down a gate outside the governor's mansion and occupied the grounds there Jan. 6, the same evening Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>Those actions spurred Gov. Jay Inslee to activate National Guard troops to join state police and other law enforcement agencies in patrolling the Capitol grounds when lawmakers opened the 2021 session, and an 8-foot-high security fence was erected.</p><p>An organizer of the planned occupation said later that the event was canceled, although protesters from both the right and left may still make their views known while lawmakers meet, State Patrol spokesman Chris Loftis said.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Sequim Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEQGAZ-news20210113PYC4101436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEQGAZ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VW-TS71-F0HF-80W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Just 100% mortality across the entire field. If you produce a million trees a year, you don't have time to deal with that,\" says Norby.</p><p>Norby says the state's farms were largely spared from the 225,000 acres that were scorched across the state from wildfires, but says the weeklong heat wave in June was the real killer.</p><p>\"The heat dome came at the absolute worst time. It came when those new seedlings were trying to take root on that fresh soil and push out new shoots, and they just couldn't compete with that heat,\" says Norby.</p><p>The heat-scorched trees have led to less supply in California this year, but in Oregon, where saplings were significantly impacted, it could be the supply seven to 10 years from now seeing the pinch.</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/weather/heat-waves-climate-change/index.html\"> Pacific Northwest heat event</url> occurred in late June, shattering heat records. Portland set an all-time, record-high temperature three days in a row, topping out at 116 degrees. Seattle hit 108 degrees.</p><p>Lytton, British Columbia, reached 121 degrees, the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada, and around 48 degrees above what's normal for that time of year. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/01/americas/canada-town-evacuation-extreme-heat/index.html\">That town burned to the ground</url> a day later.</p><p>Jeri Seifert, president of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://cachristmas.com/\">California Christmas Tree Association</url> and farm owner, says the heat wave had a huge impact on the farms in California, mainly from sunburn.</p><p>When the tree is exposed to too much sunlight and heat, without sufficient moisture, parts of the tree or the entire tree can sunburn, resulting in tree damage or the tree completely dying.</p><p>\"When the heat dome hit, most of the native trees were burned on their southern-facing sides, so you can't market a tree that's brown on one side,\" says Seifert.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/weather/2021/06/28/heat-dome-weather-definition-orig.cnn\">heat dome</url>, high pressure acts as a lid on the atmosphere, and as hot air attempts to escape the lid forces it back down, warming even more as it sinks.</p><p>Wildfires have also impacted farms in California.</p><p>According to Seifert, one farm in her state lost 90% of its farm in one of the wildfires and even the owners' home. She has seen Christmas tree growers closing their doors left and right.</p><p>\"When you lose a plantation, there's a huge process that goes into regrowing those trees, so it takes many years to recoup,\" says Seifert.</p><p>There's not a lot of money in Christmas tree growing, says Seifert, so younger generations aren't stepping up to run the farm and instead opting for higher paying jobs.</p><p>\"Many of our farmers here in California are approaching retirement, so as they move up in age and experience a forest fire ravaging through their farm, it's just time to close their doors,\" she says.</p><p>This year's weather extremes has resulted in the loss of supply and, according to Seifert, prices of trees have gone up from 10 to 15%.</p><p>It's been a calamity of weather events that has turned this industry on its head, one that both Seifert and Norby hope they can overcome.</p><p>\"This is a global warming event that's impacting Christmas,\" says Norby.</p><p>His hope is that we don't have another extreme heat event next season. Norby believes he can salvage many of this damaged trees, since it takes eight years to grow one.</p><p>But he says if another extreme heat event hits his farm next season, he may not be able to recover.</p><p>Parts of Hawaii could receive 2 feet of rain</p><p>Just days after the the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/03/weather/weather-hawaii-snow-warm-contiguous-us/index.html\">higher elevations of Hawaii received snow</url> with blizzard conditions, the entire state is now under a major flood threat.</p><p>\"Expect widespread heavy rainfall with this system, especially under the large heavy rain band, capable of producing catastrophic flooding, and strong southwest winds through Wednesday,\" says the National Weather Service office in Honolulu.</p><p>An area of low pressure will meander in the region during the next few days, bringing the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/06/weather/hawaii-storms-flooding-weather/index.html\"> potential for life-threatening floods and landslides</url>.</p><p>In Maui County, nearly a foot<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>of rain has already fallen, and more is expected.</p><p>Because of the heavy rain, some areas will experience nearly zero visibility, making conditions on the roads even more dangerous.</p><p>The rainfall is beginning to wind down across the Big Island, However, heavy rain is still forecast to fall across Maui, Oahu and Kauai throughout the day.</p><p>\"Localized rainfall rates of two to three inches per hour will exacerbate ongoing flooding from earlier rainfall,\" says NWS Honolulu.</p><p>Parts of Maui have received 6 inches of rain in just six hours, and it's still coming down.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/06/weather/hawaii-storms-flooding-weather/index.html\">READ MORE HERE</url></p><p>Some areas in the Northeast could see their first measurable snowfall of the season this week</p><p>There is still quite a bit of uncertainty in the forecast, but it is looking more likely that several of the big cities along the I-95 corridor will see flakes.</p><p>\"The airmass should be cold enough to support light snowfall across the region on Wednesday with snow developing in the morning and exiting to the east by early evening,\" said the NWS in New York.</p><p>Their forecast currently calls for an inch or two of snowfall for many areas east of New York City, with less than an inch elsewhere.</p><p>\"A reasonable worse case scenario may be up around two or three inches,\" they say.</p><p>The NWS office in Boston is also tracking the system. \"A coastal storm may bring some accumulating snowfall across southern New England Wednesday into Wednesday night, but there is considerable uncertainty,\" it said.</p><p>Boston is calling for mainly frozen precipitation, but the amount of snow that will fall is uncertain.</p><p>If the low tracks farther to the east, most of the heavy snow will stay offshore. However, if the low tracks closer to shore, coastal areas could see snow.</p><p>Right now, Boston is forecasting one to two inches of snow for eastern areas, but that could likely change.</p><p>Behind the system, temperatures will plummet. Lows Wednesday morning will range from the upper 20s inland to around freezing along coastal areas of New York.</p><p>\"While the snowfall is expected to be mainly light, sun angle as this time of year is low, so some minor accumulation on area roadways is possible even with these marginal temperatures,\" says the NWS office in New York.</p><p>California could finally get some much needed rain</p><p>\"Parts of Southern California may see the first rainfall in over a month,\" says the Weather Prediction Center.</p><p>A notable storm system will make its way onshore this week, bringing rain to drought-stricken regions of the west and mountain snow to the Sierra and Rockies.</p><p>The rain should begin in California on Wednesday and lasting through Thursday for many locations. The Bay area is one of those locations that will receive rain. Despite the fact it won't be much, any rain is helpful.</p><p>\"Definitely not a drought buster or big AR (atmospheric river), but much needed rainfall nonetheless,\" says the NWS in San Fransisco.</p><p>Their office is forecasting a few hundredths to a quarter of an inch of rain with this system.</p><p>There will be much cooler air with this particular system as well, bringing snow to lower elevations. Snow totals in the Sierra mountains could reach up to a foot in some locations.</p><p>\"Definitely the coldest airmass so far this season,\" says the NWS in San Francisco. Lows will be in the 30s and 40s in the Bay area Friday morning, with chilly temperatures lasting through much of the weekend.</p><p>Farther south, Los Angeles could even get in on the rain.</p><p>\"Amounts likely ranging from a tenth to a quarter an inch for the coast and valleys up to a quarter to half inch in the mountains,\" says the NWS office in Los Angeles.</p><p>Some models are hinting at even higher amounts, but their forecast office isn't placing any bets yet. This rain is welcomed news for areas that so desperately need the rain, in hopes more could be on the way.</p><p>\"Is this storm door finally opening? Longer range guidance shows additional rain chances returning Dec 13,\" says the NWS in San Francisco.</p><p>Have you ever heard a frozen lake?</p><p>Steamboat Lake in Colorado is now frozen.

Detroit public schools will probably require them unless everyone in a room is vaccinated. In Pittsburgh, masks will likely be required regardless of vaccination status. And in some states, schools cannot mandate face coverings under any circumstances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19 cases soaring nationwide, school districts across the U.S. are yet again confronting the realities of a polarized country and the lingering pandemic as they navigate mask requirements, vaccine rules and social distancing requirements for the fast-approaching new school year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The spread of the delta variant and the deep political divisions over the outbreak have complicated decisions in districts from coast to coast. In some conservative states, lawmakers have banned districts from requiring masks despite outcry from medical professionals. Schools are weighing a variety of plans to manage junior high and middle school classrooms filled with both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.</p><p>\"I'm so frustrated that it's become a political issue because it shouldn't be. It's science,\" said Mary Tuttle, who operates an Indianapolis in-home day care center and has watched the debate in her state over vaccines and masks.</p><p>The Indianapolis district has not yet announced its mask policy, but she hopes they will be required. She worries that the delta variant could lead to a return to in-home learning, which caused her 10-year-old daughter to become depressed and anxious last year.</p><p>The vaccine has not been approved for children under 12. If it is shown to be safe and effective for younger ages, vaccine manufacturers may seek emergency authorization sometime this fall or winter.</p><p>Adding to the concerns is a rise in cases overall - sharply in some states, including Arkansas, which won't let schools require masks. Public health researchers on Tuesday called Arkansas' rapidly climbing infections and hospitalizations a \"raging forest fire,\" and the state's top health official warned of significant future outbreaks in schools.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, and it has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>Weekly tallies by the American Academy of Pediatrics based on state reports show that COVID-19 cases in kids increased nationally in July after a couple of months of declines.</p><p>The most recent data shows a 1% increase from July 1 to July 15, representing 43,000 additional cases.</p><p>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the fact that some states refuse to allow mask requirements \"is just plain wrong.\" She said the organization has embraced recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including masking for those who are not vaccinated and other mitigation steps such as 3-feet physical distancing, ventilation and testing.</p><p>But school officials say masking decisions have been complicated by conflicting advice from public health officials.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday recommended universal masking in schools, even for those who are vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC earlier this month recommended mask-wearing indoors only for students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.</p><p>\"It's frustrating. Parents hear that these are recommendations, and it becomes a delicate dance\" because of differing opinions, said Steve Matthews, superintendent of Novi Community Schools, outside Detroit.</p><p>He probably will recommend that the school board make masking optional, although he worries about potential outbreaks because people are gathering for sporting events, family reunions and other activities.</p><p>\"It would be very helpful if there was agreement among the medical community what the approach should be,\" Matthews said. When everyone wore masks last year, \"it created a sense of community, a sense that we're all in this together. Now it ends up dividing people.\"</p><p>That's part of the reason the academy recommended universal masking in schools, said Dr. Sonja O'Leary, chair of the academy's Council on School Health.</p><p>\"People just wanted it to be clearer, masks or no masks,'' said O'Leary. She said data show COVID-19 infections have not been rampant in U.S. schools, but \"we know masks do curb transmission.\" What's more, keeping track of who has had shots and who has not may be tough for schools.</p><p>School districts that can set their own policies are taking different approaches.</p><p>In Detroit public schools, everyone will likely be required to wear a mask unless an entire room is vaccinated. Officials are developing an identification system, perhaps by wearing lanyards, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, administrators are proposing that all public school students and staff be required to wear masks indoors to protect younger students and because of \"concerns around unknowns from the variant,\" spokeswoman Ebony R. Pugh said. Universal masking also protects the privacy of older students who have not been vaccinated, she said.</p><p>In Kansas, most schoolchildren and teachers will not be required to wear masks. The state's largest district, Wichita, made masks optional starting July 6 and surveyed parents before announcing its reopening plan, said Wichita Public Schools spokeswoman Susan Arensman.</p><p>\"A lot of them, their big talking points were about the emotional well-being of students and staff,\" Arensman said. \"They still wanted kids to be safe, but they also wanted kids to be back to normal.\"</p><p>In Templeton, California, Jenny Grinager said she does not like masks and got an exemption for her 8-year-old son because he has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. She said her son struggles to communicate with people who wear masks because he's unable to see their facial expressions. Last year, he said he didn't have any friends in class and was lonely.</p><p>\"For him, it is the relationship, the interaction that causes him to remember who somebody is,\" said Grinager, who also does not believe vaccination is necessary. She notes that children are less likely to get seriously ill with COVID-19, and she has not been vaccinated.</p><p>In Madison, Wisconsin, Sarah Jedd plans to send her 15- and 13-year old sons back to classes because both are vaccinated, but she will home-school her 9-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter if masks are not required. The district is expected to announce its decision later this week.</p><p>\"I'm just really concerned about (them) being inside a school building with lots and lots of kids with no masks on while they're too young to be vaccinated,\" Jedd said.</p><p>Jacky Frechette, who has a son who's vaccinated and a 4-year-old who isn't, said every Madison student should be required to wear a mask rather than having different rules for the vaccinated and unvaccinated, especially when people can so easily lie about it.</p><p>\"It's sad (wearing masks) has become so divisive that we've put our political thoughts and feelings above what experts say,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4698209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636B-YMT1-JCDM-J2FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1185\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate Noble giving me the opportunity to conclude today's sessions; I will aim to make this one very memorable for you. Speaking of memorable, I know all of us in this room are old enough to remember, let's say, 20 years ago, when there was a lot of excitement about something called cell therapy, and it promised all sorts of wonderful and amazing things, new medicines, et cetera, et cetera. There were many scientists that were touting this new era; I was one of them, in fact. And I've got good news and bad news.</p><p>The bad news, of course, is that 20 years have gone by, and, with the exception of cancer, cell therapy hasn't really produced a lot of the things that it was promising to produce. However, the good news is it's finally starting to happen. And you can measure this in certain ways. You can measure this in the development of products, but you can also measure it on the capital side. And because this is an investment conference, you can point to things like the $1 billion acquisition of BlueRock Therapeutics that works in this space, or the $950 million acquisition of Semma. Or now, more recently, you can also include a deal we recently struck with Roche for a license for our lead program that has a value of up to $670 million. So there are things happening in this space. It's a maturing field, and it's really exciting, and I'm looking forward to telling you about what Lineage does in this space.</p><p>So first, I'll refer you first to our safe harbor clause. I may be making some forward-looking statements throughout the balance of this presentation. So Lineage, and some of those other companies I mentioned, we are advancing a new branch of medicine; it is the use of whole cells as the medicine. So rather than small molecules or antibodies, the things that we're usually familiar with in terms of therapeutics, we're actually using an entire cell to treat the patient. This is a summary slide of our technology; it's based on manufacturing and transplanting these whole cells. We have these validating partnerships, I mentioned the one with Roche and Genentech, we also work with CIRM and Cancer Research UK.</p><p>The exciting thing about using a whole cell as medicine is that, sometimes, the entire cell can do more than just a small molecule, especially in areas where small molecules have failed, and I'm going to show you some examples of that. I'm going to skip to something that I always get asked about: the company's cash position for the last reported quarter was about $83 million. And to give you some perspective, in the last couple of years, we only spent about maybe $25 million. So we think we have abundant runway to be able to reach some important milestones in the programs that I will talk to you about today.</p><p>This is a snapshot of our clinical and non-clinical programs; there are four of them. OpRegen is to treat dry age-related macular degeneration. We have a spinal cord injury program, we have a cancer program, and a brand-new program, internally generated, for auditory neurons. Now what these programs have in common is they all are based on the manufacture of a specific cell type from a stem cell starting material. So I want to be really clear and kind of restate that. We never put a stem cell into a human being, but stem cells are very powerful, and they can become a starting material for other cell types.</p><p>So for example, if you have a disease which is characterized by the loss or death of retina cells, you could use stem cells, and, from those stem cells, manufacture retina cells and replace the ones that are lost. And that's been the basis for this large deal that we did with Roche. And we have similar approaches in the spinal cord, where we manufacture spinal cord cells; in oncology, where we manufacture part of the immune cells; and now, also auditory neurons to address hearing loss.</p><p>These are the three steps; it's really simple. You start with these pluripotent stem cells. Those cells are capable of unlimited expansion, and they don't change; this is the real power of this underlying technology. Those cells can be increased in number, many, many billions of cells can be manufactured. Then in step two, you convert them. And it's almost like a recipe. You convert them through natural processes into the cell type which you desire to have. I called it like a recipe. And just like flower can lead to a cookie, or flower can lead to bread -- and you know the cookies and bread do different things -- it's the same with our starting material. These pluripotent stem cells can become retina cells, liver cells, kidney cells, heart, brain, bone, blood, anything you can imagine. Of the 200 cell types in your body, these pluripotent stem cells can become all of them.</p><p>Thirdly, we then develop the product. So after we have manufactured the specific cell type and tied it to whatever disease or condition that we're looking to treat, we then use those cells, we transplant them to the patient. And if they are functional and they are integrated and they are not rejected, which has been our data to date, then you may be able to see some clinical benefits. The amazing thing, which I sort of referred to is, because you have 200 cell types in your body, in theory, we could have 200 or more different programs. The ones that are highlighted in orange are the ones that we have today. But again, this is a platform which has tremendous breadth and power, and we could utilize this platform to go into many different areas.</p><p>Most of our experience has been what's called the ectodermal or neuro-ectodermal Lineage, so that's at the bottom. That's where we're manufacturing the auditory neurons and the specialized retina cells. But we can expand; we could go into other areas. But these are our areas of focus for today. We're trying to go after areas where there's a compelling unmet need, large market opportunity, and a paucity of competition.</p><p>We do all this internally; we do not throw our manufacturing over the wall. If you are making a small molecule, sure, you can get a contract organization, they can make the molecule, you give them a picture of it, they'll go make it for you. With whole cells, it's much more difficult. Many, many millions of times more complicated, because you have many millions of molecules that comprise the cell. So it's very difficult and it's really important to retain your own manufacturing, control your process, and, of course, you can generate a lot of intellectual property. And in fact, we do have one of the largest intellectual property estates in cell therapy, with more than 600 different applications and pending applications.</p><p>I'm going to briefly go through what we're doing in the setting of dry age-related macular degeneration. This is one of the leading causes of blindness and this is the basis for this worldwide collaboration we have with Roche and Genentech. This came with $50 million up front and another $620 million of additional payments. And we announced this in December of last year, so this is still fresh, we're still launching this. Genentech is going to take over all of the development of the product and ultimately commercialization of the product. We're doing some manufacturing still for them and their joint steering committee oversees this work. And we're completing the ongoing study; the data that we are already generating, we'll continue to follow up those patients.</p><p>Why did Genentech and Roche -- why did they want to do a deal? Well, there's a tremendous unmet need here. In the setting of dry age-related macular degeneration, the loss of retina cells leads to an ever-growing area of atrophy shown by these six panels. As you go from left to right, that area of atrophy is characterized by the death of retina cells, and it just goes outward. I'm from Southern California, we have forest fires out there. This is just like a forest fire; it just expands outward, just consuming and destroying everything in its path. What it's destroying is your vision. This person started with 20/20 vision, and, as you can see off to the right-hand side, in just a few years, they become legally blind and really have negligible vision after seven years.</p><p>So what can we do about this? Well, first, the commercial opportunity is quite compelling, because, unlike the other form of AMD, which is called WET for which there are $10 billion of sales, this dry form of AMD has no approved products and it is 8 to 9 times more common. So we have a tremendous unmet need, no FDA approved therapeutics, and probably a very significant commercial opportunity. Now people have tried to develop drugs in this space and failed. We are trying a different approach. We are, as I described, manufacturing replacement cells. So on the left side, this cartoonish figure, this schematic, this is showing the death of cells. Those cells that are in the retinal space, they support photoreceptors above them. When you lose those RPE cells, those are the cells we make, the photoreceptors lose their nourishment, they fail to function, you lose your vision. So if you can replace them -- on the right, those shiny blue cells, those are the replacement cells. So conceptually, this is kind of like a bone marrow transplant, right? Make the cells, put them in the patient who is losing the cells, look for benefits.</p><p>We have been tremendously successful in the manufacturing side; this is actually sort of a hidden strength of the business is our manufacturing capability. We are manufacturing, essentially, pure populations of RPE cells. You cannot detect residual, undifferentiated cells in our clinical material. So everything is pushed into becoming a retina cell. We never put a stem cell in a human being; we always convert them over to some other cell type, the cell type which is deficient in the body.</p><p>We've developed a new thaw-and-inject formulation, which makes it really easy to use this stuff. You take it out of a frozen state, five minutes in a warm water bath, into the syringe, 30-minute surgery, and the patient is out of the surgical suite and is able to go on with their life. So it's a straightforward clinical procedure to administer the cells into the subretinal space. By the way, these patients are familiar with having injections into the eye. I know it sounds horrible, but hopefully none of us will get there. But if you're going to lose your vision and you are faced with having an injection in your eye, it's actually a pretty easy decision.</p><p>We have been very successful at increasing the manufacturing scale. I definitely challenge you: if you look at other cell therapy companies or regenerative medicine companies, really ask tough questions about manufacturing. We're at the point that, in a 3 liter bioreactor, we can manufacture about 2,500 clinical courses. And this three-dimensional growth -- this is key, growing in three-dimensional space instead of flat plastic plates -- gives us tremendous efficiencies and also tremendous control over our process. And you can run larger bioreactors, you can put them in series or in parallel. So it's important to have a line of sight into commercial production, and we have that.</p><p>The most compelling thing about what we have done is we have shown data that no other academic or corporate group has shown, which is we've been able to show that an area of atrophy, similar to those pictures I showed you a moment ago, can actually become smaller. Areas of retinal loss can become restored after transplants that we provide. The reason why that's a big deal is because it never happens naturally. You can rip an arm off of a starfish, it might be able to grow it back, but you cannot remove retinal tissue or lose retinal tissue and regrow it; that's not a function that human beings can do. So if you take a picture of someone who has lost retinal tissue and then you treat them and you come back and you take another picture and there is new retinal tissue there, it's because of our intervention.</p><p>That's really exciting, and this is sort of flying in the face of conventional wisdom for this disease condition, because, heretofore, almost all of the leading companies are trying to slow the process down, they're trying to have that forest fire expand slower. That's best attempts right now. We've been able to not only stop it in some patients, but even reverse it in some patients. So I think that is probably the most compelling data that led to, as I say, the up to $670 million deal with Roche and Genentech, which, to our knowledge is, outside of oncology, the largest cell therapy license agreement that's been signed.</p><p>This feeds into -- this whole proof of principle that we've been working on -- I joined the company about 3.5 years ago. Everything that we've done here since I joined is really about demonstrating that the use of whole cells in therapeutic settings may be able to generate outsized clinical benefits as opposed to some of the other traditional approaches that have been pursued. So we're going to keep going with it. The story is not over, certainly, with a big pharma deal. We are using some of that capital to reinvest into some of our other programs. We are manufacturing a special kind of cell in order to help patients, who suffer from spinal cord injury, regain mobility.</p><p>This is a young man who obviously crashed his car. He was on our clinical trials. He used to be a quadriplegic; he could barely shrug his shoulders. And this is him throwing a baseball. What's really actually more important is the water bottle. What's more important is this kid can take a drink of water when he wants it, or he can manipulate his wheelchair when he wants it. That's wrist control, bicep control. That is what we want to do. Everybody has a cell phone; you want to be able to use your cell phone. Upper extremity mobility is where we're focused. And I know 20 years ago, people said, cell therapy, we are going to get people getting out of their wheelchairs. Maybe someday we are, but let's at least start somewhere. Let's start with a little bit of upper extremity mobility. Wouldn't that be a good thing? We believe that it is.</p><p>This is actually a fairly common event, maybe 18,000 times per year. It's what you would expect. It's accidents, car crashes. And it's very sad, because, often times, it is a young man who definitely did not expect this to happen. You smoke five packs of cigarettes, you might get lung cancer, but nobody expects to become immobilized from spinal cord injury.</p><p>I've really covered the unmet need and I've covered the point that we want to gain mobility into the upper extremities. I want to show you how we're going to do this. We manufacture oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. These are the cells which are responsible for creating the myelin insulation around axons. It's a technical phrase, but, suffice it to say, that in order to have cohesive mobility, organized mobility not spastic mobility, you have to have nerves that are all wiring together and all firing together. And those nerves need to have myelin. And so we are producing and transplanting to these patients the cells that are necessary to myelinate the axons that they rely on for their mobility.</p><p>They get -- just like in the setting of dry AMD in the blindness case, these cells are injected directly into the spinal cord. So the approach is very similar to the success we've had with OpRegen. RMAT designation, orphan drug designation, $14 million from CIRM, there are a lot of nice attributes to this program. And similar to the dry AMD program that I described, there have been 25, actually 30, total patients treated in this. In the dry AMD program that I described, we have treated 24 to 25 patients with various ophthalmological disorders, levels of distress. We've got 5 patients with thoracic injury, which is a little lower, and then 25 patients with cervical injury. So in terms of clinical data, clinical evidence, it's actually pretty comparable to what we have shown with the dry AMD program.</p><p>This is what we're doing. You can see on the left, this is a control -- this is an animal spinal cord; this is just to demonstrate what we're doing inside the patient. I'll show you an MRI, what it looks like in the patient, in a minute. But the concept here is that that gap, that vacancy -- it's called a cavity -- that hole, electrical impulses cannot jump across. Just like a cord in your house, you can't jump across the air. So you have to have some material, you have to have some substance in there. So we manufacture those cells, we transplant them into that cavity, and, when they are there, they are manufacturing myelin, they are secreting neurotrophic factors, they're giving the patient something to work from. Physical therapy? Electrostim? Great. Bring it on. Add it, we want it, because we are giving you the material that can respond to that additional therapy.</p><p>These cells are coming from an NIH-registered cell line. We treat patients 3 to 6 weeks after injury. I make that point because if you've got 3 to 6 weeks before you treat a patient, you have plenty of time to relocate them if you need to, if they're not at a Level I trauma center or wherever, if you need to get, and you do, all of the appropriate permissions and approvals to conduct this sort of work. This is not like the setting of stroke where you often hear about the Golden Hour, you have to be literally there at the diving board where the kid went into the pool. We have time to get the patient ready and select the right kind of patient for this kind of therapy.</p><p>This is some animal data. It's just to show you that, when you do this in animals, you can regain additional motor function. And this is a different version of the same thing; I'm not going to try and make this a data-heavy presentation. I'm also not going to go into the subsets of all the different kinds of patients, all that's available. I'd love to talk about it another time.</p><p>What I do want to stop on though is this. This is the safety output from the 25-patient trials. What's really compelling here is you have more than 500 adverse events, only one of which was potentially related to our cells. So I think this is really compelling because it says that the safety profile, the tolerance of this therapy, is very favorable. So what that means to me as someone who runs clinical trials is if we show you even just a little bit of benefit in these patients, I think the risk/reward calculus is compelling and in our favor.</p><p>Most of the patients, I'm going to say 80% of them, do develop that cavitation. Only one of them in our clinical trial, so we reduced cavitation from 80% to 4%. And that cavitation is associated with different complications and other adverse events. So really happy to see that the cells have been retained, they've been stable, they're not rejected. These patients are not on lifetime immunosuppression. Like a lot of the stuff that you may be heard about or were afraid about or thought skeptically about, in terms of cell therapy, has not shown up, at least in our hands, in our clinical trials, so I think that's encouraging. More encouraging than that is this. 96% of patients in this setting had some improvement in their motor activity, and a third of them, approximately a third of them, had two or more levels of benefit. I don't have time in this presentation to go into what that means. There's a scale that looks something like this, but I'm going to skip over, and I'm going to give you something that you can relate to maybe a little more easily.</p><p>If you gain two levels -- this is essentially like pushing the injury down, down lower, and gaining function higher -- you can see what it means to someone to move from C4 to C6, or C5 to C7: massive reductions in cost of care, huge gains in quality of life, ability to go to the bathroom when you feel like going to the bathroom, ability to button up a button on your shirt. These are important gains for individuals who fit into this profile of cervical level C4 to C7. We also think we can do better. We noticed some things in the data that we think we can avoid next time. The two worst patients, by the way, had this cord compression. You can put a port in the patient, relieve the pressure, and we may be able to select for better patients in the next study and get better outcomes. It's part of a future design, this is something we're not starting until next year, but it's an important consideration for how we're learning, through this new technology, how we can be better.</p><p>I'm going to skip the cord compression, I'm going to skip some of the specific data; a lot of this has been or is currently being published. We are, as a next step, near-term, going through some improvements in this program. The original way of administering the cells requires this big scaffold and everything, now we have this cute little device. We're going to start this clinical trial later this year, in 5 to 10 patients, and demonstrate that it is an effective way of delivering the cells. The cells themselves have been vastly improved in our hands. We have this new ready to inject formulation scale. All these manufacturing things that we learned from the ophthalmology program we are now applying to the spinal cord program. This is an example: the purity of our cells. This is a table showing you levels of impurity. Blue is the original stuff that was used in the clinic; orange is the stuff we're making today, a lot cleaner, a lot more pure. I think that's going to be beneficial and I think the FDA is going to be happy about that.</p><p>So I'm going to keep going through because I know I'm going to run out of time here, and I want to tell you about two other similar programs. One is that we can manufacture a third kind of cell, a dendritic cell. Dendritic cells are part of your immune system; they are very good at delivering information to your immune system. They can carry, that's their job. Their natural job is to carry antigens to your immune system. Because we can manufacture dendritic cells, we can load those dendritic cells with 50 million, 60 million copies of an antigen and put that in a patient. So the patient's immune system is getting a screaming, loud education as to what foreign material looks like. So instead of replacing cells that are absent, in this case, we are just adding cells that have a very specific function. So it's a little bit of a spin on the other examples of cell therapy. But it's really exciting because you can go in a lot of different directions, because it's not the cell that's therapeutic, it's the information that makes it a therapeutic. So if you want to put a colorectal cancer antigen into this cell, you can; if you want a breast cancer antigen into this cell, you can. There's a lot of different partnership ideas that we have here.</p><p>I have to skip, because I've really got to tell you about this new one: it is hearing loss. 430 million people around the world suffer from hearing loss. Fundamentally, we have a problem where, as you age or you hear a lot of -- you went to too many rock concerts or some medications can do this, you can lose your auditory neurons. Let's make the auditory neurons, let's replace the auditory neurons. So this is a new program. We didn't acquire this; this was internally built by us. And if you go back to that first slide I showed, of all the branching of all the things that you can do, this is an example of it. This is something that, six months ago, didn't really exist, and we've been able to create this new program and now we're launching this new program, we're working to get this new program into the clinic. The power and I think the potential and perhaps the great value that Lineage can offer to investors is being able to expand the scope of work that we have.</p><p>I'm going to go through -- we've got a bunch of clinical and regulatory milestones. I want to just do the takeaway to say, Lineage is a company that I believe is a leader in this regenerative medicine/antiaging space. We are a cell therapy company, but, again, we don't put stem cells in people, we are more like a bone marrow transplant. We use a specific cell as the medicine for the patient. The company is well-capitalized, we control our manufacturing, we control our own fate in a lot of ways. And I think what we have been able to do for patients, which you can find examples of on our website, have been very compelling in terms of their ability to move, their improvements in vision. And some of the credibility of this new corporate partnership I think puts us on a wonderful trajectory. And I certainly look forward to the overall healthcare environment and biotech environment starting to reward companies for the kinds of things that we are doing.</p><p>So thank you so much for your attention and I will conclude there.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service) President Joe Biden's first budget request laid out this week reflects the administration's commitments to advancing conservation and combating climate change, proposing new money across federal agencies to address those issues. Like most domestic programs in Biden's overall $1.5 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, the recommendations for increased spending on conservation and climate goals are a dramatic turnaround following four years of cutbacks during the Trump administration. </p><p>The administration is requesting[1]$17.4 billion for the Interior Department, a $2.4 billion increase from what's now in effect for the current budget year, which is fiscal 2021. The proposed 16% increase is in line with the overall increase the administration is asking for all non-defense discretionary programs. Interior would also see $1.7 billion for high-priority hazardous fuels and forest fire resilience programs, a nearly $500 million boost from fiscal 2021. A news release from the Interior Department highlighted the request's proposed increases for tribal programs. 'President Biden's funding request provides much-needed resources to Tribal Nations, prioritizes racial justice and equity, and invests in healthy lands, waters, and a clean energy economy that will create good-paying jobs,' Interior Secretary Debra Haaland said in a written statement. The request calls for $4 billion for tribal programs, a roughly 17% increase from fiscal 2021, to be used for tribal schools, law enforcement and clean energy development. It would increase funding for climate mitigation, resilience and environmental justice programs in Native American communities by $450 million. The funding would 'strengthen self-determination and self-governance programs to bolster Tribal sovereignty,' theInterior release[2]said. This week's document is a preliminary budget from the administration, which is usual in a new presidency. A more detailed budget plan, which will include revenue estimates, is expected later this spring. Congress never adopts a presidential budget request in its entirety, but Biden's is more likely to succeed at least in part in a Congress controlled by Democrats. Climate goals across the government The request released Friday reflects the administration's prioritization of climate change and its whole-of-government approach to addressing it. The administration requested a $14 billion increase for 'major new climate' spending 'across nearly every agency.' The word 'climate' appears 151 times in the 61-page document. Several federal departments would see additional funding for climate science and research. The administration asked for $4 billion 'to fund a broad portfolio of research across multiple agencies.' It would spend $1 billion to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate and in the existing Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to fund clean energy and climate resilience research. As part of its climate agenda, the administration has pledged to protect 30% of U.S. land and water by 2030. The request offers few new details on that initiative. It calls for 'significant investment' for conservation efforts on public and private lands through the U.S. Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both agencies within the Department of Agriculture. Part of the funding 'would encourage voluntary conservation across the nation's forests, farms, and ranches, while allowing land owners to continue to work their land,' the request says. The administration didn't provide details on how it would encourage voluntary conservation on private lands. Sarah Greenberger, the senior vice president for conservation policy at the conservation and bird advocacy group National Audubon Society, said the USDA could help farmers and ranchers adopt best practices and provide financial assistance. The proposal would provide $6.5 billion in lending for 'additional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects in rural communities.' In addition to climate action, several sections of the request refer to environmental justice, and programs to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate change on disadvantaged communities. Abandoned wells, displaced workers Parts of the request mirrors items in the administration's infrastructure and jobs agenda[3]it laid out last week, though at lower spending levels. The Interior section includes $550 million to cap orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mineral mines. That figure is more than triple the fiscal 2021 funding, but below the average yearly target for such efforts that the administration laid out in its proposed infrastructure and jobs legislation last week. The infrastructure framework calls for $16 billion over 10 years for abandoned wells and mines cleanup. This week's budget request is intended to be seen as a separate but complementary document, an administration official said Friday. The request also calls for funding a new Civilian Climate Corps, another item in the infrastructure proposal. This week's request asked for $200 million for Interior programs that promote science-driven conservation, including for the new jobs program. The infrastructure proposal asked for about $1 billion per year for the Civilian Climate Corps alone. The lower annual spending levels in the budget request likely reflect that the proposals would grow over time, not that the administration was lowering its spending goals. The request would fund a new multiagency program to help displaced workers in the oil and gas industry transition to jobs in cleaner forms of energy. Greenberger praised the request's focus on economic factors as part of its approach to climate. 'The budget is a demonstration of commitment to conservation, to climate action \u2014 which obviously we care deeply about \u2014 but also to people,' Greenberger said. 'For conservation to be successful, communities need to be successful.'

Detroit public schools will probably require them unless everyone in a room is vaccinated. In Pittsburgh, masks will likely be required regardless of vaccination status. And in some states, schools cannot mandate face coverings under any circumstances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19 cases soaring nationwide, school districts across the U.S. are yet again confronting the realities of a polarized country and the lingering pandemic as they navigate mask requirements, vaccine rules and social distancing requirements for the fast-approaching new school year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The spread of the delta variant and the deep political divisions over the outbreak have complicated decisions in districts from coast to coast. Some conservative states, lawmakers have banned districts from requiring masks despite outcry from medical professionals. Schools are weighing a variety of plans to manage junior high and middle school classrooms filled with both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so frustrated that it\u2019s become a political issue because it shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s science,\u201d said Mary Tuttle, who operates an Indianapolis in-home day care center and hopes the city's schools require masks for her daughters.</p><p>She worries that the delta variant could lead to a return to virtual learning, which caused her 10-year-old daughter to become depressed and anxious last year. Another daughter will turn 12 six days after starting 6th grade and will be vaccinated as soon as possible.</p><p>Adding to the concerns is a rise in cases overall \u2014 sharply in some states, including Arkansas, which won't let schools require masks. Public health researchers on Tuesday called Arkansas' rapidly climbing infections and hospitalizations a \u201craging forest fire,\u201d and the state\u2019s top health official warned of significant future outbreaks in schools.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, and it has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>In Mississippi, the leading health official said Tuesday that intensive care units are full in 13 hospitals because of a surge in cases, and he provided an ominous warning in one of the least vaccinated states in the country: \"Y'all, we\u2019re going to have a rough few weeks,\u201d Dr. Thomas Dobbs said.</p><p>Weekly tallies by the American Academy of Pediatrics based on state reports show that COVID-19 cases in kids increased nationally in July after a couple of months of declines. The most recent data shows a 1% increase from July 1 to July 15, representing 43,000 additional cases.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday recommended universal masking in schools, even for those who are vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month recommended mask-wearing indoors only for students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.</p><p>The vaccine has not been approved for children under 12. If it shown to be safe and effective for younger ages, vaccine manufacturers may seek emergency authorization sometime this fall or winter.</p><p>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the fact that some states refuse to allow mask requirements \u201cis just plain wrong.\u201d She said the organization has embraced recommendations from the CDC.</p><p>But school officials say masking decisions have been complicated by conflicting advice from public health officials.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. Parents hear that these are recommendations, and it becomes a delicate dance\u201d because of differing opinions, said Steve Matthews, superintendent of Novi Community Schools, outside Detroit.</p><p>He probably will recommend that the school board make masking optional, although he worries about potential outbreaks because people are gathering for sporting events, family reunions and other activities.</p><p>\u201cIt would be very helpful if there was agreement among the medical community what the approach should be,\u201d Matthews said. When everyone wore masks last year, \u201cit created a sense of community, a sense that we\u2019re all in this together. Now it ends up dividing people.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s part of the reason the academy recommended universal masking in schools, said Dr. Sonja O\u2019Leary, chair of the academy\u2019s Council on School Health.</p><p>\u201cPeople just wanted it to be clearer, masks or no masks,\u2019\u2019 said O\u2019Leary. She said data show COVID-19 infections have not been rampant in U.S. schools, but \u201cwe know masks do curb transmission.\u201d What\u2019s more, keeping track of who has had shots and who has not may be tough for schools.</p><p>School districts that can set their own policies are taking different approaches.</p><p>In Detroit public schools, everyone will likely be required to wear a mask unless an entire room is vaccinated. Officials are developing an identification system, perhaps by wearing lanyards, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, administrators are proposing that all public school students and staff be required to wear masks indoors to protect younger students and because of \"concerns around unknowns from the variant,\u201d spokeswoman Ebony R. Pugh said. Universal masking also protects the privacy of older students who have not been vaccinated, she said.</p><p>In Kansas, most schoolchildren and teachers will not be required to wear masks. The state\u2019s largest district, Wichita, made masks optional starting July 6 and surveyed parents before announcing its reopening plan, said Wichita Public Schools spokeswoman Susan Arensman.</p><p>\u201cA lot of them, their big talking points were about the emotional well-being of students and staff,\u201d Arensman said. \u201cThey still wanted kids to be safe, but they also wanted kids to be back to normal.\u201d</p><p>In Templeton, California, Jenny Grinager said she does not like masks and got an exemption for her 8-year-old son because he has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. She said her son struggles to communicate with people who wear masks because he's unable to see their facial expressions. Last year, he said he didn't have any friends in class and was lonely.</p><p>\u201cFor him, it is the relationship, the interaction that causes him to remember who somebody is,\" said Grinager, who also does not believe vaccination is necessary. She notes that children are less likely to get seriously ill with COVID-19, and she has not been vaccinated.</p><p>In Madison, Wisconsin, Sarah Jedd plans to send her 15- and 13-year old sons back to classes because both are vaccinated, but she will home-school her 9-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter if masks are not required. The district is expected to announce its decision later this week.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really concerned about (them) being inside a school building with lots and lots of kids with no masks on while they\u2019re too young to be vaccinated,\u201d Jedd said.</p><p>Jacky Frechette, who has a son who's vaccinated and a 4-year-old who isn't, said every Madison student should be required to wear a mask rather than having different rules for the vaccinated and unvaccinated, especially when people can so easily lie about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad (wearing masks) has become so divisive that we\u2019ve put our political thoughts and feelings above what experts say,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus, Andrew DeMillo and Lindsey Tanner and contributed to this story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-92f4414ff2b85f98c59aa2a412b1cdcd20210721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6364-NJT1-JC5B-G4GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><timeReceived>12:42 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 21, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Photo by NASA Earth Observatory President Joe Biden's first budget request laid out on Friday reflects the administration's commitments to advancing conservation and combating climate change, proposing new money across federal agencies to address those issues. Like most domestic programs in Biden's overall $1.5 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, the recommendations for increased spending on conservation and climate goals are a dramatic turnaround following four years of cutbacks during the Trump administration. </p><p>The administration is requesting[1]$17.4 billion for the Interior Department, a $2.4 billion increase from what's now in effect for the current budget year, which is fiscal 2021. The proposed 16% increase is in line with the overall increase the administration is asking for all non-defense discretionary programs. Interior would also see $1.7 billion for high-priority hazardous fuels and forest fire resilience programs, a nearly $500 million boost from fiscal 2021. A news release from the Interior Department highlighted the request's proposed increases for tribal programs. 'President Biden's funding request provides much-needed resources to Tribal Nations, prioritizes racial justice and equity, and invests in healthy lands, waters, and a clean energy economy that will create good-paying jobs,' Interior Secretary Debra Haaland said in a written statement. The request calls for $4 billion for tribal programs, a roughly 17% increase from fiscal 2021, to be used for tribal schools, law enforcement and clean energy development. It would increase funding for climate mitigation, resilience and environmental justice programs in Native American communities by $450 million. The funding would 'strengthen self-determination and self-governance programs to bolster Tribal sovereignty,' theInterior release[2]said. Friday's document is a preliminary budget from the administration, which is usual in a new presidency. A more detailed budget plan, which will include revenue estimates, is expected later this spring. Congress never adopts a presidential budget request in its entirety, but Biden's is more likely to succeed at least in part in a Congress controlled by Democrats. Climate goals across the government Friday's request reflects the administration's prioritization of climate change and its whole-of-government approach to addressing it. The administration requested a $14 billion increase for 'major new climate' spending 'across nearly every agency.' The word 'climate' appears 151 times in the 61-page document. Several federal departments would see additional funding for climate science and research. The administration asked for $4 billion 'to fund a broad portfolio of research across multiple agencies.' It would spend $1 billion to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate and in the existing Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to fund clean energy and climate resilience research. As part of its climate agenda, the administration has pledged to protect 30 percent of U.S. land and water by 2030. The request offers few new details on that initiative. It calls for 'significant investment' for conservation efforts on public and private lands through the U.S. Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both agencies within the Department of Agriculture. Part of the funding 'would encourage voluntary conservation across the Nation's forests, farms, and ranches, while allowing land owners to continue to work their land,' the request says. The administration didn't provide details on how it would encourage voluntary conservation on private lands. Sarah Greenberger, the senior vice president for conservation policy at the conservation and bird advocacy group National Audubon Society, said the USDA could help farmers and ranchers adopt best practices and provide financial assistance. The proposal would provide $6.5 billion in lending for 'additional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects in rural communities.' In addition to climate action, several sections of the request refer to environmental justice, and programs to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate change on disadvantaged communities. Abandoned wells, displaced workers Parts of the request mirrors items in the administration'sinfrastructure and jobs agenda[3]it laid out last week, though at lower spending levels. The Interior section includes $550 million to cap orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mineral mines. That figure is more than triple the fiscal 2021 funding, but below the average yearly target for such efforts that the administration laid out in its proposed infrastructure and jobs legislation last week. The infrastructure framework calls for $16 billion over 10 years for abandoned wells and mines cleanup. Friday's request is intended to be seen as a separate but complementary document, an administration official said Friday. The request also calls for funding a new Civilian Climate Corps, another item in the infrastructure proposal. Friday's request asked for $200 million for Interior programs that promote science-driven conservation, including for the new jobs program. The infrastructure proposal asked for about $1 billion per year for the Civilian Climate Corps alone. The lower annual spending levels in the budget request likely reflect that the proposals would grow over time, not that the administration was lowering its spending goals. The request would fund a new multiagency program to help displaced workers in the oil and gas industry transition to jobs in cleaner forms of energy. Greenberger praised the request's focus on economic factors as part of its approach to climate. 'The budget is a demonstration of commitment to conservation, to climate action\u2014which obviously we care deeply about\u2014but also to people,' Greenberger said. 'For conservation to be successful, communities need to be successful.'

More than 50 such models were assessed and compared in the latest round of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6 (CMIP6), run by the World Climate Research Programme1. It is crucial that researchers know the best way to use those outputs to provide consistent information for climate science and policy.</p><p>We are climate modellers and analysts who develop, distribute and use these projections. We know scientists must treat them with great care. Users beware: a subset of the newest generation of models are \u2018too hot\u20192 and project climate warming in response to carbon dioxide emissions that might be larger than that supported by other evidence3\u20137. Some suggest that doubling atmospheric CO2 concentrations from pre-industrial levels will result in warming above 5 \u00b0C, for example. This was not the case in previous generations of simpler models.</p><p>Earth is a complicated system of interconnected oceans, land, ice and atmosphere, and no computer model could ever simulate every aspect of it exactly. Models vary in their complexity, and each makes different assumptions about and approximations of processes that happen on small scales, such as cloud formation.</p><p>Survey of gender bias in the IPCC</p><p>The CMIP6 models include more sophisticated treatments of ice, water and clouds than earlier ones did, including those in phase 5 (CMIP5). The latest models also include a wider variety of physical processes than before. As models become more realistic, they are expected to converge. In the meantime, individual improvements can affect how sensitive the models are to certain warming processes, in ways that are often impossible to predict.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to its credit, has recognized this \u2018hot model\u2019 problem. Scientists contributing to the main sections of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6; published over the past few months) reconciled the newest climate models with key observational constraints on global mean warming, sea-level rise and ocean heat content, and other analyses. They applied statistics to determine the most reasonable projections, consistent with many lines of evidence, which they call \u2018assessed warming\u2019.</p><p>Unfortunately, little guidance was made available for scientists wishing to study projections in other contexts. We are concerned that in the absence of such guidance, much of the scientific literature is at risk of reporting projections that are inconsistent with the approach taken by the IPCC, and that are overly influenced by the hot models.</p><p>Studies that cover monthly or daily extremes or regional climate impacts, for example, are instead left to use the full set of CMIP6 models. And simply taking an average of those leads to higher projections of warming than the IPCC\u2019s assessed-warming averages. As a result, some studies have reported projections that might be inconsistent with AR6 assessments. Findings that show projected climate change will be \u2018worse than we thought\u2019 are often attributable to the hot models in CMIP6.</p><p>A forest fire in Brazil\u2019s Pantanal region burns out of control in August 2020.</p><p>Credit: Gustavo Basso/NurPhoto via Getty</p><p>The Brazilian Pantanal in rural Pocone, Mato Grosso, burns with the worst wildfires in recorded history, in 2020.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that, whereas unduly hot outcomes might be unlikely, this does not mean that global warming is not a serious threat. Multiple lines of evidence establish that the planet is more than 1 \u00b0C warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution, and that further warming poses severe risks to society and the natural world. There are many aspects of climate change we do not yet understand, hence the continued necessity of climate science. But there is no serious disagreement that continued emissions will lead to dangerous levels of warming.</p><p>The IPCC came up with a solution for global mean projections. Now researchers, communities and policymakers need more information. To inform better practice, we outline here what the IPCC has done differently in AR6, and offer some suggestions on how best to address these gaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hot tail</emphasis></p><p>The largest source of uncertainty in global temperatures 50 or 100 years from now is the volume of future greenhouse-gas emissions, which are largely under human control. However, even if we knew precisely what that volume would be, we would still not know exactly how warm the planet would get. This is because human-caused global warming is an enormous experiment that has no precedent, and feedback processes, such as changes to cloud cover, will affect the pace and magnitude of warming.</p><p>To quantify the influence of these effects, climate modellers define standardized metrics. One is the transient climate response (TCR), or the amount of global warming in the year in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations have finally doubled after having steadily increased by 1% every year. A second metric is equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), the eventual long-term temperature response to CO2 concentrations that have doubled and remain doubled. The two metrics are distinct but related: ECS measures a long-term equilibrium climate response, whereas TCR measures a climate that has not yet had time to fully adjust2. Models with a high TCR tend to have a high ECS4.</p><p>Heavy rainfall caused the Clarence River to flood Grafton in New South Wales, Australia, in March.</p><p>Credit: Brook Mitchell/The Sydney Morning Herald via Getty</p><p>The rising Clarence River floods the town of Grafton in Northern NSW Australia on 1 March 2022.</p><p>In previous generations of climate models in CMIP5, no model had an ECS of higher than 4.7 \u00b0C. In CMIP6, more than one-quarter of models have sensitivities that are greater than this, and around one-fifth show warming of at least 5 \u00b0C in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, according to our analysis. Numerous studies have found that these high-sensitivity models do a poor job of reproducing historical temperatures over time4\u20137 and in simulating the climates of the distant past8. Specifically, they often show no warming over the twentieth century and then a sharp warming spike in the past few decades3, and some simulate the last ice age as being much colder than palaeoclimate evidence indicates7.</p><p>At the time these new models were being developed, climate scientists were also trying to improve understanding of the range of climate sensitivity, and to narrow it. A 2020 community review (that four of us co-authored)8 combined lines of evidence from palaeoclimate, observations of surface temperatures and ocean heat content, and models of physical processes. It concluded8 that the ECS is likely (with a 66% chance) to be in the range of 2.6\u20133.9 \u00b0C, and very likely (with a 90% chance) to lie between 2.3 and 4.7 \u00b0C.</p><p>On the basis of that review and other recent findings, the AR6 authors decided to narrow the climate sensitivity they considered \u2018likely\u2019 to a similar range, of between 2.5 and 4 \u00b0C, and to a \u2018very likely\u2019 range of between 2 \u00b0C and 5 \u00b0C.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beyond model democracy</emphasis></p><p>The climate community has debated what to do about the hot models since results began to appear in 2019. Before then, the IPCC and many other assessments simply used the mean and spread of models to estimate impacts and their uncertainties. Such \u2018model democracy\u2019 assumed that each model is independent and equally valid. Other methods of combining model projections did not yield results that were more consistent or credible9.</p><p>Climate policy models need to get real about people \u2014 here\u2019s how</p><p>In AR6, such simple methods no longer work: the high-sensitivity models are not as equally valid as others for estimating global temperature. AR6 authors decided to apply weights to each model before averaging them, to produce \u2018assessed global warming\u2019 projections. Specifically, the AR6 report used various published statistical weighting methods4\u20136 to combine the projections of different climate models, giving more weight to those that agreed with historical temperature observations.</p><p>They also used a climate model \u2018emulator\u2019 \u2014 a simpler model requiring less computing power \u2014 that incorporated the latest estimates of the sensitivity of the climate to CO2 emissions, based on lines of evidence beyond climate models. This approach provides a more realistic range of future warming projections, which are better constrained by observations than the raw CMIP6 model output, but are difficult for non-specialists to reproduce.</p><p>The IPCC\u2019s assessed-warming projections produce only annual average global changes. Researchers looking to study regional climate impacts, daily extremes or other climate variables have had to pick their own path. Many analysts have defaulted to the pre-AR6 approach of treating each model the same. This leads to exaggerated projections: global average surface temperatures in 2100 that are 0.2\u20130.7 \u00b0C warmer than those with AR6 assessed warming (see \u2018Climate models: choice matters\u2019; underlying data are available in Supplementary information). The assessed-warming projections, by contrast, are broadly consistent with those from CMIP5.</p><p>Source: Z. Hausfather <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis></p><p>Climate models:Choice matters. Line graph showing four climate scenarios and the difference between models.</p><p>Results using the raw CMIP6 models are already entering the climate impacts literature. In our experience, few climate researchers outside those directly involved in the creation of models are aware of the assessed-warming approach taken in AR6. In recent months, we\u2019ve seen numerous papers highlighting how much worse regional and global climate outcomes are in CMIP6 than in the previous model generation, caused largely by the inclusion of unrealistic high-sensitivity models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What to do</emphasis></p><p>The broad and diverse community studying climate change and its impacts urgently needs guidance on best practices for combining the outputs of multiple climate models. One key message: the multi-model mean and spread of the new ensemble (CMIP6) should not simply be used like the old one (CMIP5).</p><p>We suggest that climate researchers consider the following options.</p><p>First, follow the lead of the AR6 to base analyses on global warming levels rather than on time10. For example, instead of assessing changes in rainfall by the year 2100, researchers could report changes at global warming levels of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 \u00b0C. This has several advantages. It mirrors the policy discourse surrounding the Paris agreement targets of 1.5 \u00b0C and \u2018well below 2 \u00b0C\u2019. It is also largely independent of the choice of future emissions scenario \u2014 despite some differences related to the rate of warming and aerosol forcing, the world largely looks the same at 2 \u00b0C, no matter how we get there. And, to a certain extent, using global warming levels bypasses the need to select or weight CMIP6 models. Each model has something to offer at a given temperature, so the full CMIP6 ensemble can be used. The IPCC Working Group I Interactive Atlas is a good tool for calculating multi-model means at a particular level of global warming (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch\">https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch</url>).</p><p>G20\u2019s US$14-trillion economic stimulus reneges on emissions pledges</p><p>Global warming levels force a simple question: when will the world reach a given level of warming? The answer, of course, is that it\u2019s up to us. Reporting that severe risks and catastrophic outcomes are projected to occur at a particular time can give a false sense of inevitability and obscure the role of human choice in determining the future. In situations for which policymakers require information on timing, we suggest using AR6 assessed warming to map projections for global warming levels onto emissions scenarios, ensuring consistency between regional studies and AR6.</p><p>Second, if the warming trajectory \u2014 rather than just the global warming level \u2014 is important for a particular climate outcome, focus on the subset of CMIP6 models that is most consistent with AR6 assessed-warming projections. We recommend screening out models with a TCR that lies outside the \u2018likely\u2019 (66% likelihood range) of 1.4\u20132.2 \u00b0C. The AR6 assessed-warming constraints are correlated with the TCR, so this gives a good approximation to the assessed warming4. This approach allows for an assessment of regional changes over time. Alternatively, using a \u2018likely\u2019 2.5\u20134 \u00b0C ECS screen also reproduces AR6 results well, although at the expense of discarding 60% of the models in the CMIP6 ensemble, compared with 40% in the TCR screened subset.</p><p>Third, pick models that are best suited to the task at hand. The problem is not that high sensitivity models exist, but rather that the preponderance of them in the CMIP6 ensemble biases the mean and uncertainty range upwards. If there is a real need to examine \u2018hot tail\u2019 risks \u2014 because there is still a more than 5% chance of ECS exceeding 5 \u00b0C8 \u2014 use a high-sensitivity subset. Ask whether changes in average conditions or extreme events in the region of interest scale with the global mean temperature. In cases in which model spread is not clearly related to the spread in climate sensitivity, alternative metrics might be appropriate.</p><p>Using the latest generation of models in a way that is consistent with AR6 requires both an awareness of the problem, and easy-to-use alternatives such as those we highlight here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Content</emphasis></p><p>G20\u2019s US$14-trillion economic stimulus reneges on emissions pledges</p><p>Survey of gender bias in the IPCC</p><p>Cement and steel \u2014 nine steps to net zero</p><p>Microsoft\u2019s million-tonne CO2-removal purchase \u2014 lessons for net zero</p><p>Climate policy models need to get real about people \u2014 here\u2019s how</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Eyring, V.. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Geosci.

Welcome to China Tower's 2022 Interim Results Announcement. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conduct the event by means of conference call. Thank you for your continued support to Chinese Tower. It's our pleasure to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now I would also like to introduce the management attending today's results briefing: our Executive Director and General Manager, Mr. Gu Xiaomin; Executive Director, Mr. Gao Chunlei; Chief Accounting, Mr. Hu Shaofeng; and our Deputy General Manager, Mr. Liu Guofeng.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today's results briefing covers 3 parts. First, I will briefly explain our overall performance for the first 6 months of 2022. And Mr. Gu Xiaomin and Mr. Hu Shaofeng will introduce the operational and financial performance, respectively. At the end, we will have a Q&amp;A session.</p><p>In the first half of 2022, the company seized the opportunities emerging from the development of 5G infrastructure, the Digital China initiative and the progress being made towards China's dual carbon goals. We kept promoting resource sharing and focusing on ways to drive development through innovation. Therefore, we maintained stable growth on our overall performance.</p><p>The company maintained an encouraging growth momentum and achieved healthy revenue growth of 6.6% over last year to RMB 45,480 million. Net profit up 22.2% year-on-year to RMB 4,220 million, showing a further enhancement on profitability. Operating cash flow was stable and abundant, reaching RMB 31,310 million, a year-on-year increase of 29.2%. In addition, site co-location rate steadily increased with tenancy ratio of 1.72 tenants per site, representing a year-on-year increase of 2.4%.</p><p>The following aspects are the main reasons for the stable and favorable operating performance. The company maintained its strategic strength and promoted the sustainable development of One Core and Two Wings strategy by adhering to growth by sharing its philosophy. Our TSP business continued to grow steadily. In the first half, its revenue increased by 3.9% year-on-year to RMB 41,350 million, accounting for 90.9% of the overall revenue. This has further consolidated the value foundation for the company's steady development.</p><p>The Two Wings business achieved a good development momentum and recorded revenue of RMB 4,010 million, up 46.5% year-on-year, accounting for 8.8% of our overall revenue, which kept on increasing and was 2.4 percentage points more than the same period last year and 1.7 percentage points more than the end of 2021. Two Wings business has become more prominent on driving the company's revenue growth.</p><p>In the first half of 2022, 5G network deployments continue to expedite. The company fully leveraged its expertise in operations and service capabilities to satisfy network coverage demand of TSPs and contributed to the large-scale 5G network deployments in an efficient manner. As of the end of June 2022, the company undertook a total of 1.544 million 5G construction demand with more than 97% of them satisfied by sharing existing site resources. We provided strong support for the construction of cyberpower and the Digital China initiative.</p><p>In the first half of this year, the share of incremental revenue from 5G service over TSP business reached 84%, an increase of 20 percentage points from the same period last year, while the growth upon the second half of last year being 10 percentage points. 5G is gradually becoming the main driving force for TSP business.</p><p>For the Smart Tower business, the company seized the valuable opportunities brought by the in-depth advancement of social digital governance, further increased investment in R&amp;D and continuously improved platform operation capabilities. We continue to improve the industrial product applications and build a companion service system by understanding the demand and perception of customers. At the same time, we strengthened the industry cooperation and carried health strategic partnership to preliminarily build digital tower and industrial ecosystem.</p><p>The development capabilities of Smart Tower business have been further improved. In the first half, the Smart Tower business recorded an accelerated growth and generated revenue of RMB 2,580 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 39.4% and a rapid increase of 4.2 percentage points compared to the full year of 2021.</p><p>Regarding the Energy business, the company sees the development opportunity arising from the dual carbon goals based on its own unique resource advantages. The company focused on battery exchange and power backup businesses. It increased R&amp;D investment and technical cooperation to promote product optimization and iterative upgrade. The company built an intelligent energy operation platform to promote digital transformation of the business. We also constructed a strong intelligent service system to achieve precise control and systematic management of service quality that continuously enhance the growth momentum of the Energy business.</p><p>In the first half, the scale of the Energy business continued to expand, and the revenue from Energy business reached RMB 1,430 million, a year-on-year increase of 61.3%. Through promoting reform and innovation, the company's core strengths have been further consolidated.</p><p>Enhanced asset operation management standard. The company assets are multifaceted and wide-ranging. By applying one code through the whole asset life cycle and realizing dynamic monitoring of asset operation status and operation capability, the value management of assets throughout the life cycle was promoted. Through carrying out intelligent operation and maintenance, implementing business accounting on individual site as well as accurate positioning, maintenance and augmentation, asset life extension and operational efficiency improvement were achieved.</p><p>Strengthened capabilities in addressing key issues through technological innovation. We formulated specialized plans for technological innovation, established 3 key labs for new energy, communication construction and AI as well as further increased R&amp;D investment so as to support the technological transformation of the company.</p><p>Promoted the development of digital transformation. Leveraging the self-developed unified operation and maintenance monitoring system to support a holistic business operation, the company has the national unified Tower Monitoring platform and the largest energy sharing platform across the society, which effectively supported the development of Two Wings business.</p><p>Deepened the mechanism reform. We have stimulated the vitality of the company through deepening the tenure-based contractual management and implementing specialized cultivation and retention schemes for talents. The company also promoted Double Hundred Action to speed up reform of the system and mechanism of subsidiaries.</p><p>In 2022, national strategies such as 5G infrastructure, digital economy and dual carbon goals have brought forward space for the development of the company. For example, with the deeper and wider 5G network deployments, the increasing construction demand further promoted the sustainable steady growth of the company's TSP business.</p><p>Moreover, rapid development of the digital economy was highly compatible with the company's unique resource endowment, bringing great opportunities for speeding up the upgrade from telecom towers to digital towers. Meanwhile, the accelerated promotion of dual carbon goals, the transformation into green and low carbon production and people's livelihood and the growing trend of electrification of transportation, all these positive factors also bring long-term benefits for the company to expand its new energy application services.</p><p>Looking forward, the company will further promote the One Core and Two Wings strategy, adhering to its positioning of becoming a service provider in 3 businesses. The company will promote to build an operating system that is professional, intensive, delicate, efficient and digitalized as well as develop the enterprise centering around sharing, service, innovation, technology and value creation through deepening reform and innovation as well as strengthening advantages. While consolidating the dominant TSP business, the company will further stimulate and scale up the growth of the Two Wings business. It will continue to enhance profitability and create greater value for its shareholders, customers and society.</p><p>Now I would like to hand over to our General Manager, Mr. Gu Xiaomin.

Profitability continued to increase, and further improvement on cash flow was achieved.</p><p>In terms of cost management, based on the business accounting on individual site system and digitalized operation capabilities, the company managed and controlled the production cost in a reasonable manner. In the first half, the operating expenses increased by 5.7% year-on-year to RMB 38,390 million. And the operating expenses to revenue ratio dropped from 85.1% to 84.4%.</p><p>Depreciation and amortization increased by 0.2% year-on-year to RMB 24,870 million, mainly due to the decrease in the company's newly added assets as our existing assets became more durable with extended life cycle and the changes on structure of 5G construction demand.</p><p>To strengthen the development of asset operation capabilities, the company fully tapped the potential of assets, improved asset performance to ensure business expansion and service improvement. The maintenance expense is up 20.5% year-on-year to RMB 3,490 million. Site operations and supporting expense is up 7.0% year-on-year to RMB 2,510 million, mainly due to year-on-year increase of RMB 200 million in site operation-related expenses on IT supporting services and site planning and management.</p><p>Other operating expenses increased by 40.1% year-on-year to RMB 3,750 million. It was mainly driven by the rapid growth of Two Wings business, leading to an increase in business development costs such as technology supporting service fees, marketing expenses and business operation energy consumption, which amounted to RMB 720 million.</p><p>Benefiting from the enhancement in centralized fund management and multichannel low-cost fund raising, the company's interest-bearing liabilities decreased year-on-year, and its overall financing costs remained at a relatively low level. The company's net finance costs for the first half of the year down by 14.0% year-on-year to RMB 1,600 million.</p><p>The company's profitability improved consistently on the back of stable growth in operating income and effective cost management. In the first half, operating profit increased by 11.6% year-on-year to RMB 7,090 million. Operating profit margin increased by 0.7 percentage points year-on-year, and EBITDA rose by 2.5% year-on-year to RMB 31,960 million. The net profit grew by 22.2% year-on-year to RMB 4,220 million. Net profit margin increased to 9.3%, representing a year-on-year growth of 1.2 percentage points.</p><p>With regards to CapEx, we strengthened the effective allocation of investment with the adherence to the principle of matching investment with business and capability development. In the first half of the year, CapEx was RMB 9,090 million, down by 12.3% year-on-year. It is primarily attributable to the increased proportion of 5G construction demand under TSP business, satisfied by augmentation of existing resources, leading to a decrease in average construction cost.</p><p>In addition, due to the shortage of materials and certain restriction at construction sites in some areas, the CapEx for our new site construction and existing site augmentation decreased by 21.7% year-on-year. Moreover, the company continued to focus on improving the long-term service capability of assets and orderly meeting the needs of both business development and asset life extension.</p><p>During the first half, the proportion of CapEx in asset replacement and improvement increased by 9.9 percentage points year-on-year. In the second half, as the epidemic is being controlled with increased construction and handover of TSP business orders, more confirmed Smart Tower business contracts as well as accelerated investment and capacity expansion for battery exchange and charging businesses, the company will strive to accomplish the full year CapEx plan.</p><p>In the first half of the year, benefited by the decrease in CapEx, increased VAT credit refunds and steady growth in profitability, our cash flow remained stable with operating cash flow of RMB 31,310 million and free cash flow of RMB 22,220 million, a year-on-year increase of 29.2% and 60.1%, respectively.</p><p>As of 30th June 2022, the liabilities to asset ratio of the company was 39.7%, a decrease of 1.7 percentage points over the end of last year. The gearing ratio was 31.1%. The company maintained a stable capital structure.</p><p>Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we will capture growth opportunities, focusing on the development of an operation system that is professional, intensive, delicate, efficient and digitalized. We will also strengthen investment and cost management, promote the continuous improvement of efficiency and effectiveness, accelerate the sustainable and healthy growth of the company and create greater value for shareholders.

After all, they were just doing his bidding. He had whipped them into a frenzy with a 90-minute rant which promised that a \"rigged\" election would be reversed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And after the besieged Capitol was under lockdown, with legislators huddled under desks, shots fired, and GOP leaders begging Trump to halt the insurrectionists, he released a video that only fueled the fire. \"We had an election that was stolen from us,\" Trump said. \"But you have to go home now. ... We love you. ... I know how you feel.\"</p><p>If anyone doubted the president was committing sedition, those doubts should be over. Donald J. Trump is undermining the national security of our country. He should be forced to resign.</p><p>Because let's be clear here: The president incited this unprecedented attack. Asking him politely to stop it is like asking an arsonist to put out a massive forest fire he deliberately set, match by match.</p><p>Trump has been insisting for months that any election he lost would be rigged. On Wednesday, as legislators gathered in the Capitol, he fired up his followers on the National Mall by repeating his whole catalog of total falsehoods about fraud in swing states - lies that have been rebuffed over and over by recounts, state and federal courts, the Supreme Court, and state voting officials.</p><p>\"We won in a landslide,\" he told the mass assembled, insisting, \"We will never give up.\" Hint, hint. And they listened intently.</p><p>Trump promised that Vice President Mike Pence would refuse to certify the electoral votes at the joint session on Wednesday (where too many GOP legislators were ready to challenge certification in swing states - from fear of the president).</p><p>But Pence issued a statement Wednesday saying he had no constitutional power to reverse the election. No wonder Trump's deluded followers were enraged.</p><p>It was just this kind of unhinged Trump behavior that impelled all 10 living U.S. secretaries of defense to issue a statement Sunday that the uniformed military must not be used to determine an election. I was told by one of the organizers that they feared the president might provoke violence, then use the Insurrection Act to call up uniformed troops to try to retain power.</p><p>Washington, D.C.'s mayor has now had to call for the National Guard. But who knows what military fantasies Trump might entertain in the coming days.</p><p>Many GOP legislators have yet to grasp reality and are totally complicit in Trump's sedition.</p><p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News nervously, as the invaders attacked the Capitol, \"This is not the American way.\" So what did he think he was doing when he encouraged fellow GOP House members to challenge states' certification - reinforcing the delusion that Trump had won?</p><p>McCarthy told Fox he phoned Trump and urged him to make a statement. Instead, Trump encouraged further violence. Defending the insurrectionists, he tweeted: \"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away.\" Twitter locked his account for 12 hours for appearing to incite violence.</p><p>The damage done is not just to our democratic system at home, but to our country's reputation abroad.</p><p>\"It is disgraceful that Trump has induced this and hasn't called on the [demonstrators] to disband,\" says Stanford University's Larry Diamond, one of the country's top experts on democratic systems. \"It makes us look like a banana republic.\"</p><p>\"These images will be conveyed around the world,\" says Diamond. \"They are doing extreme damage to the reputation of U.S. democracy. You can imagine what Russia and China will do with this.</p><p>\"It was already a gift to autocrats around the world, to see Trump and a large percentage of Congress reject the election results. This damages the image of democracy as a system, not just American democracy. It will take a long time to recover from this.\"</p><p>Yet, there is something Congress can do to start repairing the damage. GOP legislators can stop participating in Trump's continuing campaign to brainwash his base into believing the election, and Joe Biden's presidency, are illegitimate. They can join a bipartisan delegation to demand that Trump publicly concede defeat and demand that his followers stand down - or else step down immediately.</p><p>As Biden put it to Trump Wednesday: Go on national television \"to defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege. ... It's not protest. It's insurrection.\"</p><p>If Trump won't concede defeat to his base and denounce the rioters, it's time for Pence and Congress to invoke the 25th Amendment. This is clearly a sick, if not deranged, president, who can do far more damage to our democracy if he is not blocked. If, after today's tragedy, GOP leaders are too cowardly to act, they will go down in history as wholly complicit in his crimes. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:trubin@inquirer.com\">trubin@inquirer.com</email> trudyrubin</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20210107Ar01905</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61PM-5W21-JC3R-B2JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 7, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGU</classCode><className>2021 US CAPITOL RIOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp;

A new report from the National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric Administration warns that the U.S. coastline will see up to a foot of sea level rise by 2050 due to climate change.</p><p>Meanwhile, more extreme weather events, such as more powerful tornadoes and hurricanes, loom. Wildfires are more common and more intense. Droughts are spreading further and lasting longer.</p><p>Now some Great Lakes communities are pondering and planning what to do to accommodate a potential influx of climigrants and to improve their own resiliency to the adverse impacts of a changing climate.</p><p>\"We shouldn't be afraid of climate migration, but we definitely need to prepare better for it,\" said Conan Smith, president and CEO of the Michigan Environmental Council.</p><p>Smith notes that Michigan has lost hundreds of thousands of residents since the mid-2000s and has existing infrastructure that can accommodate new arrivals. At the same time, some of that infrastructure needs repair and modernization so people can trust the purity of their drinking water and maximize water efficiency, Smith said.</p><p>There are other questions for policymakers and business leaders about planning for an economic future with new arrivals, said Mike Foley, director of the sustainability department in Cuyahoga County along the banks of Lake Erie in Ohio.</p><p>\"There's going to be migration happening,\" Foley said. \"If people are coming, and I think the theory is right, there will be a gradual and more-than-gradual migration into or back into the Midwest. We want those people to have a job when they come.\"</p><p>ESCAPING CALAMITIES</p><p>Many climigrants to the Great Lakes region would most likely come from Eastern and Southern coastal areas, from the drought-stricken Southwest and West, and from wildfire-vulnerable parts of California and the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Some will leave ahead of disaster with enough resources to resettle comfortably.</p><p>That was the case of the Parrishes, both of whom have good-paying jobs in information technology that can be done anywhere there's a high-speed internet connection.</p><p>Andrew Parrish, who grew up in Atlanta, arrived in Boise in 1997 after graduating from Hillsdale College in Michigan. He was drawn by Boise's greenbelt in the bucolic foothills of the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>But over time, Boise saw an influx of residents, causing housing prices to soar and streets to become more congested while temperatures started rising over time.</p><p>Parrish calls this the \"frog in the boiling pot of water\" for Boise. Last summer, the pot boiled over with 30 days of temperatures over 100 degrees. Parrish is a runner and, starting in 2013, regularly checked Boise's air quality index before venturing outside.</p><p>\"You're willing to forgive some things, but the final straw for me was that brutal summer,\" Parrish said. \"It became clear to me that this confluence of factors-the smoke and the heat and the wildfires-is not going to go anywhere anytime soon.\"</p><p>Fearful of water restrictions in drought-stricken Boise, Parrish and his wife made access to fresh water a top priority in deciding where to migrate to.</p><p>\"Boise is a wonderful place, but we came to determine there might be an even better place,\" he said. \"What bigger lake is there than Superior?\"</p><p>'THERE'S WATER EVERYWHERE'</p><p>Other climigrants may be devastated financially when their homes or businesses are destroyed and they lack flood or other insurance, raising social justice questions for the communities they might move to.</p><p>For some climate migrants, the region's draw will be the opportunity to live, work, create and play on the freshwater seas while abandoning flooding saltwater coastal areas along the Atlantic and Gulf shorelines. For some, the pull may be family ties or alumni memories.</p><p>For Rodney Puttock, water-a shortage of it-was the prime motivation to leave Las Vegas where he grew up and relocate to Holly, a village between Detroit and Flint that is still rooted in its agricultural history.</p><p>\"It's a big issue in Las Vegas, the place of my childhood,\" said the 44-year-old Puttock, who makes voiceovers for television and radio commercials and does veteran coordinator work for the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars.</p><p>At the time Puttock and his wife moved to Michigan in mid-2021, the two reservoirs that supply Las Vegas were abnormally low. Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the U.S., was filled to only 35% of capacity. It's since dropped to a record low 31% in March of this year, while Lake Powell is at less than one-fourth of its capacity.</p><p>But in Michigan, \"there's water everywhere,\" Puttock said.</p><p>Puttock was amazed when he could purchase fresh produce along rural Michigan roadways.</p><p>\"You can't find that where I'm from,\" he said.</p><p>For other climate migrants, the magnet may be the perceived solidity and serenity of place, or the lower cost of living than where they came from or the ability to work remotely or the security of being comparatively better-sheltered from the vicissitudes of unpredictable weather and climate.</p><p>Five cities in the Great Lakes region appear among the 10 most affordable places to live in the country on the 2022-23 U.S. News &amp; World Report roster: Green Bay ranked second, Fort Wayne fifth, Pittsburgh sixth, Peoria ninth and Youngstown 10th. Grand Rapids, South Bend, Kalamazoo and Cincinnati are among the top 25.</p><p>Beth Gibbons, executive director of the American Society of Adaptation Professionals, which is based in Ypsilanti, Mich., near Detroit, said her research shows the Great Lakes are not yet a unique factor in current migration to the region.</p><p>\"What we know about migration is that people move first and foremost based on their kith and kin relationships,\" she said. \"They go to places where they expect to find community and relationships.\"</p><p>A few communities in the region, including Buffalo and Duluth, have been pegged as possible climate havens but don't talk that way about themselves, Gibbons said.</p><p>\"The cities are not rejecting that narrative, but they're not putting programs and processes in place to activate that in terms of recruitment or receiving people,\" Gibbons said.</p><p>In general, there's been little recruitment of prospective climate migrants to the Great Lakes, but Remote Workforce Keweenaw is trying to lure some of them to the northwestern Upper Peninsula, where the Parrishes settled in Houghton. The group describes itself on Facebook as \"a portal for those wanting to explore locating their remote work careers in an awesome place with more affordable housing, ubiquitous natural beauty, no congestion and lower crime.\"</p><p>Housing prices are rising fast in some flood-prone areas like Florida and drought-prone areas like Arizona. TitleMax reports that some communities with the fastest-rising house prices are in coastal cities such as Nantucket, Mass., Amagansett, N.Y., and Santa Monica, Calif. Another is Bal Harbor, Fla., just 15 miles north of Miami, where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is considering whether to build a 6-mile, $6 billion sea wall up to 20 feet tall to safeguard Miami from storm surge damage.</p><p>While northern parts of the world, including the northern U.S. and Canada, are expected to remain livable the longest, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that they'll continue to be affected by extreme weather events-although less harshly than southern parts of the globe.</p><p>MIGRATION SPURS NEW CHALLENGES</p><p>Not all climate migrants moving to the Great Lakes area are likely to resettle in the biggest cities. Some will choose smaller communities for reasons of lifestyle, employment and economic opportunities, lower housing costs, quality of public education, less traffic and easier access to the outdoors.</p><p>But how will the region's communities confront difficult questions about available infrastructure, price tags and their own vulnerability to climate disruptions?</p><p>Marquette, the largest city in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, is already seeing new arrivals. City Commissioner Jenn Hill said most climate transplants so far appear to be from California and other Western states beleaguered by wildfires.</p><p>\"It's the smoke,\" she said. \"You just can't live with that smoke.\"</p><p>Hill said a lack of affordable housing is her community's No. 1 problem.</p><p>\"Marquette County housing prices went up more than any other county in Michigan since 2000. You look at our housing situation, and we know people are bidding on homes sight unseen from California and other West Coast areas to be here, or at least to have an investment here.\" Construction costs are high due to the escalating cost of materials and shipping, as well as supply chain disruptions and a shortage of construction workers.</p><p>Climate change and housing are key topics in the master plan review process Marquette is going through now. The city is also looking at its own climate readiness, including the capacity of its stormwater system to handle the volume \"if we get one of those massive rainstorm events,\" Hill said.</p><p>Gary McDowell, director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development, said another major challenge is that some climate migrants, particularly well-to-do ones, will be attracted to rural areas, putting pressure on owners of prime farmland to sell, especially in tourism communities along Lake Michigan.</p><p>Even now, workers in parts of northern Michigan's vacationland hospitality and service industries find it impossible to find affordable housing near their jobs. That situation could well worsen as climate migrants seek jobs locally, including seasonal positions on farms and orchards, and in what McDowell foresees as a burgeoning food processing industry in the state.</p><p>Another challenge for rural areas wanting to accommodate an influx of climate migrants is a need for high-speed internet. The pandemic provided a wakeup call about major gaps in rural broadband service as people found themselves forced to work from home and as schools closed and moved instruction online.</p><p>\"It showed we had been kind of left behind. So many people had poor-to-no broadband,\" said McDowell, who has spotty service at his own Upper Peninsula farm and even had connection problems in a telemeeting with the governor.</p><p>The availability of underused water infrastructure and ample fresh water will be a significant magnet for water-intensive manufacturers and other companies. So will a reliable electric grid.</p><p>\"We're not rooting for climate change, but we are a region that has suffered economically and lost population,\" said Foley, the sustainability director in Cuyahoga County. \"We want to be ready for it and mitigate the damage from weather.\"</p><p>Officials are looking at infill housing opportunities in the Cleveland suburbs, said Mary Cierebiej, executive director of the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission.</p><p>\"Now is the time to fill in the missing teeth. How can we be competitive unless we're bringing in housing?\" she asks.</p><p>In the Chicago area, the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus has adopted one of the country's first regional climate plans to promote measures to bolster resiliency and better protect residents from \"high-priority\" climate hazards, such as heat, flooding, drought and threats to the water supply.</p><p>While the member municipalities aren't marketing themselves to prospective climate migrants at this point, \"we recognize there is likely to be a coastal migration inland over the next 50 to 100 years,\" said Geneva Mayor Kevin Burns, who chairs the organization's environment committee.</p><p>Burns' city, west of Chicago, is taking steps to bolster its resiliency, including designation of hundreds of acres to remain open space forever, increasing its use of renewable energy, electrifying its vehicle fleet and working with manufacturers to \"tighten the (energy) efficiency of their operations\" and buildings.</p><p>\"Everyone can agree that what was once the 100-year flood is now every five years,\" Burns said. \"Whether they attribute it to climate change or not, people want that resolved.\"</p><p>PLANNING FOR FUTURE DEMAND</p><p>Affordable housing isn't the only challenge.</p><p>Parts of the Great Lakes region already struggle to remedy their existing climate-related vulnerabilities, and that reduces their ability to plan for future ones.</p><p>Detroit neighborhoods, its suburbs and metro-area roadways have confronted-and failed to prevent-massive flooding and sewage problems for years. In Chicago, even modest rain can overwhelm the combined sewer system, leading to sewage backups and flooding, as well as opening the floodgates to let some of the overflow enter rivers and Lake Michigan.</p><p>In both cities, environmental problems disproportionately affect low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.</p><p>Overall, communities are poorly prepared for the public health consequences of climate migration within the United States, according to a 2021 study by Columbia University researcher Nika Sabasteanski. The study predicts \"huge challenges because of the American health system's unique, pre-existing weaknesses\" and urges federal, state, local and tribal governments to adopt a universal health care policy that shifts primary care away from physicians and toward other professionals.</p><p>Meanwhile, work continues on Chicago's multibillion-dollar \"Deep Tunnel\"-more formally the Tunnel &amp; Reservoir Project-intended to store over 20 billion gallons of water.</p><p>As part of regional resiliency work in southeast Michigan, the Great Lakes Water Authority is developing \"additional operational strategies for larger rain events\" to lower the odds of basement backups that have become more frequent.</p><p>In Grand Rapids, Mich., sustainability and performance management officer Alison Sutter said she believes climate migration \"will drive people to the greater Grand Rapids area.\"</p><p>Michigan's second-largest city is creating its first climate action and adaptation plan, which will address climate migration, and is developing its next 20-year community master plan, Sutter said.</p><p>\"This will be something we will raise for discussion,\" she said.</p><p>In some ways, planning is the easy part politically and financially, according to Gibbons of the American Society of Adaptation Professionals.</p><p>Gibbons lists the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., and Ann Arbor, Marquette and Ypsilanti in Michigan among communities doing good planning, a process she said must include social justice considerations.</p><p>While Gibbons sees a \"public will and often a political will\" to plan for climate change, she cautions that use of a climate plan \"is pretty minimal without a willingness to invest in the recommendations of that plan.\"</p><p>Thus it's a battle to find the political will to invest in climate resiliency projects, usually infrastructure.</p><p>\"It's a really good idea for communities, for the state and the whole region to think about how we attract people and who we want to have in place to receive different kinds of migrants,\" Gibbons said. \"What is the culture when people arrive here?\"</p><p>THE RELIEF OF HIGHER GROUND</p><p>Emily Tobin-LaVoy said she wouldn't have considered a 2019 move to Marquette with her future husband were it not for increasingly frequent floods in New Orleans, one of which rose 5 feet in her neighborhood.</p><p>\"It totaled my car, which I couldn't afford to replace at the time, and scared me a lot,\" said Tobin-LaVoy, a colorist for an animated web series. \"It's really a disaster. I was getting tired of living one day to the next wondering if my house would be OK or if I'd have to climb on my roof to get away from the floodwater.\"</p><p>As for water, she now lives about two blocks from Lake Superior.</p><p>\"I don't have to worry about flooding here,\" Tobin-LaVoy said.</p><p>Eric Freedman is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and director of the Knight Center for Environmental Journalism at Michigan State University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIBUS-5350436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIBUS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65TK-PXC1-DYFH-V0SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8099</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Crain Communication All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crain's Chicago Business</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23760\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 45</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 27, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Business &amp;

View the full release here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210908005554/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210908005554/en/</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scheduled for launch beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the constellation will enable Kin\u00e9is, a company backed by private and public investors including the French government's space agency CNES (Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites) an international space-based solutions provider, to improve its global IoT connectivity. The multi-launch contract with Kin\u00e9is, which is subject to standard termination and launch rescheduling provisions, follows a similar bulk buy of launches earlier this year to deploy nine satellites across five dedicated Electron missions as part of a constellation for BlackSky, a provider of real-time geospatial intelligence and global monitoring services.</p><p>Kin\u00e9is CEO, Alexandre Tisserant, says: \"We are glad to entrust our constellation of 25 satellites to Rocket Lab. They are the leaders in small satellite launch and the obvious choice as launch partner to activate our constellation at such a pace. We designed and developed our 25 satellites in record time with the support of CNES, Thal\u00e8s Al\u00e9nia Space and HEMERIA in order to deliver a full new operational service to our existing and future customers - we are now eagerly counting down to first launch in 2023!\"</p><p>The proven accuracy and reliability of Electron's Kick Stage in successfully deploying 100+ satellites to date was a decisive factor in Kin\u00e9is selecting Rocket Lab as its launch partner. The Kick Stage will act as an orbital transfer vehicle to deliver each satellite in the Kin\u00e9is constellation to their precise orbital planes at a 650km altitude, allowing Kin\u00e9is to avoid sacrificing spacecraft mass for propulsion and to begin a fully operational service as quickly as possible.</p><p>Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck, says: \"We're thrilled to be Kin\u00e9is' launch partner and look forward to delivering their constellation across five dedicated missions in quick succession. Deploying an entire constellation and having it operational quickly requires each satellite to be deployed to exactly the right orbit. Rocket Lab's track record of exceptional orbital deployment accuracy provides Kin\u00e9is with that assurance. By taking care of in-space transport, the Kick Stage makes life much easier for satellite constellation operators, enabling them to maximize spacecraft mass for their payload.\"</p><p>Kin\u00e9is currently operates the Argos system, an international scientific collaboration between CNES, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), to monitor wildlife, fisheries, and to collect data about Earth's climate and environment through CLS. Kin\u00e9is' new constellation will complete the current system with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology and a ship-tracking Automatic Identification System (AIS). Once deployed, this technology will allow Kin\u00e9is to expand across multiple industries and scale from 20,000 devices connected to millions.</p><p>In addition to these missions, Rocket Lab will further contribute to the international Argos system with another upcoming Electron launch. Rocket Lab is the launch provider for the Argos-4 mission for General Atomics, which is developing the satellite for the United States Space Force on behalf of NOAA. That mission is currently scheduled to launch early 2022.</p><p>+ Images &amp; Video Content<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketlabusa.com%2Fabout-us%2Fupdates%2Flink-to-rocket-lab-imagery-and-video%2F&amp;esheet=52487892&amp;newsitemid=20210908005554&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.rocketlabusa.com%2Fabout-us%2Fupdates%2Flink-to-rocket-lab-imagery-and-video%2F&amp;index=1&amp;md5=73f5b229d7899609052a46b77742f2b5\">www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/link-to-rocket-lab-imagery-and-video/</url></p><p>About Rocket Lab:</p><p>Rocket Lab is a global leader in space, building rockets and spacecraft that make it easier to get to orbit and to do amazing things there.

File photo by Cate Chant/VTDigger <br/><br/> More than half of Vermont is in a state of drought, with dry conditions that date back at least to June 2020. </p><p><br/><br/>The persistence of the dry conditions has prompted reactivation of the Vermont drought task force, which held its first meeting Thursday to discuss ways to deal with a drought that has persisted for more than a year[1]. <br/><br/>Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux, state climatologist and co-chair of the task force, requested the reactivation last week. The group \u2014 which includes local, regional and national experts \u2014 focused mostly on information-sharing on Thursday and getting up to speed on conditions and impacts throughout the state. <br/><br/>The task force is taking a broad approach to ensure it is not overlooking impacts in a particular area, Dupigny-Giroux said. <br/><br/>The drought began about 13 months ago, Dupigny-Giroux said, and 'because it's persisted for that period of time, we're seeing the progression of the various ways that we can see drought impacts.' <br/><br/>Meteorological signs such as declines in rainfall are apparent at the start of droughts, she said, and as they persist for weeks or months, impacts on vegetation and dryness in the upper levels of the soil will crop up. <br/><br/>And when droughts stretch from months into years, 'then you start seeing the hydrologic impacts,' Dupigny-Giroux said \u2014 the water table drops, shallow wells can run dry, and the forest fire danger escalates. <br/><br/> Where is the drought? <br/><br/> Just over 57% of Vermont is experiencing moderate drought conditions, and most of the state is abnormally dry, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System monitor[2]. Few parts of the country are registering drought conditions in the 'exceptional' and 'extreme' categories on the monitor, and none of them are in the Northeast. <br/><br/>Erica Bornemann, director of Vermont Emergency Management, is the other chair of the drought task force. She said there are a range of actions the state could take if the drought in Vermont became more severe, but things are not at that point. <br/><br/>'We're not, you know, anywhere near a situation where we would expect to see significant impacts at the local level,' she said. <br/><br/>While the drought is largely hitting northern Vermont right now, it was more prevalent in the southern part of the state last year, according to Robert Haynes, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Burlington. <br/><br/>Part of the reversal relates to where storms end up tracking, Haynes said. Southern Vermont had a significant mid-December snowstorm last winter, he said, while the northern part of the state did not. Snowfall totals can have a significant impact on drought. <br/><br/>'If we lack a good seasonal snowpack from before, if we don't have enough contribution from snowmelt, that lack of snow in winter can kind of translate into summer as well, where a dry summer can compound with a dry winter to allow for those drought conditions,' he said. <br/><br/> Hydrologic impacts <br/><br/>Vermont is seeing severe hydrological drought, according to Dupigny-Giroux. The impact includes low water levels in lakes, streams and other bodies of water \u2014 affecting recreation, fishing and even the prevalence of blue-green algae[3]. <br/><br/>Scientists have seen hydrologic impacts throughout the winter and into this summer. <br/><br/>'It's getting to the point where we need to sort of raise the level of awareness around that, around what are sort of things that could be coming down the pike, and some of the human health aspects that could be coming,' she said. <br/><br/>It has also meant a drop in the levels of underground water, the source of much of Vermont's drinking water. <br/><br/>Staff at the national and state geological surveys say one result can be a higher concentration of metals in the water, Dupigny-Giroux said. The task force discussed five types of chemicals and metals \u2014 uranium, iron, sulfur, arsenic and manganese \u2014 that can become a concern during an extended drought, she said. <br/><br/>The task force will discuss the topic in more depth at a later meeting, Dupigny-Giroux said, but is already paying close attention to it. The task force also hopes to raise public awareness about what might happen to the water. <br/><br/>'Some folks know that their well tends to have whatever concentration of uranium or arsenic,' she said. 'It's by way of public awareness of information that we learn more, that we get more and more samples.' <br/><br/> Shortfalls and record lows <br/><br/> Task force members are seeing record-low values for wells, streamflow and groundwater flow, Dupigny-Giroux said. And given that the U.S. Geological survey has monitored the conditions in some of these areas for decades, 'seeing record low values is of concern,' she said. <br/><br/>'I think that's one of the things that was sort of like the impetus to get back together \u2014 to actually quantify that, to create that coordinated messaging and to get the proactive strategies in place,' she said. <br/><br/>Lake Champlain's water levels are below normal for this time of year, Dupigny-Giroux said. A National Weather Service graph of the lake level[4] over the past 60 days showed a level of 94.74 feet Thursday. Another National Weather Service graph[5] showed an average level of nearly 96 feet in mid-July. <br/><br/>Rainfall has also been scant, Dupigny-Giroux said. The northeastern part of Vermont is facing a shortfall of 9.5 inches and the western portion is 7.61 inches short, she said Thursday. But last week, the northeastern part of the state was in a shortfall of 9.25 inches, and the western part 8.05 inches, she said. <br/><br/>Improvements in some areas of the state but not others demonstrate part of the reason it's so hard to determine what it will take \u2014 in terms of precipitation and time \u2014 for Vermont to get out of drought conditions, Dupigny-Giroux said. <br/><br/>Another factor is that, in the middle of the summer, rainfall is in high demand \u2014 for vegetation, and for residential, industrial or commercial purposes. And, with ultra-dry soil, a lot of rain is absorbed as soon as it hits the ground. <br/><br/>As a result, 'it'll take longer for that groundwater and subsurface moisture to recharge itself,' she said. 'It's not as if all that water is going to make its way down through to recharge the aquifers.' <br/><br/>Haynes said winter could ease the drought \u2014 or not. 'If we have another dry winter, then we'll probably not see much improvement,' he said. <br/><br/>How long might the drought last? Dupigny-Giroux can't say. <br/><br/>'It took us a while to get into the particularly severe hydrologic drought that we're in right now,' she said. 'It'll take us a while to get back out.' <br/> Read the story on VTDigger here: 13-month drought, with no end in sight, prompts task force to reassemble[6]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2021/04/18/dry-air-fewer-crops-and-painting-rocks-how-the-drought-is-hitting-vermont/\">https://vtdigger.org/2021/04/18/dry-air-fewer-crops-and-painting-rocks-how-the-drought-is-hitting-vermont/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.drought.gov/states/vermont\">https://www.drought.gov/states/vermont</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/14/burlington-beaches-reopen-after-closure-caused-by-cyanobacteria/\">https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/14/burlington-beaches-reopen-after-closure-caused-by-cyanobacteria/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weather.gov/btv/60daylevel\">https://www.weather.gov/btv/60daylevel</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weather.gov/btv/lakeLevel?year=2020\">https://www.weather.gov/btv/lakeLevel?year=2020</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/16/13-month-drought-with-no-end-in-sight-prompts-task-force-to-reassemble/\">https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/16/13-month-drought-with-no-end-in-sight-prompts-task-force-to-reassemble/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VTDG127906162647315077425879100113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IVNN-127906</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6359-85W1-JCMN-Y08B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484298</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1209\"/><timeReceived>10:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>VTDigger</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 16, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Erica Bornemann</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp; Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Drought</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>drought task force</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DESJ</classCode><className>SEVERE WINTER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D24P</classCode><className>BURLINGTON, VT, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GS161</classCode><className>VERMONT, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The entire exercise of survey of this defence land was completed in association with the Revenue authorities of various State Governments. During the survey, approximately 585 acres of defence land which was previously untraceable has been identified and surveyed. Modern survey technologies like Electronic Total Station, Differential Global Positioning System, drone and satellite imagery based survey were leveraged for this exercise. 3D Modelling techniques for better visualisation of defence land in hilly area was also been introduced by utilising Digital Elevation Model in association with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). As a part of the survey, a project for real time change detection system based on the Time series Satellite imagery for detection of encroachments on defence land was also initiated. The GIS maps, digitized shape files and updated land data will enable MoD to access land data on real-time basis thus reducing delays considerably in taking decision on land optimization, land transfer for infrastructure projects and new land acquisitions. It will also enable Army, Air Force, Navy and DGDE to prevent encroachments.</p><p>Drone Imagery: For the first time, Drone imagery based survey technology was used for survey of lakhs of acres of defence land in Rajasthan.

In view of the difficulties faced in managing large tracts of defence land in the State and demand of residents of Cantonments located in Uttarakhand, MoD will establish an independent office of Defence Estates at Dehradun. The RM also approved establishment of a sub-office at Ranikhet under the administrative jurisdiction of Defence Estates, Dehradun to deal exclusively with 6 districts of Kumaon region of the State.</p><p>AI to detect unauthorised constructions:Centre of Excellence on Satellite and Unmanned Remote Vehicle Initiative (CoE-SURVEI) established by DGDE at NIDEM has developed an Artificial Intelligence-based software which can automatically detect change on ground, including unauthorised constructions and encroachments using Satellite Imagery. The CoE-SURVEI, leverages latest technologies in survey viz. satellite imagery, drone imagery and geo-spatial tools for effective land management and urban planning. The CoE-SURVEI also developed tools for vacant land analysis and 3D imagery analysis of hill cantonments for land management.</p><p>DEFENCE ACCOUNTS DEPARTMENT</p><p>SPARSH: Defence Accounts Department signed an MoU with CSC e-Governance Services India Limited, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) under MeitY to onboard pension services under the digital platform System for Pension Administration Raksha (SPARSH) initiative across more than four lakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) all over the country.

Several important steps were taken to protect the EU budget from fraud in 2019, the report shows. As the EU prepares to mobilise unprecedented sums to tackle the coronavirus crisis and its consequences, the positive results achieved in recent years provide a solid basis to meet future challenges for European and national authorities in their fight against fraud. Ville Itl, Director-General of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), commented:'We must ensure that every single euro of the EU budget is spent for its intended purpose. </p><p>We are well equipped to protect EU taxpayers' money from inefficiencies, irregularities and fraud, but we must do even more to adapt our tools and structures, both at European and national level, to the new situation. The Commission will soon propose new measures to protect the EU budget and the resources invested in the EU's recovery from the coronavirus crisis. OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, will continue to pull its weight. We can rely on OLAF's experience in fighting fraud acquired over the past years and the solid framework of the Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy.' In 2019, detected fraud and related financial amounts declined in comparison with the previous year. 939 fraudulent irregularities were reported, for a financial value of roughly less than half compared to 2018, confirming an overall declining trend over the last five years. Detected non-fraudulent irregularities remained stable but declined in value by 8%, the 2019 PIF report shows.According to the report, Member States continued their efforts to strengthen their national systems and procedures, focusing on prevention and detection, but also on measures to enhance transparency, and to fight corruption and conflict of interest. EU institutions continued to counter fraud against both EU revenue and expenditure, including through the investigations of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and to improve instruments and policies to protect EU taxpayers' money. Highlights of progress made in 2019 include: The transposition by EU Member States of the Directive on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law (the 'PIF Directive'); The adoption of the Directive on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (the 'Whistleblowing Directive'); The adoption of the new Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy; The appointment of Ms Laura Codru?a K\u00f6vesi as European Chief Prosecutor. At national level, Member States adopted a wide array of measures to improve their capabilities to prevent and detect fraud. Most of the reported measures focus on the management and control of EU funds. As the coronavirus crisis calls for more funding in the years to come, in particular for the health sector, this report also includes an analysis of irregularities in the area of 'investment in health infrastructure'. The Commission will step up its fraud prevention work to ensure that EU money continues to receive the highest possible level of protection against fraudsters who may try to take advantage of the current situation, concludes the report. Likewise, Member States must not lower their guard against the risks highlighted in the report, the text recommends. According to the Report, Romania is the country where the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) concluded the most numerous number of investigations on EU fund embezzlement last year. More than 10% of the total100 files refers to frauds with EU money in our country, according to the 2019 OLAF report. Last year, OLAF investigated how EU funds had been spent in 42 countries, concluding 100 files overall. 11 of them (over one tenth) refer only to European money spent in Romania. At the same time, 9 in those 11 files have been concluded with recommendations from OLAF. Romania is ranked on several chapters regarding EU fund embezzlement: aquaculture farms in areas where there is no water, EU funds for preventing forest fires or funds for the waste water management. Last year, OLAFconcluded 181 investigations, issuing254 recommendationsto the relevant national and EU authorities; The Office recommended therecovery of \u20ac485 millionto the EU budget and223 new investigations. Throughout 2019, OLAF investigations have tackled trade in endangered species and illegal logging and import into the EU of wood and timber, sometimes from protected forests. They have uncovered international trade schemes of illicit biodiesel, fraud against forest fire detection funds, and several cases focusing on water and waste management. One case concluded in 2019 involves faking green credentials in order to obtain EU funding. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ACTM134219159981522374925876100057</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACTM-134219</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TF-KR21-JCMN-Y23C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567483</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><timeReceived>9:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>ACTmedia News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS  REVIEWS &amp;

This landmark legislation spurred the largest reorganization of the US federal government since the National Security Act of 1947, uniting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with 21 other organizations under the newly created Department of Homeland Security (DHS). </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 9/11, the crisis management community has made great strides in addressing the negative impacts of disasters on American lives and livelihoods. Congressional appropriations for disaster response and recovery have increased to historic levels, with FEMA allocating $45 billion between 2017 and 2020 to disaster relief and financial aid. New approaches to recovery and mitigation have emerged, including the development of the National Response Framework and the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program. Federal and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) agencies are more integrated and coordinate more effectively. Indeed, the past two decades have seen significant progress.

It is important to acknowledge the many advancements of the past several years, including improved disaster management structures and higher levels of funding.\u00a0</p><p>DHS has developed and implemented national response structures that have improved and streamlined how local, regional, and national disaster responders serve communities. For instance, it launched the National Incident Management System (NIMS) in 2004 as a preparedness and response management model designed to standardize and unify response operations. Similarly, FEMA was instrumental in the creation of the National Response Framework (NRF), which articulated a set of overarching emergency principles to assist in coordinating multiagency and multijurisdictional responses to disasters. </p><p>FEMA and the federal government have also significantly expanded resources for disaster relief and preparedness. FEMA's public assistance program, for instance, was 23 percent larger during 2010-19 than during the previous decade (2000-09). Between 2017 and 2020, FEMA allocated $45 billion in disaster relief and financial aid to communities across the country, of which about 80 percent had been spent by June 2021. Additionally, since 2002, FEMA has provided more than $52 billion in grants to support state and local preparedness investments.</p><p>However, FEMA is not the only key player in crisis management at the federal level. According to a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts, FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, a key funding source for disaster response and recovery, represented 44 percent of federal disaster funds from 2005 to 2014. The remaining 56 percent was drawn from the budgets of 17 major federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Other agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p><p>These new structures and investments illustrate the US government's progress in responding to disasters over the past two decades. </p><h>The next two decades will likely witness more frequent and worse disasters affecting more people</h><p>The increased spending on disaster relief and preparedness is driven, in part, by a greater awareness of the importance of disaster management since 9/11. But another driver has been the increasing frequency and severity of disasters, as well as increased exposure of individuals and infrastructure to major risks. </p><p>Research suggests that the number of weather- and climate-related disasters, such as hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires, is on the rise. In 2021 alone, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States endured Hurricane Ida, a catastrophic heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, and an extended forest fire season in California. Indeed, billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in the United States increased from two to three per year in the early 1980s to 22 events in 2020. In fact, 2020 broke previous records from 2011 and 2017-but 2020 was not an outlier. The average number of billion-dollar events over the past five years is roughly 16 per year, with each costing an average of $120 billion. </p><p>Similarly, disasters on average have become more severe. According to data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a proxy for hurricane activity, has risen noticeably since the 1950s. And eight of the ten most active years for ACE have occurred since the mid-1990s.</p><p>The same trend can be seen with wildfires. According to data reported by the National Interagency Coordination Center, an average of 70,072 wildfires have burned an average of 7 million acres of territory a year since 2000. This figure is more than double the average annual acreage burned in the 1990s (3.3 million acres).</p><p>At the same time, a rising number of Americans are exposed to disaster harms, exacerbating the impact of these trends. The real estate firm Redfin found that the population of the 50 US counties most prone to heat, drought, fire, floods, and storms grew from 2016 to 2020, while the 50 counties with the lowest risk saw populations decline. Additionally, maps from climate data analysts at First Street Foundation show that 70 percent more buildings in the United States are vulnerable to flood risk than previously thought. And without question, lower-income communities are at greater risk during disasters. Moreover, they receive disproportionately less relief funding than other communities. </p><p>Risks from climate- and weather-related disasters are also amplified by the state of the nation's infrastructure. The population of the United States has more than doubled since the 1960s, when most of the country's major infrastructure was designed, and much of this infrastructure is now reaching the end of its expected lifetime. According to the World Economic Forum, the United States ranked 13th globally for infrastructure quality in 2019, down from fifth in 2002.</p><p>Chronic underinvestment contributes to the country's infrastructure challenges. In its 2021 \"report card\" on American infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that the United States faces an infrastructure investment gap of nearly $2.6 trillion this decade that, if unaddressed, could cost $10 trillion in lost GDP by 2039.</p><p>Gaps in infrastructure spending can have serious ramifications for disaster management. As a National Academy study explains, \"If a community has weakened infrastructure, like a human body with a compromised immune system, it will not withstand trauma as well as one in good health.\" The disaster community can think about how mitigation and preparedness can strengthen national infrastructure so that communities can better respond to the trauma of disasters. </p><h>The disaster management community can answer five questions to help prepare communities for future disasters </h><p>The United States experienced 230 events presidentially recognized as emergencies or disasters in 2020, surpassing the previous high of 128 declarations in 2011. And the country will likely face more frequent and worse disasters over the next 20 years than it faced in the past 20 years. </p><p>To continue to protect people's lives and livelihoods, the crisis management community could reevaluate the roles and responsibilities of major stakeholders, including federal and SLTT organizations, as well as communities, individuals, and private-sector institutions. The community can also consider how best to ensure that all peoples' lives and livelihoods are better protected and preserved with available resources. </p><p>In light of these considerations, the crisis management community can collectively answer five questions to help ensure success over the next two decades. </p><h>Question 1: How can federal and SLTT agencies coordinate and collaborate to spur successful outcomes?</h><p>Disaster management must succeed across a complex stakeholder environment, with some of the most engaged and influential responders being the federal government and state and local agencies. In the United States, government disaster response is coordinated across local, state, and federal agencies through NIMS. Once a federal emergency has been declared, FEMA normally becomes the lead agency coordinating the response, with HUD, the SBA, and numerous other stakeholder agencies also playing key roles, including ensuring equity during long-term recovery. </p><p>The consequences of poor coordination can be serious. FEMA cited lack of coordination as a major failing following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The result was widespread confusion. </p><p>Over the next two decades, the community can improve coordination of crisis management in a few primary ways. </p><p>Clarifying roles can improve coordination and collaboration across federal, state, and local agencies. In the midst of disaster recovery and response, it can be difficult to determine which entity owns a particular task and how best to liaise with other stakeholders. Crisis managers at all levels could take the lead in engaging with policy makers to clarify roles and responsibilities across levels to meet future demands; they could also lead in adjusting existing coordination models where appropriate to ensure that communities are better served during and after disasters. </p><p>Another area in which improved coordination could occur is long-term recovery efforts. The Government Accountability Office has targeted long-term recovery as an area in which coordination challenges are particularly acute, largely due to complex documentation requirements that slow down local partners' efforts. Streamlining requirements and developing better frameworks for long-term recovery coordination could prove a particularly fruitful area for improving efficacy over the next two decades. </p><p>Funding uncertainty is another major variable and friction point. For example, funding from HUD's disaster recovery block grants is contingent on ad hoc congressional appropriations. As a result, crisis managers have limited lead times or visibility into budgets to plan and coordinate their efforts. Policy makers could consider more stable funding models here and elsewhere to facilitate better strategic planning and coordination among partners. </p><p>Finally, with the rise of big data and greater technological proficiency throughout the disaster management community, there could be new ways to leverage technology to assist in response coordination and collaboration. For instance, technology could be used to identify people who are currently missing opportunities for assistance or who are least prepared for a disaster within a community. Such information could help target emergency response and assist in matching resources to those in need. </p><h>Question 2: What role could the private sector play in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery?</h><p>Too often, crisis management is seen as a public-sector endeavor, usually led by FEMA with coordination from state and local agencies and first responders. However, the private sector can serve an important role across all aspects of disaster management, from mitigation and preparedness to response and recovery. </p><p>About 40 percent of all US fixed assets are held by the private sector, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. And according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of January 2022, the private sector employs more than 129 million Americans, representing about 80 percent of the US labor force. Moreover, the private sector can play a pivotal role in formulating disaster-related incentive structures-especially through insurance markets-that influence behaviors and approaches related to risk. Absent engagement from the private sector, the United States will not reach its full potential in terms of resilience. </p><p>Indeed, in the United States, successful approaches to preparedness, recovery, and response have often involved the private sector, and several companies have made significant efforts to highlight the importance of disaster management and assist in recovery efforts. The home improvement retailer Home Depot, for instance, partners with FEMA to offer preparedness workshops, supply checklists, and guides to help people prepare their properties for extreme weather, while Walmart uses its website to promote preparedness among employees and to provide tips on preparedness and other disaster information. Numerous companies have provided significant funding to support disaster relief and recovery. For example, Bank of the West, eBay Foundation, and General Motors are among the major donors to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy's recovery fund. And the private sector has increased its contributions to disaster relief in recent years: the share of disaster relief contributions from the 500 largest US companies increased from less than 20 percent in 1990 to more than 95 percent in 2014.</p><p>However, the private sector could play an even bigger role in disaster management. One action the sector could take is to provide incentives for people to live in areas less exposed to risk. In many cases, resilience investments are more cost-effective than disaster relief and recovery investments. For instance, companies could harness evidence-based research to develop more sophisticated premium models to help contain risk and improve resilience, ultimately saving time and resources for insurers and homeowners. The National Flood Insurance Program, for example, offers insurance discounts of up to 45 percent based on the Community Rating System-a voluntary incentives program that encourages communities to exceed the minimum floodplain management requirements. Private insurers could replicate this model.  Similarly, the California Earthquake Authority offers premium discounts of up to 25 percent for seismic retrofits to support mitigation efforts.</p><p>Another way that private-sector institutions can support crisis management and long-term recovery is by using their platforms to communicate to the public about the importance of preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters. The private sector could encourage individuals to undertake resilience efforts in their local communities and to assist in disaster response and recovery. </p><h>Question 3: How can the community encourage more individuals to assist with crisis management?</h><p>Crisis management is not only for the public and private sectors. Individuals can play an active role in mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. To date, much of the community's focus at the individual level has been on response. But the disaster management community has the potential to play a more active role in helping individuals with preparedness, which is arguably where they could play the largest role. Indeed, individuals sometimes make disasters worse through actions including failing to invest in resilience for homes in at-risk areas, failing to clear brush on properties in areas prone to wildfires, or neglecting to develop reasonable preparedness plans for natural disasters. </p><p>Over the next two decades, the disaster management community could encourage the public to assist with crisis management by reviewing the effectiveness of existing programs. One current program is FEMA's Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program, which educates volunteers about disaster preparedness. CERT volunteers are often called upon to assist first responders during emergencies. The crisis management community could review CERT's effectiveness in order to identify best practices that could be scaled throughout CERT (and in other similar programs) to engage as much of the public as possible during preparedness and response. Another important program, FEMA's Youth Preparedness Council (YPC), created in 2012, could improve the pipeline to critical disaster management occupations. </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>Over the next two decades, the disaster management community could encourage the public to assist with crisis management by reviewing the effectiveness of existing programs.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>The crisis management community also could educate the public about mitigation and preparedness and provide incentives for investing in such efforts for their properties and places of work. One existing model is the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which requires all residential-property insurers in the state to offer wind mitigation credits, thereby encouraging individuals to invest in building features that reduce damage due to wind. Policy makers and insurers could develop similar programs to address different hazards, and SLTT agencies could partner with corporations and nonprofits to provide more information about how homeowners and small businesses can improve their mitigation and preparedness efforts-in addition to why it matters. </p><h>Question 4: What is the right level and mix of investments for crisis management?</h><p>Determining the right investment mix for crisis management is essential-and difficult. In addition to understanding the right level and mix of investments needed to support response and recovery, it is particularly important for the crisis management community to understand what is needed to improve resilience (that is, for mitigation, prevention, and preparedness). </p><p>According to a 2019 report from the National Institute of Building Sciences, every dollar invested by the federal government in mitigation saves society $6 in recovery costs. Despite this, resilience necessarily competes with immediate spending needs such as education and healthcare, as well as with urgent response and recovery activities. Accordingly, resilience investments are often difficult to prioritize, especially since policy makers often see them as expensive, short-term costs. </p><p>The Stafford Act (1988), which forms the key legislative framework for American disaster management through its system of presidential disaster declarations, also limits resilience investments. While the act references mitigation measures as they relate to reducing losses from disasters, it primarily focuses on reimbursements for response activities. </p><p>To determine the appropriate mix of investment across mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, disaster managers could consider new frameworks and approaches-especially in the mitigation space-for determining the effectiveness of investments across crisis management investment portfolios. FEMA's National Mitigation Investment Strategy represents forward progress, but more could be done to make the assessment of disaster management investments both more quantitatively rigorous and easier to communicate to policy makers.</p><p>Looking ahead, crisis management practitioners could think more creatively about developing new and better ways to quantify and communicate the value of crisis management investments. Resilience return on investment (RROI), which was recently championed by Resilience Shift, a partnership between Lloyd's Register and the Arup Group, is a promising metric. Calculation of expected RROI for various crisis management activities could be a powerful tool for clarifying trade-offs and helping prioritize disaster management investments. This approach could help with not only immediate budgetary considerations but also the development of more widely applicable best practices that could be syndicated and replicated by public-sector agencies around the country at the federal, state, and local levels. While it might be difficult to calculate expected RROI on mitigation and preparedness, even tentative or rough expected RROIs could be useful to policy makers. And broad use of an RROI methodology for assessing disaster management investments might prompt stakeholders to collect data that will help to refine and improve RROI calculations over time. </p><h>Question 5: How could equitable recovery be factored into conversations about crisis management?</h><p>Communities of color are disproportionately affected by natural disasters in part because they have less access to response resources. Limited resources, in turn, can inhibit long-term recovery. Indeed, on average, people living in communities of color experience a 31-point decline in their credit scores following disaster events, compared with a decline of four points among residents in predominantly White communities, based on data from 15 natural disasters between 2011 and 2014. In addition, Black and Latino households that experience natural disasters lose $27,000 to $29,000, on average, while White households gain $126,000, based on wealth data from 3,500 families between 1999 and 2013.</p><p>The current administration has prioritized equity in its policy making. In 2021, FEMA announced a new definition of equity-\"[t]he consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial treatment of all individuals\"-and launched a portfolio of new equity initiatives (including expanding assistance for housing and disaster-caused disability). Going forward, equity can be interwoven in every aspect of crisis management, and the crisis management community can identify the causes of inequity and work diligently to eliminate them. </p><p>The causes of inequity in crisis management are multifarious but include postdisaster documentation requirements, postdisaster replacement policies, and manual processes required at the local level to secure funds. In recovery, for instance, an obstacle for disadvantaged communities can be the requirement for verification (such as titles to houses) to receive relief aid, as detailed by FEMA in 2021. FEMA has recently acted to accept a wider range of verification documents to ensure equity. But in light of this barrier, policy makers could also consider additional ways of modifying verification requirements in other contexts so that recovery funds and assistance are allocated more equitably. </p><p>The structure of recovery aid is another source of inequitable outcomes. Typically, recovery aid supports replacement costs for damaged or lost property, but the inspectors sent to verify damage may not be able confirm that damage was caused by the disaster. For example, if a roof that was damaged in a disaster was due to be replaced, inspectors may cite lack of maintenance as the cause of damage, and the applicant may not receive help in replacing the roof. Policy makers could take these factors into account when designing recovery aid funding formulas in order to achieve more equitable outcomes across communities. </p><p>Finally, funding distribution still relies heavily on affected individuals to take action. A large number of funds may become available to individuals affected by presidential-declared disasters, including FEMA's Transitional Shelter Assistance and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program contingency funds; SBA's Disaster Loan Assistance and Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funds; the Department of Labor's Disaster Unemployment Assistance; and the Department of Agriculture's Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Navigating the different requirements of each of these programs can be challenging-especially as people juggle the effects of the disaster. The crisis management community could simplify the process for receiving funds from this web of programs and, in particular, help low-income and historically disadvantaged communities access the funds they are entitled to. </p><p>The crisis management community has made a great deal of progress since the implementation of the Homeland Security Act. However, the work of crisis management never ends, and there will be many more challenges in the coming years. </p><p>The questions posed above could help the crisis management community approach the future in a more integrated and coherent way-and build on the foundation established in the years since 9/11 to create more secure, equitable, and resilient communities across the United States. </p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tony D'Emidio</emphasis></p><p> and </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jon Spaner</emphasis></p><p> are partners in McKinsey's Washington, DC, office, where</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Zoe Fox</emphasis></p><p> is a consultant;\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ophelia Usher</emphasis></p><p> is an associate partner in the Stamford office.</p><p> The authors wish to thank Florinda Bartoli and Charles Drummond for their contributions to this article.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6671-GMF1-DXH6-F2T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4232\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 McKinsey &amp;

The voters spoke and their verdict is clear: The Trump presidency will end on Jan. 20, 2021. What is not clear is just how much more damage Trump will do to the country before that date arrives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After four years of undermining US democracy, Trump has launched his most direct attack against it, rejecting the results of the election and mobilizing his most fervent supporters to try either to overturn the result -- which seems all but impossible -- or, more likely, create enough doubt about the results that Trump can claim he was cheated and remains undefeated. That would protect his self-image as some version of invincible and thus safeguard his political power to influence US politics or even run again in 2024.</p><p>The Trump campaign, CNN reports, is planning a \"messaging blitz\" to amplify his false claims that the election was stolen. Unless someone can prevail on Trump to accept reality, the coming days and weeks could bring campaign-style rallies -- potential Covid-spreading events -- of Trump supporters disputing the election results.</p><p>President-elect Joe Biden won the popular votes with a more than 4 million-vote margin -- the highest vote total of any candidate in the history of the republic. Biden's victory in the Electoral College is expanding, possibly ending with a margin at least as wide as the one Trump called a landslide in 2016. Even Fox News, normally supportive of Trump, agreed when all the networks concluded Biden had won the election.</p><p>At war with the truth, Trump went on television to claim the election was being stolen from him and tweeted, \"I WON THIS ELECTION BY A LOT!\"</p><p>Already, conspiracy theories are spreading like a raging forest fire after a long drought. So-called \"Stop the Steal\" protests have flared across the country. The groups grew out of a Facebook page filled with fake videos supposedly proving vote fraud as Trump fanned the conspiracy flames, gaining hundreds of thousands of followers in hours -- one of the fastest-growing Facebook pages in the platform's history, according to The New York Times-- before Facebook shut it down.</p><p>Two days after Election Day, the former chief security officer at Facebook, Alex Stamos, tweeted, \"This is the most intense online disinformation event in U.S. history.\" Meanwhile, Trump's legal challenges aren't going his way for now. Courts are dismissing claims of fraud, so, the campaign is running a parallel disinformation campaign. The conspiracies, the fake videos, the unfounded claims, are being promoted and amplified by the President, his son Donald Trump Jr. and others in his orbit.</p><p>The campaign is reportedly planning to claim that large numbers of votes in Michigan were cast in the names of dead people. CNN reviewed the evidence supposedly showing that happened and didn't find a single instance. The lieutenant governor of Georgia, Republican Geoff Duncan, says he has seen no evidence of voting irregularities in that pivotal state.</p><p>In fact, we've yet to see any credible evidence that Biden did not win, and the election appears to have been clean and efficient overall, perhaps because election officials were under so much pressure to protect the system from interference.</p><p>Still, Trump's supporters continue to egg him on. Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Fox on Sunday, \"Do not concede, Mr. President, fight hard.\"</p><p>Trump's refusal to concede is already harming the transition. The Trump-appointed administrator of the General Services Administration, Emily Murphy, has refused to write the letter that the Biden transition team needs to get access to resources needed for the incoming administration to prepare for its duties. Less than a week before Election Day, the White House installed a new head of the general counsel office at GSA, another Trump appointee. Hobbling the work of the transition team will hurt the entire country.</p><p>Trump's disinformation campaign is the most dangerous version yet of the \"alternative facts\" strategy he launched after his 2017 inauguration. That's when he told Americans to ignore what they had seen with their own eyes and believe millions more had attended the event than appeared on television screens showing wide empty spaces.</p><p>Back then, he denied reality to bolster his image. What's happening now is arguably much more harmful. Trump is choosing to end his presidency as he started it, attacking the truth and undermining the nation's institutions.</p><p>By now, we know exactly who Trump is. He lied from the day he came to office, and he's doing it again on his way out in hopes that he will personally benefit. That is hardly a surprise. What is still surprising is that so many Republicans who were once honorable public servants have chosen to join his attack on American democracy.</p><p>In the end, Trump will have to move out of the White House, whether he likes it or not. But his shenanigans will leave the country wounded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-202011102020electiontrumpdenialofrealityopinionghitis1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6189-2NH1-JBPX-X1DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><timeReceived>3:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 10, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sadly, the koala, Ellenborough Lewis, succumbed to its burns. Now memorialized by Australian artists Gillie and Marc Schattner, Ellenborough Lewis serves as a potent reminder of the fires that torched millions of acres, claimed dozens of lives and caused billions of dollars in environmental and economic damage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Forest fires often start in remote areas and burn so fast, they can consume the length of an entire football field in one second,\" said Jay Sheth, a Ph.D. candidate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Virginia School of Engineering. \"Rapid detection is crucial, yet there's no way to detect the start of a forest fire in real time.</p><p>\"Our technology is about to change that.\"</p><p>Sheth is part of a research team working at the Integrated Electromagnetics, Circuits and Systems lab led by Steven M. Bowers, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.</p><p>\"We are designing a dense network of detectors comprised of reliable, inexpensive and self-powered circuits,\" Sheth said. The team dubbed their project \"RISc detectors\" after these key attributes.</p><p>Sheth designed the power amplifiers for the ultra-low power transmitters. This helps each detector autonomously relay a fire warning in real time across thousands of square miles. A detector senses the start of a fire through various chemical and gas sensors and forwards the warning signal to the next functioning detector in the network.</p><p>One sensor's ability to distinguish working and non-working sensors is crucial when small fires are triggered simultaneously, as can happen during lightning storms. In a briefing last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said nearly 12,000 lightning strikes over a 72-hour period sparked more than 560 new wildfires in the state.</p><p>According to statistics collected by CAL FIRE at the end of August, the Santa Clara and Sonoma Lake-Napa \"lightning complex\" fires were the second- and third-largest fires in the state's history, dating back to 1932; the fires had burned more than 720,000 acres and destroyed nearly 1,000 structures, and were only partially contained.</p><p>Sheth envisions a smart network able to navigate signals around damaged sensors. This functionality helps fire fighters maintain situational awareness, so they can deploy resources strategically.</p><p>\"I consider myself blessed to have and use my skills to meet urgent human needs,\" Sheth said.</p><p>Sheth found his calling while pursuing his associate's and bachelor's degrees, when he discovered electromagnetics and circuits - the building blocks of electrical engineers. In his final year at Virginia Tech, Sheth interned with Bowers on a project sponsored by the Virginia Microelectronics Consortium that would evolve into the RISc detectors project.</p><p>\"I never thought I would get into a Ph.D. program. The internship experience, with Steve's mentoring and guidance, opened that door for me,\" Sheth said.</p><p>\"Attracting talented students who can simultaneously engage technically at the highest levels while being able to understand and communicate the societal impact of our work is one of the most important aspects of my job,\" Bowers said. \"Jay is one of those special people who can switch between those modes effortlessly, which really compounds the impact of the engineering work he does.\"</p><p>Sheth follows Bowers' example, motivating others through the student chapter of the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Sheth enjoys welcoming undergraduate students to the lab and the opportunity to reach a broader audience through open houses, seminars and technology demonstrations.</p><p>\"My involvement in the student chapter has helped me clearly communicate the value of our research to people outside our technical field,\" Sheth said.</p><p>Sheth's pitch for RISc detectors earned first place at the IEEE Microwave Week three-minute thesis competition. Microwave Week celebrates the technical accomplishments of the top three conferences convened under the umbrella of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society. The competition helps renew public interest in microwaves as a transformative - and potentially life-saving - technology.</p><p>Sheth plans to continue to advance microwave technology, with an eye toward incorporating scientific developments for public safety and consumer applications.</p><p>Contact: Karen Walker, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mkw3a@virginia.edu\">mkw3a@virginia.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7251121 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7251121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610C-0081-JC11-10YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><timeReceived>1:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A policing overhaul after the killing of George Floyd is up in the air. Even a seemingly bipartisan effort to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol faces the blockade of Republican opposition in Congress.</p><p>It's a pivotal time for many aspects of Biden's ambitious agenda. Rounding the first quarter of his presidency, the White House and Congress have been unable to meet key Memorial Day deadlines set by the administration on crucial priorities.</p><p>While lawmakers quickly approved Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue package and senators confirmed the top ranks of the administration with Biden's nominees, the next legislative priorities on the White House's agenda will be a longer slog.</p><p>The sweeping infrastructure investment, in particular, faces a crucial moment: The White House is assessing whether the president can strike a bipartisan deal with Republicans on his American Jobs Plan, a top domestic priority, or try to go it alone with Democrats if no progress is made over the next week. Biden's allies in the House and Senate are preparing for all scenarios.</p><p>\"This is going to feel like a tightrope walk all the way until it gets to Biden\u2019s desk,\u201d said Jim Kessler, executive vice president of Third Way, a centrist think tank.</p><p>___</p><p>AP: Top cop in Black man's deadly arrest withheld cam video</p><p>NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 In perhaps the strongest evidence yet of an attempted cover-up in the deadly 2019 arrest of Ronald Greene, the ranking Louisiana State Police officer at the scene falsely told internal investigators that the Black man was still a threat to flee after he was shackled, and he denied the existence of his own body camera video for nearly two years until it emerged just last month.</p><p>New state police documents obtained by The Associated Press show numerous inconsistencies between Lt. John Clary\u2019s statements to detectives and the body camera footage he denied having. They add to growing signs of obfuscation in Greene\u2019s death, which the white troopers initially blamed on a car crash at the end of a high-speed chase and is now the subject of a federal civil rights investigation.</p><p>The highly secretive case has drawn national attention since last week when the AP began publishing graphic body camera videos that showed troopers repeatedly jolting Greene with stun guns, putting him in a chokehold, punching him and dragging him by his ankle shackles. And like George Floyd's death a year ago, it once again highlighted the importance of video as key evidence in police misconduct cases.</p><p>\u201cVideo doesn't lie, and the best way to protect the integrity of law enforcement agencies is with body camera footage,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a New Orleans-based watchdog group.</p><p>But Clary, the highest-ranking officer among at least six state troopers at the scene of Greene's May 10, 2019, arrest, told investigators later that day that he had no body camera footage of the incident \u2014 a statement proven to be untrue when his 30-minute body camera video of the arrest emerged last month.</p><p>___</p><p>US warns against all travel to Japan as Olympics loom</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. health officials and the State Department on Monday warned Americans against travel to Japan because of a surge in coronavirus cases in the country, which is preparing to host the Olympics in just two months.</p><p>The twin alerts don\u2019t ban U.S. citizens from visiting the country, but they could have an impact on insurance rates for travelers and may factor into decisions by Olympic athletes and spectators on whether to compete in or attend the games, which are due to start in July. There was no immediate indication as to what effect the warnings might have on would-be Olympic-goers.</p><p>\u201cTravelers should avoid all travel to Japan,\u201d the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a new COVID-19 update. \u201cBecause of the current situation in Japan even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants and should avoid all travel to Japan.\u201d</p><p>The State Department's warning, which followed the CDC alert, was more blunt. \u201cDo not travel to Japan due to COVID-19,\u201d it said in the announcement, which raised the department's travel alert from Level 3 \u2014 Reconsider travel \u2014 to Level 4 \u2014 Do not travel. The previous alert was issued on April 21.</p><p>The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee said it still anticipates that American athletes will be able to safely compete at the Tokyo Games.</p><p>___</p><p>Judge digs into Apple app store policies as Epic trial ends</p><p>SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The judge who will decide a case challenging Apple\u2019s stranglehold on its iPhone app store indicated on Monday she would like to promote more competition but without dismantling a commission system that reaps billions of dollars for the technology powerhouse.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers isn\u2019t likely to issue a decision until this summer. But she opened a window into her thoughts during a three-hour session with lawyers for Apple and its adversary, Epic Games, during the final day of a three-week trial in Oakland, California.</p><p>Gonzalez Rogers\u2019 line of questioning suggested she sides with much of the defense that Apple has mounted to justify the 15% to 30% commissions it collects for in-app transactions on the iPhone to help pay for the technology powering its devices.</p><p>Epic Games, the maker of the popular videogame Fortnite, has been trying to prove the fees are the price-gouging tool of a monopoly hatched within the \u201cwalled garden\u201d Apple has built around the iPhone, the app store, its software and other devices such as the iPad and iPod.</p><p>To loosen Apple\u2019s tight-fisted control, Epic wants Gonzalez Rogers to issue an order that would require Apple to open the iPhone and its other mobile products to rival app stores. Those alternatives would include Epic\u2019s still-unprofitable app store, which charges a commission of just 12%.</p><p>___</p><p>Families urge legal changes to prevent more police killings</p><p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Parents and siblings of Black men killed by police urged people during a discussion in the city where George Floyd was killed a year ago to join them in pursuing legal changes they say can make similar deaths less likely in the future.</p><p>The panel, convened Monday in Minneapolis and organized by the George Floyd Memorial Foundation founded by Floyd\u2019s sister Bridgett and moderated by prominent Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, was part of a series of events marking the one-year anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death on May 25.</p><p>Family members of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Daunte Wright and other Black men slain by police gathered for a discussion about the state of policing in the U.S. and racial inequities in the frequency of fatal encounters with law enforcement.</p><p>The families also discussed the role of lawmakers in making changes to hold police accountable and how community members can support the loved ones of those killed by police.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to actually lose a child in order for you to have that passion,\u201d said Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin. \u201cWe need allies, we need people to support us and lift us up when we\u2019ve fallen down and when you all have fallen down we need to lift you all up.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Biden doubling spending to prepare for hurricanes, storms</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden announced Monday that he's doubling U.S. emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impact of climate change.</p><p>The $1 billion in spending is a small fraction of what the U.S. spends on weather-related disasters. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion.</p><p>2021 has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states, and officials expect an ongoing severe drought in the West to fuel another destructive summer of wildfires following one of the worst fire years on record in 2020. Forecasters predict a busy hurricane season along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, but perhaps not as severe as 2020\u2019s record-shattering year.</p><p>\u201cWe all know that the storms are coming, and we\u2019re going to be prepared,\" Biden said during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Washington headquarters. \u201cWe have to be ready.\u201d</p><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the hurricane season, which runs from June through November, will likely see 13 to 20 named storms, including at least six that will become hurricanes and three to five categorized as major hurricanes with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kilometers per hour).</p><p>___</p><p>Mali's president and PM arrested by mutinous soldiers</p><p>BAMAKO, Mali (AP) \u2014 Mutinous soldiers arrested Mali's transitional president and prime minister Monday hours after a government reshuffle left out two members of the junta that had seized power in a coup nine months earlier, the African Union and United Nations said.</p><p>A joint statement issued along with the West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS and other members of the international community called for the immediate release of President Bah N\u2019Daw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane, who were taken to the Kati military headquarters.</p><p>Those who signed on to the joint statement called for Mali's political transition \u201cto resume its course and conclude within the established timeframe.\"</p><p>\u201cThe international community rejects in advance any act of coercion, including forced resignations,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey emphasize that the ill-considered action taken today carries the risk of weakening the mobilization of the international community in support of Mali.\u201d</p><p>The developments raised new alarm about whether the transitional government would be able to move ahead freely with plans to organize new democratic elections as promised by next February in Mali, where the U.N. is spending $1.2 billion a year on a peacekeeping mission.</p><p>___</p><p>Watchdog: US forced deported parents to leave kids behind</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A government watchdog says the Trump administration, under its practice of separating families at the border, forced migrant parents to leave the U.S. without their children, contradicting claims by officials that parents were willingly leaving them behind.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General said in a report released Monday that it found at least 348 cases in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement had no records showing migrants wanted to leave their children in the U.S. It also found \u201csome\u201d cases in which agency officials deported parents even while knowing they wanted to take their children with them.</p><p>That contradicted assertions by senior DHS officials that parents were choosing to leave their children in the U.S. to stay with family or for other reasons while they were deported in 2017 and 2018 as the administration sought to enforce a hard-line approach to immigration enforcement.</p><p>The findings, issued by Trump-appointed Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, provide new insight into a policy that became a significant political crisis for the previous administration and a continuing challenge for the current one, which is working to reunite children who remain separated even now.</p><p>\u201cThose who conceived of this travesty will have to live with the memory of their cruelty for the rest of their lives,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who is chair of the Judiciary Committee and requested the report.</p><p>___</p><p>Grim western fire season starts much drier than record 2020</p><p>As bad as last year\u2019s record-shattering fire season was, the western U.S. starts this year\u2019s in even worse shape.</p><p>The soil in the West is record dry for this time of year. In much of the region, plants that fuel fires are also the driest scientists have seen. The vegetation is primed to ignite, especially in the Southwest where dead juniper trees are full of flammable needles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like having gasoline out there,\u201d said Brian Steinhardt, forest fire zone manager for Prescott and Coconino national forests in Arizona.</p><p>A climate change-fueled megadrought of more than 20 years is making conditions that lead to fire even more dangerous, scientists said. Rainfall in the Rockies and farther west was the second lowest on record in April, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>\u201cIt means that the dice are loaded toward a lot of forest fire this year,\u201d said Park Williams, a UCLA climate and fire scientist, who calculated that soil in the western half of the nation is the driest it has been since 1895. \u201cThis summer we\u2019re going into fire season with drier fuels than we were at this time last year.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-7f3ff4ed3b248f636b32b46e9c76199c20210525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62S0-DCW1-JC5B-G38C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2380\"/><timeReceived>3:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 25, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Power was lost in some areas as fires downed transmissions lines, and residents were warned that the worst may be yet to come.</p><p>\"We are now in a position where we are saying to people it's not safe to move, it's not safe to leave these areas,\" state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters. \"We are in for a long night and I make no bones about that. We are still yet to hit the worst of it.\"</p><p>As dawn broke over a blackened landscape today, a picture emerged of disaster of unprecedented scale. The Rural Fire Service said 150 fires were active in the state, 64 of them uncontrolled.</p><p>\"It's not something we have experienced before,\" Berejiklian said.</p><p> She said that the extent of the bushfire season was the largest in living memory, \"and many experts have been around much longer than I have, who fought fires and observed circumstances. All agree we're in uncharted territory.\"</p><p>However, milder temperatures today  brought hope of a respite from wildfires that have claimed 24 lives and destroyed almost 2,000 homes.</p><p> \"The weather conditions have improved in New South Wales and Victoria but there are still many fires raging and there's a significant firefighting effort continuing,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a news conference today.</p><p>He announced the establishment of a national bushfire recovery agency, headed by former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin, which would provide support payments to small businesses and help repair damaged infrastructure.</p><p>The deadly wildfires, which have been raging since September, have burned about 12.35 million acres of land. That's more than any one year in the U.S. since Harry Truman was president.</p><p>For the first time in Australia's history, 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists have been called up and will be thrown into the battle against the fires. Morrison announced the decision Saturday. </p><p>A crew of 20 veteran firefighters based in California's Angeles National Forest will head to Australia on Monday to help.</p><p>Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management already have provided a few dozen people, most of them with experience managing fires, officials said Saturday.</p><p>The crew leaving on Monday will replace a group of personnel sent to Australia in early December. They include hot-shot and helicopter crew members with experience attacking fires early before they grow into large infernos, said Angeles National Forest Fire Chief Robert Garcia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0107013715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XX6-J1T1-JBM5-R0B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>AS--Australia-Wildfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

As of Sunday, $600 had been raised.</p><p>\"He is known and well-loved by the community,\" said Alan Moulton, a friend and church member.</p><p>At the time of the fire, Hicks said he thought he smelled a burning car, so he ran to the top of his driveway to make sure a neighbor didn't need help. With nothing found, he turned back toward the trailer to see smoke pumping out the back of it.</p><p>\"I emptied the fire extinguisher out on it, and it didn't put a dent in it, so then I tried buckets of water and tried to keep the woods from catching fire,\" he said. \"I didn't want to be responsible for starting a forest fire.\"</p><p>By the time the Stoddard Fire Department arrived on the scene, the trailer was fully engulfed, but firefighters were able to get the fire out quickly, according to a Facebook post from the department.</p><p>Hicks wasn't injured, but said he got a \"flame haircut,\" with the fire burning a few pieces of his hair, facial hair and eyebrows.</p><p>\"It's the first time my mustache can't be tied under my chin,\" he joked, pointing to his light gray facial hair that stopped -- almost perfectly -- at the curve of his mouth.</p><p>Since the fire, Hicks, who retired after 30 years as head of security at Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center in Greenfield, has been trying to figure out his next steps.</p><p>He was staying in the trailer until he could finish building a home on the same property on Tigola Trail, but said money issues kept pushing him further away from that goal.</p><p>He's now staying in the home's previously built cement basement, which had been used for storage. The cramped quarters -- equipped with a small, old stove and sink -- has a shelf for canned goods, a few chairs and a couch restored from the town dump, and an old TV.</p><p>Hicks has no plumbing or septic, and said a hand-pumped well will be installed on the property soon so he can get fresh water for bathing and drinking.</p><p>Despite this, Hicks maintains a chipper demeanor, and even offered a Sentinel reporter the limited food he had when they spoke.</p><p>This is how he has always been, according to Moulton.</p><p>\"Jon ... continues to have a positive Christian attitude, and is optimistic regarding this situation,\" he said in a letter to The Sentinel.</p><p>In addition to the church's fund, boxes of clothes and food have also been given to Hicks, who said after the fire all he had left were two cans of tuna. Now, his shelf is stocked with canned goods donated by fellow churchgoers and Stoddard residents.</p><p>\"I never expected that kind of outpouring,\" he said, \"and I am just so thankful and so happy that these people are so good.\"</p><p>Donations can be sent to Stoddard Congregational Church, P.O. Box 334, Stoddard, NH 03464, to the attention of Treasurer/Jonathan Hicks Fund.</p><p>Olivia Belanger can be reached at 352-1234 extension 1439, or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:obelanger@keenesentinel.com\">obelanger@keenesentinel.com</email> Follow her on Twitter @OBelangerKS.</p><p>___ (c)2020 The Keene Sentinel (Keene, N.H.)

Sadly, the koala, Ellenborough Lewis, succumbed to its burns. Now memorialized by Australian artists Gillie and Marc Schattner, Ellenborough Lewis serves as a potent reminder of the fires that torched millions of acres, claimed dozens of lives and caused billions of dollars in environmental and economic damage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Forest fires often start in remote areas and burn so fast, they can consume the length of an entire football field in one second,\" said Jay Sheth, a Ph.D. candidate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Virginia School of Engineering. \"Rapid detection is crucial, yet there's no way to detect the start of a forest fire in real time.</p><p>\"Our technology is about to change that.\"</p><p>Sheth is part of a research team working at the Integrated Electromagnetics, Circuits and Systems lab led by Steven M. Bowers, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering.</p><p>\"We are designing a dense network of detectors comprised of reliable, inexpensive and self-powered circuits,\" Sheth said. The team dubbed their project \"RISc detectors\" after these key attributes.</p><p>Sheth designed the power amplifiers for the ultra-low power transmitters. This helps each detector autonomously relay a fire warning in real time across thousands of square miles. A detector senses the start of a fire through various chemical and gas sensors and forwards the warning signal to the next functioning detector in the network.</p><p>One sensor's ability to distinguish working and non-working sensors is crucial when small fires are triggered simultaneously, as can happen during lightning storms. In a briefing last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said nearly 12,000 lightning strikes over a 72-hour period sparked more than 560 new wildfires in the state.</p><p>According to statistics collected by CAL FIRE at the end of August, the Santa Clara and Sonoma Lake-Napa \"lightning complex\" fires were the second- and third-largest fires in the state's history, dating back to 1932; the fires had burned more than 720,000 acres and destroyed nearly 1,000 structures, and were only partially contained.</p><p>Sheth envisions a smart network able to navigate signals around damaged sensors. This functionality helps fire fighters maintain situational awareness, so they can deploy resources strategically.</p><p>\"I consider myself blessed to have and use my skills to meet urgent human needs,\" Sheth said.</p><p>Sheth found his calling while pursuing his associate's and bachelor's degrees, when he discovered electromagnetics and circuits the building blocks of electrical engineers. In his final year at Virginia Tech, Sheth interned with Bowers on a project sponsored by the Virginia Microelectronics Consortium that would evolve into the RISc detectors project.</p><p>\"I never thought I would get into a Ph.D. program. The internship experience, with Steve's mentoring and guidance, opened that door for me,\" Sheth said.</p><p>\"Attracting talented students who can simultaneously engage technically at the highest levels while being able to understand and communicate the societal impact of our work is one of the most important aspects of my job,\" Bowers said. \"Jay is one of those special people who can switch between those modes effortlessly, which really compounds the impact of the engineering work he does.\"</p><p>Sheth follows Bowers' example, motivating others through the student chapter of the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Sheth enjoys welcoming undergraduate students to the lab and the opportunity to reach a broader audience through open houses, seminars and technology demonstrations.</p><p>\"My involvement in the student chapter has helped me clearly communicate the value of our research to people outside our technical field,\" Sheth said.</p><p>Sheth's pitch for RISc detectors earned first place at the IEEE Microwave Week three-minute thesis competition. Microwave Week celebrates the technical accomplishments of the top three conferences convened under the umbrella of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society. The competition helps renew public interest in microwaves as a transformative and potentially life-saving technology.</p><p>Sheth plans to continue to advance microwave technology, with an eye toward incorporating scientific developments for public safety and consumer applications.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123933501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-P7J1-JCBF-S010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Nathan Miller, wildland superintendent with the Santa Fe Fire Department, said after evaluating weather outlooks and models, this year may be worse than the last three.</p><p>\"I'm gonna say this will be as active as last year, if not worse. The kind of models that we've seen are predicting the year to be a bit like 2016,\" he said.</p><p>New Mexico saw 620 wildfires that year, burning over 110,000 acres, according to the State Forestry Division.</p><p>Fire departments are no longer worried only about the summer. Officials from the U.S. Forest Service and the Santa Fe County and city fire departments agreed the fire season is shifting into something that is year-round.</p><p>Lance Elmore, a forest fire staff officer, has worked at the U.S. Forest Service for over 20 years and has seen significant changes along the way.</p><p>\"The length of the fire season is obviously a trend that has gone up since I started my career,\" he said. \"Typically, come July and the monsoons, you didn't really worry about large fires. We always had fires after that month, lightning type stuff, but they were relatively small. You didn't see a lot of these larger September, October type fires then as you have in the past several years.\"</p><p>In order to deal with the nearly yearlong fire risk, city and county departments work through every season on preventive measures and assessing private property where landowners want to diminish the risk.</p><p>Some of those measures include clearing excess underbrush, doing prescribed burns and managing areas of high-risk dead vegetation.</p><p>\"We prepare for the worst,\" said county fire wildland Capt. Mike Feulner. \"We know that this is going to be a tough season just based on drought fuel conditions and things like that, and we try to look at where we can to support in the offseason preparing for it.\"</p><p>Fighting wildfires is a complex, multiorganizational endeavor. It takes cooperation from local fire departments, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Affairs, to name a few. The Forestry Division even set up a resource plan to use bulldozers and water canisters from the Department of Transportation.</p><p>But one of the most influential factors in wildfire prevention and mitigation, experts say, is the public. Without proper awareness and education, a careless mistake could be devastating.</p><p>Activities like welding outdoors, grilling, using a cutting torch or even parking a car over an area of dry grass have been known to start fires. According to Mason and her department's data, 98 percent of the fires this year were caused by people.</p><p>Elmore emphasized a need for the outdoors community to pay attention to fire restrictions, particularly with the pandemic bringing a higher number of people into the forests.</p><p>\"We did see a lot of folks that did not have a lot of [experience] in camping and camping safely with campfires,\" he said. \"Those [restrictions] are put into place not lightly, but to help reduce the risk of large catastrophic fires.\"</p><p>While the public may be the largest threat, it is also the solution. Private property owners getting risk assessments and fire mitigation work done on their homes - or utilizing the various resources provided by the forest service and local fire departments - are just a few of the ways that Santa Fe citizens can be proactive, experts say.</p><p>\"We'll go out to the homeowners and look at their property and kind of give them a suggestion of what we think they need to [have] done to their property to help mitigate their issue and reduce the risk [of] fire,\" Miller said. \"The public can always reach out to us to schedule a time that we can come and do an assessment.\"</p><p>Miller was unable to provide a number of private landowners in Santa Fe who use the department's help, but said the city wildland team is out three to four times a week during the year working on property assessments or fuel mitigation.</p><p>Feulner also highlighted the county's Ready, Set, Go! program, which helps families create a prevention and escape plan in case of an emergency and is available on the county's website.</p><p>Overall, local firefighters and forest experts say the year will present many challenges with these extreme environmental factors, but they urge the Santa Fe community to take advantage of local resources to help mitigate risk.</p><p>\"We need everyone to take responsibility to prevent wildfires, to protect our communities and our firefighters who are putting their lives on the line every time they go out,\" Mason said. \"It only takes one spark.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15586642</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62B1-TT11-JBSG-12HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 29, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

Thanks to a grievous, almost incomprehensible lack of federal leadership from the White House, the U.S. leads the world in cases and deaths from this virus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our numbers: 2.4 million-plus cases and almost 125,000 deaths. And rising.</p><p>Those numbers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are vastly understated. It's worse than the numbers show, perhaps 10 times higher.</p><p>The pause has hit New Mexico, where Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said last week that our state would not be moving to the second phase of reopening. Even here, in a place where science has led decisions, the transmission rate is rising. It can't help New Mexico's rate of infection to be sandwiched near states such as Arizona and Texas, where lousy leadership at the state level has led to the pandemic roaring out of control.</p><p>Lujan Grisham says New Mexico has a week to improve numbers so she can continue the phased reopening.</p><p>Everyone wants a return to life as usual. But normal during the pandemic is not the normal of a few months ago. That's the reality too many Americans - especially the president - have failed to confront.</p><p>Today's normal means wearing a face covering in public, maintaining a 6-foot distance from others, continuing smart hygiene practices and, for the most part, staying home.</p><p>Normal does not mean having graduation parties, dining out in large groups or shopping daily or taking group hikes without face coverings. The new normal is better than the strict restrictions of the early days of the pandemic, with schools shuttered and churches and businesses closed, but it is still not the freedom to come and go that people so desire.</p><p>But here's the deal.</p><p>By staying home and being smart about mingling, New Mexicans will win the freedom we crave sooner, rather than later.</p><p>By opening up too quickly and abandoning mask-wearing and distancing, we condemn ourselves to months of restrictions - and to many more cases of the coronavirus, with resulting harm and deaths. If the disease transmission rate in New Mexico does not fall, schools may not open. The goal is 1.05 or lower, and the current rate is 1.12.</p><p>It's time to be tough - on ourselves, and perhaps, on one another.</p><p>That means disciplining ourselves to a March or April mindset - staying home and limiting unnecessary movement. The state's success in the first months of this crisis was largely due to an all-for-one commitment to distance and smart, reasonable behavior.</p><p>It also means avoiding those who choose not to follow these guidelines. Those who don't wear masks (and there are many among us; it's not all tourists from Texas and Arizona) are, in essence, public health hazards to steer clear of like any tornado or forest fire or flood.</p><p>As Lujan Grisham said at her update last week - people must take this seriously.</p><p>Many of our readers are ready to shut down the roads to New Mexico because of pandemics gone wild in nearby states. It's encouraging to see the city will step up its oversight of mask-wearing, complete with public-awareness campaigns for visitors. And, yes, issue warnings and tickets if need be.</p><p>Lives hang in the balance, including those damaged because our economy is shattered.</p><p>In Texas, with its rush to open, Gov. Greg Abbott called a halt last week - he's even closing the bars. Arizona remains out of control.</p><p>New Mexico, meanwhile, can stand out as a model of smart governance and a devotion to the common good - combining science and commitment to keep people safe while slowing the virus's spread.</p><p>If we do that, New Mexico stands a far better chance of limiting the damage to its businesses and its lifestyle, to say nothing of its health.</p><p>If we don't, we end up like our neighbors. And who wants that?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15537230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607K-TBY1-JBSG-153J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 28, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp; PREVENTION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002233</classCode><className>EPIDEMIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOZG</classCode><className>SCHOOL CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D43B</classCode><className>BUSINESS CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002233</classCode><className>EPIDEMIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>PE000DABR</classCode><className>MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GS147</classCode><className>NEW MEXICO, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS159</classCode><className>TEXAS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A follow-up Sierra National Forest radio call confirmed the 10-acre fire was fanned by 20- to 40-mile-per-hour winds, and could escalate quickly.</p><p>Forrest, a volunteer for the 11-person department the past two years, immediately drove an hour to meet the team. Together, with help from another 25 firefighters, they fought and ultimately contained the Blue Fire, which would grow to 277 acres over five days.</p><p>In ensuing days as the winds lessened, he moved off the front lines to manage water truck support and dig fire lines, clear brush, cut down burning trees and rake areas that had burning embers.</p><p>Forrest was well prepared for the situation from the year before when he spent nearly a month helping fight the Creek Fire. The fourth-biggest fire in state history became a national news story as it burned nearly 380,000 acres around Shaver Lake for about five months.</p><p>Creek Fire experience</p><p>Forrest recalls his Labor Day weekend in 2020 starting innocently, as he headed to Shaver Lake to go water skiing with friends on a Friday afternoon. As they pulled up, he saw an area resident, the former Big Creek fire chief, who warned him about a small fire that had just started to the northwest.</p><p>He turned around to get his gear and got the fire department call on his way to the station. The team soon headed out to nearby Camp Sierra to rouse and help evacuate unsuspecting visitors.</p><p>That first night, response organizers had hoped air support and typically mild evening weather might limit the fire's growth until crews could create containment lines in the morning. However, the fire quickly grew as unexpected winds and extra dry and hot conditions pushed it at an alarming pace towards Shaver Lake.</p><p>The first week of the fire, firefighters worked nearly 24-hour shifts to combat the walls of flame that soared over 80-foot ponderosa pine trees and dwarfed firefighters who sometimes defended perimeters only 30 to 40 feet away.</p><p>The fire grew exponentially the first 48 hours to 45,000 acres, and by the end of the first week had almost quadrupled to 167,000 acres. The combined efforts of nearly 3,000 responders from as far away as Texas and Alaska ultimately saved a majority of the homes and buildings in the Shaver Lake and Huntington Lake areas, and more importantly, prevented any deaths.</p><p>Part of the fire's ferocity was due to the large amount of dead or dying trees that had been infested by bark beetles. Recent years of drought had limited many trees' sap production, its natural defense against the beetle, as the forest was turned from a healthy green to a flammable brown.</p><p>\"It could have been even worse,\" Forrest said. \"The Edison forest crews had done a fantastic job with controlled burns during the winter on their property. You could see where the fire would come to the previous burn lines, and might only spot over some, but other places there was no stopping it partly because the humidity was so low.\"</p><p>After the first week's front line duties, the remaining September work days were still a minimum of 12 to 18 hours as he was assigned to spot fires and other needs as far south as Tollhouse and north towards Lake Edison.</p><p>Spot fire duty means roaming areas near the fire lines and looking for isolated fires that could be as small as 1 square-foot to 1 acre in size or larger. The potential small fires require constant attention since they can quickly escalate and start randomly from live embers carried by the winds. He also searched for smoldering flare fires that would pop up after they had been put out days before on the same, already-charred earth.</p><p>For Reaves, it grew into a 25-day commitment that officially ended on Oct. 1, with only a mandatory, two-day break after the hectic first two weeks. At that point, the fire had topped 300,000 acres and was still less than 50% contained. For Shaver Lake citizens, however, the drama had begun to settle as evacuation orders were lifted as the fire headed mostly northward into the high alpine areas with less vegetation.</p><p>He spent a few more days with the department afterward, attending to other local medical and emergency needs as permanent residents returned.</p><p>Transitioning back to his routine</p><p>Exhausted from the grueling four weeks, Forrest still faced a busy schedule back home in Kingsburg. He had virtual classes at Fresno State to catch up on duties at the family farm that was already a month into its pomegranate harvest season.</p><p>Thankfully, his work at the family's Youngstown Grape Distributors was more predictable than his volunteer firefighting work. The family operation raises and processes a wide variety of grapes, citrus, stone fruit, persimmons and other produce. It is equally known for its Farm Dog Juices, the nation's only farm-to-bottle, cold-pressed juice producer.</p><p>He takes great pride in the family business, so much that he plans to remain a part of it after graduation this fall. He also hopes to eventually obtain his pest control and certified crop advisor licenses to help manage 1,000 acres of fields that range from Reedley to Earlimart.</p><p>Forrest's equal passion for the mountains and Shaver Lake area are tied to a family skiing tradition that dates back over 50 years to his father, Mike, a 1985 Fresno State business graduate and former offensive lineman for the Bulldogs football team.</p><p>Those frequent trips eventually prepared him for other ski trips around the Western United States, and later around the world, as one of the nation's top junior downhill ski racers.</p><p>The family cabin in Shaver Lake now also provides a basecamp for his work on the China Peak emergency medical response team during the summer and winters and for his fire department training. Today, he is the only department member in his 20s, and one of only two under 50 years old.</p><p>\"I appreciate the opportunity that they have given me,\" Forrest said. \"I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a full-time firefighter or not, so it was a good chance to get my feet wet and get some experience.\"</p><p>When he's normally on call on the weekend, it includes an array of emergency needs, mostly related to medical assistance and traffic accidents. Forest fires are the least common, and often only a couple times a year at most. Other potential fires might relate to smaller property or lightning strike fires, or an occasional prescribed burn that has edged past its boundary and can be contained in an hour or two.</p><p>\"When you see a major forest fire like that and how much damage it can do, it makes you realize how much of a difference you can make,\" Forrest said. \"I can see myself going into a six-month fire academy program. Whether I'm working with the ski patrol or fire department, it's all about the same thing, trying to help others, any way you can.\"</p><p>Shaver Lake Fire Department Assistant Chief Steve McQuillan echoed similar sentiments about his teammate.</p><p>\"It was great having someone like Reaves at your side to rely on,\" McQuillan said. \"He lives the farthest away of anyone on the team, by far, yet he is so reliable. When you're fighting a once-in-a-lifetime fire like that, you're not worried about someone's age, but how cool they are under fire. I spent a lot of time out there with him during the fire, and he was someone I was proud to have on our team.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-7589801 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7589801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63HD-2T41-DYG2-R00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1311\"/><timeReceived>12:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 2, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CNUK</classCode><className>US LABOR DAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XAG</classCode><className>BOTANY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CZUL</classCode><className>NIGHT &amp; SHIFT WORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001820</classCode><className>WATERSKIING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A075</classCode><className>TEXT MESSAGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009F8J</classCode><className>FAMILY FARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX449</classCode><className>FRESNO, CA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Forest Service programs like reforestation, the county Board of Commissioners was told Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forest management and reforestation in 2020 added $10,873,592 to the county's economy, said Robby Freeman, a NCFS ranger in Robeson County, during a 9 a.m. Robeson County Board of Commissioners meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Out of that $10.8 million that was added to the county this year, 10.6 (million dollars) of it was roughly from timber harvest, the rest of it was from state and federal cost-share programs that we help assist with, to get trees planted back on those harvested areas,\" Freeman said.</p><p>In 2020, 3,264 acres were planted with trees in the county, which is a record, he said. There were 2,742 acres of timber harvested.</p><p>The county has 336,536 acres of commercial forest land protected by the N.C. Forest Service, Freeman said. The county has 326,094 acres of privately owned forest land eligible for NCFS management assistance.</p><p>\"It was roughly a average year of fires for us, as far as the numbers,\" Freeman said.</p><p>In 2020, the N.C. Forest Service in Robeson County responded to 165 forest fires, with 949 acres burned in total, he said. There were 195 buildings or homes saved, with an estimate of $14,662,500 in value.</p><p>The acreage was low, which Freeman said was a good thing, citing the wet conditions of wooded areas last year.</p><p>\"We wrote 36 warning tickets last year, one citation and issued one warrant for arrest,\" he said.</p><p>Robeson County has one county ranger, three assistant county rangers, two forest fire equipment operators and a service forester, Freeman said.</p><p>Laurel wilt has been detected and is being monitored, he said. Laurel wilt is a disease that affects red bay, or short-trunked trees.</p><p>Freeman also said the NCFS obtained three brush trucks to give to three fire departments in 2020 by placing their names on the list for surplus equipment from the U.S. Department of Defense. One generator and other items, like vehicle extraction tools, light towers and tires, were also given to departments.</p><p>Board of Commissioners Chair Faline Dial commended Freeman and N.C. Forest Service workers for their efforts and services in the county.</p><p>Commissioners went into closed session for more than 30 minutes to discuss opioid litigation of which the county is part, but took no action after returning to open session. Commissioners were given an update on the status of the opioid litigation during the closed session, Robeson County Attorney Rob Davis said.</p><p>Dial commended elementary students who participated in the Project Trash Talk anti-littering program implemented by the Public Schools of Robeson County. Dial spoke of a visit she made with a first-grade class, in which students had learned much from the program.</p><p>\"That was just so encouraging, so encouraging to me to know that we, thanks to Commissioner (David) Edge, have implemented this program that I hope will certainly help us in the future as we move forward with our littering issue in the county,\" Dial said.</p><p>Edge shared his concern about the program.</p><p>He discovered that the anti-littering program he helped shape and launch in PSRC's elementary schools on the week of Earth Day was not being taught at every school, Edge said. After contacting multiple schools in his district, he found that principals weren't enforcing the program and not all teachers had been teaching it.</p><p>\"So, I called the superintendent's office. I thought they needed to know,\" Edge said.</p><p>He was called back later and told that a miscommunication occurred and principals thought it was optional, but the curriculum would be launched then, the commissioner said.</p><p>Dial said she was met with confusion when she reached out to schools in her district the week of Earth Day. She then made some telephone calls.</p><p>Principals later met and the curriculum moved forward, she said. And many schools launched the curriculum this past week.</p><p>\"I think it's on, it's on track now,\" Edge said.</p><p>He understood it was a miscommunication, but was still a little disappointed, Edge said.</p><p>\"I am still excited about the curriculum and going forward. It has got to make a difference,\" he said.</p><p>Commissioner Lance Herndon said the curriculum should be taught more than just once a year during the week of Earth Day.</p><p>\"I would love to see it be a yearlong focus,\" he said.</p><p>Herndon said parts of the curriculum could be taught at the beginning, middle and end of the year.</p><p>\"I think it does, it does make a difference, and especially if they hear it more than one time,\" Herndon said.</p><p>Edge agreed and said he plans to meet with PSRC administration and invited other commissioners to attend with him.</p><p>He also hopes to push the curriculum to other parts of the state.</p><p>\"It is a problem with our state,\" Edge said.</p><p>The program could be \"an important fix\" to that problem, Edge said.</p><p>Also during Monday's meeting, commissioners approved resolutions to accept the following bids for property plus the cost of advertising: $3,400 for 110 Anita Road in Pembroke; $9,275 for two parcels on Marietta Road in Marietta; and $4,000 for 615 Canal St. in Fairmont.</p><p>Dial also said Teacher Appreciation Week and National Nurses Week are here, and commissioners should consider showing those employees appreciation for their services.</p><p>Commissioners will hear an update on broadband assessment from David Richardson, executive director of Lumber River Council of Governments, at the next scheduled meeting. Richardson could not attend Monday's meeting to present because of a death in his family.</p><p>\"The board would certainly like to send our condolences,\" Dial said. \"So, we look forward to hearing Mr. Richardson at our next meeting in May.\"</p><p>The next board of commissioners meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m. May 17.</p><p>Reach Jessica Horne at 910-416-5165 or via email at [email protected]</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Robesonian (Lumberton, N.C.)

I'd gone to stay at Mount Athos, this peninsula of holy land with stone monasteries, olive groves, vineyards and no electricity, where women haven't set foot since the fourth century for fear of them outshining the Virgin Mary. I hoped for some cosmic revelations from a wizened hermit or sagacious pilgrim, but after the first day of standing in line to kiss icons next to sweaty, unwashed men and getting answers like \"because it felt right\" when I asked the monks why they had joined, I got bored.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I asked if I could work, and the head deacon sent me to what they called the \"Koimitiria\" -- Sleeping Area, where I found a guy in camo pants and a long-sleeve gray shirt digging into this wet dirt. \"I'll shovel,\" he said, \"you wheelbarrow,\" and I said ok. After a few full barrels, I asked him what we were doing. He said the rain had uncovered some graves that they hadn't known about, so they had to put the bones into shrines to rest.\u00a0</p><p>First, we pulled out the rocks. Big, flat ones that could have come from a castle wall. Under them was a packed dirt rectangle, woven with hairy pink roots and an arch of teeth poking up from one end. \"This is all man is,\" the guy said. \"That's why you have to care for your soul.\" He dug with a small trowel, pulling dirt out from under where the feet should be, pausing to pick out the little toe bones. \"You're here for a reason too,\" he said. \"You may not know it yet, but something brought you here.\"</p><p>I asked him what brought him there. He said he was still an initiate, and he said he was trying to \"escape his demons.\" He said he'd wanted desperately to get married and when he realized that he was only doing it to hide from something, or to cover up something, he had to make a change, so he came in. And I might be imagining this, but something about the way he smiled or the way he asked if I \"had a girl... or something\" suggested he was gay.\u00a0</p><p>We kept digging. I found the calcaneus, the heel bone, but had forgotten the Greek word for it, so I said, \"The place where Achilles was vulnerable,\" and he laughed. \"All man is,\" he said again, and again with the pelvic bones. They all had this glassy brown hue. Brother, I wanted to tell him, there are places you can go. There are places where you can be free, where no one will tell you you're a sinner for whom or how you love or how you identify. Or if they do, we've collectively agreed that those people are the sick ones.</p><p>But I didn't. I wondered what would be a better gift: to \"free\" him of his concept of sin, or to leave him believing that his path was the right one. Maybe there was no right one. I kept digging, hoping that some clarity would come to me, but it didn't, and soon we had two buckets full of glassy brown bones. I'd expected more solemnity, but the four-hour endeavor felt a little like deboning a turkey carcass with my uncle some Christmases before.\u00a0</p><p>I thought of this monk last week after dinner with some pod-mates. One of them, a fellow veteran, had asked during dinner if she could bring over a friend, a guy friend, and we all went \"Oooooh,\" like we were in eight grade, and she'd blushed and said \"No, no, no, it's not like that,\" and told us that she had a boyfriend. But after the dinner, she stood at my door kind of shifty-footed and said, \"You know why she didn't come over? The friend?\" I said no and dug into a tub of ice cream because I'd forgotten all about him. \"Because he wanted to talk in private,\" she said. \"Because he has something important to tell me.\" She paused and then asked, \"Am I about to be rebounded with?\"</p><p>I don't know what I said then. Something milquetoast. And she said she was confident in her defenses and her maturity and she knows better than to cross that boundary between friendship and lust and so on. But something in her eyes and her posture showed fear. And it was only after she left, after I'd pushed the table against the wall and stacked the pizza boxes by the recycling bin and was making faces at myself while brushing my teeth that I realized what I should have said.</p><p>\"God I hope so,\" I should have told her. I hope you get rebounded on. I hope you trip and fall so madly in love that we have to scrape your pieces back together like those goopy crumbs you find under your stove coils.\u00a0</p><p>Because here's the thing, I should have told her. We're all going to die. You're going to die and I'm going to die and so will everyone we know and love. And sometime long after that, our sun will burst and swallow our little blue rock, and everything human we ever knew will be long forgotten, or its digital memory will be carried away on solar sailboats in the quantum brains of our robot descendants. But right now, we're alive. Through pandemics, murder hornets, racial awakenings and forest fire smoke that literally blocked out the sun. What are we saving ourselves for?</p><p>You only get so many chances to feel things, I should have told her, and they will never be enough. Never enough trembling fingers hovering over the \"Send\" arrow. Never enough sitting in the bleachers in the rain with a head on your shoulder and floodlights on the rugby field and the sound of cleats in the slick mud. Never enough flowers picked, never enough slow dances, never enough cursing yourself for not saying what you wanted to say, or standing under a blood-pink morning sky, asking someone to love you when you know they can't.</p><p>So please, I should have told her, go out and feel things. Because one day there will be nothing left of you to guard or regret. Not even glassy brown bones.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4987746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62KV-J041-DY7P-T49H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Stanford Daily: Stanford University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 4, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Stanford</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CNRX</classCode><className>RELIGIOUS PILGRIMAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000777</classCode><className>LGBTQ+ PERSONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC319</classCode><className>GREECE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

James Madison is the most recent addition. Those memo\u00adri\u00adalized through statues leave behind a common legacy. These politi\u00adcians, founding fathers, and abo\u00adli\u00adtionists greatly con\u00adtributed to freedom and democracy, sup\u00adporting the United States during its darkest days with passion and bravery.</p><p>Barton's life and legacy, equally matched in service to the American people, also deserves recog\u00adnition.</p><p>Barton was born in 1821 to a pros\u00adperous farming family in Oxford, Mass\u00ada\u00adchu\u00adsetts. She first became a teacher, founding schools for poor stu\u00addents. Barton never received formal training as a nurse and her expe\u00adrience caring for a sick older brother was her only medical back\u00adground. After the Civil War erupted in 1861, Barton's nursing skills and affinity for charity aided mil\u00adlions of people across the country.</p><p>Barton encoun\u00adtered the war while working as a recording clerk in the U.S. Patent Office in Wash\u00adington D.C. - the first woman to hold such a position. Barton began her work by bringing sup\u00adplies to the men of the 6th Mass\u00ada\u00adchu\u00adsetts Infantry, many of whom she knew. Her staunch support for abo\u00adlition and love for the troops, inspired her orga\u00adnized effort to help the sol\u00addiers as they pursued liberty for all.</p><p>Barton's resilience was a weapon for the Union. She gained access to field hos\u00adpitals where she main\u00adtained a flow of sup\u00adplies and medical assis\u00adtance. According to the Red Cross' biog\u00adraphy of Barton, \"fol\u00adlowing the battle of Cedar Mountain in northern Vir\u00adginia in August 1862, she appeared at a field hos\u00adpital at mid\u00adnight with a wagon-load of sup\u00adplies drawn by a four-mule team.\"</p><p>Barton risked her life on the front lines of major battles including Fairfax Station, Harpers Ferry, Antietam, Fred\u00ader\u00adicksburg, and Charleston among others. The Red Cross' his\u00adtorical accounts note that \"at Antietam, she ordered the drivers of her supply wagons to follow the cannon, and traveled all night actually pulling ahead of mil\u00aditary medical units. While the battle raged, she and her asso\u00adciates dashed about bringing relief and hope to the field.\"</p><p>Barton con\u00adsis\u00adtently put the sol\u00addiers' well\u00adbeing before her own.</p><p>She wrote: \"I always tried ... to succor the wounded until medical aid and sup\u00adplies could come up - I could run the risk; it made no dif\u00adference to anyone if I were shot or taken prisoner.\"</p><p>After the war, Barton estab\u00adlished the Office of Cor\u00adre\u00adspon\u00addence with Friends of the Missing Men of the United States Army, which answered 63,000 letters and iden\u00adtified 22,000 missing men, alive or deceased, over four years.</p><p>From the beginning of the war to the end, Barton cared for the living and dead troops. At Antietam she removed a bullet from a man's face, though she was not a surgeon. She was also in charge of orga\u00adnizing the tent hos\u00adpitals. After the war, she insisted upon the cre\u00adation of a national cemetery in Georgia and through her efforts, 13,000 graves were iden\u00adtified and memo\u00adri\u00adalized.</p><p>The end of the Civil War closed an extra\u00ador\u00addinary chapter in Barton's human\u00adi\u00adtarian work, but she had much more to give. On a visit to Switzerland, she was impressed by the Red Cross orga\u00adni\u00adzation for dis\u00adaster relief and victims of war. She nego\u00adtiated with three dif\u00adferent pres\u00adi\u00addents over five years to have her plans for an American branch approved. In 1881, the American Asso\u00adci\u00adation of the Red Cross was formed, and Barton served as its first pres\u00adident until 1904.</p><p>Though she was a pow\u00ader\u00adhouse of charity and unceasing devotion to her country during her life, Barton's legacy con\u00adtinues to aid mil\u00adlions of Amer\u00adicans. Now in its 139th year, the American Red Cross admin\u00adisters to dis\u00adaster victims, facil\u00adi\u00adtates blood donation, and sup\u00adports mil\u00aditary fam\u00adilies around the world. Most recently, they have aided those affected by the Cal\u00adi\u00adfornia wild\u00adfires.</p><p>Clara Barton's purpose in life was the good of her country. Despite never having the right to vote, she was a hero of war, a nego\u00adtiator with pres\u00adi\u00addents, and the founder of an orga\u00adni\u00adzation that sup\u00adports people around the globe to this day. Barton's exem\u00adplary ded\u00adi\u00adcation to freedom and charity more than qual\u00adifies her for res\u00adi\u00addency on the Liberty Walk.</p><p>Lily McHale is a junior George Wash\u00adington Fellow studying political economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4807766</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:617B-2021-DY7P-T0YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hillsdale Collegian: Hillsdale College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>AMERICAN RED CROSS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Hillsdale</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N621399MG</classCode><className>NURSES &amp;

Overall, credit to these commodities has increased by 40% since the Paris Agreement was signed in December 2015. As of April 2020, investors also held USD 37 billion in bonds and shares in these companies.</p><p>Banco do Brasil was found to be the largest creditor overall, having provided USD 30 billion to forest-risk commodity operations, since 2016. This was almost exclusively for companies operating in Brazil, going into beef, soy and pulp and paper operations. Also in the top five of largest creditors are the Brazilian bank Bradesco, with USD 7.5 billion, the Dutch bank Rabobank, with USD 6.3 billion, US-based JPMorgan Chase, with USD 5.8 billion, and Japanese bank Mizuho Financial, with USD 5.5 billion. Launched by Forests &amp; Finance -- an initiative by the Forests &amp; Finance Coalition including Rainforest Action Network (RAN), TuK INDONESIA, Profundo, Reporter Brasil, Amazon Watch and BankTrack -- the database reveals the financial flows between January 2013 and April 2020 to more than 300 of the biggest forest-risk commodity companies whose operations impact forests in Southeast Asia, Central and West Africa, and Brazil.</p><p>Despite various multilateral and industry commitments to zero deforestation, tropical deforestation has nearly doubled over the past 10 years. Forests are being primarily cleared for agribusiness commodities, often illegally and with strong ties to corruption, tax evasion and organized crime. Collectively known as forest-risk, the commodities are beef, palm oil, pulp &amp; paper, rubber, soy and timber. In 2019 alone, tropical deforestation reached 11.9 million hectares. Deforestation and the associated loss of wildlife habitat is also a critical factor in the emergence of zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19, according to the UN Environment Programme. Credit and investment is critical to the expansion and day-to-day operations of companies responsible for deforestation.</p><p>\"Right now, intentionally lit fires are burning through the world's last remaining rainforests as fire is used as a 'cheap' way to clear land for commodity production. Global banks and investors are knowingly financing agribusiness giants that are fueling the fires,\" said Merel van der Mark, Coordinator of the Forests and Finance Coalition. \"Despite the financial sector's commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, their pursuit of profits are driving us toward a climate and public health disaster at full speed.\"</p><p>Just 15 banks [1] accounted for approximately 60% of the USD 154 billion in credit extended to forest-risk companies since the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement. Eight of these banks are signatories to the UN's Principles for Responsible Banking, which includes a commitment to align bank operations with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including SDG 15 to \"halt deforestation [and] restore degraded forests\" by 2020. In terms of source finance, banks from Brazil, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, United States and Japan represented the largest flows of finance. These findings illustrate the lack of regulations and company policies necessary to bring the financial sector into line with global environmental and social priorities.</p><p>\"Banks and investors doing business in Indonesia are routinely financing deforestation, destruction of peat and human rights violations, via client operations. Yet banks are failing to disclose these direct business impacts - including the deadly annual haze - to the public, shareholders or regulators,\" said Edi Sutrisno of TuK-INDONESIA. \"Urgent reforms are needed that compel banks to implement stricter lending criteria and which open up the financial sector to greater public scrutiny and monitoring.\"</p><p>\"The Amazon's indigenous peoples are facing a catastrophic burning season heaping tragedy on the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Christian Poirier of Amazon Watch. \"Fires across the BrazilianAmazon are at a 10-year high, with a 77 percent increase on indigenous territories since last year. These spikes are the product of criminal deforestation and arson fueled by forest-risk commodities and bankrolled by global financial giants. To global banks and investors: this database unequivocally exposes your complicity in this disaster.\"</p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Contact: Emma Rae Lierley, communications manager, forests, 425/281-1989 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:emma@ran.org\">emma@ran.org</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7223480 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7223480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RS-6BF1-DYG2-R3H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><timeReceived>9:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Tucker is up next. And always remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome at TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the summer of 2020, mobs of Joe Biden voters destroyed big parts of the City of Minneapolis. They looted stores. They burned a police station. They murdered people. But they did this, we were informed at the time, in the name of something called racial justice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But then we saw that some of the mob turned out to be privileged White kids, the children of lawyers from Bethesda. But, they said they were rioting on behalf of so-called marginalized communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They were working for racial justice. And because of that, they couldn't be punished for what they did. Nor, by the way, were they required to wear COVID masks like the rest of us. That's how holy their mission was. They're exempt from the normal laws of civilization. Kamala Harris raised money for them like they were missionaries. You probably remember that.</p><p>But do you recall what happened next in Minneapolis? That's the part of the story the media had no interest in covering, and they never do.</p><p>The iron law of liberal social activism is that you never revisit the scenes of your moral victories. You give a speech declaring yourself a good person and you go home. You don't return to Selma or Soweto or Ferguson, Missouri, to see how the people there are doing because it's not about those people. It's about you and your newly enhanced moral authority, which is instantly convertible to political power and cash. Ask Barack Obama.</p><p>But in the spring of 2021, one reporter decided to break with protocol and go back to Minneapolis a year later. He wanted to see what racial justice had done for the city. His name was Michael Tracey, and as you can imagine, he writes for Substack, not \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>One night, while Tracey was in Minneapolis, a man walked into a Somali- owned convenience store and murdered the clerk. Tracey wanted to know why that happened. So, he started to interview people in the neighborhood and one of them told him this: \"African-Americans are hunting Somalis in Minneapolis.\" Why is that? Well, because: \"They believe Somalis are getting special favors from the government.\"</p><p>Are you surprised to hear that? You should not be surprised because when government creates a spoils system based on race and ethnicity -- and our government certainly has done that -- division and violence are the inevitable outcomes. That is true always and everywhere. That fact never changes.</p><p>And liberals for many decades used to pretend to understand that. That's why they opposed Jim Crow and the Nuremberg Laws. But at some point, and it would be interesting to know precisely when and why, liberals enthusiastically embraced the racial spoils system they once claimed to hate.</p><p>This is unfolding across the country, but it's especially prevalent in places liberals control. The more power liberals have, the more sweeping and rigid the race-based spoils system they create.</p><p>In California, of course, they have absolute power, and that's why the government of San Francisco has just announced they will send you money if you have the right skin color.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KTVU REPORTER: More cities and counties in the Bay Area are starting guaranteed income programs for the most vulnerable people in their communities.</p><p>The Silicon Valley Guaranteed Income Pilot Program says it will target people of color, undocumented, and mixed-status families, and women-led households. One-hundred fifty families will get $1,000.00 a month for two years with no strings attached.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"The most vulnerable people in the community.\" If you're the most vulnerable person in the community, you get a thousand dollars a month. But that specifically does not include the homeless guy OD'ing in the park on fentanyl if he is White. If he is White, he can die because if he's White, even if he's dying, he is by definition not vulnerable.</p><p>California now has many programs like this. The State has now proposed a reparations program for the descendants of slaves. It seems simple, but there's a problem with it. How do you know who qualifies for reparations? It's been a long time. It's been more than 150 years since slavery, and Americans have made a lot of babies since then, and many of them are interracial.</p><p>So at this point, there are plenty of White people in America who are descended from slaves. There are plenty of Black people in America who are descended from slave owners. That's just true. So how do you know who qualifies for government reparations?</p><p>Well, of course, there's only one way to find out and it is old-fashioned Nazi race science. Nazi race science. So the State will have to certify the racial purity of its citizens in order to send them money. That's going to have to happen.</p><p>Do we really want to go there? Do we really want to do that? Amazingly, liberals really do.</p><p>The City of San Francisco just fired its Elections Director, a man called John Arntz, because he is White. We're not guessing at that. The President of San Francisco's Election Commission, Chris Jerdonek, confirmed that was the reasoning. And we're quoting: \"Our decision,\" he said to the man who was fired, \". was not about your performance. But after 20 years, we wanted to take action on the city's racial equity plan and give people an opportunity to compete for a leadership position.\" Fired for his skin color.</p><p>Aren't we against that? Didn't we have a Civil Rights movement to stop that? And by the way, in this specific case, the guy who got fired, John Arntz, single-handedly ended widespread corruption and incompetence in San Francisco's election. He had the job for two decades.</p><p>They used to have ballot boxes turning up regularly in the San Francisco Bay. That was fraud. He stopped it. But his skin color was the problem. The shade of his skin was more offensive to liberals in San Francisco than fraudulent elections.</p><p>Now, there was an outcry over this and Arntz ultimately got his job back. But the City of San Francisco -- the government, not just the people, the government -- still endorses the idea of punishing people based on their skin color.</p><p>The City of San Francisco just launched a separate guaranteed income program, this one for \"pregnant Black women.\" It pays up to a thousand dollars a month. And that program got more than $5 million more in State funding, so it's expanding now to Los Angeles, Riverside, Contra Costa County, Alameda.</p><p>The left-wing group, Expecting Justice just put together this promo for the program. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NARRATOR: Many people don't realize this, but here in San Francisco, Black and Pacific Islander women have a significantly more risk of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and pregnancy complications than other people. And people also don't realize that this risk is primarily due to racism, both structural racism and the racism that birthing people and mothers experience when they're interacting with physicians and other medical providers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So that is, every word of it, a racist lie. There's precisely no evidence that structural racism exists in this country against the communities she is talking about, and none whatsoever that it causes higher infant mortality. There is no science whatsoever. That's just, again, a racist lie.</p><p>But more to the point, nobody who says birthing people should ever be in charge of handing out money to mothers, much less taxpayers' money.</p><p>But of course, that's happening. And that tells you, well, this is a grift. This is a scam designed to shunt money from people who make it to people who vote for the right party.</p><p>And that's why Sheila Jackson Lee recently demanded billions of dollars of reparations. Because that, she said, would have been a much better way to deal with COVID.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX): Interestingly, a recent peer-reviewed study from Harvard Medical School suggests that reparations for African- Americans could have cut COVID-19 transmission and infection rates, both among Blacks and the population at-large.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, she's obviously a fringe character and easy to make fun of. But it wasn't just Sheila Jackson Lee. That was the official position. That was the prevailing view of the Democratic Party in 2020. Vote for us and we'll give reparations based on skin color.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has proposed a bill to form a Commission to study how to do reparations.</p><p>KAMALA HARRIS, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I am elected President, I am signing that.</p><p>SHARPTON: Would you sign that bill?</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes.</p><p>SHARPTON: Would you sign it?</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If the House and Senate pass that bill, of course I would sign it.</p><p>KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I firmly support Congresswoman Jackson Lee's bill to create a Commission to study reparations.</p><p>SHARPTON: Would you sign the bill for reparations?</p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, I would. I already support that bill.</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There are things that we need to do in this country that have been a long time in coming. One of those is to move forward with reparations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So again, it's hard to overstate just how crazy and divisive that is. In order for that to work in practice, you would have to take people's blood and figure out what percentage they were of one race or the other. Maybe measure their heads. You would wind up with Nazi race science, with racial purity tests.</p><p>And no decent person wants to live in a country where the government does that. It's obviously a dead end and a terrible idea, and it would, of course, promote violence and division. So that's a non-starter when you think about it.</p><p>But Joe Biden decided he was going to get around a national debate on reparations simply by just doing it, throwing it in the farm bill. Biden, right after he took office, allocated billions of dollars in farm aid based on race -- just on race.</p><p>A Judge, thankfully, shut that down, but they didn't slow down in their effort to create a racial spoils system. They don't care about what it does to the country.</p><p>So Kamala Harris suggested that certain communities, based on their skin color, deserved faster hurricane response.</p><p>So there's an entire Civil Rights department at the Justice Department, a division, designed to stop the government from rewarding or punishing people on the basis of skin color. That was the whole point of the Civil Rights movement. But they're doing nothing. Of course, they're encouraging it because Democrats run the government.</p><p>So as a result, California has launched yet another basic income program, this time for trans people. Really? How is that going to work? How do you prove you're trans? Can anyone even define what that means? No.</p><p>But here's San Francisco supervisor Rafael Mandelman bragging about how much taxpayer money London Breed gives to people for being trans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAFAEL MANDELMAN, SAN FRANCISCO SUPERVISOR: Every single year, this woman comes forward with groundbreaking and unprecedented investments in queer people, in the most vulnerable queer people.</p><p>She focuses on the transgender community, and she has talked about some of it. Universal basic income in San Francisco, unprecedented investments directed at unhoused trans folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: \"The most vulnerable people.\" Really? How are we measuring vulnerability when \"The View\" supports and celebrates your existence every single day? When every fashionable person in America posts tributes to you on social media every week, how vulnerable are you? Let's get right to it. Let's measure that by household income.</p><p>Is the household income of the average trans person in America higher or lower than it is on an Indian reservation? Hmm. Is it higher or lower than it is in rural Iowa?</p><p>And by the way, what is transgender? On the current application in San Francisco, there are 97 different gender options available, 19 sexual orientations. These would include aromantic, demisexual, dike, pansexual, same-gender loving and skoliosexual.</p><p>So at this point, probably not going to get California back into the realm of functional and sane. Twenty years from now, that will be a deeply poor State presided over by a small group of incredibly rich people. Every normal person of all colors will have left and moved to Florida. Probably no fixing it at this point. They'll be cutting the Redwood Forests, selling them for money.</p><p>You know exactly where this is going. Look at Bolivia.</p><p>But what can the rest of us, in the other 49 states, learn from what's happening in California?</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson has spent his life there. His family has been there for generations. He is with the Hoover Institute. We're happy to have him join us now.</p><p>Professor, thanks so much for coming on. It seems to me that once you get down this path where government decides certain races or certain orientations are better than others, like how do you fix that?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: I don't think you do. You're like the former Yugoslavia and financially once something is not sustainable. It's not sustainable.</p><p>What do you outlined, Tucker was predicated on three things. One was Silicon Valley's big money infusions, and now they're laying off people, and companies are fleeing because of the regulatory atmosphere. Forty-five percent of the population is Latino. Many of them are upwardly mobile, they're not allies in some rainbow coalition with the fight or some who are African-American.</p><p>They're against reparations, and many of them are starting to become more conservative, and the so-called White middle class and upper middle class entrepreneurial classes, leaving at the rate of 300,000 a year, and that's why we have the highest taxes income among the highest sales, the highest gas taxes, and yet, we're having a $25 billion shortfall with these types of programs, so it's not sustainable.</p><p>And I don't know how you stop it. There is no way I can foresee it stopping because this is just the veneer. I mean, we rate in the bottom 10 percent of schools. We have the highest property crime rates in the country in San Francisco, we have one-third of the nation's welfare recipients, 40 percent of the homeless, 21 percent living below the poverty level, we have about 40 percent of the illegal aliens in the nation.</p><p>So it's all been a gravy train fed by Silicon Valley money and upper middle class one percent paying 50 percent of the income tax and it's coming to a close. There's running out of money.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, I wonder if they know that. I mean, you'd hate to see them get to a point where they have to sell the State's natural resources to keep going, they have to, you know, sell Lake Tahoe to Arizona.</p><p>But it seems Just like they're on an express train to that place. Does anybody in leadership understand this?</p><p>HANSON: No, I think they'd rather be ideologically correct and broke than be prosperous and incorrect because we're sitting on some of the largest gas and oil deposits of the 50 States. We have the richest agricultural sector in the world. We have enormous resources in timber and mining. We're not using any of it. That's all off limits. And we're trying to destroy the agricultural sector by cutting off the water.</p><p>We haven't reinvested in this once wonderful infrastructure, aqueducts, lakes, freeways. We've got this high speed rail $15 billion boondoggle that looks like Stonehenge covered with graffiti unfinished. They don't want to do what would save them and they're going over the cliff like lemmings.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and I wish you were wrong, but you would know and I think you're right.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson, thank you.</p><p>HANSON: I wish I was, too. It is tragic.</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: It is tragic. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>So why degrade the US military? It's like the one institution most Americans are really proud of, really love without reservation, in an ingenuous sweet way. But the leaders of the US military, not the enlisted ranks, but the people in charge are going out of their way to embarrass the institution at every opportunity. Why are they doing that?</p><p>You've probably seen the latest. Images of a US Army Colonel who posted pictures of himself in uniform wearing bondage gear. This Colonel also uploaded pornographic pictures that appeared have been taken inside US military installations.</p><p>The pictures have been online for a long time. So we reached out to the military about this. You'd think they'd have a response by now, but of course they don't.</p><p>They told us this quote: \"The US Army Pacific is aware of the content found on social media reflecting soldiers activities wearing uniforms. The incident is currently under investigation.\" Right. Meaning, nothing will ever happen.</p><p>They'll protect this guy just as a protected Army Major Chris Schilling who used his position at a military base to scare the hell out of a mother on Facebook, for dissenting from the approved narrative. Nothing will ever happen to you.</p><p>The only person we are aware of in the entire US military who has been punished was one patriotic Marine officer who said, wait a second, this Afghanistan pullout is a disaster, and of course, he went right to jail. Amazing.</p><p>Well, one of the many things we learned about Mike Tyson is that he loves animals and doesn't just love them, but learns from them. Amazing.</p><p>He tells us about his tigers and what happens when you make them mad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE TYSON, FORMER PROFESSIONAL BOXER: They walk by and pow, hit you with a piss. Holy [bleep]. They do this to you sometimes.</p><p>CARLSON: They do out of contempt or love or why do they do that?</p><p>TYSON: Sometimes you piss them off. Sometimes they are doing jokes on you and they piss on you.</p><p>They just walk by and they rub up to you, and face licking and then walk, pow, and it comes from the back. And it comes out because they don't go like, they kind of drop down, it comes up, pow. It hits you right -- and the smell of the piss -- holy [bleep].</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That man spent 14 years with two 400-pound tigers in his bed on either side for real, and learned a lot more from them.</p><p>More from the man straight ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: According to official tallies, Kari Lake lost her bid to become the next Arizona Governor by just over 17,000 votes. That's a tiny margin in a big State.</p><p>Now Lake is suing the State's election officials. She says many ballots were not properly counted. She also says her opponent, then Secretary of State Katie Hobbs worked illegally with Big Tech to silence voters online, and for the record that appears to be true.</p><p>Lake is also setting widespread printer failures in Maricopa County, also true. She says they prevented people from voting. Maricopa County claimed they didn't stop anyone from voting, but has not responded further.</p><p>We reached out to Katie Hobbs' office and got no reply at all. Kari Lake joins us tonight.</p><p>Kari Lake, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>So Maricopa County is as far as I understand it, does not deny that a huge number of printers didn't work on Election Day, but they're saying it had no effect.</p><p>KARI LAKE (R), FORMER ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it had a huge effect, obviously, Tucker.</p><p>Our voters were showing up on Election Day. That was no secret. And the minute the polls opened, the wheels fell off. The ballot printers weren't working. There wasn't enough toner in the printers. The tabulators weren't working. It became a debacle.</p><p>And the line started forming right away, some of the lines three hours, four hours, five hours. And there's video of people walking out of line, people told us and this is in our lawsuit that they showed up they couldn't even find parking because the parking lots were full and the lines were long and many people didn't even get to vote.</p><p>And those who did vote when they went up to, you know, get the printer out, the printer didn't have toner in it, so the ballots weren't dark enough, and our voters were showing up and voting two to one for me on Election Day.</p><p>We vote for a full month in Arizona with early ballots and on Election Day when the Republicans showed up, the Election Day voting was sabotaged and that's what our case is going to prove. It's a 70-page lawsuit that reads like a real crime novel and it's shocking what they did.</p><p>The man who runs Maricopa County elections ran a PAC. He actually started a PAC raising thousands of dollars to defeat me and he is running our elections. And then my opponent oversees all the elections in Arizona. It was a conflict of interest. And not only was Katie Hobbs working with Big Tech to censor people, the man who runs Maricopa County elections, they were also censoring people as well online.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think anyone denies that a lot of the voting machinery didn't work on Election Day. I mean, I don't think that's a controversial point, it remains an observation. But weren't they tested all the day before?</p><p>LAKE: They are supposed to be tested, but they weren't tested. They weren't tested in the appropriate way, and they didn't have the basics like toner in these machines. I mean, this is real basic stuff. It's not like we don't know when Election Day is.</p><p>We can figure out what Election Day is from here to eternity, and they were not prepared. And we will have an expert testifying that this could not have happened by accident. There had to be malicious intent. We have an excellent Court case. And we had our first hearing yesterday, and set up a time for our trial to begin, and it will be next Tuesday, and we will be presenting a lot of evidence.</p><p>We have four whistleblowers, one that worked for a company called Runbeck, who said there were 300,000 ballots inserted into the system that had no chain of custody. Others who were in the Voter Signature Verification Department said tens of thousands of ballots were rejected because there were no signatures or scribbles and they somehow got thrown in and counted anyways.</p><p>There are a plethora of problems that went down in Maricopa County, and if somebody doesn't stand up and say, we can't have our elections being run this way, then we will never have another fair election.</p><p>I mean, 60 percent of the polling places on Election Day were in operational or non-functioning. When did we stop and say enough is enough? Would it have to get to 80 percent? Ninety percent? A hundred percent? When do we say we need to have our elections run fair?</p><p>CARLSON: I completely agree with you. And if you care about democracy, this should be the top of your list. I'm glad you're doing this. Kari Lake, thank you for telling us about it tonight. Good to see you.</p><p>LAKE: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So Atlanta isn't just any other city, it is what New York is to the Northeast and Los Angeles is to the West and Chicago is the Midwest and Denver is the Mountain State. It's the hub of an entire region. And it's a nice place.</p><p>So if Atlanta starts to fall apart, you should care. The murder rate in that city is up 78 percent in just the last month. One of the victims was an elderly woman who was stabbed to death in a gated community during an attempted carjacking. Here is a local news report from FOX5 in Atlanta.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOX5 REPORTER: Family and friends of 77-year-old Ellen Bowles say she had a kind heart and a love for all living things.</p><p>This man who they call a person of interest seen on a neighbor's security video.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are really sad, and we are particularly concerned about Michael, you know her son who found her.</p><p>FOX5 REPORTER: Michael Bowles discovered his mom's body stabbed to death in her own garage in this gated community on Paces West Terrace over the weekend.</p><p>Her car, a black 2021 Lexus SUV was gone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So a lot of these crimes are taking place in the neighborhood that pays a lot of the taxes in Atlanta, the northern part of the city is called Buckhead.</p><p>Buckhead has been thinking about leaving Atlanta for quite some time. It has now announced plans to do that, but the State's Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan paused the Buckhead City Referendum Bill to give the Mayor time to fix the crime problem.</p><p>Has the Mayor fixed the crime problem? Apparently not.</p><p>Bill White is the Chairman and CEO of Buckhead City, Georgia. He joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. White, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>So they said they were going to make it better. It doesn't sound like they have made it better for the people of Buckhead.</p><p>BILL WHITE, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BUCKHEAD CITY, GEORGIA: No, sir. Thank you, Tucker, for having us on.</p><p>Our heart goes out to Eleanor Bowles' family and just about three weeks prior to that, Chris Eberhart, a contractor was brutally murdered. Both assailants were in the progress of robbing or committing crimes. One was being chased by APD, the Atlanta Police Department, the other was being chased by the liquor store owner who called the police. The police didn't show up to pick him up. He went over a wall and stabbed beautiful Eleanor Bowles to death.</p><p>The other man got in a car accident after APD didn't chase him and he went off and shot Chris Eberhart, a 57-year-old contractor and stole his car as well.</p><p>Listen, crime is not down in Buckhead and the Mayor keeps coming into Atlanta and he says when there is a murder of Buckhead, hey, Buckhead, crime is down. You know, sit down, shut up, pay your taxes.</p><p>And I'm telling you the people of Buckhead have had it. Atlanta can no longer protect us, Tucker, so we have no choice here. It is our only choice to stand up for ourselves and fight back.</p><p>You know, the DA Fani Willis who is busy prosecuting someone we all know, for a phone call with 18 lawyers didn't prosecute these two folks who killed both of those people and they should have been in jail, not being out to be able to kill these two beautiful souls.</p><p>So we're fighting to get this Bill passed, and we have a new Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones, we have a newly elected Governor Brian Kemp, a new Speaker, Jon Burns, and we're hoping that the Bill will pass so we can vote next November 7th, and make Buckhead safe, secure, and independent in very short order.</p><p>CARLSON: You do not have a moral obligation to pay for the corruption and violence of the City of Atlanta, which hates you. You don't. And I think it'll be an inspiration the entire country if you are able to pull this off and be your own city, independence. There is nothing wrong with that. It's America.</p><p>Bill White, Godspeed. We're really rooting for you. Thank you.</p><p>WHITE: Thank you so much, Tucker. And God bless you, sir.</p><p>CARLSON: Part two of our interview with Mike Tyson, straight ahead.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to \"FOX News Live.\" I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles.</p><p>The destructive storm system spawning deadly tornadoes as it rips across the South, it has left at least three people dead in Louisiana. The National Weather Service also warning more twisters are possible tonight from New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama.</p><p>The huge storm system is also delivering blizzardlike conditions to the Great Plains. The pre winter storm could also push snow into the Northeast.</p><p>Meantime, an investigation by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee claims there are indications that COVID-19 could be tied to China's Biological Weapons Research Program. But according to the report, the findings do not resolve the origins of COVID-19 beyond all doubt. It all states that there is no \"credible indication\" that the virus was intentionally rather than accidentally released.</p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>CARLSON: We showed you the first part of our conversation with Mike Tyson last night, one of the most interesting interviews we've ever done, but it got even better.</p><p>Mike Tyson, it turns out, doesn't just love animals. He watches them really carefully and has learned a lot. He told us what it's like to live with two tigers on his bed, and he told us how he felt about the men he faced off against in the ring. Here is a hint: He wanted to kill them, and he really meant it.</p><p>Here is part of the second half of our conversation with Mike Tyson from \"Tucker Carlson Today.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: How did you feel about the guys you were in the ring with?</p><p>TYSON: I wanted to kill them.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I can tell. Why did -- I'm laughing nervously --</p><p>You really felt that way? You wanted to --</p><p>TYSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: How did you get yourself into a frame of mind where you wanted to kill them?</p><p>TYSON: Just think about who I am, I don't want to go back there no more. I don't want to -- I don't want to be in that poverty state of mind anymore and not from a physical perspective, I don't want to be poverty struck in here.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. So would you sit and think about it before a fight? Think about the guy you are fighting?</p><p>TYSON: Absolutely. The more you hurt them, the higher you go in life. And so, that's just my mentality. The more you hurt him, the more people love you.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow, that's pretty intense and true, I guess. So when you knocked them out, you're satisfied? Happy?</p><p>TYSON: I don't really want to say -- yes, kind of yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What don't you want to say?</p><p>TYSON: It wasn't good enough. At that time in my life, it wasn't good enough.</p><p>CARLSON: You wanted to keep going --</p><p>TYSON: My total -- yes, I wanted to crush his spirit, I wanted everything he could be -- fierce like fire. If you know how to control it, it keeps us all warm. It heats our food and everything. But if you let it get out of control, it destroys you and everything around you.</p><p>CARLSON: How do you -- that's such a smart point. How do keep it in this box where it's the nuclear reactor that fuels you, but it's not the forest fire that destroys.</p><p>TYSON: I don't know, I was programmed. I could be in a room with a bunch of really bad -- you may consider bad, but very interesting people that I maybe shouldn't be able to leave that room, but it's just my projection of how I feel and I project it with everyone else.</p><p>CARLSON: Have you in the years since those fights, have you stayed in touch with any of the guys you fought?</p><p>TYSON: Holyfield.</p><p>CARLSON: Holyfield.</p><p>TYSON: We are business partners.</p><p>CARLSON: In the THC Gummy business.</p><p>TYSON: In all the marijuana stuff, pretty much. With the bites, Mike Bites, part of Holyfield's ear that was missing, to be able to come out with that, and we've been very successful with that. And I'm so happy that he is going to -- this is what I say, all right. Listen to this.</p><p>We're the only fighters in the history of the world that are still getting paid from a fight. 25 years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: It is true.</p><p>TYSON: Who's doing that?</p><p>CARLSON: You still have tigers?</p><p>TYSON: No, I have little kids. If I didn't have kids and just me at home, I would.</p><p>CARLSON: So when your kids grow older, you're going to have tigers again?</p><p>TYSON: I'm not going to be -- I'm not going to be strong enough to handle them. You've got to be tough with them sometimes.</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>TYSON: Yes. They understand. Listen. You don't have to tie them as much because they get offended and if you reprimand them, the lions are like dogs, hey, sit down. Hey, get over there. Just like dogs.</p><p>Cheetahs, too. Cheetahs are more dogs because cheetahs bark, they don't growl like cats, they purr, they bite. They bark. So most cats -- some cats are in the dog family.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? So a cheetah behaves like a dog.</p><p>TYSON: If a cheetah and the lions, tigers not so, but you can tell them what to do when they attack somebody, they will jump on you, they will come to go out with you. Tigers are not like that. They just want to hang out with you alone, they don't want to be friends with no one else.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it dangerous to have friends over when you've got tigers?</p><p>TYSON: I normally don't have them -- I have them in a cage when my friends come over.</p><p>CARLSON: So you're saying as you get older and you become less aggressive, the cats can smell that?</p><p>TYSON: Yes, they need -- listen, they have to be put in their place. The tiger knows he has to be put in his place and if you're not able to put him in his place, he is going to put you in your place.</p><p>CARLSON: So you've got to be the Cus D'Amato to his Mike Tyson.</p><p>TYSON: Absolutely. And it doesn't have to be brutal.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>TYSON: It doesn't have to be brutal. Listen, you can teach these cats, right, you can teach them, but very few like only half a percent could be trained. You can't tame them. You could train them, but you can tame them. Only half a percent can be tamed.</p><p>CARLSON: What's the difference?</p><p>TYSON: Well if you if you train them, they do tricks for you, you hang out with them, they do this and then you're going to put them away.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>TYSON: When you have them with you, they are just going to sleep on the bed with you.</p><p>CARLSON: You can do that?</p><p>TYSON: Yes. If I didn't have -- I had tigers in my bed and I have two of them in the bed, that's fine with me. They don't go well together, you stay in the bed, they want to get close. The next thing, you've got two 400- pound cats fighting and you're holy [bleep]. You're just trying to roll to the floor. You roll on the floor and they fighting on the bed. They want to get close to you, which one wants to get the closest, they fight.</p><p>CARLSON: How do you break up a tiger fight?</p><p>TYSON: I don't. You know what I mean? That's one beat down, and then he runs to me, the one tiger get behind me and this guy comes out --</p><p>CARLSON: It is like three in the morning in your bedroom.</p><p>TYSON: It's a fight.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think I can handle that level of drama.</p><p>TYSON: I didn't think I could either. That never happened to me before. I used to have them since they were first born, they slept with me, hanging out with me and this never happened before. It never happened, never thought about bringing them up, they come upstairs, they hang out.</p><p>But listen if they ever fought, I'd get -- the whole house, you have to leave. Yes, they fought. Oh, God. Holy. I had to get the whole house gets flushed out, man.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>TYSON: Oh, man. You can't -- you think somebody threw a nuclear bomb on you or something, you can't breathe?</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the musk.</p><p>TYSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Ooh, they're spraying that stuff everywhere.</p><p>TYSON: Listen, and if you're not careful, sometimes, they do this to you and then they walk by, pow, they hit you with the piss. Holy [bleep]. They're dissing you sometimes?</p><p>CARLSON: They do? Out of contempt or love or why do they do that?</p><p>TYSON: Sometimes you piss them off. Sometimes they're ding jokes on you and they piss on you. They just walk by, they rub up to you, and face licking and they walk, pow, and it comes from back. It comes out, and then you go like, they kind of drop down, and it comes back, pow. It hits you right -- and the smell of the piss, holy [bleep].</p><p>CARLSON: It's really strong.</p><p>TYSON: I mean, listen, ammonia don't have nothing on that.</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>TYSON: Well, hell, you can pass out when you got pissed, man. And when they do it, listen. It comes out like a spring, powerful, boom, the tail goes up and boom, it hits you. What the [bleep]. And you die in the smell, the smell is worse than the --</p><p>CARLSON: How long did you have big cats in your house?</p><p>TYSON: Fourteen years, thirteen years, something like that.</p><p>When people came in, I took him to their cage where they run around and stuff like that.</p><p>CARLSON: Did you ever worry you're going to get bitten?</p><p>TYSON: I should have been, but my ego told me, I've got the big mother's under control. They didn't talk to me and try to jump on me. You have to have the idea, but you have to show them respect.</p><p>You show them -- you don't show respect to these animals, you're finished. You've got to kiss them, love them, stroke them. Well, that's -- I show love.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: That whole second half the interview with Mike Tyson comes out tomorrow on FOX Nation. You can stream part one right now.</p><p>So TikTok isn't just a social media app, it is a tool of the Chinese government used for propaganda and also spying. Can we put up with this?</p><p>Senator Marco Rubio of Florida says, no, we shouldn't, not for one more minute. He joins us next.</p><p>CARLSON: I want to bring you a quick update on Joe Biden's nonbinary, dress-wearing, kleptomaniacal, underwear-stealing nuclear waste official, Sam Brinton.</p><p>Now you may recall, how could you forget that Brinton was busted stealing ladies' luggage from two different airports and subsequently let go for his weirdest fetish of all.</p><p>Now we want to bring you Sam Brinton's mugshot. You can see it in your screen. It looks a little different without the lipstick, a little more menacing, put the lipstick back on Sam Brinton. You're freaking us out.</p><p>So TikTok turns out to be by far -- didn't know this actually -- the most popular social media app in the United States, but the problem is it's owned by a Chinese company controlled by the Chinese government, and it is for that reason, a major security risk. Not only does it disseminate propaganda, it hurts the country, it also apparently is used for spying.</p><p>So the governments of a couple of States have already moved to block TikTok in government devices. Now, a US senator from Florida, Senator Marco Rubio has introduced legislation to ban TikTok.</p><p>Senator Rubio joins us tonight.</p><p>Senator, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So Republicans, conservatives are generally against banning private companies. Tell us why we should ban TikTok if you would?</p><p>RUBIO: Well, what we ban is their ability to make money in the country, and the reason is because it's basically a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Communist Party of China. You know, one thing, it's not about the content. Ultimately, I mean, we have free speech in this country, it's about how the data that's on it is being used. So that's number one.</p><p>Some people would say to me, well, what do we care if the Chinese government has access to the data on the phone of a 16-year-old teenager somewhere in America. It's not about the 16-year-old teenager, it's about millions of 16-year-old, 17-year-olds, 30-year-olds, people that are on there dumping all kinds of data that the government of China gets access to, on location, your pictures, your texts, your consumer behavior, what the algorithm is learning from you.</p><p>And then the other thing is, and this is what's really stunning to me, that the Chinese tried to interfere in our Midterm Elections. They were putting out videos discouraging people, and they were using the algorithms to do this, discouraging people from voting on a bipartisan basis or nonpartisan basis, and that's why I tell people if TikTok was a Russian company, there would be an FBI raid of their headquarters, at least they would be calling for it on the left.</p><p>So I think everyone agrees, they are a privacy danger to America, to our National Security, we shouldn't have the Communist Party of China having access to a treasure trove of American data that they can use to try to influence and divide us at the same time as they collect valuable information now and for the future.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we banned RT. I'm hoping that you're going to get at least one Democrat on your side on this, are you?</p><p>RUBIO: I think we will. Look, I think we have a lot of Democrats support for the concern about it. Now, Mark Warner is the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Him and I sent a letter together asking the Justice Department and Intelligence Agencies to speed up this review, but I don't think anything is going to come of it. I really don't.</p><p>I don't think at the end of the day that anything is going to come of the security review or that anything they do will take care of this problem.</p><p>I think we have to begin with the very basic principle, companies under the control of the Chinese Communist Party should not have access, unfettered access to the private data of millions and millions of Americans that they can then use against us for espionage for foreign policy for division.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you for saying that, and so crisply and nicely put. I hope you'll keep saying it. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, good to see you.</p><p>RUBIO: Thanks, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: So we're going to be issuing a very important and honestly heartfelt correction on our Mayor Pete Private Jet coverage. It turns out we were wrong, and we'll tell you how.</p><p>CARLSON: We told you the other night that Mayor Pete Buttigieg has taken at least 18 flights on a private jet. He is a one man Vesuvius of carbon emissions. Weird given his commitment to climate justice.</p><p>Jets like Mayor Pete's pollute a lot more per passenger than the commercial flight so after that report aired, the Transportation Department sent us this: \"Can you please update your story to reflect these flights are on an FAA government plane. This is not a private jet.\"</p><p>In other words, same amount of carbon but it's not on a private jet, it is a Cessna Citation 560 XL. There it is. You will little polluter, you carbon criminal. You should be brought to justice.</p><p>We are out of time, unfortunately. We can't do it.</p><p>We will see you tomorrow night at 8:00 PM. Here is Sean Hannity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2022121401cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:673C-7RJ1-JCP1-P3N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 14, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Race Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kari Lake</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TikTok</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Highspeed Rail</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk1MzI4MDYxOEUwNEU5REIwMEQ2QkY2RDM3NkU0NzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp;
