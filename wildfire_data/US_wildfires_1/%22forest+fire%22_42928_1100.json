They sneak into ice-cream stores, smash through car windows and break into houses, trashing kitchens. Often, they go viral on Instagram and TikTok in the process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have become as much a part of  Lake Tahoe lore as lazy afternoons by the water or starlit evenings under mountain peaks. And so too have the fights about what to do about problem bears - with some activists accusing the California Department of Fish and Wildlife of being too quick to euthanize naughty bruins, instead of educating the public to better coexist with their ursine neighbors.</p><p>But even in this environment,  the fight that has roared up in South Lake Tahoe this summer is unlike anything many on both sides of this issue have seen in years. For the last few days, bear activists have been staging a round-the-clock bodyguard operation, including sleeping out in the woods, to protect a cub and a home-raiding bear that the state has targeted for \"lethal removal.\" The activists have also launched a public relations campaign to try to lobby the government to spare the bear's life.</p><p>The bear in question is a young mother, with a cub by her side. She is known to the government as \"Sow #753,\" while bear activists and their hundreds of thousands of social media followers call her \"Hope.\" They call her cub \"Bounce.\" (The state of California does not approve of naming bears because authorities believe wild animals should not be anthropomorphized.)</p><p>Whatever she is called, Hope/Sow #753 has a long history with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. She has been on the department's radar since 2022, according to wildlife officials. But this summer, she took things up a notch.  She has been linked, via her DNA, to more than a dozen home break-ins in the South Lake Tahoe area since mid-July, state wildlife officials say.</p><p>On Aug. 21, she and her cub <url normalizedValue=\"https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Black-Bear/Blog/fire-averted-on-butler-avenue-after-south-lake-tahoe-bear-break-in\">broke into a home</url> on Butler Avenue in South Lake Tahoe and accidentally lighted a burner on the gas stove while rummaging through the kitchen.</p><p>\"This bear and its cub came very close to igniting a fire and burning down a house, and potentially creating a forest fire,\" said Peter Tira, spokesperson for the Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p><p>A staff member at Fish and Wildlife who was in the area happened to smell the gas and called 911.</p><p>As emergency responders dealt with that situation, mother and cub fled up a nearby tree.</p><p>The Fish and Wildlife staff member stood below to monitor them.</p><p>The staffer was holding a paintball gun, which is often used to haze bears. But when some in the community saw it, they feared that it was a real gun, and that the bears were at risk of being shot. </p><p>The Bear League, an organization that works to protect bears by teaching people to coexist with them, blasted out an urgent message to its 200,000 Facebook followers: \"NEWSBREAK: Hope and Bounce are currently high up in a tree on the 2000 block of Butler Avenue in South Lake Tahoe, and Fish and Wildlife are there and we know they have issued a standing order to kill Hope. If you are in the area, please go act as a respectful witness.</p><p>People began rushing to the scene. Many of them were furious at Fish and Wildlife. \"How would they like it if an ex-USMC sniper came to protect those bears?\" one man wrote on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/SaveTahoeBears\">Bear League's Facebook</url> page.</p><p>Eventually, the police were called to defuse the situation.</p><p>Ever since, said Ann Bryant, the executive director of the Bear League, teams of volunteers have tried to stick by the bear at all times, to protect her from being killed by Fish and Wildlife.</p><p>\"We have some people who are sleeping out in the wilderness at night,\" Bryant said, adding that they do so because the bear's \"life has meaning, and she wants to live and she has a baby. We don't want her to be murdered.\"</p><p>Bryant said she would like the mother bear and her cub to be left alone, but if Fish and Wildlife won't allow that, she wants the bear to be trapped and transported to a bear sanctuary out of state, while her cub could be rehabilitated and released back into the wild.</p><p>She noted that the Department of Fish and Wildlife has often been reluctant to send bears to out-of-state havens, but hopes that the lobbying that has been unleashed on the department \"from people all over the world\" who are \"extremely upset about her potential death\" will help sway officials.</p><p>Tira, of the Department of Fish and Wildlife, said bears sent to sanctuaries often fail to thrive and \"have to be on antidepressant medications.\"</p><p>\"Shipping California wildlife all over the place is not necessarily a long-term solution,\" he said.</p><p>But it was clear to officials, he said, that something had to be done about this particular bear.</p><p>\"It's a dangerous situation,\" he said. \"We know this bear has broken into at least a half a dozen [homes] just within the last week. This is not normal bear behavior.\"</p><p>Still, he added: \"Things in Lake Tahoe are very emotionally charged with this bear.\"</p><p>Bryant and other bear activists have been keeping up a regular stream of updates on their efforts to keep the bear from being killed. They also dispute the idea that Hope/Sow #753 is particularly badly behaved.</p><p>\"She has not done much more than walk in through unlocked doors and windows,\" Bryant said, adding that once the bodyguard operation was launched, the bear is now being constantly watched and hazed away from homes when she tries to get in. </p><p>\"She has never even bluff charged anybody. She's absolutely 10 times better than some of the other mama bears down in that area,\" Bryant said, adding that the real problem was that some homeowners in the neighborhood were not being responsible about their garbage or closing and locking their doors and windows and \"she is being scapegoated.\"</p><p>Despite the brouhaha over Hope/Sow #753, officials said there has not been a huge uptick in bear conflict this summer in Lake Tahoe.</p><p>Since May 1, officials said, there have been 170 incidents of bear-related property damage reported to the state, along with 18 cases of \"general nuisance\" caused by bears and two unspecified public safety incidents.</p><p> In 2024, there were a total of 521 reports of property damage. The total was 607 in 2023; the first and only known <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-15/womans-grisly-death-inflames-debate-over-how-california-manages-black-bears\">instance of a person being killed by a bear</url> was recorded in California that year: a 71-year-old woman in Downieville who was partially eaten by an animal who broke into her home.</p><p>Bears have also continued to draw social media attention for their food-lusting foibles. On Aug. 17,  four days before the standoff on Butler Avenue, deputies from the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office found a bear inside an ice-cream store in South Lake Tahoe and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-20/ice-cream-shop-bear-south-lake-tahoe\">snapped a photo</url>.

That's easier said than done. It couldn't be done before the Maine forest fire of 1947 and it can't be done now.</p><p>If one happens to be walking or hiking through the woods, one probably would notice the forest floor is covered with vegetation as well as dead, dry plant material - including trees. To remove all of this would be an unsustainable cost in any budget. Having done volunteer trail maintenance in the White Mountain National Forest for several years, I can see why. The picture becomes clearer when I hike an occasional bushwhack.</p><p>The devastating fires in the Los Angeles area were not solely the result of unkempt plant life. Drought and hurricane-force winds made any ignition source unstoppable. Given the conditions, the devastation could have happened anywhere - including West Palm Beach, Florida. Unfortunately, it occurred on a terrain that made it very difficult for experienced, professional firefighters to contain multiple fires. The density of human habitation did not help.</p><p>The 1947 fires in Maine burned over 200,000 acres, destroyed over 1,200 homes and killed 16 people. Drought conditions (like California) existed from July well into October when the fires started. The possibility of ignition from utility infrastructure (such as the Camp Fire in Northern California) was not considerable, though the public was warned to keep their chimneys clean.</p><p>Northern York County, where I live, was hardest hit. I have a bulldozed firebreak lined with 75-year-old red oaks on one side of my lot. It's hard to imagine people running from flames as high as the trees until you see the old photographs.</p><p>So how do you stop destructive wildfires? I guess we'll have to get rid of the wilderness.</p><p>The suggestion that all the duff and organic material in the natural world should be removed will help ensure that nothing will spring up in its place. This would be of particular concern in Maine, where so much of the economy depends on the regeneration of its woodlands and maintaining an environment that attracts those from away.</p><p>We could be like the idiot who set fire to his vehicle last July and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-pushing-burning-car-ravine-started-park-fire-burning-45000-acres-c-rcna163697\">rolled it off the road into the woods</url> for pure spite, causing the Park Fire, or we can show some respect for what is, for all of us, the cycle of life. If it wasn't for a fire crew that narrowly escaped death in New Mexico in 1950 and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.spokesman.com/further-review/smokey-bear-history/\">rescued a badly burned bear cub,</url> we wouldn't have that reminder.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLPRE-httpswwwpressheraldcom20250210opiniontherearenoeasyanswerswhenitcomestoforestfire</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLPRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F3F-5GC3-RTVK-53RX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Press Herald  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pressherald.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64498\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 10, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States &amp;

It was Aug. 13, just before 7 p.m. local time, and a neighbor told her there was a fire in the forest. Lamela, the mayor of Larouco, wasn't surprised by the news. The area around her small village of less than 500 residents had been baking at temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for over two weeks amid one of the longest and hottest heat waves was only a matter of time. </p><p>With her hand still on the steering wheel, Lamela notified regional authorities and asked for help. Then, she called the clerk to get the town's only fire truck ready and asked a nephew to post a message on the village's WhatsApp group calling for volunteers. \"For the first few hours, it was just us neighbors and our truck,\" she said. \"The regional government and their resources were fighting fires elsewhere.\" Within hours the Larouco Fire became the biggest on record in Galicia, burning through more than 116 square miles. The town was not alone in its misery, as dozens of similar blazes were erupting across Spain and Portugal over mid-August, overwhelming authorities and leaving officials struggling to coordinate extinguishing efforts across dozens of agencies and departments, according to multiple accounts by local politicians, firefighters and neighbors who all fought the flames themselves. Beyond the Iberian Peninsula, it's been a similar tale of destruction in Europe. This year, more than 1,900 wildfires have sparked across the EU, scorching a record 3,806 square miles - an area larger than Cyprus, according to satellite estimates from the EU's European Forest Fire Information System . Climate change is playing a major role in the endless scenes of smoke and fire. Europe is the world's fastest-warming continent can soften the worst outcomes, Europe still faces risks ahead as the world continues to break new temperature records. For Galicia, one of Europe's most fire-prone regions, this summer overturned long-held assumptions about how blazes behave. As Lamela explained, fires had always raced uphill in her town, not down. Volunteers believed that if they protected the village at the bottom of the valley, they would be safe. The flames were expected to burn through the forest and stop at the ridge, buying time for regional crews to arrive and put them out. On Aug. 13 that didn't happen. The flames continued to climb the incline before wild winds caused the fire's path to move unpredictably. \"That fire had a weird behavior the whole time,\" Lamela said. \"First it went up, and then it crossed the ridge and went down at incredible speed toward [the village of] Freixido.\" In Larouco, volunteers worked days without rest. One firefighter collapsed after 17 hours straight on the job. The support crews they received from the local, regional and central governments, and the army was intermittent and never enough, as similar fires broke out simultaneously in neighboring towns. While helicopters were called in to douse the flames, pilots were in short supply, according to a firefighter involved in extinguishing blazes in Galicia who requested anonymity for fear of repercussions from his employer, a private contractor for the regional government. \"There were moments when aerial support was halted,\" the person said. \"It was absolute chaos.\" The Galician government deployed the largest response ever to face forest fires this summer, both in terms of people and resources, a spokesperson said. The situation was exceptional and hard to respond to for any emergency mechanism. The priority was to protect people and their belongings, they said. For the first time ever for forest fires , Spain activated the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism, which allows EU members to request help from other countries in the bloc. \"We were not ready for this,\" Lamela said. \"There was a lack of coordination, but what coordination could there be when it was so violent, so big and fast and happening everywhere at the same time? We would have needed three command posts and four times as many resources as we had.\" Still, swift action was not helped by political bickering. Even after the immediate emergency was over, a fire at a municipal dump containing plastic waste in the neighboring town of A R\u00c3\u00baa burned for over two weeks amid a dispute between rival county and regional political parties over who should extinguish it, said Mar\u00c3\u00ada Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez, the mayor of A R\u00c3\u00baa. \"Meanwhile, no one was doing anything,\" she said. Across the Spanish border, there were other bureaucratic bottlenecks preventing Portugal from tackling its wildfires with speed this summer. Last month Conservative Prime Minister Lu\u00c3\u00ads Montenegro was criticized for not moving quickly enough to request firefighting help from the EU and failing to declare a \"state of calamity\" that would have unlocked more resources to affected areas. Government decisions often need to be approved at weekly cabinet meetings, which in August are less frequent due to summer holidays. Beyond politics, one of the thorniest issues for preventing wildfires in Europe has been the region's patchwork of private land ownership. Most forest area in northern Spain and Portugal is privately held and divided into thousands of small plots of land, many held by absentee owners who neither maintain nor even know they own the property. Legally, they must clear brush. As an old Galician saying goes, fires are not extinguished in summer, but in winter by keeping the forest clean. Yet enforcement is almost impossible. The consequences are stark. Take what happened in A R\u00c3\u00baa. Fires burnt much of the town's privately-owned patches of forest and abandoned agriculture fields - leaving a grim, charred landscape. But satellite images showed the disaster didn't spread to the village and its immediate surroundings, where for decades locals have grown Godello vineyards, a variety that produces a white wine known for its citric taste, similar to Chardonnay. \"The vineyards saved us,\" said Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez, the mayor. \"If the rest of our land was managed that way, maybe some would have burnt, but not 30,000 or 40,000 hectares.\" Similar dynamics played out in France's Aude department in southern France this summer. The region suffered its worst fires in more than 70 years, with an area bigger than Paris burned. The most significant damage was on land where vineyards no longer existed and had been abandoned prior to the fires. \"Everywhere there were vineyards, for the most part, the fire was stopped,\" French Prime Minister Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Bayrou told journalists during a tour of the burnt area in August. \"Where there were no longer vineyards, where thickets, scrubland, and garrigue had taken their place, we saw the catastrophe worsen, with the fire spreading faster.\" Even with best practices and billions of euros of funding, climate change is making wildfires harder for governments to snuff out in Europe. In Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, all of which experienced large blazes this summer, such extreme conditions would have happened once in a century in a world without climate change. Today, they're expected to happen once every two decades, according to World Weather Attribution scientists at the Imperial College in London. Planetary warming made these fires ten times more likely and 22 percent more intense, according to an August report from the consortium, which studies the influence of climate change on natural disasters. A second report published by the group last week concluded that the extreme weather made fires in Spain and Portugal 40 times more likely and about 30 percent more intense. Mediterranean wildfires are not just made worse by climate change - they're contributing to it too. Carbon emissions from wildfires in Spain rose to the highest in at least 23 years following this summer's blazes, according to the EU's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service . With a view to preventing future disasters, Greece is implementing a (EURO)2 billion ($2.3 billion) program using financing from the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility to buy amphibious firefighting aircrafts, drones for aerial monitoring, detection and extinguishing systems, control centers and over 1,000 firefighting vehicles. The country has also beefed up efforts to prevent blazes, including cleaning forests. These measures have helped Greece avoid the uncontrolled and simultaneous massive fires that have ravaged Spain, France and Portugal this summer. Still, it was not without disruption : around 32,000 people were evacuated this season, including 5,000 tourists on the island of Crete. At least one person died, 13 firefighters were injured and half of the island of Kythera was scorched. Apostolos Voulgarakis , a wildfire expert at the Technical University of Crete and a co-author of the Imperial College study, notes the region around Athens has already lost over 40 percent of its forested area in less than a decade. Europe's record fire season is showing that climate change is loading the dice toward disaster, with even well-prepared countries struggling to keep forests safe. \"In Greece we don't have a particularly encouraging picture,\" Voulgarakis said. \"It's been the third consecutive summer with a catastrophic fire season that's in many ways unprecedented and hitting different parts of the country without any distinction.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-000001991aa8daeea5fb7aaf1d2c0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GX7-97C3-RRHR-349H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 8, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

TOMS RIVER, NJ - Authorities in New Jersey arrested and charged a man with arson for causing a fast-growing wildfire that has consumed thousands of acres in the central part of the state. Joseph Kling, 19, of Ocean Township was charged with aggravated arson and arson for the Jones Road wildfire, which has burned 15,000 acres and was 50% contained as of April 24. The fire erupted on April 22 after officials said Kling lit a bonfire of wooden pallets and left without extinguishing it properly. Though no injuries have been reported from the wildfire, it destroyed a commercial building and multiple other outbuildings and vehicles, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. About 5,000 residents who evacuated have since been allowed to return home, while authorities predict the fire will keep spreading until the area gets a soaking rain. At about 9:45 a.m. on April 22, the Cedar Bridge Fire Tower located a column of smoke coming from the area of Jones Road and Bryant Road in Ocean Township, authorities said. There, emergency personnel saw a fire within the Ocean County Natural Lands Trust's Forked River Mountains Wilderness Area, which is on the east side of Jones Road. An investigation by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crime Unit-Arson Squad, New Jersey Forest Fire Service, Ocean County Fire Marshal's Office and New Jersey State Fire Marshal's Office plotted the origin of the fire via GPS, officials said. Kling was taken into custody at Ocean Township Police Headquarters and then transferred to Ocean County Jail, pending a detention hearing. Jones Road wildfire causing air quality issues as far as NYC Heavy smoke from the wildfire was affecting visibility in neighboring townships, and authorities warned residents to drive cautiously. Some 60 miles away, authorities in New York issued air quality alerts on April 24 because the traveling smoke was making the air unhealthy for sensitive groups. The\u00a0alert\u00a0covered Manhattan along with the Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland. Residents in New York will be able to see and smell the smoke from New Jersey, officials said.

The film is the result of a project involving hundreds of local people answering the question, if Northampton burnt down again tomorrow, what would people save, what would people rebuild first and what would make it feel like our Northampton again? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Local children have contributed drawings to the animation, local animators have shared their skills and market-goers have shared their thoughts through workshops, vox pops and on the ideas wall at The Creative Place. The resulting film will premiere at 1.30pm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Becky Carrier of Northampton Film Festival said: \u201cThe project has been supported by CLICK Arts Foundation and West Northamptonshire Council, and has also included other free opportunities to take part in animation workshops and masterclasses with animation professionals.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to showcasing everyone\u2019s work as we come together as a community to commemorate this huge milestone in our town\u2019s proud history.\u201d</p><p>Throughout the day, there will be an extended version of The Creative Place\u2019s Makers Market featuring artisan producers and creatives, a bar by V&amp;B, a performance from the Bach choir and displays from Northamptonshire Police and Northamptonshire Fire &amp; Rescue.</p><p>Live music and DJ sets will be provided from the likes of Inspiration FM, United African Association, CLICK Arts Foundation, Saphron and The Performing Room.</p><p>West Northamptonshire Council will also be sharing its vision for the redevelopment of Northampton town centre, echoing the efforts to rebuild the town in the wake of the blaze in 1675. </p><p>A five-month event calendar has already seen exhibitions, church services, art installations, interactive trails, films, history tours and cultural celebrations take place to mark 350 years since flames ripped through the streets of Northampton, destroying 700 of the 850 buildings in the town centre and claiming 11 lives.</p><p>Art historian James Miller, who has spearheaded the Great Fire anniversary project, said: \u201cThe Great Fire of Northampton is a hugely significant moment in our local history and we have been thrilled to see so many people coming together in recent months to mark the 350th anniversary in style.</p><p>\u201cFrom the carnival procession to the fire-themed planting for Northampton in Bloom, and everything in between \u2013 this has been the summer of the Great Fire and we\u2019re looking forward to a spectacular conclusion this September with a week-long series of free activities giving everyone the chance to get involved.</p><p>\u201cThis will be an opportunity for the county to come together to celebrate Northamptonshire\u2019s extraordinary resilience, civic pride and independent spirit. It is that character that shone through 350 years ago and is still very much in evidence today.\u201d</p><p>The Great Fire of Northampton is believed to have been caused by sparks from an open fire in a home on St Mary's Street, near the former castle site. The fire quickly spread and engulfed the surrounding buildings. As the flames raged, residents sought refuge in the Market Square, but the situation grew increasingly dire, and the authorities ordered the evacuation of the area, with terrified residents forced to flee.</p><p>The fire's destructive path left behind a scene of devastation, with prominent buildings such as All Hallows\u2019 Church reduced to ashes.</p><p>While the blaze caused immense destruction, it also marked a turning point in the town's architectural development. Following the fire, efforts were made to rebuild and revitalise Northampton, leading to the construction of new buildings and a renewed focus on urban planning.</p><p>In a remarkable display of community spirit and determination, local residents and businesses rallied together, raising \u00a325,000 to finance the ambitious reconstruction of the town centre, centred around the bustling Market Square.</p><p>As part of the anniversary, a spectacular light show will be beamed onto All Saints\u2019 Church every night from Monday, 15 September to Saturday, 20 September, while Fiori Musicali will perform a spine-tingling interpretation of Handel\u2019s Music for the Royal Fireworks at the church at 7pm on Thursday, 18 September.</p><p>Father Oliver Coss, Rector of All Saints\u2019 Church, said: \u201cThe memory of All Hallows' Church and its destruction in the Great Fire of Northampton serves as a reminder of the resilience of the town and its ability to recover and rebuild, even in the face of catastrophic events.</p><p>\u201cThe events taking place here at All Saints\u2019 and in the Market Square this September will channel that community spirit and shine a light on the history and heritage that gives Northamptonshire such a proud identity.\u201d</p><p>The Great Fire of Northampton anniversary commemorations have been organised by cultural and historical groups from across the county alongside partners including Northampton Town Centre Business Improvement District (BID), Northampton Town Council and West Northamptonshire Council.</p><p>For more details, visit <url normalizedValue=\"//www.discovernorthampton.co.uk/GFON350\">www.discovernorthampton.co.uk/GFON350</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINAL WEEK ITINERARY</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Saturday, 13 September: </emphasis>Heritage Open Days: Northampton Town Council\u2019s History of the Great Fire \u2013 Actors from Mystery Tours will be bringing the story of the Great Fire to life around the Guildhall, and local historian Ruth Thomas will be leading a guided walk for visitors from St Mary\u2019s Street through the town centre.

One of the slated areas is Mansfield Hollow State Park, located near the University of Connecticut's Storrs campus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Controlled burning is a valuable tool for maintaining healthy habitats and diverse vegetation,\" said the DEEP announcement. \"For example, it helps maintain grassland and shrubland habitat for species that are declining in Connecticut due to a loss of farmland and early successional habitat, helps maintain pitch pine sand plain forest (one of the state's most imperiled ecosystems), and can assist with forestry objectives such as oak regeneration.\"</p><p>DEEP will burn approximately one acre of Mansfield Hollow to enhance the grassland habitat in the space. The state park area is managed by DEEP in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who use the forestry and Mansfield Hollow Lake for recreational and wildlife management studies.</p><p>The exact dates of the controlled burns will depend on weather conditions, the announcement said. The DEEP Forest Fire Control Office, in conjunction with state authorities and the National Weather Service, publishes a daily fire danger warning level to guide citizens and prevent forest fires on the web and on a large sign outside its headquarters on Route 66 in Marlborough.</p><p>\"Connecticut traditionally experiences high forest fire danger in the Spring from mid-March through May,\" stated the Forest Fire Control Office webpage. \"In an average year approximately 500 acres of Connecticut woodland are burned by forest fires.\"</p><p>The DEEP Forestry Division is conducting the prescribed burns with assistance from fire-trained workers in the organization's wildlife, state parks and support services divisions. These areas are set to be closed to the public with signage posted, the announcement said.</p><p>Five additional locations will also receive prescribed burns, including 10 acres of the James Goodwin State Forest in nearby Hampton, 26 acres of the Pachaug State Forest in Voluntown, 10 acres of the Quinebaug River Wildlife Management Area in Plainfield, one acre of the Belding Wildlife Management Area in Vernon and 70 acres of the Suffield Wildlife Management Area, in the north-central Connecticut town of Suffield.</p><p>Mansfield Hollow Lake looking north from the southwestern shore and boat launch on Bassetts Bridge Road. Photo by Morrow Long/Wikimedia</p><p>DEEP said that these burns help sustain wild plant species, maintain favorable habitats for endangered animal species found in these forests and provide wildfire suppression training for DEEP staff and local firefighters.</p><p>Controlled burning of forestry and vegetation is a long-established practice originated by American Indian populations, who used the technique to make land more habitable and cultivatable. DEEP noted that Connecticut natives burned to promote the growth of sweet acorns and other nut and berry-producing trees.</p><p>\"We try to replicate what Native Americans would have done on the land, they kept land open for different reasons,\" said DEEP Fire Control Officer Rich Schenk to WTNH Channel 8 after its first prescribed burn in 2024 at Machimoodus State Park in East Haddam.</p><p>People may notice smoke from the planned areas on the days of the burns. When DEEP and local officials from the town of Mansfield decide on a date to begin the prescribed burn process at Mansfield Hollow State Park, weather permitting, it will be announced to the public.</p><p>For more information about CT DEEP's forest fire prevention and controlled burning initiatives, visit its Forestry Division webpage at portal.ct.gov/deep/forestry/forest-fire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6123757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJ1-C4V3-S286-F09M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Campus: University of Connecticut</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 10, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Storrs</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp;

Today, thirty years later, and with far fewer fires than before, but of greater magnitude, politicians pick up the gauntlet and explain that most fires are intentional, when that is not the right answer either. Because the cause of ignition (origin) is not the same as the cause of spread (forest management). The origins of fires are almost always human (intentional or accidental), but the background is political. And we forest managers keep saying it year after year after year: it is the conditions of the forest that cause major fires.</p><p><br/>In these three decades we have suffered unprecedented rural abandonment and no people in the villages. This means that there are no sheep or cows, the natural brush cutters. And there are no inhabitants, who were the ones who collected biomass for their chimneys. The forests in this country are abandoned and grow without control.<br/>We, the professionals of the sector, stubbornly insist that a State policy is needed to create an economic forestry sector in the country. A preventive policy that provides resources to the autonomous communities so that they can implement conservation policies; but also to make the most of the forests. What we call sustainable forest management. Because if there is no profitability there will be no forest management.<br/>When we talk about forest management we refer to pruning and thinning of the forest, that is, cutting some trees so that others grow more, thus reducing the density. Or cutting down old trees to plant new ones. Also to open roads to reach more distant points, infrastructures such as firebreaks, etc. We are talking about clearing the surplus of shrub vegetation that dries out and burns at the slightest spark. To assess the health of the forests and the possible pests that lurk in them. To take care of biodiversity. But all this cannot be done without profitability for the forester. Let's remember that 72% of the forest area in the country is privately owned.<br/>That is why it is so important to implement incentive measures for forest management and forest products. We need economic aid, favorable taxation, regulations that favor forestry groups, updating of cadastres and improving the conditions of access to credit and land. We are the third most forested country in Europe and we only collect half as much in timber as our neighbors. But the forestry industry goes far beyond timber. It is chestnuts, pine nuts, mushrooms and truffles, resin, cork, red fruits, aromatic and medicinal plants. A whole forest industry capable of creating jobs and reversing rural abandonment.<br/>Recently, several voices have joined what we have been saying for a long time: prevention is much more profitable and cheaper than extinction. The forestry engineer and fire expert V\u00edctor Resco provides the data: putting out fires costs 19,000 euros per hectare. However, prevention actions cost 3,000 euros per hectare.<br/>The Spanish Forestry Plan 2022-2032 itself proposes an increase in investment in forest fire prevention, proposing that annual investment in prevention be increased from 300 to 600 million euros. The objective is to achieve a balance in spending, so that the proportion of investment in prevention and extinction is 60/40 (currently it is reversed, with more weight on extinction). And the experts speak of a budget for investment in prevention that reaches one billion euros.<br/>But politicians, who do not want to enter into the structural problem, remedy the summer crisis of fires by talking about intentional fires and extinction. Of forest firefighters and facilities, which are necessary and should be well sized so that what is happening in Castilla y Le\u00f3n does not happen. But they would be less necessary and would cost us less if our forests were healthy and managed.<br/>In the winter of 2024 we saw with horror that 122 people had lost their lives in Chile because the fire had reached 10,000 homes and 30,000 hectares of forest, an extension similar to that of the first fire that broke out in the Sierra de la Culebra in Zamora in 2022. Something that could very well happen here, especially in the Mediterranean basin, with many chalets perched on the mountains bordering the coasts. Or areas with housing developments nestled in the interior of forests and woodlands, whose nearby fields have been filled with scrub, which in case of fire could be greatly compromised. This is a reminder of the need for all municipalities to have emergency and self-protection plans, and for all the inhabitants of these areas to be aware of them.<br/>The meteorological conditions that caused these catastrophes in Chile were very similar to those we have now in Spain: a heat wave, strong winds, low humidity, and a lot of rain in the winter, which favored the growth of herbaceous and shrubby vegetation, which is now dry and easy to burn. And the human hand. All together plus the lack of management is a bomb that can explode. It is going to explode.<br/>We see people literally crying in their networks because their forest heritage is burning. Well, let's stop crying and understand that the administrations have reduced prevention resources by half in the last 13 years, from 364 to 136 million euros. Some communities, such as Castilla y Le\u00f3n, 90%. They are doing just the opposite of what should be done. More resources are devoted to extinction than to prevention.<br/>Less moaning and more demanding from our politicians a series of measures that put forest management at the center. Political short-termism is killing us. The forests need long-term commitments and continuous actions over time. The intangible heritage provided by the forests is something we should learn at school and then learn to protect as adults. It is not an option. Life without forests is not livable.<br/>Regardless of the profitability for their owners, the ecosystemic benefits of forests, regulating the water cycle, capturing carbon dioxide, taking care of soil quality, allowing leisure and enjoyment of citizens, are of incalculable value.<br/>That is why we repeat: let's do prevention throughout the year. Let's manage, not just extinguish. Let's take advantage of all the resources of our forests and let's understand which are the things that matter to demand them with our votes.<br/>Francisco Carre\u00f1o is president of the Confederation of Forestry Organizations of Spain.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72283950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G0V3-RRN8-04R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 21, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Medio ambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Sociedad</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Bosques</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Verano</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Prevenci\u00f3n incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Medio rural</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000980</classCode><className>JOB CREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

Utilizing the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and the Shapley value, we identify the impacts of meteorological variables on fire weather danger as represented by FFDI and FWI.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Theme-based Research Scheme, General Research Fund - Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong, Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, \"Our findings reveal that under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 5-8.5 high-emission scenario, both FFDI and FWI project significant intensification of fire weather, particularly in historically recognized high- risk hotspots, demonstrating robust inter-model consistency. Notably, the future projections of FFDI indicate the likely occurrence of wildfires with unprecedented severity. The comparative analysis using Shapley values highlights substantial regional and index-specific variations in the contribution of meteorological input variables to fire weather simulations. While these global patterns are generally retained as global warming leads to a systematic reinforcement of all variables, in-depth regional scale analyses further uncover a stark contrast of dominant factors controlling FFDI and FWI.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These findings stimulate discussion on the potential adaptability and discrepancies of empirically derived fire models, highlighting the need for future research to advance fire weather modeling with enhanced flexibility and multi-factor consideration.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Wildfire Risk In a Changing Climate: Evaluating Fire Weather Indices and Their Global Patterns With Cmip6 Multi-model Projections.

If there are no exceptional circumstances, as there were in 2017, the forest fires will no longer be on the news and the issue will be forgotten. What's more, this year's local elections and the discussion of the State Budget will turn the debate on its head.</p><p><br/>Politicians will spend some of their days talking about \"forest reform\" and presenting a range of ideas. The government has already announced a partially plagiarized program that runs until 2050, with an estimated value of 6.5 billion euros. But there's a problem: in the last six years the country has spent more than a billion euros on the forest and more than a billion and a hundred million on fighting it, and the results are hardly visible. To propose doing the same is to continue wasting time and money.<br/>The political world may be busy with plans and programs, but there will be no serious reform if the country doesn't accept the expropriation of all forest properties under twenty hectares (1), with the subsequent aggregation and sale at public auction of units between fifty and one hundred hectares and the payment by the state of the expropriated value between ten and twenty years; or if there isn't a profound change in the taxation of rural property (2) which leads to the voluntary handing over of property to the state with a tax subsidy, its exploitation or its sale, also promoting aggregation, and starting with the automatic transfer to the state of all plots not registered in the BUPi from 2030 onwards (3); finally, there won't be any reform if the state doesn't have an annual financial availability of more than one and a half billion euros over the next fifteen years (4) to profoundly change the Portuguese forestry area. These four initial premises would require a pact between the central political forces, which would say a lot about their vision for the country.<br/>But the issue is not just one of structural and medium/long-term reform. It urgently requires a reorganization of the state in terms of intervention in each of these areas - structural promotion and prevention, operational prevention and combat. Based on my experience as a local authority and as a government official, exactly with the subsequent supervision of civil protection and forests at the end of the first decade of the century, only with the establishment, by every government that comes along, of a thematic council of ministers (5) that meets and decides, and with the extinction of the AGIF and the creation of a High Commissioner for Forest Fires (6), with strong leadership skills, an institutional vision, the ability to relate to local authorities and the transversal skills to overcome smallholdings and intervene in each of the areas, we can start the journey again.<br/>The following measures are also proposed:<br/>1. Promotion and structural prevention<br/>In this area, it is important to put an end to the \"urban-centric\" and \"Lisbon-centric\" vision (7) which, coupled with the ICNF's inordinate arrogance, has turned the country's back on the structures created since 2016. Agriculture and the environment are the most centralist and corporatist areas in the country, reminiscent of the Estado Novo. The multi-annual determination of investment amounts in the forestry sector for the transformation and resilience of stands should be promoted, and a database of public investment since 2000 should be set up, with the obligations of contractors, particularly with regard to active management (8), the identification of externalities that can be paid for or subsidized should be promoted (9) and three public business units (north, center and south) should be built to manage the state's forestry and agricultural territories, with the possibility of concession to private individuals, including the public forests, Florestegal and Companhia das Lez\u00edrias (10).<br/>The government should abandon the term \"rural fires\" as it makes no sense. A fire on a piece of land in Odivelas that has trees or in the Serra de Valongo is anything but rural, but it must also be extinguished (11); it must restore the National Forestry Authority, separated from the INCB (12), with three national directorates for investment, management and forest resilience (13); the Forest Code approved in 2009 (14) should be restored, with the appropriate changes, bringing the sector into the 21st century; a revision of the Basic Forestry Law should be approved which assumes decentralization to the CIMs and municipalities of planning and the basis of prevention (15); the legal framework for agroforestry master plans to be approved by municipalities should be approved (16); it should approve the regime for annual municipal prevention plans to be approved by municipal assemblies in conjunction with the activity plans and budgets (17); it should promote the transfer of the decision on the network of forestry sappers, and its funding, organization and framework, to the municipalities or CIMs (18); should promote the creation of technical capacities in municipalities, especially in fire management, through highly qualified personnel (19); should promote the reform of the legal framework for the sale of woody material (20); should encourage the creation of interprofessional bodies in the forestry sector (21); it should consider the current framework for protected areas and their management (22); it should promote a new amendment to the law on commonholdings which requires real forest management, the exclusive use of financial resources for the same management and the loss of management rights, in the event of a forest fire, by the sharers and also create the national commonholds solidarity fund, to which the funds not used by the management boards in the management of the same commonhold are sent (23); the national forestry information network should be recreated, interconnecting national and international knowledge by the national and local public administration, universities, associations in the sector, the GNR and civil protection (24); the legal framework for forestry producers' associations should be approved (25); the law on forestry condominiums, which will replace ZIFs, and forestry cooperatives should be approved (26); interaction with hunting reserves should be promoted in order to create a base for identifying threats in the forest and monitoring by hunters and guards (27); the components of public funds, specifically the Environmental Fund, intended for structural prevention should be clarified (28).<br/>2. Operational prevention<br/>The National Republican Guard has special competencies in prevention (SEPNA) and combat (UEPS). As well as facing visible strategic saturation, this force should consider combining these two units under a single command (29).<br/>In addition, a special forest inspection system should be approved (30), which will streamline the relationship between citizens, security forces and municipalities in terms of land clearing; a law should be passed allowing firefighters to inspect forest areas (31); a new operational relationship rule should be established between the PJ, GNR, PSP and Maritime Police (32); the criminal framework for arsonists should be reviewed (33); the crime of failing to clear forest land should be reclassified (34); the special system for municipal intervention in safeguarding settlements should be created (35); the directive on the protection actions that the GNR must guarantee on the part of road concessionaires and other services of general interest should be approved (36); the national technological network for identifying forest masses should be made available at the grassroots (37), creating a visual monitoring and mass assessment system based on a specific algorithm and AI; municipalities, the GNR and the CBs should be provided with overlapping maps identifying the years of the most damaging fires in the last 25 years (38) so that they can anticipate, on the ground, the safeguarding of territories; all GNR and PSP vehicles should be equipped with a system for identifying/locating situations of non-compliance with cleaning and protection rules (39) with a direct link to the municipalities; the GNR should be given the power to promote nationwide hard information and awareness campaigns (40); an in-depth analysis should be carried out on whether the GNR should maintain a civil protection unit or whether this responsibility should be transferred to the National Defense System (41); SEPNA's civilian staff should be reinforced in the field of environmental monitoring (42), which should cover the entire national territory with the exception of protected areas; watch posts should be technologically redesigned, managed remotely, and the structure should be equipped with situation and analysis rooms 3.0 situation and analysis rooms, technologically advanced, adjacent to those of civil protection at territorial level (43).<br/>3. Combat<br/>Since the universe of first intervention and forest firefighting has remained the most stable over the last two decades, it needs to be rethought, upgraded or improved. Protection and rescue is not structured solely to respond to forest fires, but rather to respond to a multitude of occurrences that are not visible.<br/>With a view to a complete reform of our obligations in the defense sector within the framework of NATO, it would be important for civil protection to become the civil area of the Ministry of National Defense, leaving the Internal Administration, and also become part of the sector's investment (44), which is expected to reach 5% of GDP in the next decade. This is not unique; there are European countries that have been using this model for decades.<br/>From this point of view, it would be very important to revise the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic so that the Armed Forces would have new areas of intervention in the internal security and protection and rescue sector (45); that the evolving systems of Medical Emergency, Protection and Relief, Civil Protection, Internal Security, National Defense and Crisis Management be redesigned (46); that three emergency and civil defense units be created in the Armed Forces for highly demanding and complex interventions (47); that the current Engineering Regiment be relocated to the northern interior and another created in the center/south (48); that the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces be entrusted with the creation of the National Integrated Defense, Security, Protection and Emergency Communications Networks, with segregated and confidential management and operational use systems (49); that the Shipwreck Relief Institute be integrated into the GNR and renamed the Coastal Defense and Protection Unit, with intervention capabilities in the forest protection area of the Portuguese coastline (50); to promote the phased acquisition by the Air Force, over ten years, of two thirds of the air resources intended for forest fires and for use in internal security (51); and to finally approve the legal framework for military participation in forest fire situations (52).<br/>In the context of the National Civil Protection Authority, given that it is based on a multi-agency principle, similar to that of the UN's integrated forces, it is important to review the Basic Law and promote clarification of the participation of the military and security sectors in the system, as well as firefighters (53); to create the Firefighters' Technical Autonomy Regime (54) and the complete reformulation of the public service obligations of Portuguese firefighters and their functional dependence (55), which will guarantee a clarification of commands and bodies in the system; the direction, command and control components of the ANPC's national, regional and sub-regional operational commands should be strengthened (56); it should be decided whether the territorial basis of civil protection remains in the NUT III and, if so, whether other relevant entities in situations of alert, contingency or catastrophe, such as the GNR, PSP, INEM, Red Cross, the services of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment, Social Security and the ULS, move towards the same territorial profile, or whether, because there is a decades-long history, there should be a return to district territories (57); the material support schemes for protection and rescue structures should be completely reformed (58), so that human resources contracted with the ANPC and municipalities for the EIP's cannot carry out emergency medical and patient transportation activities; the SIOPS should be reformed, incorporating the Incident Command System rules and the affirmation that stems from it to return to combat work based on machines and tools, rather than water, in the first intervention and combat situation (59); the ANPC's forms of external communication should be refounded by creating communication officers in the fire departments and training journalists every year (60); the number of EIP's in fire stations should be doubled by the end of the decade (61); the operational goals of these Professional Teams in the CB's and the areas of intervention and training they must fulfill annually should be promoted (62); the Special Civil Protection Force should be extended to the entire national territory (63); a review of the funding schemes for entities carrying out civil protection activities should be promoted (64); a Crisis Management training program for mayors should be built as an essential element of their intervention capacity (65).<br/>Specifically in the Portuguese firefighting sector and at grassroots level, in addition to those already mentioned from the ANPC, the category of volunteer fire departments should be extinguished from institutional and political terminology, since there are only mixed and professional fire departments in the country (66); the professionalization of fire department commanders should be promoted and the legal regime for their recruitment, training, assessment and swearing-in should be approved (67); general CB accounting rules should be approved which segregate funding for patient transport and medical emergency activities from activities funded in the field of protection and rescue by municipalities and the ANPC (68); the career of firefighter officer should be reactivated and professional recruitment promoted on the basis of officer/firefighter appropriations (69); the census of volunteer firefighters should be promoted with the obligation of physical and technical aptitude tests, the reserve and honorary cadres should be extinguished and the universe of AHB servants of a technical nature should be regulated (70); new rules should be defined, with mandatory reporting and centralized control, regarding the training and annual operational obligations of volunteer firefighters in mixed fire departments; the aggregation of humanitarian associations should be promoted with the approval of an incentive system (71); the existence of a single fleet of rolling stock for each municipality and its distribution among the fire departments in each municipality should be increased (72); the regulation of the operational relationship between the commanders of the fire departments and the municipal operational commander, who is dependent on the municipalities, should be promoted, which should be reinstated (73) as a way of integrating the entire system and the path towards the total professionalization of the universe of protection and rescue in the fire departments over 25 years; the obligation for all AHBs to be audited by the Court of Auditors and for their accounts to be published on the institutional website (74); and for fire departments to keep their operational activity online and publicly accessible (75).<br/>To this universe of proposals we could add other more radical ones, but the times we live in require consensus and slower progress. However, for all this to come to fruition, there is no need for new committees of experts, new studies or new committees of inquiry. What is needed is for Portugal not to go back to business as usual, waiting for new and more damaging disasters.<br/>This text can be read in the online edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Expresso</emphasis> at: you can listen to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Podcast</emphasis> at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://tinyurl.com/2swhvyca\">https://tinyurl.com/2swhvyca</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72407531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKM-BNV3-RS5Y-6085-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 26, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opiniao</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

They sneak into ice-cream stores, smash through car windows and break into houses, trashing kitchens. Often, they go viral on Instagram and TikTok in the process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have become as much a part of Lake Tahoe lore as lazy afternoons by the water or starlit evenings under mountain peaks. And so too have the fights about what to do about problem bears -- with some activists accusing the California Department of Fish and Wildlife of being too quick to euthanize naughty bruins, instead of educating the public to better coexist with their ursine neighbors.</p><p>But even in this environment, the fight that has roared up in South Lake Tahoe this summer is unlike anything many on both sides of this issue have seen in years. For the last few days, bear activists have been staging a round-the-clock bodyguard operation, including sleeping out in the woods, to protect a cub and a home-raiding bear that the state has targeted for \"lethal removal.\" The activists have also launched a public relations campaign to try to lobby the government to spare the bear's life.</p><p>The bear in question is a young mother, with a cub by her side. She is known to the government as \"Sow #753,\" while bear activists and their hundreds of thousands of social media followers call her \"Hope.\" They call her cub \"Bounce.\" (The state of California does not approve of naming bears because authorities believe wild animals should not be anthropomorphized.)</p><p>Whatever she is called, Hope/Sow #753 has a long history with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. She has been on the department's radar since 2022, according to wildlife officials. But this summer, she took things up a notch. She has been linked, via her DNA, to more than a dozen home break-ins in the South Lake Tahoe area since mid-July, state wildlife officials say.</p><p>On Aug. 21, she and her cub broke into a home on Butler Avenue in South Lake Tahoe and accidentally lighted a burner on the gas stove while rummaging through the kitchen.</p><p>\"This bear and its cub came very close to igniting a fire and burning down a house, and potentially creating a forest fire,\" said Peter Tira, spokesperson for the Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p><p>A staff member at Fish and Wildlife who was in the area happened to smell the gas and called 911.</p><p>As emergency responders dealt with that situation, mother and cub fled up a nearby tree.</p><p>The Fish and Wildlife staff member stood below to monitor them.</p><p>The staffer was holding a paintball gun, which is often used to haze bears. But when some in the community saw it, they feared that it was a real gun, and that the bears were at risk of being shot.</p><p>The Bear League, an organization that works to protect bears by teaching people to coexist with them, blasted out an urgent message to its 200,000 Facebook followers: \"NEWSBREAK: Hope and Bounce are currently high up in a tree on the 2000 block of Butler Avenue in South Lake Tahoe, and Fish and Wildlife are there and we know they have issued a standing order to kill Hope. If you are in the area, please go act as a respectful witness.\"</p><p>People began rushing to the scene. Many of them were furious at Fish and Wildlife. \"How would they like it if an ex-USMC sniper came to protect those bears?\" one man wrote on the Bear League's Facebook page.</p><p>Eventually, the police were called to defuse the situation.</p><p>Ever since, said Ann Bryant, the executive director of the Bear League, teams of volunteers have tried to stick by the bear at all times, to protect her from being killed by Fish and Wildlife.</p><p>\"We have some people who are sleeping out in the wilderness at night,\" Bryant said, adding that they do so because the bear's \"life has meaning, and she wants to live and she has a baby. We don't want her to be murdered.\"</p><p>Bryant said she would like the mother bear and her cub to be left alone, but if Fish and Wildlife won't allow that, she wants the bear to be trapped and transported to a bear sanctuary out of state, while her cub could be rehabilitated and released back into the wild.</p><p>She noted that the Department of Fish and Wildlife has often been reluctant to send bears to out-of-state havens, but hopes that the lobbying that has been unleashed on the department \"from people all over the world\" who are \"extremely upset about her potential death\" will help sway officials.</p><p>Tira, of the Department of Fish and Wildlife, said bears sent to sanctuaries often fail to thrive and \"have to be on antidepressant medications.\"</p><p>\"Shipping California wildlife all over the place is not necessarily a long-term solution,\" he said.</p><p>But it was clear to officials, he said, that something had to be done about this particular bear.</p><p>\"It's a dangerous situation,\" he said. \"We know this bear has broken into at least a half a dozen [homes] just within the last week. This is not normal bear behavior.\"</p><p>Still, he added: \"Things in Lake Tahoe are very emotionally charged with this bear.\"</p><p>Bryant and other bear activists have been keeping up a regular stream of updates on their efforts to keep the bear from being killed. They also dispute the idea that Hope/Sow #753 is particularly badly behaved.</p><p>\"She has not done much more than walk in through unlocked doors and windows,\" Bryant said, adding that once the bodyguard operation was launched, the bear is now being constantly watched and hazed away from homes when she tries to get in.</p><p>\"She has never even bluff charged anybody. She's absolutely 10 times better than some of the other mama bears down in that area,\" Bryant said, adding that the real problem was that some homeowners in the neighborhood were not being responsible about their garbage or closing and locking their doors and windows and \"she is being scapegoated.\"</p><p>Despite the brouhaha over Hope/Sow #753, officials said there has not been a huge uptick in bear conflict this summer in Lake Tahoe.</p><p>Since May 1, officials said, there have been 170 incidents of bear-related property damage reported to the state, along with 18 cases of \"general nuisance\" caused by bears and two unspecified public safety incidents.</p><p>In 2024, there were a total of 521 reports of property damage. The total was 607 in 2023; the first and only known instance of a person being killed by a bear was recorded in California that year: a 71-year-old woman in Downieville who was partially eaten by an animal who broke into her home.</p><p>Bears have also continued to draw social media attention for their food-lusting foibles.</p><p>On Aug. 17, four days before the standoff on Butler Avenue, deputies from the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office found a bear inside an ice-cream store in South Lake Tahoe and snapped a photo. It went viral.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: HUMANS should learn to better coexist with bears, including \"Hope\" and cub \"Bounce,\" activists say.

As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.</p><p>This article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Canadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content</p><p>Back to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025</p><p>TORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.</p><p>The delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships. The initiative aims to strengthen bilateral connections between French and Canadian producers, with a focus on the development of new English-language television series across genres.</p><p>In addition to bringing together experienced producers from Canada and France to strengthen bilateral content collaboration, the CMPA and USPA will discuss the ongoing shared challenges faced by the independent production sectors in their respective countries.</p><p>\u201cUSPA is thrilled with the ongoing international cooperation fostered by its partnership with CMPA in Canada. In the current international context, it is necessary to strengthen the links between our two countries, both operationally and politically,\u201d said Amanda Borghino, Deputy General Delegate of the USPA. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this collaboration and shaping together new paths for transatlantic content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrance has long been a valued production partner for Canada, and we are thrilled to collaborate with USPA on this initiative,\u201d said Reynolds Mastin, President and CEO of the CMPA. \u201cToday, our two countries are leading global efforts to ensure foreign streaming services respect the right of national governments to require equitable contributions to domestic production, and opportunities for local producers to hold and exploit their own intellectual property. This is critical to the success of local independent production sectors, and to safeguarding individual countries\u2019 national cultural sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>Participants from Canada:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Amos   Adetuyi, Circle Blue Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Alfons Adetuyi, Inner City Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Kerry Appleyard, Lionsgate Canada  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Eli Campbell, Peacock Alley Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Annette Clarke, Ruby Line Productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Lauren Corber, LoCo Motion Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   David Cormican, Fun Republic Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Malachi Ellis, Area V5 Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sibel Guvenc, Kybele Films Inc.  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Frederick Kroetsch, Catapult Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michelle Morris, Lily Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michael Souther, Amaze Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Steven Thibault, Screen Siren Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Participants from France:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Iris Bucher, Quad Drama (USPA President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Thomas Anargyros, Mediawan Studio France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Isabelle Degeorges, Gaumont Televisions France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Patricia Boutinard Rouelle, Nilaya Productions (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Odile McDonald, Wildcats Productions (USPA Drama college VP)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Arnaud de Cr\u00e9miers, Jour Premier  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sophie Deloche, Ashart\u00e9&amp;Cie  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Nicolas Deprost, What\u2019s up productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Fabrice Est\u00e8ve, Yuzu Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Emmanuel Fran\u00e7ois, Brother Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Corine Janin, Bleu Kobalt  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Betty Johnson, Hababo Studios  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Am\u00e9lie Juan, Morgane Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Jean-Marie Laronze, Monde et media TV  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Gini Lorin, Scriptline  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Tatiana Maksimenko, Hamak (Effervescence group)  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The initiative is presented in collaboration with Telefilm Canada, the Canada Media Fund, CanExport for Associations (Global Affairs), the French Embassy in Canada and the Canadian Embassy in France.</p><p>Source: The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/\">https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/</url></p><p>Canada Media Producers Association</p><p>The Canadian Media Producers Association is Canada\u2019s trade association for independent producers.

Heightened economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the prospect of a global recession are weighing on consumer confidence. In addition, the decline in BCE's share price has resulted in a higher cost of capital. The Board also considered the impact of the unsupportive regulatory environment given recent CRTC decisions, ongoing aggressive competitive pricing, and a slowdown in immigration.</p><p>Greater financial flexibility and a prudent approach to capital management is required in the current economic, regulatory and competitive environments. Accordingly, the Board has determined to establish the annualized dividend at $1.75 per BCE common share. In addition, BCE's common share dividend payout policy has been updated to target a dividend payout range of 40% to 55% of free cash flow. In order to allow investors to consider the effects of lease liability repayments on our cash available for dividend payments, we will also going forward be disclosing both free cash flow and free cash flow after payment of lease liabilities13.</p><p>This measure is expected to strengthen the Corporation's balance sheet, while providing enhanced flexibility in the context of economic uncertainty. BCE's Board has declared today a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per common share, payable on July 15, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2025.</p><p>BCE also announced today that the Board has determined to terminate the discounted treasury issuances under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan effective from the July 15, 2025 dividend payment date.

Adjusted EBITDA projections remain the same as previously disclosed. The Corporation expects additional pressure on its revenue, particularly in\u00a0the United States, driven by increased competition. As part of its three-year transformation program, the Corporation has initiated several cost reduction initiatives and operating efficiencies across the organization in order to minimize the revenue impact on adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, net capital expenditures are expected to be lower than under the previous financial guidelines, partially resulting from operational efficiencies following the combination of the Canadian and U.S. management teams.</p><p>Consequently, compared to fiscal 2024, on a constant currency and consolidated basis, we are lowering Cogeco's revenue projections for fiscal 2025 to a low single digit decline, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain stable. In addition, due to some better-than-anticipated transformation-related cost savings and lower expected net capital expenditures, we are increasing the Corporation's free cash flow financial guidelines, from a decrease compared to fiscal 2024 to a stable free cash flow, while reducing net capital expenditures projections.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://corpo.cogeco.com/cgo/en/press-room/press-releases/cogeco-announces-q3-2025-financial-results-and-canadian-wireless-launch/\">https://corpo.cogeco.com/cgo/en/press-room/press-releases/cogeco-announces-q3-2025-financial-results-and-canadian-wireless-launch/</url></p><p>Cogeco Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA projections remain the same as previously disclosed. The Corporation expects additional pressure on its revenue, particularly in\u00a0the United States, driven by increased competition. As part of its three-year transformation program, the Corporation has initiated several cost reduction initiatives and operating efficiencies across the organization in order to minimize the revenue impact on adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, net capital expenditures are expected to be lower than under the previous financial guidelines, partially resulting from operational efficiencies following the combination of the Canadian and U.S. management teams.</p><p>Consequently, compared to fiscal 2024, on a constant currency and consolidated basis, we are lowering Cogeco's revenue projections for fiscal 2025 to a low single digit decline, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain stable. In addition, due to some better-than-anticipated transformation-related cost savings and lower expected net capital expenditures, we are increasing the Corporation's free cash flow financial guidelines, from a decrease compared to fiscal 2024 to a stable free cash flow, while reducing net capital expenditures projections.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://corpo.cogeco.com/cgo/en/press-room/press-releases/cogeco-announces-q3-2025-financial-results-and-canadian-wireless-launch/\">https://corpo.cogeco.com/cgo/en/press-room/press-releases/cogeco-announces-q3-2025-financial-results-and-canadian-wireless-launch/</url></p><p>Corus Entertainment Inc.

The Corporation continues to make progress, gaining market share quarter after quarter while consolidating its position as the most profitable player in the sector, supported by the strongest balance sheet in the Canadian telecommunications industry.</p><p>Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor</p><p>Quebecor posted solid financial results in the first quarter of 2025, including increases of 8.1% in cash flows provided by operating activities and 13.5% in adjusted income from operating activities. As a result of this strong performance, driven by rigorous disciplined management, we were able to reduce our consolidated net debt by more than $155.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 and lower our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to 3.26x at March 31, 2025, the lowest among Canada\u2019s major telecommunications providers.</p><p>In an aggressively competitive business environment, our innovative range of products offered at competitive prices allowed us to deliver an increase of 54,400 (1.3%) new mobile lines in the first quarter of 2025, the best growth rate among Canada\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, and 367,500 (9.6%) lines over the past twelve months. We continued investing in our network, in line with our priority of delivering a superior customer experience. Since April 2025, we have been gradually deploying 3800 MHz spectrum across Freedom\u2019s 5G+ network in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. With access to state-of-the-art 5G+ technology now included in all Freedom monthly mobile plans, regardless of price, this rollout will significantly boost network capacity and performance. In February 2025, Freedom also launched a new range of mobile plans in Manitoba that offer higher data caps and include \u201cRoam Beyond\u201d international roaming.</p><p>Freedom brand awareness is also growing. Freedom is an official sponsor of the 2025 Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic cultural events; the exceptional exposure to millions of attendees and television viewers will strengthen its national positioning.</p><p>We are also proud of the resounding success of Fizz TV, the all-digital television service we launched in February 2025. Available to Fizz Internet subscribers in Qu\u00e9bec, Fizz TV meets the needs of customers seeking flexibility, accessibility and innovation. More than 12,000 new customers signed up in just a few weeks, confirming the relevance of our offer and the appeal of the Fizz brand in a fast-changing market.</p><p>Videotron continued to pick up distinctions, ranking as the most respected telecommunications company in Qu\u00e9bec for the 19th time since 2006 in L\u00e9ger\u2019s 2025 Reputation survey. It also hit a double in L\u00e9ger\u2019s WOW 2025 index, in which it ranked first among telecom retailers for in-store experience in Qu\u00e9bec while Fizz was first in Canada for online experience for the sixth year in a row. Freedom moved up to third place for online experience.</p><p>Although its current restructuring plans have reduced operating expenses considerably, TVA Group Inc. (\u201cTVA Group\u201d) recorded negative adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 as a result of a significant ongoing decline in advertising revenues due to the general crisis in the media industry and fewer major foreign productions filming at our MELS studios. We must therefore maintain a rigorous approach in order to meet the current challenges and safeguard the future of the business.</p><p>Even though TVA Group gained market share, climbing to a total of 42.4% in the Winter 2025 season (January 6 to April 6, 2025), our advertising revenues continued to decline. Our platforms deliver considerably more viewing hours than the American platforms, but advertisers continue to pour their dollars into the latter. Yet their reliability pales in comparison with the credibility of local media, which offer advertisers an unrivalled showcase and reach their target audiences more effectively. As we have repeatedly argued, we believe that the federal government must eliminate the tax deduction for advertising spending on foreign platforms and, conversely, introduce a tax deduction for investment in domestic businesses. At a time when the proliferation of fake news on social media is widely condemned, it defies logic that our public institutions continue to encourage foreign platforms and our governments support them through unfair favourable tax treatment.</p><p>Moreover, as private broadcasters struggle to survive in an over-regulated, over-taxed and loss-making broadcasting environment with a long-obsolete business model, the federal government must move quickly to implement the recommendations of the 2020 Yale Report by reforming CBC/Radio-Canada and its mandate, in particular by eliminating advertising in order to support private broadcasters, for which it is the main source of revenue.</p><p>I would like to mention the upcoming retirement, on May 14, of Lyne Robitaille, Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines, and a valued contributor for the past 36 years. Lyne has had a remarkable career. Over the years, she has led the development and growth of several Quebecor subsidiaries. She oversaw a number of major transformations at Quebecor, including the digital transition of our newspapers, which made Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec the most-read newspapers in Qu\u00e9bec across all platforms, with over 3.1 million readers per week. On behalf of Quebecor, I wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.</p><p>In April 2025, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pierre P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor launched a year-long tribute to honour the memory of its founder, a visionary builder of Qu\u00e9bec Inc. who helped transform and modernize Qu\u00e9bec society and its economy. This anniversary is also a reminder that the philanthropic commitment that was so important to Pierre P\u00e9ladeau remains central to Quebecor\u2019s values, as our recent historic donations\u2014$20 million to Universit\u00e9 Laval to support the Carrefour international Brian-Mulroney and $10 million to the Fondation du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec to support its integrated cancer centre\u2014eloquently demonstrate. Several other events will follow in the course of the year.</p><p>Today, the innovation, ambition and courage to think big that we inherited from Pierre P\u00e9ladeau continue to drive our growth and expansion. Extending our track record of successful execution, we are maintaining rigorous financial discipline and building on solid foundations to achieve our objectives and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025\">https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025</url></p><p>Rogers Communications Inc.

(\u201cShaw\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>Fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6% year-over-year to $624 million, funds flow from operations decreased 5.3% to $487 million, and net income decreased 32.9% to $169 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenue decreased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Fiscal 2022 results include year-over-year growth in Consumer Internet, Wireless service and Business revenue, offset by declines in Wireless equipment and Wireline Video, Satellite and Phone revenue. The prior year results included Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates and higher equity-based compensation costs of approximately $29 million due to the significant increase in Shaw\u2019s share price following the Rogers-Shaw Transaction (as defined below) announcement on March 15, 2021. Throughout the year, management continued to invest in its networks, focus on profitable subscriber growth and support the Proposed Transaction (as defined below).</p><p>\u201cAs Canadians put the COVID-19 pandemic behind them, the need to connect, and stay connected, has remained strong. The Canadian and global communications sectors \u2013 both wireline and wireless \u2013 face important and rapidly escalating investment demands where ongoing investments today determine our competitiveness tomorrow. That is true for our networks, and also for our country. All Canadians depend on our industry to make the necessary investments so that they can benefit from technology advances and all the opportunities afforded by our digital economy,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Mr. Shaw continued, \u201cThat is why it is so important to move forward with the transactions that Shaw, Quebecor and Rogers have agreed to in direct response to concerns raised by the Competition Bureau and ISED. Our proposed series of transactions creates an unprecedented opportunity to enable a strong, fourth wireless carrier that can compete at scale against the Big 3 and with 5G. The proposal also ensures that Shaw\u2019s wireline business can make the significant investments it needs to remain competitive over the long term. In short, we are proposing a bright future for sustainable competition in Canadian telecommunications. Instead of moving ahead with the investments and long-term planning that will drive more competition, we are unfortunately delayed by litigation with the Competition Bureau. Despite this, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately be able to complete our proposed transactions, and we are unwavering in our conviction that they represent a victory for all stakeholders, especially Canadian consumers. We maintain our strong commitment to the ongoing process, and to ensuring that Canada continues to have a vibrant and competitive industry with world leading infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Proposed Transaction</p><p>On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Rogers Communications Inc. (\u201cRogers\u201d), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw\u2019s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the \u201cRogers-Shaw Transaction\u201d).</p><p>Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the \u201cShaw Family Shareholders\u201d)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the \u201cRogers Shares\u201d) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash. As at March 13, 2021, when the Arrangement Agreement was signed, the value of the consideration attributable to the Class A Shares and Class B Shares held by the Shaw Family Shareholders (calculated using the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021) was equivalent to $40.50 per share.</p><p>The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw\u2019s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.</p><p>Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor</p><p>On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (\u201cQuebecor\u201d) announced their agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d) to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion.

(\u201cVideotron\u201d), a subsidiary of Quebecor, substantially consistent with the terms announced on June 17, 2022 (the \u201cFreedom Transaction\u201d). The Freedom Transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner of Competition (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and is conditional on the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. Subject to satisfaction of all conditions, closing of the Freedom Transaction will take place immediately before the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.  Collectively, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, the Freedom Transaction and all transactions provided thereunder are referred to as the \u201cProposed Transaction.\u201d</p><p>The Share Purchase Agreement provides that Videotron, a subsidiary of Quebecor, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Freedom. Accordingly, Videotron will acquire the entire Freedom business, including all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom\u2019s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations, and all of Freedom\u2019s existing backhaul and backbone arrangements. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements pursuant to which Rogers will provide Quebecor with transport services (including backhaul and backbone) and roaming services. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom\u2019s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom\u2019s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers will not be transferred to Videotron and will remain with Shaw.</p><p>Status of the Proposed Transaction Regulatory Approvals and Related Proceedings</p><p>For the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the parties made filings with each of the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Commissioner and ISED in April 2021. For the Freedom Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties made filings with the Commissioner and ISED in June 2022.</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw\u2019s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Commissioner\u2019s case can be heard by the Tribunal. On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner\u2019s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As announced by the Company on July 6, 2022 and October 27, 2022, the respective mediation sessions between Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor and the Commissioner in July, 2022 and October, 2022, did not result in a resolution of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the proposed merger.  As a result, the Tribunal hearing began on November 7, 2022.</p><p>On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry (the \u201cMinister\u201d) officially denied the application for the wholesale transfer of Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Rogers, which is no longer being proposed.  In connection with his ongoing review of the pending application to transfer Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Videotron, the Minister gave notice that any spectrum licences acquired by Videotron must remain in Videotron\u2019s possession for at least ten years and the Minister conveyed his expectation that prices for wireless services in Ontario and Western Canada would be comparable to what Videotron is currently offering in Quebec. Videotron subsequently announced that it is willing to accept these conditions.</p><p>The parties to the Proposed Transaction strongly believe that it is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy. Above all, the Proposed Transaction will strengthen competition in Canadian wireless and wireline telecommunications and enhance sustainable competition over the long term.  It will also enable network expansion, bridging the digital divide, and the next-generation wireless and wireline networks that will drive innovation and economic growth.</p><p>As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes and related hearings, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust have agreed to extend the outside date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from July 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 which outside date may be further extended to January 31, 2023 at the option of Rogers or Shaw, demonstrating their commitment to completing this transformative combination. The outside date in the Share Purchase Agreement also tracks the outside date in the Arrangement Agreement but can be extended beyond January 31, 2023 only with the consent of Videotron. Nonetheless, the time required to complete the Tribunal hearing, as well as receive ISED approval, including any appeals of the outcomes of any required regulatory process, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and the Freedom Transaction.</p><p>Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately 52,900 new Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 25,600 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile, partially offset by increasing retail traffic for Freedom Mobile, although not yet to pre-pandemic levels. Wireless service revenue growth of 7.3% is due to continued subscriber growth, partially offset by lower ARPU1. Fourth quarter Wireless ARPU decreased 0.9% from the prior year period to $37.08. Wireless postpaid churn2 of 1.39% improved approximately 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.</p><p>Consumer Wireline RGU3 losses in the fourth quarter of approximately 42,500 improved over the prior year period, led by Internet RGU additions of approximately 4,700, combined with fewer Video and Phone losses, primarily due to improved retention tactics. Fourth quarter Wireline revenue decreased 2.4% over the prior year to $1.03 billion and Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.4% to $501 million.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireless revenue increased 1.2% to $325 million and adjusted EBITDA of $123 million increased 16.0% year-over-year. For the twelve-month period, Wireless revenue grew 1.5% to $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $485 million improved 23.4%. Wireless service revenue for the three and twelve-month periods increased 7.3% and 9.1% respectively, to $250 million and $972 million, over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by lower ARPU. Wireless equipment revenue for the three and twelve-month periods decreased 14.8% and 16.3% respectively, to $75 million and $319 million over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021. Fourth quarter ARPU decreased 0.9% to $37.08 reflecting Shaw Mobile customer additions offset by lower device subsidy allocations. For the full year, ARPU of $36.83 decreased 1.4% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, the Company added approximately 160,000 Wireless customers bringing its total customer base to approximately 2.28 million.</p><p>Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 40,400 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 45,400 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain in Consumer Internet RGUs of approximately 4,700 offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 42,500 in the aggregate. Business RGUs increased by approximately 2,100.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireline revenue of $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $501 million decreased 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. Consumer revenue of $879 million decreased 3.4% compared to the prior year as Internet revenue growth was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $155 million increased 4.0% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.The decrease in revenue was partially offset by lower employee related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 of approximately $11 million due to the impact of share price movements on stock-based compensation as well as favourable adjustments to employee benefit provisions based on experience.</p><p>For the twelve-month period, Consumer revenue decreased 3.2% to $3.55 billion and Business revenue increased 6.7% to $623 million resulting in Wireline revenue of $4.17 billion, or 1.9% lower than the prior year. Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the same period of $2.05 billion decreased 2.8% due primarily to lower Consumer revenue.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $340 million compared to $292 million in the prior year. Wireline capital spending increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher investments in network upgrades, enhancements and success-based categories as well as an increase in new housing development. Wireless spending of $34 million decreased by approximately $37 million year-over-year primarily due to lower planned investment in the quarter. In fiscal 2022, consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion increased approximately 7.7% from the prior year.</p><p>Free cash flow4 for the quarter of $70 million compared to $227 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely due to higher capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 of $819 million was $154 million, or 15.8%, lower than the prior year due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid partially offset by growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Funds flow from operations for the quarter of $487 million decreased 5.3% from $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income and partially offset by a decrease in non-cash future income tax recovery. Funds flow from operations for fiscal 2022 of $2.0 billion was $257 million, or 11.4%, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher current income tax and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA all in the current year.</p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of $169 million decreased 32.9% from $252 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to an $83 million increase in income taxes in the quarter, primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income for fiscal 2022 of $764 million was $222 million lower than the prior year primarily due to a $29 million increase in interest expense related to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year and a $211 million increase in income taxes in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the $34 million increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Tax expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $125 million revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in 2021 as well as the recognition of a $78 million tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by management\u2019s expectations that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to fully utilize such losses, partially offset by the effect of higher pre-tax income.</p><p>As at the end of fiscal 2022, the net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.</p><p>Shaw files Year-End Disclosure Documents</p><p>Shaw announced today the filing with Canadian securities regulators of its 2022 audited annual consolidated financial statements, related management\u2019s discussion and analysis and 2022 annual information form and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its 2022 annual report on Form 40-F which includes the Canadian filings.</p><p>These documents are available on Shaw's profile on the Canadian Securities Administrators' website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).

This decrease is mainly due to the impact of the sale of the industrial packaging operations and lower volume in the Packaging Sector, partially offset by higher volume in the Retail Services and Printing Sector, notably in book printing activities, the favourable exchange rate effect and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Middleton Group Inc.</p><p>Operating earnings before depreciation and amortization decreased by $12.5 million, or 10.3%, from $121.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $109.0 million in the third quarter of 2025. This decrease is mainly due to lower volume in the Packaging Sector, a less favourable product mix in our two main sectors, the increase in restructuring and other costs, an asset impairment charge and the sale of the industrial packaging operations, partially offset by the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect.</p><p>Adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by $1.6 million, or 1.3%, from $121.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $122.6 million in the third quarter of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, mostly offset by lower volume in the Packaging Sector, a less favourable product mix in our two main sectors and the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation decreased by $4.9 million, or 11.2%, from $43.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $38.7 million in the third quarter of 2025. This decrease is mainly due to the previously explained decrease in operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower financial expenses, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes. On a per share basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.50 to $0.46, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $7.5 million, or 14.6%, from $51.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $58.9 million in the third quarter of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to lower financial expenses and income taxes as well as the previously explained increase in adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization. On a per share basis, adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.60 to $0.70, respectively.</p><p>Results for the First Nine Months of Fiscal Year 2025</p><p>Revenues decreased by $52.1 million, or 2.5%, from $2,063.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $2,011.5 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This decrease is mainly due to the impact of the sale of the industrial packaging operations and lower volume, mainly in the Packaging Sector, partially offset by the favourable exchange rate effect.</p><p>Operating earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by $62.0 million, or 21.2%, from $292.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $354.9 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the decrease in restructuring and other costs (revenues), the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, partially offset by lower volume and a less favourable product mix in the Packaging Sector as well as the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by $1.4 million, or 0.4%, from $327.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $328.6 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, mostly offset by lower volume and a less favourable product mix in the Packaging Sector as well as the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $54.7 million, or 74.5%, from $73.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $128.1 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the previously explained increase in operating earnings before depreciation and amortization as well as lower financial expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher income taxes. On a per share basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.85 to $1.53, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $14.5 million, or 10.8%, from $134.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $148.6 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to lower financial expenses. On a per share basis, adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $1.55 to $1.77, respectively.</p><p>For more detailed financial information, please see the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter ended July 27, 2025, as well as the financial statements in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of our website at  <url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/investors/overview\">www.tc.tc</url>  .</p><p>Outlook    (1)</p><p>The investments in our growth activities, including flexible packaging and in-store marketing, position us well for the future and should be a key driver of our long-term growth.</p><p>In terms of profitability, despite a weaker than anticipated demand in the third quarter, we expect to generate organic growth in adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization of the Packaging Sector for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. In the Retail Services and Printing Sector, given the higher than anticipated growth in earnings since the beginning of fiscal 2025, we expect adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2025 to rise compared to fiscal 2024.</p><p>Lastly, we expect to continue generating significant cash flows from operating activities, which will enable us to pursue our strategy launched in 2023 to reduce net indebtedness while investing in our growth and returning capital to our shareholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2\">https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2</url></p><p>Vividata</p><p>Vividata Leader In Canadian Cross-Media And Consumer Research</p><p>Offering the largest syndicated study in Canada, Vividata\u2019s SCC | Study of the Canadian Consumer is the go-to source for demographics, psychographics, lifestyle, life events, media, purchasing and brand preferences.

As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.</p><p>This article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Canadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content</p><p>Back to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025</p><p>TORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.</p><p>The delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships. The initiative aims to strengthen bilateral connections between French and Canadian producers, with a focus on the development of new English-language television series across genres.</p><p>In addition to bringing together experienced producers from Canada and France to strengthen bilateral content collaboration, the CMPA and USPA will discuss the ongoing shared challenges faced by the independent production sectors in their respective countries.</p><p>\u201cUSPA is thrilled with the ongoing international cooperation fostered by its partnership with CMPA in Canada. In the current international context, it is necessary to strengthen the links between our two countries, both operationally and politically,\u201d said Amanda Borghino, Deputy General Delegate of the USPA. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this collaboration and shaping together new paths for transatlantic content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrance has long been a valued production partner for Canada, and we are thrilled to collaborate with USPA on this initiative,\u201d said Reynolds Mastin, President and CEO of the CMPA. \u201cToday, our two countries are leading global efforts to ensure foreign streaming services respect the right of national governments to require equitable contributions to domestic production, and opportunities for local producers to hold and exploit their own intellectual property. This is critical to the success of local independent production sectors, and to safeguarding individual countries\u2019 national cultural sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>Participants from Canada:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Amos   Adetuyi, Circle Blue Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Alfons Adetuyi, Inner City Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Kerry Appleyard, Lionsgate Canada  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Eli Campbell, Peacock Alley Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Annette Clarke, Ruby Line Productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Lauren Corber, LoCo Motion Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   David Cormican, Fun Republic Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Malachi Ellis, Area V5 Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sibel Guvenc, Kybele Films Inc.  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Frederick Kroetsch, Catapult Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michelle Morris, Lily Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michael Souther, Amaze Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Steven Thibault, Screen Siren Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Participants from France:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Iris Bucher, Quad Drama (USPA President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Thomas Anargyros, Mediawan Studio France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Isabelle Degeorges, Gaumont Televisions France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Patricia Boutinard Rouelle, Nilaya Productions (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Odile McDonald, Wildcats Productions (USPA Drama college VP)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Arnaud de Cr\u00e9miers, Jour Premier  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sophie Deloche, Ashart\u00e9&amp;Cie  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Nicolas Deprost, What\u2019s up productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Fabrice Est\u00e8ve, Yuzu Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Emmanuel Fran\u00e7ois, Brother Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Corine Janin, Bleu Kobalt  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Betty Johnson, Hababo Studios  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Am\u00e9lie Juan, Morgane Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Jean-Marie Laronze, Monde et media TV  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Gini Lorin, Scriptline  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Tatiana Maksimenko, Hamak (Effervescence group)  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The initiative is presented in collaboration with Telefilm Canada, the Canada Media Fund, CanExport for Associations (Global Affairs), the French Embassy in Canada and the Canadian Embassy in France.</p><p>Source: The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/\">https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/</url></p><p>Canada Media Producers Association</p><p>The Canadian Media Producers Association is Canada\u2019s trade association for independent producers.

Heightened economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the prospect of a global recession are weighing on consumer confidence. In addition, the decline in BCE's share price has resulted in a higher cost of capital. The Board also considered the impact of the unsupportive regulatory environment given recent CRTC decisions, ongoing aggressive competitive pricing, and a slowdown in immigration.</p><p>Greater financial flexibility and a prudent approach to capital management is required in the current economic, regulatory and competitive environments. Accordingly, the Board has determined to establish the annualized dividend at $1.75 per BCE common share.

Adjusted EBITDA projections remain the same as previously disclosed. The Corporation expects additional pressure on its revenue, particularly in\u00a0the United States, driven by increased competition. As part of its three-year transformation program, the Corporation has initiated several cost reduction initiatives and operating efficiencies across the organization in order to minimize the revenue impact on adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, net capital expenditures are expected to be lower than under the previous financial guidelines, partially resulting from operational efficiencies following the combination of the Canadian and U.S. management teams.</p><p>Consequently, compared to fiscal 2024, on a constant currency and consolidated basis, we are lowering Cogeco's revenue projections for fiscal 2025 to a low single digit decline, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain stable.

As part of its three-year transformation program, the Corporation has initiated several cost reduction initiatives and operating efficiencies across the organization in order to minimize the revenue impact on adjusted EBITDA.

The Corporation continues to make progress, gaining market share quarter after quarter while consolidating its position as the most profitable player in the sector, supported by the strongest balance sheet in the Canadian telecommunications industry.</p><p>Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor</p><p>Quebecor posted solid financial results in the first quarter of 2025, including increases of 8.1% in cash flows provided by operating activities and 13.5% in adjusted income from operating activities. As a result of this strong performance, driven by rigorous disciplined management, we were able to reduce our consolidated net debt by more than $155.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 and lower our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to 3.26x at March 31, 2025, the lowest among Canada\u2019s major telecommunications providers.</p><p>In an aggressively competitive business environment, our innovative range of products offered at competitive prices allowed us to deliver an increase of 54,400 (1.3%) new mobile lines in the first quarter of 2025, the best growth rate among Canada\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, and 367,500 (9.6%) lines over the past twelve months. We continued investing in our network, in line with our priority of delivering a superior customer experience. Since April 2025, we have been gradually deploying 3800 MHz spectrum across Freedom\u2019s 5G+ network in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. With access to state-of-the-art 5G+ technology now included in all Freedom monthly mobile plans, regardless of price, this rollout will significantly boost network capacity and performance. In February 2025, Freedom also launched a new range of mobile plans in Manitoba that offer higher data caps and include \u201cRoam Beyond\u201d international roaming.</p><p>Freedom brand awareness is also growing. Freedom is an official sponsor of the 2025 Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic cultural events; the exceptional exposure to millions of attendees and television viewers will strengthen its national positioning.</p><p>We are also proud of the resounding success of Fizz TV, the all-digital television service we launched in February 2025. Available to Fizz Internet subscribers in Qu\u00e9bec, Fizz TV meets the needs of customers seeking flexibility, accessibility and innovation. More than 12,000 new customers signed up in just a few weeks, confirming the relevance of our offer and the appeal of the Fizz brand in a fast-changing market.</p><p>Videotron continued to pick up distinctions, ranking as the most respected telecommunications company in Qu\u00e9bec for the 19th time since 2006 in L\u00e9ger\u2019s 2025 Reputation survey. It also hit a double in L\u00e9ger\u2019s WOW 2025 index, in which it ranked first among telecom retailers for in-store experience in Qu\u00e9bec while Fizz was first in Canada for online experience for the sixth year in a row. Freedom moved up to third place for online experience.</p><p>Although its current restructuring plans have reduced operating expenses considerably, TVA Group Inc. (\u201cTVA Group\u201d) recorded negative adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 as a result of a significant ongoing decline in advertising revenues due to the general crisis in the media industry and fewer major foreign productions filming at our MELS studios. We must therefore maintain a rigorous approach in order to meet the current challenges and safeguard the future of the business.</p><p>Even though TVA Group gained market share, climbing to a total of 42.4% in the Winter 2025 season (January 6 to April 6, 2025), our advertising revenues continued to decline. Our platforms deliver considerably more viewing hours than the American platforms, but advertisers continue to pour their dollars into the latter. Yet their reliability pales in comparison with the credibility of local media, which offer advertisers an unrivalled showcase and reach their target audiences more effectively. As we have repeatedly argued, we believe that the federal government must eliminate the tax deduction for advertising spending on foreign platforms and, conversely, introduce a tax deduction for investment in domestic businesses. At a time when the proliferation of fake news on social media is widely condemned, it defies logic that our public institutions continue to encourage foreign platforms and our governments support them through unfair favourable tax treatment.</p><p>Moreover, as private broadcasters struggle to survive in an over-regulated, over-taxed and loss-making broadcasting environment with a long-obsolete business model, the federal government must move quickly to implement the recommendations of the 2020 Yale Report by reforming CBC/Radio-Canada and its mandate, in particular by eliminating advertising in order to support private broadcasters, for which it is the main source of revenue.</p><p>I would like to mention the upcoming retirement, on May 14, of Lyne Robitaille, Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines, and a valued contributor for the past 36 years. Lyne has had a remarkable career. Over the years, she has led the development and growth of several Quebecor subsidiaries. She oversaw a number of major transformations at Quebecor, including the digital transition of our newspapers, which made Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec the most-read newspapers in Qu\u00e9bec across all platforms, with over 3.1 million readers per week. On behalf of Quebecor, I wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.</p><p>In April 2025, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pierre P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor launched a year-long tribute to honour the memory of its founder, a visionary builder of Qu\u00e9bec Inc. who helped transform and modernize Qu\u00e9bec society and its economy. This anniversary is also a reminder that the philanthropic commitment that was so important to Pierre P\u00e9ladeau remains central to Quebecor\u2019s values, as our recent historic donations\u2014$20 million to Universit\u00e9 Laval to support the Carrefour international Brian-Mulroney and $10 million to the Fondation du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec to support its integrated cancer centre\u2014eloquently demonstrate. Several other events will follow in the course of the year.</p><p>Today, the innovation, ambition and courage to think big that we inherited from Pierre P\u00e9ladeau continue to drive our growth and expansion. Extending our track record of successful execution, we are maintaining rigorous financial discipline and building on solid foundations to achieve our objectives and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025\">https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025</url></p><p>Rogers Communications Inc.

(\u201cShaw\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>Fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6% year-over-year to $624 million, funds flow from operations decreased 5.3% to $487 million, and net income decreased 32.9% to $169 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenue decreased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Fiscal 2022 results include year-over-year growth in Consumer Internet, Wireless service and Business revenue, offset by declines in Wireless equipment and Wireline Video, Satellite and Phone revenue. The prior year results included Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates and higher equity-based compensation costs of approximately $29 million due to the significant increase in Shaw\u2019s share price following the Rogers-Shaw Transaction (as defined below) announcement on March 15, 2021. Throughout the year, management continued to invest in its networks, focus on profitable subscriber growth and support the Proposed Transaction (as defined below).</p><p>\u201cAs Canadians put the COVID-19 pandemic behind them, the need to connect, and stay connected, has remained strong. The Canadian and global communications sectors \u2013 both wireline and wireless \u2013 face important and rapidly escalating investment demands where ongoing investments today determine our competitiveness tomorrow. That is true for our networks, and also for our country. All Canadians depend on our industry to make the necessary investments so that they can benefit from technology advances and all the opportunities afforded by our digital economy,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Mr. Shaw continued, \u201cThat is why it is so important to move forward with the transactions that Shaw, Quebecor and Rogers have agreed to in direct response to concerns raised by the Competition Bureau and ISED. Our proposed series of transactions creates an unprecedented opportunity to enable a strong, fourth wireless carrier that can compete at scale against the Big 3 and with 5G. The proposal also ensures that Shaw\u2019s wireline business can make the significant investments it needs to remain competitive over the long term. In short, we are proposing a bright future for sustainable competition in Canadian telecommunications. Instead of moving ahead with the investments and long-term planning that will drive more competition, we are unfortunately delayed by litigation with the Competition Bureau. Despite this, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately be able to complete our proposed transactions, and we are unwavering in our conviction that they represent a victory for all stakeholders, especially Canadian consumers. We maintain our strong commitment to the ongoing process, and to ensuring that Canada continues to have a vibrant and competitive industry with world leading infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Proposed Transaction</p><p>On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Rogers Communications Inc. (\u201cRogers\u201d), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw\u2019s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the \u201cRogers-Shaw Transaction\u201d).</p><p>Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the \u201cShaw Family Shareholders\u201d)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the \u201cRogers Shares\u201d) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash. As at March 13, 2021, when the Arrangement Agreement was signed, the value of the consideration attributable to the Class A Shares and Class B Shares held by the Shaw Family Shareholders (calculated using the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021) was equivalent to $40.50 per share.</p><p>The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw\u2019s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.</p><p>Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor</p><p>On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (\u201cQuebecor\u201d) announced their agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d) to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion. On August 12, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cShare Purchase Agreement\u201d) for the sale of Freedom to Videotron Ltd. (\u201cVideotron\u201d), a subsidiary of Quebecor, substantially consistent with the terms announced on June 17, 2022 (the \u201cFreedom Transaction\u201d). The Freedom Transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner of Competition (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and is conditional on the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. Subject to satisfaction of all conditions, closing of the Freedom Transaction will take place immediately before the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.  Collectively, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, the Freedom Transaction and all transactions provided thereunder are referred to as the \u201cProposed Transaction.\u201d</p><p>The Share Purchase Agreement provides that Videotron, a subsidiary of Quebecor, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Freedom. Accordingly, Videotron will acquire the entire Freedom business, including all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom\u2019s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations, and all of Freedom\u2019s existing backhaul and backbone arrangements. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements pursuant to which Rogers will provide Quebecor with transport services (including backhaul and backbone) and roaming services. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom\u2019s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom\u2019s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers will not be transferred to Videotron and will remain with Shaw.</p><p>Status of the Proposed Transaction Regulatory Approvals and Related Proceedings</p><p>For the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the parties made filings with each of the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Commissioner and ISED in April 2021. For the Freedom Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties made filings with the Commissioner and ISED in June 2022.</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw\u2019s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Commissioner\u2019s case can be heard by the Tribunal. On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner\u2019s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As announced by the Company on July 6, 2022 and October 27, 2022, the respective mediation sessions between Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor and the Commissioner in July, 2022 and October, 2022, did not result in a resolution of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the proposed merger.  As a result, the Tribunal hearing began on November 7, 2022.</p><p>On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry (the \u201cMinister\u201d) officially denied the application for the wholesale transfer of Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Rogers, which is no longer being proposed.  In connection with his ongoing review of the pending application to transfer Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Videotron, the Minister gave notice that any spectrum licences acquired by Videotron must remain in Videotron\u2019s possession for at least ten years and the Minister conveyed his expectation that prices for wireless services in Ontario and Western Canada would be comparable to what Videotron is currently offering in Quebec. Videotron subsequently announced that it is willing to accept these conditions.</p><p>The parties to the Proposed Transaction strongly believe that it is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy. Above all, the Proposed Transaction will strengthen competition in Canadian wireless and wireline telecommunications and enhance sustainable competition over the long term.

The outside date in the Share Purchase Agreement also tracks the outside date in the Arrangement Agreement but can be extended beyond January 31, 2023 only with the consent of Videotron. Nonetheless, the time required to complete the Tribunal hearing, as well as receive ISED approval, including any appeals of the outcomes of any required regulatory process, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and the Freedom Transaction.</p><p>Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately 52,900 new Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 25,600 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile, partially offset by increasing retail traffic for Freedom Mobile, although not yet to pre-pandemic levels. Wireless service revenue growth of 7.3% is due to continued subscriber growth, partially offset by lower ARPU1. Fourth quarter Wireless ARPU decreased 0.9% from the prior year period to $37.08. Wireless postpaid churn2 of 1.39% improved approximately 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.</p><p>Consumer Wireline RGU3 losses in the fourth quarter of approximately 42,500 improved over the prior year period, led by Internet RGU additions of approximately 4,700, combined with fewer Video and Phone losses, primarily due to improved retention tactics. Fourth quarter Wireline revenue decreased 2.4% over the prior year to $1.03 billion and Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.4% to $501 million.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireless revenue increased 1.2% to $325 million and adjusted EBITDA of $123 million increased 16.0% year-over-year. For the twelve-month period, Wireless revenue grew 1.5% to $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $485 million improved 23.4%. Wireless service revenue for the three and twelve-month periods increased 7.3% and 9.1% respectively, to $250 million and $972 million, over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by lower ARPU. Wireless equipment revenue for the three and twelve-month periods decreased 14.8% and 16.3% respectively, to $75 million and $319 million over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021. Fourth quarter ARPU decreased 0.9% to $37.08 reflecting Shaw Mobile customer additions offset by lower device subsidy allocations. For the full year, ARPU of $36.83 decreased 1.4% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, the Company added approximately 160,000 Wireless customers bringing its total customer base to approximately 2.28 million.</p><p>Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 40,400 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 45,400 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain in Consumer Internet RGUs of approximately 4,700 offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 42,500 in the aggregate. Business RGUs increased by approximately 2,100.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireline revenue of $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $501 million decreased 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. Consumer revenue of $879 million decreased 3.4% compared to the prior year as Internet revenue growth was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $155 million increased 4.0% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.The decrease in revenue was partially offset by lower employee related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 of approximately $11 million due to the impact of share price movements on stock-based compensation as well as favourable adjustments to employee benefit provisions based on experience.</p><p>For the twelve-month period, Consumer revenue decreased 3.2% to $3.55 billion and Business revenue increased 6.7% to $623 million resulting in Wireline revenue of $4.17 billion, or 1.9% lower than the prior year. Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the same period of $2.05 billion decreased 2.8% due primarily to lower Consumer revenue.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $340 million compared to $292 million in the prior year. Wireline capital spending increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher investments in network upgrades, enhancements and success-based categories as well as an increase in new housing development. Wireless spending of $34 million decreased by approximately $37 million year-over-year primarily due to lower planned investment in the quarter. In fiscal 2022, consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion increased approximately 7.7% from the prior year.</p><p>Free cash flow4 for the quarter of $70 million compared to $227 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely due to higher capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 of $819 million was $154 million, or 15.8%, lower than the prior year due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid partially offset by growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Funds flow from operations for the quarter of $487 million decreased 5.3% from $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income and partially offset by a decrease in non-cash future income tax recovery. Funds flow from operations for fiscal 2022 of $2.0 billion was $257 million, or 11.4%, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher current income tax and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA all in the current year.</p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of $169 million decreased 32.9% from $252 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to an $83 million increase in income taxes in the quarter, primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income for fiscal 2022 of $764 million was $222 million lower than the prior year primarily due to a $29 million increase in interest expense related to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year and a $211 million increase in income taxes in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the $34 million increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Tax expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $125 million revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in 2021 as well as the recognition of a $78 million tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by management\u2019s expectations that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to fully utilize such losses, partially offset by the effect of higher pre-tax income.</p><p>As at the end of fiscal 2022, the net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.</p><p>Shaw files Year-End Disclosure Documents</p><p>Shaw announced today the filing with Canadian securities regulators of its 2022 audited annual consolidated financial statements, related management\u2019s discussion and analysis and 2022 annual information form and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its 2022 annual report on Form 40-F which includes the Canadian filings.</p><p>These documents are available on Shaw's profile on the Canadian Securities Administrators' website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).

This increase is mainly attributable to the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, mostly offset by lower volume and a less favourable product mix in the Packaging Sector as well as the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $54.7 million, or 74.5%, from $73.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $128.1 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the previously explained increase in operating earnings before depreciation and amortization as well as lower financial expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher income taxes. On a per share basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.85 to $1.53, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $14.5 million, or 10.8%, from $134.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $148.6 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to lower financial expenses. On a per share basis, adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $1.55 to $1.77, respectively.</p><p>For more detailed financial information, please see the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter ended July 27, 2025, as well as the financial statements in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of our website at  <url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/investors/overview\">www.tc.tc</url>  .</p><p>Outlook    (1)</p><p>The investments in our growth activities, including flexible packaging and in-store marketing, position us well for the future and should be a key driver of our long-term growth.</p><p>In terms of profitability, despite a weaker than anticipated demand in the third quarter, we expect to generate organic growth in adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization of the Packaging Sector for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. In the Retail Services and Printing Sector, given the higher than anticipated growth in earnings since the beginning of fiscal 2025, we expect adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2025 to rise compared to fiscal 2024.</p><p>Lastly, we expect to continue generating significant cash flows from operating activities, which will enable us to pursue our strategy launched in 2023 to reduce net indebtedness while investing in our growth and returning capital to our shareholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2\">https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2</url></p><p>Vividata</p><p>Vividata Leader In Canadian Cross-Media And Consumer Research</p><p>Offering the largest syndicated study in Canada, Vividata\u2019s SCC | Study of the Canadian Consumer is the go-to source for demographics, psychographics, lifestyle, life events, media, purchasing and brand preferences.

This week, a swath of the Pine Barrens went up in flames, a stark warning of what might be a treacherous fire season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About 11,500 acres were affected by a fire that started Tuesday morning in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area of Ocean County, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/NJForestFireService?mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=y91lb1S4OLtp8xsj&amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F17ZfMQcM3D%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr#\">New Jersey Forest Fire Service said midday Wednesday.</url> The Garden State Parkway was shut down for miles as thick smoke wafted into neighborhoods and thousands of households and businesses were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nj-wildfire-ocean-county-barnegat-lacey/\">evacuated for hours</url> and had power cuts. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service said 50% of the blaze was contained by Wednesday evening.</p><p>Foresters <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/\">had warned in March</url> that New Jersey was particularly vulnerable to wildfires this year because of below-average rains, near-drought conditions\u2014and a delay in prescribed burns by authorities that have typically helped to reduce risk.</p><p>A Smokey Bear sign warns against wildfire in Brendan T.

Its bark is dark and scaly and can endure the periodic wildfires that are part of the natural ecological cycle. But the pinelands, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/pinelands/reserve/\">first national reserve</url> in the country, also thrive because of forest service prescribed burns to rid brush. This year, foresters said they cut back on springtime burns because of on-the-ground conditions: It has been just too hot and dry to start prescribed fires.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service typically treats 25,000 acres in central New Jersey, across seven counties, with planned burns. So far this year, forest personnel have burned only 3,320 acres, a fraction of its work in previous years. Five years ago, 26,000 acres were burned. In 2024, 15,000 were targeted.\u00a0</p><p>New Jersey entered fire season, from March to May, following its third driest January since records began in 1895. State fire officials are warning that a drop in rainfall and snow have made autumn leaves and winter needles ready tinder across what is called the Atlantic Coastal Pine Barrens.</p><p>\u201cConditions have severely hampered efforts by the Forest Fire Service to conduct prescribed fire operations that are critical to preventing wildfires,\u201d Bill Donnelly, the state\u2019s fire warden and forest fire service chief, said in an email before Tuesday\u2019s flames.</p><p>Donnelly and his team normally conduct prescribed operations through March 15 in the southern and central regions of New Jersey, and April 1 in the north.</p><p>[Image: Paul Horn/Inside Climate News]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>When fire officials burn during dry conditions, there\u2019s a higher risk of burning into what\u2019s called the duff layer, which is the decomposed organic matter like leaves, twigs, and needles that sits atop the soil. If burned, Donnelly said, it could damage new growth and cause smoke that lingers, affecting communities and roadways for weeks.</p><p>\u201cNot sure what the rest of the year\u2019s gonna hold for us,\u201d Donnelly said in a press briefing last month. \u201cIf things continue the way they are, we\u2019re going to have quite a fire season on our hands.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>New Jersey, the country\u2019s fourth-smallest state geographically, offers an example of America\u2019s growing fire risk in the Northeast. The region is experiencing drier and wetter seasons, part of what is a changing and much less predictable cycle of drought and deluge. Evolving climate patterns are testing fire strategy from California to Connecticut as well as communities. Los Angeles suffered devastating fires in January, with billions of dollars in damages, and UCLA researchers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/los-angeles-fires-survey.html\">in an extensive survey</url>, found residents reported emotional and financial loss for months after.</p><p>Beautiful broadleaf deciduous trees that color the Northeast in the fall are tightly packed so that, in less trying times, when the leaves drop they often hold a lot of moisture, according to Erica Smithwick, a professor of geography and ecology at Penn State University.</p><p>Not so in drier conditions. The leaves are parched for water as they fall and pose an increased fire risk. \u201cIf the leaves are dead and they dry out in the fall and they drop to the ground, all you need is ignition to get it all to burn,\u201d Smithwick said. Burns are meant to clear undergrowth safely and limit wildfire.</p><p>Last fall, <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18022025/northeast-wildfire-risks/\">multiple woodland fires</url> broke out in the Northeast including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York. In January, firefighters from a coalition of Northeast states met to discuss the increasing unpredictability of rain and drought across the region. Record-low rainfall allowed for blazes in October and November north of Boston, in Brooklyn, and in Connecticut. On New Jersey\u2019s border with New York, fire scorched <url normalizedValue=\"https://abc7ny.com/post/jennings-creek-wildfire-fire-now-100-percent-contained/15575544/\">5,000 acres of land</url> and one volunteer firefighter died.</p><p>Some experts, including Jaclyn Rhoads, executive director at Pinelands Preservation Alliance, suggest that prescribed burning should occur throughout the year. Fire personnel should be planning beyond seasons, she said, and considering month-by-month weather conditions.</p><p>\u201cWe need to try to mimic the wildfires in a controlled way that allows for us to receive all the benefits without necessarily the damages,\u201d Rhoads said. \u201cThere are plenty of examples, like in Florida, where their forest fire service burns all year round.\u201d</p><p>Smithwick at Penn State noted that Northeast forests are close to cities and infrastructure such as roads and powerlines. Maps of wildlife urban interface (WUI)\u2014areas where wildland vegetation and man-made development intermingle and are particularly vulnerable to wildfires\u2014show an expansion of 2 million acres per year based on data from the U.S. Fire Administration.</p><p>\u201cEven a small wildfire could have more impact in the east because of all that built infrastructure,\u201d Smithwick said. \u201cIn fact, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the mid-Atlantic\u2014some of the highest WUI in the country is in the east.\u201d</p><p>Caryn Shinske, senior press officer of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said fire teams in the past month had been staffing fire towers, staging for initial response for possible fires, and readying equipment for the summer risks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u2014By\u00a0Anna Mattson, Inside Climate News</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News.

It's ridiculous.'</p><p>Retired academic, Professor Bart Kay, spent decades working across 10 universities around the world, specialising in cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p><p>He told Daily Mail: 'Blaming heart disease on cholesterol is akin to turning on the TV, seeing a forest fire, seeing scenes of firemen running around then blaming the fire on the firemen.'</p><p>Professor Kay explained that when a person suffers a heart attack, caused by a blockage, cholesterol was found but wrongly blamed as the root cause.</p><p>'The clogging of the arteries is almost entirely consisting of scar tissue and clotting factors,' he said.</p><p>'This is an auto-immune dysfunction underpinned by inflammation, underpinned by endothelial cell injury.</p><p>'If you have endothelial cell injury those cells will be screaming out for raw materials to make repairs and that will include cholesterol.'</p><p>Professor Kay claimed he could easily prove that cholesterol wasn't causing blockages in arteries.</p><p>'Atherosclerotic lesions occur in the endothelial linings of your arteries, not your veins, unless you take a vein out of your venous system and you graft it into the arterial system for a bypass operation,' he said.</p><p>'That vein that then becomes an artery suddenly becomes susceptible to atherosclerosis heart disease when it wasn't when it was a vein.</p><p>'It's the same tissue but we've just moved it from the low-pressure side of the system to the high-pressure side. Both sides of the system carry the same blood that has the same cholesterol lipoprotein carriers.</p><p>'There is no way that cholesterol, of LDL cholesterol, can be the cause of heart disease. It seems that what's required is high blood pressure.'</p><p>Dr Walker agreed and pointed out that statins were the biggest selling drugs in the world.</p><p>'Blood pressure is the most important cardiovascular risk factor, especially when you get over 60. It's much more important than cholesterol,' he said.</p><p>Both recommended blood pressure be kept under 120/80 and both told Daily Mail the same thing - blockages in arteries appear at predictable points.</p><p>'The pattern of where these lesions occur is where the blood flow is turbulent. That happens at splitting points of an artery or when you've got a big curve like in the aorta,' Professor Kay said.</p><p>'It turns out that the transit time of blood under high pressure across those tissues is what's doing the physical damage that's causing the inflammation. The reaction to the inflammation is the retention of LDL so it can deliver its cholesterol payload.'</p><p>So, in a nutshell, if there's no endothelial cell damage, cholesterol (including LDL) will not accumulate in the artery wall in large amounts.</p><p>Dr Walker said the key to good cardiac health involved five things.</p><p>The first was having no addictions of any kind.</p><p>'So, anyone that smokes is ill. You can't be healthy and drink too much alcohol or snort cocaine,' Dr Walker said.</p><p>The second was sleep and Dr Walker recommended seven to eight hours of good quality sleep which was 'as good for your body as not smoking'.</p><p>The third is diet.</p><p>'One of the key aspects of nutrition is not just what you should avoid but what you should have and, tragically, only five per cent of the population have two or three pieces of fruit and three to five servings of vegetables per day,' Dr Walker said.</p><p>'Those who do have the lowest rates of heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's and it doesn't do zip to your cholesterol.</p><p>'What it does it keep your immune system healthy but damping down chronic inflammation which is one of the bases of all modern disease.'</p><p>The fourth principle was exercise, but not too much of it.</p><p>'The second-best drug on the planet is three to five hours every week of moderate excursion which should be two thirds cardo and a third resistance training,' Dr Walker said.</p><p>'Once you go beyond five hours a week you don't get any extra benefit, and you may get harm.</p><p>'And, finally, the best drug on the planet is happiness. You do those five things well, and only 10 per cent of the population does, you reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease by over 80 per cent.'</p><p>Dr Walker recommended that every male at 50 and every female at 60 get a calcium score test.</p><p>It's a measurement of the amount of calcified plaque in the arteries supplying blood to the heart.</p><p>'It measures how much muck you have in your arteries,' Dr Walker said.</p><p>'The studies show beyond a doubt that if your calcium score is below 100 you don't need a statin to lower your cholesterol.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-114125024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKV-FT13-S0M3-648V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><timeReceived>6:09 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Other than that outlier, the 14.5 million acres so far this year are the most since 1995, according to the CIFFC.</p><p>Webster said that, for many years, Maine did not see a lot of wildfire smoke.</p><p>\"Of course, 2023 was the big year,\" she said. \"That was an absolutely awful year.\"</p><p>While not as bad, Maine still saw a significant amount of smoke in 2024 and is feeling it again this year.</p><p>\"Right now, it looks like, as one smoke plume starts to leave, it doesn't totally clean out, and the next one moves in,\" Webster said of this year's fires. \"I would encourage people to pay attention to the forecast and how their bodies are when they're outside for the rest of the week.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNJOU-httpswwwsunjournalcom20250728canadianwildfiresmokeislingeringinmainehereswhatyoushouldknowbeforeheadingoutside</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNJOU2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCG-30T3-RSFW-P4WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490508</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Lewiston Sun Journal  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunjournal.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64499\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States &amp;

Its core business activities center on sustainable forest management, timber harvesting, and the production of wood products. The company''s largest sources of revenue come from its Timberlands segment, which includes the sale of logs and timber, and its Wood Products segment, which manufactures and distributes lumber, engineered wood, and other building materials primarily for residential and commercial construction. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser operates a Real Estate, Energy, and Natural Resources segment, focusing on land sales and renewable energy opportunities. Among its business lines, the Wood Products segment has shown notable growth, driven by strong demand in the housing and construction markets. With a commitment to environmental stewardship, Weyerhaeuser continues to balance profitability with sustainable practices across its extensive land holdings. It is the NYSE's 5th largest Building materials &amp; fixtures company by market capitalisation.</p><p>In FY 2024, the top earner of Revenue was WOOD PRODUCTS [68%] followed by TIMBERLANDS [26.9%] at Rank 2  and REAL ESTATE &amp; ENR [5.1%] at Rank 3. In FY 2024, revenue growth was highest in REAL ESTATE &amp; ENR [7.7%] .</p><p>Weyerhaeuser Company has consistently demonstrated its commitment to sustainable forestry and community development through strategic investments and philanthropic efforts. Recently, Weyerhaeuser made headlines with its land donation for the Row River wildfire substation, exemplifying its leadership in wildfire protection and emergency services partnerships. This initiative underscores Weyerhaeuser's dedication to wildfire mitigation and response infrastructure, crucial in safeguarding forests and nearby communities.</p><p>In West Virginia, Weyerhaeuser's investment strategy is robust, epitomized by a $1 million community investment in Buckhannon. This investment is set to bolster rural economic development and enhance Weyerhaeuser's community grants and support efforts. Highlighting its philanthropic endeavors, Weyerhaeuser's charitable giving focuses on corporate social responsibility, revered by the Buckhannon community for fostering sustainable forestry.</p><p>Through such initiatives, including timberland and forestland donations, Weyerhaeuser maintains a steadfast commitment to land stewardship, enhancing community resilience, and ensuring a sustainable future for generations.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>Source: Weyerhaeuser's,</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 64.2 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 29.1:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 64.2 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 29.1 and market average of 13.0.</p><p>6.1 3-DAY: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN </p><p>WY dips 0.8% on firm volume 1.3 times average.

According to news originating from Istanbul Technical University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The increasing frequency and severity of forest fires globally highlight the critical need to understand their environmental impacts.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Istanbul Technical University: \"This study applies spatial autocorrelation techniques to analyze the dispersion patterns of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO [ [2] ] ) emissions during the 2021 Manavgat forest fires in Turkiye, using Sentinel-5P satellite data. Univariate (UV) Global Moran's I values indicated strong spatial autocorrelation for CO (0.84-0.93) and NO [ [2] ] (0.90-0.94), while Bivariate (BV) Global Moran's I (0.69-0.84) demonstrated significant spatial correlations between the two gases. UV Local Moran's I analysis identified distinct UV High-High (UV-HH) and UV Low-Low (UV-LL) clusters, with CO concentrations exceeding 0.10000 mol/m<sup>2</sup> and exhibiting wide dispersion, while NO [ [2] ] concentrations, above 0.00020 mol/m<sup>2</sup>, remained localized near intense fire zones due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. BV Local Moran's I analysis revealed overlapping BV-HH (high CO, high NO [ [2] ] ) and BV-LL (low CO, low NO [ [2] ] ) clusters, influenced by topography and meteorological factors.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These findings enhance the understanding of gas emission dynamics during forest fires and provide critical insights into the influence of environmental and combustion processes on pollutant dispersion.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis of CO and NO [ [2] ] Related to Forest Fire Dynamics.

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This paper investigates data transmission in an Internet of Things (IoT) network, where multiple devices send environmental data to a remote base station through an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Army Engineering University of PLA: \"The UAV serves as an airborne intermediary that collects status information from distributed IoT devices (e.g., temperature readings in a real-time forest fire monitoring system) and forwards it to the base station. To capture the impact of data staleness, a novel Age of Information (AoI) and entropy-aware system loss is defined in terms of L-conditional cross-entropy, which quantifies the expected penalty caused by state misestimation. The scheduling problem, which aims to minimize the system loss defined by L-conditional cross-entropy, is formulated as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) problem. By applying Lagrange relaxation, the objective function is decomposed into tractable sub-problems, enabling a low-complexity, gain-index-based scheduling strategy. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing the long-term average system loss.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In particular, the gain-index-based policy achieves a significant reduction in average penalty compared to random, round-robin, periodic update, and MAX-AoI scheduling strategies, demonstrating its superior performance over these baselines.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Entropy-Based Age-Aware Scheduling Strategy for UAV-Assisted IoT Data Transmission.

The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, shows that wildfires are getting worse, particularly in one climate-sensitive area - the northern boreal forests, which span from Russia to North America. Fire emissions have almost tripled from those forests during the past 20 years, the authors of the report said.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>The study attributed rising emissions from burning forests to a combination of more fire-favorable weather and faster-growing woodlands that provide flammable organic matter. Both trends are aided by rapid temperature rises in the high northern latitudes, which are warming twice as fast as the global average because of climate change.<br/>\"The steep trend towards greater extratropical forest fire emissions is a warning of the growing vulnerability of forests,\" said Matthew Jones, the study's lead author and a researcher at the University of East Anglia in the U.K. \"It poses a significant challenge for global targets to tackle climate change.\"<br/>That's because forests are vital to regulate Earth's climate, absorbing about one-quarter of the carbon released from human activities such as burning fossil fuels.<br/>Countries around the world also count on reforestation and afforestation to help remove more CO2 from the atmosphere - a plan that would work only if trees remain standing.<br/>The worsening forest fire crisis comes at a time when the burning of savannas and grasslands has shrunk significantly, resulting in a roughly 25 percent decline in the total burnt areas by wildfires since 2001.<br/>Yet global fire emissions have not gone down, Jones and his co-authors say, because the uptake in forest fires has canceled out all the climate gains from reduced savanna and grassland fires.<br/>Making matters worse, the researchers also found a sharp rise in forest fire severity - a measure of how much carbon is emitted per unit of area burned. This is up by nearly 50 percent globally.<br/>\"This signals that fires are causing much more damage to forest ecosystems than they did in the past,\" Jones said. \"This will challenge the ability of forests to rebound - and recapture lost carbon - after fires.\"<br/>And more forest fires are not just a problem for the climate. They are also putting more communities and infrastructure at risk, and pushing firefighting services to the brink.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 10-19 A3 FOREST-FIRE-EMISSIONSBLO_A03<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8434167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJY-X2G1-JBSN-00F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Columbian Publishing Co.

According to news reporting out of Noida, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Landslides present a significant danger to both infrastructure and human lives in the challenging terrain of the Himalayas. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately map areas prone to landslides to facilitate informed decision-making and proactive planning, allowing for effective management of this hazard.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Amity University, \"Since the landslide occurrences are accentuated by floods through toe erosion, and wildfires through this research aims to integrate machine learning techniques with the analysis of multiple hazards, such as floods and forest fires, as novel conditioning factors to create a comprehensive map of landslide susceptibility. Geospatial analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between 19 conditioning elements, including factors related to flood and forest fire susceptibility, which contribute to the occurrence of landslides. This study tested the efficacy of three machine learning models for mapping landslide-prone areas: eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These models can identify complex correlations and patterns among conditioning elements, resulting in more accurate mapping of regions prone to landslides. A regression analysis was performed to evaluate multicollinearity and confirm the association between the dependent and independent variables. The analysis revealed a variance inflation factor within acceptable bounds, providing validation for the correlation. The ROC-AUC curve approach was used to assess the models' accuracy. Among the models tested, XGB exhibited the highest accuracy at 94%, followed by RF at 92% and ANN at 77%. The results of this study offer insightful information about how to combine data from various hazard occurrences to forecast landslide susceptibility.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This work can be instrumental for local authorities and disaster management organisations in prioritising resources, implementing mitigation plans and enhancing resilience against landslide threats.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Landslide Susceptibility Mapping In Complex Topo-climatic Himalayan Terrain, India Using Machine Learning Models: a Comparative Study of Xgboost, Rf and Ann.

According to news reporting originating from Changsha, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The formation of forest fire burned area, influenced by a variety of factors such as meteorology, topography, vegetation, and human intervention, is a dynamic process of fire line burning that develops from the point of ignition to the boundary of the burned area. Accurately simulating and predicting this dynamic process can provide a scientific basis for forest fire control and suppression decisions.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Project; Hunan Forestry Science And Technology Research And Innovation Project; Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education; Science And Technology Innovation Platform And Talent Plan Project of Hunan Province; Field Observation And Research Station of Dongting Lake Natural Resource Ecosystem, Ministry of Natural Resources. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Central South University of Forestry and Technology: \"In this study, five typical forest fires located in different regions of China were used as the study object. The straight path distances from the ignition point grid to each grid on fire line in Sentinel-2 imageries for each forest fire were used as the target variables. We obtained the values of 11 independent variables for each pathway, including wind speed component, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Degree of Relief, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Vegetation Type, Fire Duration, and Gross Domestic Product reflecting human intervention capacity for fires. The value of each target variable and that of its corresponding independent variable constituted a sample. Four machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were trained using 80% effective samples from four forest fires, and 20% used to verify the above models. The hyper-parameters of each model were optimized using grid search method. After analyzing the validation results of models which showed temperature as a non-significant variable, the training and validation process of models above was repeated after excluding temperature.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results show that RF is the optimal model with 49.55 m for root mean square error (RMSE), 29.19 m for mean absolute error (MAE) and 0.9823 for coefficient of determination (R2). This study used the RF model to construct the shape of burned areas by predicting lengths of all straight path distances from the ignition point to the fire line. The study can dynamically capture the development of forest fire scenes.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Research on the Simulation Model of Dynamic Shape for Forest Fire Burned Area Based on Grid Paths from Satellite Remote Sensing Images.

Through a free online resource hub, first responders can find specially designed content, including videos about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and suicide prevention, along with mental health tips, educational articles and contacts for occupationally aware support groups and counselors in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's support for wildland firefighting efforts in the Pacific Northwest began in the aftermath of the Yacolt Burn in 1902, when the company began advocating for Washington's first forest fire legislation and the funding of community fire prevention education and patrols. Today, as Weyerhaeuser celebrates its 125th anniversary, the company continues to play an active role in fire prevention and response through its forest management operations. Weyerhaeuser employees and contractors receive annual fire readiness training, build fire breaks and containment lines, conduct aerial surveys and deploy tanker trucks, helicopters and quick-response crews to wildland fires.</p><p>\"After launching the Fighting Fires Together campaign with FBHA four years ago, we're proud to continue this effort to support wildland firefighters and their mental health as they work in challenging conditions to protect our communities,\" says Bill Frings, vice president of Western Timberlands for Weyerhaeuser.</p><p>Press Release article 13 of 17, Source: Company Website, 299 words </p><p>May 22: Weyerhaeuser Acquiring High-Quality Timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia</p><p>Capitalizing on unique off-market opportunity to further enhance Southern Timberlands portfolio with highly productive and strategically located acreage</p><p>SEATTLE, May 22, 2025 - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today announced an agreement to acquire approximately 117,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia from Roanoke Timberlands LLC, a subsidiary of Roseburg Forest Products, for $375 million. Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities. The acquisition is expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within the company's Southern Timberlands business.</p><p>Key attributes of the acquisition:</p><p>Located in strong and growing sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. South Primarily fee ownership with 81 percent planted pine acreage, strong site productivity and favorable all-weather logging operability Mature planted pine age class expected to produce an average annual harvest of 7.4 tons per acre (or 860,000 tons) over the first five years Expected to deliver an average annual timber free cash flow yield of 5.1 percent over the first five years Significant optionality to capture additional upside from real estate, natural climate solutions and natural resource opportunities \"These are exceptional timberlands, and we're excited and well-positioned to capitalize on this unique off-market opportunity,\" said Devin W.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>Source: Weyerhaeuser's, 10-Q filing dated July 25, 2025, available at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm</url> and Weyerhaeuser's website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/\">https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/</url>.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 64.6 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 29.3:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 64.6 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 29.3 and market average of 13.0.</p><p>6.1 PAST WEEK: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN </p><p>WY decreases 2.1% on average volume 0.98 times average.

On Monday 25th, the risk of lightning in a cloud near the site caused the test to be postponed.</p><p><br/>On Tuesday, the spacecraft took off exactly at the time the window started at 8:30 pm (Bras\u00edlia time). In 1 minute, the spacecraft reached 1,000 km/h. At 2min15sec, the spacecraft began separating from the Super Heavy launcher - 30 seconds later the process was complete. At 8.36pm, the Super Heavy returned to Earth, as scheduled by the company. This time, however, the equipment did not return to the company's base in Texas, but made a controlled landing in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico (renamed the Gulf of America by President Donald Trump).<br/>After a 19-minute flight, at an altitude of 189 km, the company carried out a test by placing equipment simulating Starlink satellites, the company's internet system, into orbit. Eight pieces of equipment were put into space, one per minute on average. At 25 minutes 11 seconds into the mission, the load test was fully completed. This is the first time the Starship has carried out this type of simulation, which is a step forward for SpaceX after a series of failures in 2025.<br/>After 45 minutes of flight, the Starship had already crossed the African continent and was at an altitude of 100 km, when it began the re-entry process - at this point, the rocket is traveling at 5 times the speed of sound. The plan is to make a controlled landing in the waters of the Indian Ocean, rather than recovering the rocket intact. SpaceX's plan is to test the Starship's thermal protection system, so the re-entry and landing are not expected to be smooth.<br/>The Starship's tenth flight is the fourth test attempt this year, with all the previous ones ending in failure, which has put SpaceX's progress in check.<br/>The last two tests resulted in the ship exploding in space. This is the tenth test of the rocket in total, from the company's facilities in Boca Chica, Texas.<br/>According to SpaceX, after the previous incidents, \"changes were made to the hardware and operations to increase reliability\". For the tenth flight, the company plans to deploy payloads on the Starship for the first time, including eight Starlink simulators. They will be on the same suborbital trajectory as the Starship and should disintegrate upon entering the atmosphere. Other payloads had already been placed on the rocket, but as none of the attempts were completed, the test with the payloads could not be carried out either.<br/>For this launch, the Super Heavy booster will not attempt to return to its point of origin, but will force land in the Gulf of America. The decision is aimed at avoiding damage to the launch base's infrastructure. Even so, the data collected during the flight should help shape the next versions of the rocket.<br/>Another test should involve a maneuver in the rocket's return burn, which has already been carried out on the ninth flight. The move requires less propellant in reserve, allowing more fuel to be used during ascent to allow an additional payload mass into orbit.<br/>History<br/>In its first test, the rocket took off in April 2023, but exploded four minutes after launch, at an altitude of 39 kilometers, due to a propellant leak at the rear of the Super Heavy booster, which eventually cut the connection to the vehicle's main flight computer. According to Space X, this led to a loss of communications with most of the booster's engines and, ultimately, control of the vehicle.<br/>At the time, the explosion caused damage to the Texan region, causing \"dirt to rain down\" on a town near the take-off, 10 km from the launch. The incident also caused a forest fire, prompting an environmental investigation in the USA.<br/>In order to fly again, Space X had to comply with 63 requirements made by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following the explosion. The changes included one related to the spacecraft separation process, in which the second stage, the Starship itself, turns on its engines during the same separation process, rather than afterwards, in order to obtain more power.<br/>If everything went according to plan, the Starship's flight would last 90 minutes, reaching Earth's orbit and making an almost complete lap around the planet.<br/>The fourth attempt was the first with 100% success in all stages of the flight, from the trajectory to the recovery of the booster and the landing of the spacecraft. Liftoff was achieved despite the fact that one of the launcher's 33 engines failed on ascent. Temperatures did not exceed fatal limits and the descent, aided by the atmosphere (which slows down the rocket), was stable. With this, the Starship is the largest rocket in history to make a full flight off the planet.<br/>The fifth flight was the first to have the rocket's booster recovered at Starbase. In the test, carried out in October, the Heavy Booster was recaptured around 7 minutes after launch, by the launch tower itself, with two structures that simulate a kind of arm to hold the booster, called Mechazilla. The Starship landed in the Indian Ocean 1 hour and 5 minutes after leaving the launch base in Texas.<br/>The seventh flight was the second to succeed in retrieving the booster from the launch tower, but the flight was not completed. About 8 minutes after take-off, the rocket lost contact with the control center and later exploded. SpaceX claimed that the problem was related to a leak in the spacecraft.<br/>The eighth flight also had a problem that prevented the test from being successful. The flight was interrupted ahead of schedule after a failure in the attitude control system, responsible for maintaining the orientation of the spacecraft during its journey. According to SpaceX, the problem occurred around 8 minutes after launch, causing the rocket to lose control and fail to complete its mission of circling the Earth almost completely.<br/>On the last attempt, at the end of May, just under 30 minutes into the flight, the rocket lost control of its flight altitude and started doing rotational \"maneuvers\" in space. In June, during an engine test for the tenth flight, the rocket also exploded.<br/>Meet the Starship rocket<br/>The Starship is the most powerful reusable rocket developed by Space X. Its aim is to take mankind to the Moon and then to Mars, a journey which is expected to cost between US$10 million and US$60 million. The company says that the rocket can be used to transport up to 150 tons of cargo on Earth, with journeys of up to an hour and a half to anywhere in the world.<br/>\"The Starship will be able to transport up to 100 people on long-duration interplanetary flights,\" Space X says on its website about the spacecraft. \"The Starship will also help enable the delivery of satellites, the development of a lunar base and point-to-point transportation here on Earth.\"<br/>The Starship is nicknamed the \"rocket ship\" because it is much larger than Space X's predecessor, the 70-meter Falcon 9. Its most recent sibling is 120 meters tall, 9 meters in diameter and weighs 1,300 tons.<br/>The spacecraft carries the Super Heavy booster (69 meters high), which is responsible for taking the Starship into Earth orbit in around 170 seconds. The launcher has 33 Raptor engines, with a thrust of 72 meganewtons (twice that of the Falcon 9's Merlin engine). Like the main spacecraft, the launcher can be reused for new flights.<br/>The Starship is 50 meters high, equipped with three Raptor engines and three more Raptor Vacuum engines, a model with a larger exhaust to maximize efficiency in space. The vehicle also has a liquid methane tank and another liquid oxygen tank for combustion.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72444073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKV-9WM3-RY9B-V27D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1304\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 27, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Neg\u00f3cios</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp;

Here's how some countries have been fighting the fires.</p><p>Portugal</p><p>In Pi\u00f3d\u00e3o in central Portugal, a fire started on August 13 and kept on burning for 11 days, consuming more than 64,000 hectares of land, according to the National Institute for Nature and Forests Conservation. Overall this year, more than 250,000 hectares have been destroyed by wildfires in Portugal.</p><p>On August 15, the government activated the UCPM. After the initial days of silence and lack of response by Interior Minister Maria L\u00facia Amaral, the government and Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro were accused of not taking the situation seriously.</p><p>After requesting assistance, Portugal received two Fire Boss airplanes and one Super Puma helicopter from France and two Canadair airplanes from Greece, along with 20 firefighters from Estonia and 20 from Malta. They will be in the country until August 29.</p><p>Spain</p><p>Spain is struggling with numerous fires in the west of the country. Over 400,000 hectares have been burned so far this year. Improved weather conditions have helped efforts to bring under control the 40 fires that were still active as of Monday.</p><p>Spain triggered the UCPM on August 13 - the first time that the country has ever asked other member states to help battle forest fires.</p><p>Spain received planes, helicopters and ground teams from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Finland, Romania, Greece and Estonia, some of which were already battling their own wildfires. It became the biggest activation of the UCPM mechanism this year.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has pledged EU support to Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to help with recovery of the affected areas, suggesting that resources such as the European Solidarity Fund could be used in the aftermath of the fire season.</p><p>France</p><p>France has been hit by its largest wildfire since 1949, which broke out at the beginning of the month in the municipality of Ribaute in the southern Occitania region and spread to 16,000 hectares. One woman died in the fire and 25 people were injured.</p><p>At times, more than 2,000 firefighters were deployed.</p><p>France has not activated the UCPM. However, the Slovak Fire and Rescue Corps (HaZZ) is deploying firefighters in the region from August 16 to 31.</p><p>Albania</p><p>Fires in EU candidate country Albania caused one death and burned hundreds of hectares of land and forests.</p><p>Albania received assistance through the UCPM, following fires in the south of the country on July 6. Two Canadair aircraft from the rescEU escort were mobilized to help control the situation.</p><p>From August 8 to 14, Albania activated the UCPM again to deal with a wave of fires that also affected neighbouring countries. The commission mobilized rescEU with aircraft from Croatia, Bulgaria, Italy, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</p><p>Greece</p><p>An overall 323 European firefighters are stationed in Greece from July 1 to September 15, under the UCPM's pre-positioning programme. Firefighters from Austria, Bulgaria, France, Moldova, Romania and the Czech Republic are being deployed, with teams stationed in Attica, Thessaloniki and Patras.</p><p>According to available data, Greece has activated the mechanism twice so far. On July 26, Italy responded by deploying two firefighting aircraft. On August 12, the UCPM confirmed the deployment of two Swedish rescEU aircraft, previously stationed in Bulgaria.</p><p>Greece has responded to UCPM requests from other countries, deploying aircraft and firefighters to Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Albania and North Macedonia in response to large-scale wildfires.</p><p>Bulgaria</p><p>Firefighters in Bulgaria have extinguished around 3,500 fires since the start of July, Bulgarian fire safety chief Alexander Dzhartov told the Trud newspaper in comments published on August 19. Some required the use of helicopters and planes provided through the UCPM.</p><p>Bulgarian firefighters were also sent abroad. On July 9, the Foreign Ministry said that a team with a fire engine was working to contain a blaze in Kriva Palanka, North Macedonia. Another team of firefighters was dispatched with two engines on July 2 to Vourvourou in northern Greece.</p><p>Awareness and training are key</p><p>In order to prepare citizens and firefighters alike for the new reality of more frequent wildfires, it is crucial to raise awareness among the population of how to stay safe and to equip firefighters with the necessary knowledge and tools.</p><p>The commission has said that the world broke its own temperature record last year. The average global temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, making 2024 the hottest year to date.</p><p>One dire consequence of the record-high temperatures is the increased risk of wildfires spreading.</p><p>A measure that Bulgaria employs is to have additional crews mobilized on high-risk days, especially weekends, when more people are outdoors.</p><p>Despite negligence being a leading cause, public engagement in fire prevention and suppression is growing. Forestry services, the armed forces, municipalities, farmers, businesses and volunteers are increasingly active in helping firefighters.</p><p>After the largest fire in Slovenian history in 2022 devastated the western part of the country on the border with Italy, it started to strengthen its firefighting capabilities, also with the help of European funds.</p><p>In March, during a visit by EU Budget Commissioner Piotr Serafin, the Slovenian Centre for Fighting Large Fires in the Natural Environment was officially opened in the town of Sezana. Firefighters are trained there according to a special programme adapted for protection and rescue, and it is equipped with modern equipment for responding to natural disasters.</p><p>Last but not least, technology and state-of-the-art warning systems are also vital to identify new fires before they are beyond control.</p><p>At the Pont du Gard in France, a Roman aqueduct located about thirty kilometers from N\u00eemes and visited by more than a million tourists each year, more than 120 small satellite-connected boxes were installed earlier this month, equipped with sensors measuring atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity.</p><p>Developed by the German company Dryad, they are the first phase of a project designed to help firefighters better anticipate forest fires.

(NAM or the Company) provides an update on the 2025 field program at its 100%-owned Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project in southeast Alaska, approximately 65 km south of Glennallen and ~265 km east of Anchorage. The project is road-accessible and situated within 3 km of the all-season Richardson Highway and a high-capacity power line. From the Tonsina Lodge, which the exploration crew utilized during the program, it takes approximately one hour to access the site.</p><p>Highlights of the Genesis project are listed below: //st * The Genesis PGM-Cu-Ni Project is 100% owned by New Age Metals. * The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Gensis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska. * The project is located within 3 km of the all-season paved Richardson highway and a high-capacity electric power line. * The Genesis property comprises 4,144 hectares of State of Alaska mining claims. * Two separate settings of magmatic reef-style mineralization occur: chromate-hosted Platinum Group Metals (PGM) returning up to 2.4 g/t palladium (Pd) and 2.4 g/t platinum (Pt); and nickel-copper (Ni-Cu)-bearing sulphide mineralization with values up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu. * Reef-style cumulate mineralization is open to the west, east, north and at depth. * Reef-style mineralization has been identified in outcrop for 2,000 metres along strike, with a 40-metre true thickness. * The 2025 Program focused on Sheep Hill area of the Project and approximately 134 rock samples were sent to the ALS lab to Reno, Nevada. * Known mineralization covers a distance of 9 km across the prospect. The target areas have never been drilled. A Technical Report is available.</p><p>Highlights of the Genesis project 2025 Exploration Program are listed below: //st * 2025 Sheep Hill program has been completed. Detailed mapping and prospecting focused on the western half of Sheep Hill were carried out at 1:1,000 scale; 134 rock samples were collected during July 1519, 2025. After QA/QC additions (blanks and standards), 163 samples were shipped to ALS in Reno. Assays are pending. * Access verified and improved logistics. The team mobilized from Anchorage to the base camp at Tonsina River Lodge and confirmed ~11 miles of ATV trail access to the Sheep Hill work area, including a safe Bernard Creek crossing. Travel time to the trailhead was refined to ~1 hour each way as routes were flagged. The program was completed within budget. * Genesis remains a 100% NAM-owned PGM-Cu-Ni project; two magmatic mineralization settings are present at surface;</p><p>* (i) chromite-hosted PGM up to 2.4 g/t Pd and 2.4 g/t Pt and (ii) Ni-Cu sulphide up to 0.96% Ni and 0.58% Cu . Reef-style mineralization is mapped in outcrop for ~2.0 km with ~40 m true thickness ; PGM mineralization spans ~9 km across the prospect; no drilling has yet tested these targets.</p><p>Figure 1: Map showing a portion of the ATV trail (red line), walking trail (green line) and the preliminary sample points (yellow dots) from the fieldwork portion of the project.</p><p>Figure 2.

Work included detailed geological mapping at 1:1,000 to 1:2,000 scales, litho-geochemical grid planning (100 m 100 m where applicable), and targeted grab rock and sediment sampling.</p><p>Operational additions to the July 29 program outline are as follows: mobilization occurred July 14, with base camp at Tonsina River Lodge; ATV access (including Bernard Creek crossing) was physically confirmed and improved with flagged routes; consideration is being given to permitting a short ATV spur from the current parking area to the base of the mountain to streamline future sampling and support activities. A total of 163 samples (including QA/QC) were dispatched to ALSReno; results will be released once received and reviewed. After review of the results, NAM will have the consultants initiate an updated geological report which future recommendations.</p><p>Figure 6: Truck and trailer loaded with field gear and ATVs for the Gensis Project Summer Field Program.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Robert M Retherford, CPG #10904, is a Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and a consultant to NAM, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure in this press release.</p><p>The Qualified Person has not completed sufficient work to verify the historical information on the project.</p><p>Issuance of Options</p><p>The Company also announces that it has granted 2,925,000 incentive stock options to directors, officers, employees, investor relations service provider, and consultants of the Company at an exercise price of $0.26 per share for a period of five (5) years from the date of grant in accordance with the Companys Stock Option Plan. The Stock Options granted will be subject to vesting restrictions, acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange and are subject to regulatory hold periods in accordance with applicable Securities Laws.</p><p>About NAM</p><p>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical green metal projects in North America. The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Antimony-Gold Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAMs Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with todays issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, please visit MetalQuestMining.com . High-purity iron ore became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale.

According to news reporting from Socorro, New Mexico, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing significant environmental and economic damage. Effective early prediction mechanisms are critical for minimizing these impacts.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Department of Computer Science: \"In our previous work, we developed a smart and secure wireless sensor network (WSN) utilizing physical sensors to emulate forest fire dynamics and predict fire scenarios using machine learning. Building on this foundation, this study explores the integration of virtual sensors to enhance the prediction capabilities of the WSN. Virtual sensors were generated using polynomial regression models and incorporated into a supervector framework, effectively augmenting the data from physical sensors. The enhanced dataset was used to train a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) to classify multiple fire scenarios, covering both early warning and advanced fire states. Our experimental results demonstrate that the addition of virtual sensors significantly improves the accuracy of fire scenario predictions, especially in complex situations like \u201cFire with Thundering\u201d and \u201cFire with Thundering and Lightning\u201d. The extended model's ability to predict early warning scenarios such as lightning and smoke is particularly promising for proactive fire management strategies. This paper highlights the potential of combining physical and virtual sensors in WSNs to achieve superior prediction accuracy and scalability of the field without any extra cost. Such findings pave the way for deploying scalable (cost-effective), intelligent monitoring systems capable of addressing the growing challenges of forest fire prevention and management. We obtained significant results in specific scenarios based on the number of virtual sensors added, while in some scenarios, the results were less promising compared to using only physical sensors.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"However, the integration of virtual sensors enables coverage of much larger areas, making it a highly promising approach despite these variations. Future work includes further optimization of the virtual sensor generation process and expanding the system's capability to handle large-scale forest environments. Moreover, utilizing virtual sensors will alleviate many challenges associated with the huge number of deployed physical sensors.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Smart Wireless Sensor Networks with Virtual Sensors for Forest Fire Evolution Prediction Using Machine Learning.

They also cite an apparent contradiction with the agency's acceptance of renewable natural gas (RNG) as a credit-earning \"fuel\" under the RFS.</p><p>Use of such RNG accounts for the majority of the \"cellulosic\" biofuel category under the program, even though it is a gas and not a liquid fuel.</p><p>\"EPA can rely on the fact that it is a longstanding matter of federal law to treat electricity as a fuel,\" the groups say, citing the Energy Policy Act of 1992.</p><p>\"Preserving the electricity pathway while eliminating subsidies for the EV sector are not mutually exclusive. The electricity pathway was never intended to promote EVs. No other transportation fuel in the RFS program treats the user of the fuel, i.e., the vehicle end-user, as the 'producer' of RINs. That is contrary to the plain language of the statute,\" the groups say.</p><p>While Obama-era proposals explored granting eRINs to EV makers or charging station operators, these ideas were not \"consistent with existing law,\" the groups say.</p><p>The trade associations note that Congress has frequently directed EPA to establish \"pathways\" for eRIN generation. Although EPA has established such pathways for certain feedstocks -- such as RNG -- it has not done so for all. And no administration has yet established a workable framework for granting eRINs, and thus none have been issued.</p><p>\"Congress has similarly endorsed EPA's interpretation of \"renewable fuels\" and further encouraged EPA to utilize the renewable electricity pathway. On seven separate occasions since 2019, Congressional appropriators have expressed frustration with the backlog of applications seeking to generate RINs from the electricity pathway and have demanded the agency act on pending applications,\" the biomass groups say.</p><p>\"In 2020, Congress even allocated $500,000 for the purpose of processing applications to make use of the renewable electricity pathway. In sum, Congress has repeatedly endorsed EPA's power to implement the electricity program and pushed the agency to do so expeditiously,\" the groups add.</p><p>Senate FY26 Report</p><p>The Senate Appropriations Committee on July 24 also voiced support for the eRIN program.</p><p>In report language attached to the panel's fiscal year 2026 spending bill for EPA, which lawmakers approved on a 26-2 vote, the committee noted that EPA \"still has not implemented the electricity program under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), despite past direction from this committee.\"</p><p>The report directs EPA to \"finalize the eRINs program within 90 days of enactment of this act and to process all electric pathway feedstock petitions prior to issuing the final 2026 Renewable Volume Obligation rule.\"</p><p>The Appropriations Committee said it \"expects that the eRIN program will be implemented with all eligible feedstocks, particularly those that support agriculture activity, minimize wildfire risk, and reduce methane emissions.\"</p><p>Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-ME) is a key champion of the biomass sector and its efforts to win RFS credit, along with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the biofuels industry source says, adding that there is substantial bipartisan support in the House for this effort.</p><p>The biomass groups in their comments say: \"Because prior EPAs have decided to make the [cellulosic RIN] market almost entirely the exclusive domain of RNG, this has incentivized the conversion of landfill-gas-to-electricity facilities from providing baseload power to RNG production, all the while failing to support baseload biomass electricity, and all because of EPA policies that are contrary to President Trump's energy policies.\"</p><p>\"Biomass power's exclusion from the [cellulosic] program has directly and negatively impacted baseload power capacity and good-paying rural jobs. In the last decade, 25 biomass facilities have closed, resulting in an estimated loss of 20% of the total capacity of the industry and contributing to a staggering loss of logging jobs across the country,\" the groups say.</p><p>\"This trend is directly contrary to the President's executive orders, including EO 14213 to further domestic energy dominance, EO 14216 to increase baseload power, and EO 14260 to promote affordable and reliable energy.\"</p><p>Two additional orders, EO 14225 and EO 14308, \"are directly relevant to EPA's decision to exclude electricity from the RFS. Specifically, EO 14225 encourages federal agencies to find 'tools to facilitate the increase' in bioenergy production. Inclusion of biomass derived electricity in the . . . program is exactly such a tool. Additionally, because many biomass power facilities utilize forest residues that would otherwise contribute to wildfires, EO 14308 is applicable.\"</p><p>The associations ask EPA to: maintain renewable electricity in the RFS program; process all pending biomass power pathways; finalize a simplified electricity pathway program that creates greater market competition while not burdening consumers or refiners; and remove the ability for the program to serve as an incentive for the EV industry by designating power generators as the sole \"producer.\"</p><p>However, there is so far no indication that the Trump EPA will move from its categorical rejection of electricity as a qualifying \"fuel\" under the RFS. And other major sectors affected by the program, including ethanol and biodiesel producers and refiners, are pursuing policies that benefit liquid fuels over other types. -- Stuart Parker (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sparker@iwpnews.com\">sparker@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARPT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARPT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGN-ND23-RS12-W3NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Clean Air Report</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 14, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

About 350,000 hectares have burned during 2025, and the vast majority of them have done so in the Great Forest Fires of this month. Specifically, 79% of this surface area was concentrated in the communities of Galicia and Castilla y Le\u00f3n, according to information from the European Forest Fire Information System.</p><p><br/>At present, around twenty fires are still active in the country. Specifically, there are 12 active fires in Castilla y Le\u00f3n, one in Extremadura and eight in Galicia, however, the good weather conditions have allowed to work more easily in the extinguishing tasks. From Sunday a DANA could leave a change in the weather, with rainfall and a new drop in temperatures in the north of the peninsula that will help in the fight against forest fires.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTILLA AND LE\u00d3N</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cecopi remains optimistic despite the fact that 12 fires are still active. </emphasis><br/>The Cecopi of Le\u00f3n has shown on Friday its optimism about the situation of the province to the fires due to the weather, since the increase in humidity and the support of troops arrived from other autonomous communities allows to maintain a steady pace in extinction.<br/>In spite of everything, 1,524 inhabitants of 27 localities continue evacuated, being the last five neighbors of Anllarinos. The fire extinguishing services in the province are now focusing their work on the fires affecting Llamas de Cabrera, Fasgar, Barniedo, Colinas and Anllares, with special attention to the penultimate one due to the risk of its advance towards the Tremor area.<br/>There is also a risk of reproduction in the Llamas de la Cabrera fire and the Gestoso fire, the latter already without flames. The fires in Yeres and Molezuelas de la Carballeda, where active surveillance of the perimeter continues, are evolving favorably. According to the latest updated data from the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT), eight roads are cut by the fire, all of them secondary: four in Le\u00f3n, two in Zamora, one in Palencia and one more in C\u00e1ceres.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALICIA</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Laoruco fire is still active, but the rest of the fires have been stabilized.</emphasis><br/>In Galicia, eight fires are still active on Friday, five of them in Ourense and another three in Pontevedra and Lugo. The fire in Carballedo (Lugo) maintains active situation 2 due to its proximity to the town of Oleiros and has forced the preventive evacuation of 53 children and 11 monitors from the Albergue dos Peares. The Laoruco fire, the largest in the history of Galicia, is still of concern, but the Mui\u00f1os fire has been controlled and the fires in Carballeda de Avia, Vilardev\u00f3s, Maceda, Fumaces and Trepa, Moialde, R\u00edos-Trasestrada and Montederramo-Paredes have been stabilized.<br/>In Ourense no new confinements or evacuations were recorded during the night, and all main roads remain operational.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EXTREMADURA</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jarilla fire stabilized, the largest in the history of the community</emphasis><br/>The Jarilla fire, the only one in Extremadura and the largest in the history of the autonomous community, has been stabilized. This has been communicated this Friday by the Minister of Presidency of Extremadura, Abel Bautista, from the emergency operation of the fire.<br/>At the moment there are some hot spots in the northwest of the fire, where six air assets and more than 200 other troops will be concentrated today on the perimeter, after a night \"somewhat complicated\" but in which the fire has been perimetered.<br/>On the other hand, from 17.00 the neighbors of the houses of the periurban area of Herv\u00e1s will return to their homes and, at this moment, also return to their homes those of the isolated houses of Jerte, Tornavacas, Cabezuela del Valle and Navaconcejo. At the moment, more than 17,300 hectares have burned in Jarilla, in a perimeter of 170 kilometers. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ASTURIAS</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No active outbreaks in the Picos de Europa area.</emphasis><br/>Three fires are still active in the southwest of Asturias, one in the region of Dega\u00f1a, and two others in Somiedo and Cangas del Narcea, while there is no active fire in the area of Picos de Europa as those of Ponga, Cabrales and Pe\u00f1amellera Baja are stabilized or controlled.<br/>Compared to the twenty fires that in the past days were registered simultaneously in Asturias, today have been reduced to eight: the three active fires in the southwest, as many others that are stabilized and two more controlled.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Arson</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">41 people arrested and 127 investigated for their possible relationship with the origin of the fires.</emphasis><br/>During the fires that have burned throughout 2025, the Castilian-Leonese community has taken the worst part with some 151,135 hectares burned, being 96,870 of them in Le\u00f3n -the most affected province in the whole country-, and 30,644 in Zamora. Galicia is next with a total of 105,547 hectares burned, especially Ourense with 96,779 ha.<br/>Extremadura is the third most affected with 47,075 hectares lost, with 34,778 ha burned in the province of C\u00e1ceres. The rest of the autonomous communities show smaller figures compared to the previous ones, such as Catalonia (8,115 ha), Community of Madrid (3,850 ha), Andalusia (2,660 ha), Asturias (2,298 ha), Castilla-La Mancha (2,208 ha), Cantabria (656) and the Valencian Community (469 ha).<br/>According to the Undersecretary of the Ministry of the Interior, Susana Cris\u00f3stomo, at the moment there are 41 people arrested and 127 under investigation for their possible relationship with the origin of the fires. All the forestry brigades of the Ministry of Ecological Transition are still operating in seven of the fires, as well as 45 aerial means that carry out unloading missions on a daily basis. The UME is acting in nine fires, where it is concentrating the deployment of its 1,400 troops, who are supported by another 1,000 military personnel from other units of the three armies.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">International assistance to extinguish the fires</emphasis><br/>In addition, means from eight European countries are operating in the different fires under the coordination of the General Directorate of Civil Protection and Emergencies. In particular, two Italian tanker planes, whose period of action has been extended until August 24, two helicopters from the Netherlands, a helicopter from the Czech Republic and a helicopter from Slovakia are working on the fires.<br/>Likewise, 26 firefighters from Finland continue working in the extinguishing tasks, who have been integrated in an Estonian contingent that was already in Spain (Orense) in a mission of exchange of good practices organized by the EU during the summer campaign.<br/>Also two teams of firefighters from France (66 troops and 23 vehicles) are working in Le\u00f3n, a team of firefighters from Germany (60 troops and 24 vehicles) in Extremadura, a team from Andorra in Asturias, 51 forest firefighters from Romania have joined this Friday the firefighting work in Galicia and a team of 20 forest firefighters from Greece has had to delay their arrival in Asturias, where they will immediately join the firefighting work.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72299065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G0W3-RS1P-J1J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1160\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>vida</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000A2MQ</classCode><className>CASTILE AND LEON, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A2MJ</classCode><className>EXTREMADURA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000A2MK</classCode><className>GALICIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This is a time of year when deciduous (non-evergreen) trees are bare, allowing the warm spring sun to heat up forest fuels. Forest fuels consist of anything that burns, such as grass, leaves, twigs, branches, and decaying material in the soil. As the days grow longer and the sun gets hotter, the fuels that are most exposed quickly dry out. Grasses, twigs, and small branches are called \"1-hour fuels,\" meaning they can dry out and become ready to burn within an hour. Larger fuels take longer to dry out. Typically, fires that start at this time of year burn just these 1-hour fuels and can spread very fast, particularly when its windy.</p><p>Brush fires are a serious hazard and can threaten lives and infrastructure. In 2024, Connecticut had a total of 605 wildfires, with 510 acres impacted. Tragically, a firefighter died while responding to a brush fire in fall 2024, and eight other firefighters were injured in 2024 while responding to brush fires. One residential building and seven other structures were lost to wildfire. Overall in 2024, 170 structures and residences were at risk for damage from wildfires.</p><p>The majority of wildfires in Connecticut are caused by human actions such as improper burning of debris or poor management of campfires, arson, careless discarding of wood ashes, and placing motorized equipment on top of or adjacent to fire fuels.</p><p>As we saw from our historic brush fire season last fall, brush fires are a serious hazard, particularly in a densely populated state like Connecticut, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. With increasingly extreme weather conditions, its all the more important for residents to be vigilant and careful when burning anything outdoors. Its important to remember that local open burning permits are automatically suspended on days when the fire danger level is high, very high, or extreme. Please be sure to properly dispose of wood ashes, make sure all campfires are completely extinguished and wet and cool to the touch before leaving the area, and take proper care when extinguishing and disposing of smoking materials such as cigarette butts.</p><p>As we have seen across the country, and recently here in CT, wildland fires can quickly threaten homes and other structures, State Fire Marshal Lauri Volkert said. Even a small camp fire can turn deadly in a matter of minutes. Make sure an alert adult constantly attends to every outdoor fire. Teach children how to be safe around fire by keeping a 3-foot kid-free zone around any campfire, storing matches and lighters securely out of kids reach and modeling responsible behavior around fire.</p><p>DEEP's Forest Fire Control Office urges all who enjoy Connecticut's parks, forests and open spaces to use fires with caution and heed the following recommendations, especially during forest fire season:</p><p>Obey local laws regarding open fires, including campfires.</p><p>Keep all flammable objects away from fire. Scrape away leaves, twigs, and grass within a 10-foot diameter circle from fire.</p><p>Have firefighting tools nearby and handy.</p><p>Never leave a fire unattended.</p><p>Carefully dispose of hot coal/ashes.</p><p>Drown all fires.</p><p>Carefully extinguish smoking materials.</p><p>For Connecticut homeowners and residents, the following best practices are suggested to protect your family members and home:</p><p>Make a fire-safe zone around your house. Clean flammable vegetation and debris from at least 30 feet around the house and any outbuildings.</p><p>Prune away the lower limbs of evergreens that are within the fire-safe zone. Evergreens catch fire easily during dry periods and burn quickly.</p><p>Remove any limbs which overhang the roof or chimney.</p><p>Regularly remove leaves and needles from gutters.</p><p>Do not store firewood in the fire-safe zone.</p><p>Use fire-resistant roofing materials.</p><p>Make sure firefighters can find and access your home. Mark your house and roads clearly and prune away limbs and trees along your driveway which do not allow fire truck access.</p><p>Have an escape plan-- and practice it.</p><p>Follow state and local open burning laws.</p><p>Stay with outside fires until they are completely safe and extinguished.</p><p>Dispose of wood ashes in a metal bucket, soak them with water before dumping them.</p><p>Local open burning permits are automatically suspended on days when the fire danger level is high.</p><p>Municipal issued open burn permits are automatically suspended if the Daily Forest Fire Danger Index is rated High, Very High, or Extreme)</p><p>Open Burning</p><p>Daily Forest Fire Danger Report</p><p>To sign up for DEEPs daily Forest Fire Danger Report, go here: Forest Fire Weather Information and Danger Explanations</p><p>If you spot a forest fire, remain calm, go to the nearest telephone and dial 911 to report the fire as quickly as possible to your local fire department. Tell the emergency dispatcher when and where you saw the fire. If you see anything suspicious at or near the scene of the fire, take note and relay that to the dispatcher as well.

Scientists say climate extremes are driving the destruction. Yet forests have an incredible capacity to recover \u2013 sometimes naturally, and sometimes with human help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, forest fires have destroyed millions of hectares of vegetation in North America, southern Europe, Australia, and especially in Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once the flames die down, forests can regenerate naturally or with intervention. Depending on the trees and the location, recovery can take anywhere from three to 60 years.</p><p>Forests can recover if the right conditions are in place \u2013 whether through natural regrowth, human intervention or replanting. These techniques differ slightly depending on geographic zones and climate patterns.</p><p>Many experts say natural regeneration is usually the most effective.</p><p>\u00c9ric Rigolot, a research engineer at France's National Institute for Agricultural, Food, and Environmental Research (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inrae.fr/en\">Inrae</url>), specialises in Mediterranean forest ecology.</p><p>\"For the most part, the forest will manage to regenerate on its own,\" he told RFI.</p><p>\"Mediterranean forests, for example, are adapted to a certain fire regime. They have developed effective methods for post-fire regeneration.\"</p><p>Fire-resistant bark</p><p>Some species, like the cork oak, are especially resilient. \"Three weeks after a fire, there can already be young shoots appearing on the trunk,\" Rigolot said.</p><p>Other trees survive thanks to their bark.</p><p>\"Those with more fire-resistant bark won't necessarily die: they'll sprout again with buds that will reform in the following years,\" Jonathan Lenoir, an ecologist and research fellow at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnrs.fr/fr/personne/jonathan-lenoir-0\">CNRS</url>, said.</p><p>Forests can turn green again quickly after rainfall.</p><p>\"If there is good natural regeneration capacity, we will see a return of trees in the following years,\" said R\u00e9mi Savazzi, head of the National Forestry Office's (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.onf.fr/\">ONF</url>) fire division.</p><p>Underground roots can also survive, allowing vegetation to \"grow back from the stump\".</p><p>Protecting the soil is the first priority after a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/tag/wildfire/\">forest fire</url>.</p><p>\"The forest has a role in protecting the soil and against other natural hazards,\" Savazzi explained.</p><p>Measures are taken to repair walking trails and to identify damaged trees or trees about to fall.</p><p>Trees affected by fire can be repurposed into anti-erosion barriers that \"slow down runoff and maintain the soil\", Savazzi added.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/environment/20250129-climate-change-made-la-wildfires-more-likely-according-to-international-study\">Climate change made LA wildfires 'more likely' according to international study</url></p><p>Human intervention</p><p>For some scientists, human involvement helps forests recover faster.</p><p>\"We need to ensure that invasive species like weeds don't proliferate. This will help native species regrow more easily,\" said Patrick Norman, a researcher at <url normalizedValue=\"https://experts.griffith.edu.au/13743-patrick-norman\">Griffith University</url> in Australia.</p><p>In Canada, some trees sow seeds when they burn, thus participating in natural forest regeneration. This is the case for certain conifers in the country's boreal forests.</p><p>Victor Danneyrolles, a researcher at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://creb-uqac.ca/en/equipes/victor-daneyrolles/\">University of Quebec</url> and a specialist in fire ecology told RFI that this is a very effective mechanism in allowing trees to regenerate after a fire.</p><p>\"There are seed systems enclosed in serotinous cones. There is a resin in the cone, which will melt when the fire passes, opening the cone, and allowing all the seeds to be released,\" he said.</p><p>While natural regeneration is prioritised where possible, sometimes a helping hand is needed \u2013 particularly when it comes to planting.</p><p>For many years in France, the planting of new trees and new seeds by humans was an integral part of the forest healing process but it hasn't always been effective.</p><p>\"We have examples of our colleagues 30 or 40 years ago who replanted as soon as there was a gap. We realise that some plantations have unfortunately failed,\" ONF's Savazzi said.</p><p>In the Mediterranean region, the last planting programs took place in the 1980s, according to Inrae, but this has become too expensive to maintain.</p><p>Danneyrolles indicates that in Quebec, the price of replanting corresponds to $8,000 per hectare, or nearly \u20ac5,000.</p><p>\"You have to produce the seeds, then plants in nurseries, build forest roads to access the areas to be reforested, labour costs,\" he said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20220721-france-s-worst-wildfires-in-30-years-force-a-rethink-on-managing-forests-climate-change\">France's worst wildfires in 30 years force a rethink on managing forests</url></p><p>Choice of tree species</p><p>Furthermore, replanting, while still used in many countries, can be risky if done poorly or if the species planted are not well chosen.</p><p>\"We may be tempted to plant species that are more resistant to fire, and which sometimes come from far away. These species can be invasive and cause other problems,\" said Jonathan Lenoir of the CNRS.</p><p>Lenoir instead advocates replanting a \"mixture of species\" to \"avoid the spread of fire, which can be more prevalent when tree species are homogenous.</p><p>Australian researcher Patrick Norman insists on planting something that's native to the area, \"something that should originally grow there,\" he says.</p><p>\"Planting an exotic species like a eucalyptus (a species widely found in Australian forests), which burns very well, would significantly exacerbate the problem\" in unsuitable forests.</p><p>In many countries, the regeneration of forests is a combination of techniques.</p><p>In Morocco, the National Agency for Water and Forests (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.maroc.ma/en/news/moroccos-anef-issues-wildfire-risk-bulletin-aug-17-20\">ANEF</url>) sets aside closed areas to allow vegetation to regrow without disturbance, alongside reforestation with drought-resistant native species.</p><p>After fires in the Landes de Gascogne region of France in 2022, \"most of the maritime pine forests were replanted,\" Rigolot said. Planting is also taking place along the Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal.</p><p>New tools like drones are being tested in Canada, Spain and Mexico. In Michoacan, some drone models can carry nearly 20 kilos of seeds, Danneyrolles said.</p><p>Indigenous input</p><p>Some countries, such as Australia, draw on the knowledge of indigenous communities to develop more sustainable regeneration strategies for fire-affected areas.</p><p>\"They are an incredible source of knowledge; they have maintained the environment and lived with fires for nearly 50,000 years. Who knows the affected regions better than the First Nations' people?\" Australian researcher Patrick Norman said.</p><p>Victor Danneyrolles agrees with this when it comes to Canada.</p><p>\"They are generally the most exposed to the risk of fires, because some live in somewhat isolated areas. We work with them as much as possible to understand their needs and realities.\"</p><p>Traditional techniques such as controlled burns are now widely used in Australia and Canada. Indigenous groups are also exploring the use of drones, which avoid building roads or bringing in heavy machinery.</p><p>Generations to grow</p><p>Even when regeneration is quick, full recovery can take decades.</p><p>\"It will take 20 to 30 years for small trees to become adult trees and be able to reseed,\" Savazzi said.</p><p>Norman recalled Australia's \"Black Summer\" of 2019-2020, when \"trees that were thought to be dead sprouted two or three years later.\" Still, he noted that some ecosystems can take \"up to 20 years to return to the state they were in before the fires.\"</p><p>When it comes to ancient forests, an even longer period is required, according to Rigolot from Inrae \u2013 who points to the fires earlier this month in the Aude department of France.</p><p>\"To rebuild a mature forest, like the one that burned in the Corbi\u00e8res, it takes many years, almost a human generation, or almost 60 to 70 years. The forest is an ecosystem with a very long life cycle,\" he said.</p><p>The process of reforestation and restoration that can take even longer if disrupted by repeated or overly massive fires.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250807-biggest-french-wildfire-since-1949-a-catastrophe-on-an-unprecedented-scale\">Biggest French wildfire since 1949 a 'catastrophe on an unprecedented scale'</url></p><p>Resilience as key</p><p>In Quebec, after the mega-fires that ravaged several million hectares in 2023, some forests, for example, have been unable to regenerate on their own.</p><p>\"It is estimated that more than 300,000 hectares will not be able to reforest themselves. We are capable of reforesting ourselves, but only up to 50,000 hectares per year,\" Danneyrolles said.</p><p>For Jonathan Lenoir, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/tag/climate-change/\">climate change</url> will involve a different adaptation of forest ecosystems, to put the emphasis on resilience. This may lead to the disappearance of certain species better adapted to a more humid climate.</p><p>\"We risk having species better adapted to hot and dry climates naturally, or, through assisted migration, humans will seek to favour species adapted to these new conditions,\" he said.</p><p>With already 8 to 10 million hectares of natural forests disappearing each year, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/\">NGO World Wildlife Fund</url> says helping forests adapt will be essential.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.47% is 0.84 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.14%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.47</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.14</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.67</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.5% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.5%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 181.7%.

They also cite an apparent contradiction with the agency's acceptance of renewable natural gas (RNG) as a credit-earning \"fuel\" under the RFS.</p><p>Use of such RNG accounts for the majority of the \"cellulosic\" biofuel category under the program, even though it is a gas and not a liquid fuel.</p><p>\"EPA can rely on the fact that it is a longstanding matter of federal law to treat electricity as a fuel,\" the groups say, citing the Energy Policy Act of 1992.</p><p>\"Preserving the electricity pathway while eliminating subsidies for the EV sector are not mutually exclusive. The electricity pathway was never intended to promote EVs. No other transportation fuel in the RFS program treats the user of the fuel, i.e., the vehicle end-user, as the 'producer' of RINs. That is contrary to the plain language of the statute,\" the groups say.</p><p>While Obama-era proposals explored granting eRINs to EV makers or charging station operators, these ideas were not \"consistent with existing law,\" the groups say.</p><p>The trade associations note that Congress has frequently directed EPA to establish \"pathways\" for eRIN generation. Although EPA has established such pathways for certain feedstocks -- such as RNG -- it has not done so for all. And no administration has yet established a workable framework for granting eRINs, and thus none have been issued.</p><p>\"Congress has similarly endorsed EPA's interpretation of \"renewable fuels\" and further encouraged EPA to utilize the renewable electricity pathway. On seven separate occasions since 2019, Congressional appropriators have expressed frustration with the backlog of applications seeking to generate RINs from the electricity pathway and have demanded the agency act on pending applications,\" the biomass groups say.</p><p>\"In 2020, Congress even allocated $500,000 for the purpose of processing applications to make use of the renewable electricity pathway. In sum, Congress has repeatedly endorsed EPA's power to implement the electricity program and pushed the agency to do so expeditiously,\" the groups add.</p><p>Senate FY26 Report</p><p>The Senate Appropriations Committee on July 24 also voiced support for the eRIN program.</p><p>In report language attached to the panel's fiscal year 2026 spending bill for EPA, which lawmakers approved on a 26-2 vote, the committee noted that EPA \"still has not implemented the electricity program under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), despite past direction from this committee.\"</p><p>The report directs EPA to \"finalize the eRINs program within 90 days of enactment of this act and to process all electric pathway feedstock petitions prior to issuing the final 2026 Renewable Volume Obligation rule.\"</p><p>The Appropriations Committee said it \"expects that the eRIN program will be implemented with all eligible feedstocks, particularly those that support agriculture activity, minimize wildfire risk, and reduce methane emissions.\"</p><p>Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-ME) is a key champion of the biomass sector and its efforts to win RFS credit, along with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the biofuels industry source says, adding that there is substantial bipartisan support in the House for this effort.</p><p>The biomass groups in their comments say: \"Because prior EPAs have decided to make the [cellulosic RIN] market almost entirely the exclusive domain of RNG, this has incentivized the conversion of landfill-gas-to-electricity facilities from providing baseload power to RNG production, all the while failing to support baseload biomass electricity, and all because of EPA policies that are contrary to President Trump's energy policies.\"</p><p>\"Biomass power's exclusion from the [cellulosic] program has directly and negatively impacted baseload power capacity and good-paying rural jobs. In the last decade, 25 biomass facilities have closed, resulting in an estimated loss of 20% of the total capacity of the industry and contributing to a staggering loss of logging jobs across the country,\" the groups say.</p><p>\"This trend is directly contrary to the President's executive orders, including EO 14213 to further domestic energy dominance, EO 14216 to increase baseload power, and EO 14260 to promote affordable and reliable energy.\"</p><p>Two additional orders, EO 14225 and EO 14308, \"are directly relevant to EPA's decision to exclude electricity from the RFS. Specifically, EO 14225 encourages federal agencies to find 'tools to facilitate the increase' in bioenergy production. Inclusion of biomass derived electricity in the . . . program is exactly such a tool. Additionally, because many biomass power facilities utilize forest residues that would otherwise contribute to wildfires, EO 14308 is applicable.\"</p><p>The associations ask EPA to: maintain renewable electricity in the RFS program; process all pending biomass power pathways; finalize a simplified electricity pathway program that creates greater market competition while not burdening consumers or refiners; and remove the ability for the program to serve as an incentive for the EV industry by designating power generators as the sole \"producer.\"</p><p>However, there is so far no indication that the Trump EPA will move from its categorical rejection of electricity as a qualifying \"fuel\" under the RFS. And other major sectors affected by the program, including ethanol and biodiesel producers and refiners, are pursuing policies that benefit liquid fuels over other types. -- Stuart Parker (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sparker@iwpnews.com\">sparker@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENWASW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENWASW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGF-RW93-S165-52GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">285559</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EnergyWashington Week</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 13, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Legal News</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

With fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels reaching thresholds deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups, state officials responded by issuing advisories for more than a dozen counties.</p><p>The move underscored the ongoing public health risk posed by recurring wildfire smoke events, which have grown increasingly common in recent years as large blazes persist in Canadian provinces. Vulnerable individuals\u2014especially those with heart or respiratory conditions, children, and older adults\u2014have been warned that even brief exposure can trigger symptoms or exacerbate underlying health issues.</p><h>What To Know</h><p>The Wisconsin DNR issued an air quality advisory beginning at 6 a.m. Thursday, impacting the counties of Ashland, Barron, Bayfield, Burnett, Chippewa, Douglas, Dunn, Iron, Pepin, Pierce, Polk, Price, Rusk, Sawyer, St. Croix, Vilas, and Washburn.</p><p>According to state officials, the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM2.5\u2014tiny particles capable of penetrating deep into the lungs\u2014was forecast to reach levels classified as \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" (USG) and, in some areas, \"Unhealthy.\"</p><p>The advisory stemmed from dense smoke originating in ongoing Canadian wildfires, particularly from Saskatchewan and Manitoba, that migrated south into the Upper Midwest. The smoke plume was expected to reach the Duluth/Superior area between 6 and 9 a.m. and gradually move southeast, extending impacts throughout the day and possibly into the weekend.</p><p>As meteorological conditions change, the alert area was scheduled to be updated in response to real-time monitoring and predictive models.</p><p>The official alert recommended that residents\u2014especially those with preexisting lung or heart disease, asthma, young children, and older adults\u2014take precautionary measures. These include limiting the intensity and duration of outdoor activities, moving activities indoors if possible, and staying alert for any new or worsening symptoms.</p><p>For all residents, staying indoors and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/five-states-keep-windows-shut-air-quality-2103480?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">keeping windows closed</url> remained a key precaution while smoke persists in the area.</p><p>Health officials urged residents to monitor themselves for symptoms associated with poor air quality. Key symptoms to watch for included:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>CoughingShortness of breathThroat irritationUnusual fatigueChest discomfortHeart palpitations</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>People with asthma were advised to follow their asthma action plans and keep quick-relief inhalers readily available. Those with heart disease were instructed to contact their health care providers if symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, or unexpected fatigue developed. The advisory also encouraged all residents, including healthy individuals, to keep outdoor activities shorter and less intense, and to go inside if any symptoms present.</p><h>What People Are Saying</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Air quality alert issued in Wisconsin:</emphasis> \"People with heart disease: Symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, or unusual fatigue may indicate a serious problem. If you have any of these, contact your health care provider.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Wisconsin DNR webpage about wildfire smoke:</emphasis> \"Larger and more frequent wildfires are a growing public health concern, as wildfire smoke from larger fires can travel and impact air quality hundreds or even thousands of miles away and cause a wide range of health impacts based on a person's sensitivity to pollutants and the amount of pollutants in the air.\"</p><h>What Happens Next</h><p>The air quality advisory remained in effect through Thursday with a possibility for extension or adjustment depending on updated smoke projections and AQI readings. As southerly winds are forecast to return over the weekend, state officials anticipated that smoke may be pushed farther north, allowing air quality to improve gradually in majority of the state. However, lingering smoke impacts could require advisories to remain in effect for certain regions.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2689756/air-quality-alert-canadian-wildfire-smoke.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Air quality alert Canadian wildfire smoke</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>James_Gabbert/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Burning forest fire in British Columbia in Kootenay National Park.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-2103623</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBD-VS93-RRVM-115N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><timeReceived>1:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2025 Newsweek Inc.

)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters battled blazes across Turkey on Monday as the country sweltered in a summer heatwave across much of the Mediterranean, with wildfires leading to at least 14 deaths in the country in the past week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Around 20 villages have been evacuated, officials said, and more than 3,500 people forced to leave their homes.</p><p>\"We are burning up, we don't even know where to go anymore,\" Asmin Gezginci, 24, said while returning from a park to her home in the Kurdish-majority southeastern city of Diyarbakir.</p><p>Temperatures had already soared to a record high of 50.5 degrees Celsius (123 Fahrenheit) on Friday in Silopi, two hours from Gezginci's home.</p><p>According to weather forecasts, the heatwave will continue this week with temperatures of 40C to 45C in the central Anatolia region and 45C to 50C forecast in the southeast on Tuesday.</p><p>On Monday, local authorities in Diyarbakir warned residents about temperatures \"four to six degrees above seasonal norms until August 2\".</p><p>In the city, the thermometer was already showing 45.4C at midday, an AFP journalist saw.</p><p>The heatwave has exacerbated forest fires on the dry ground that have spread rapidly in windy conditions.</p><p>Firefighters tackled blazes around Bursa in the northwest on Monday, the country's fourth-largest city and a major industrial centre, for the third consecutive day.</p><p>Their efforts were hampered by strong winds fanning the flames, according to Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli.</p><p>Some residents used tractors to transport water tanks, while television images showed others rushing toward the blazes with bottles of water in their hands.</p><p>But the intensity of a fire in Karabuk in the north has diminished, and a fire in Kahramanmaras in the south is now \"under control\", Yumakli said.</p><p>\"Given the size and intensity of the fires, the state's ability to respond quickly to such disasters is sometimes limited,\" he acknowledged.</p><p>\"If there is wind, there are no planes, and it takes hours, even days, for you to take control,\" he said.</p><p>In recent days, 19 villages had to be evacuated in the Safranbolu region in the north, and more than 3,500 people around Bursa.</p><p>In a televised speech after a weekly cabinet meeting, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 96 percent of the fires were caused by human activity such as cigarette butts and picnic fires.</p><p>There were also a few cases of sabotage, he said.</p><p>\"Let us not forget that this is a war, a defence of our green homeland, against this insidious enemy,\" Erdogan said.</p><p>\"We are doing what is necessary, and we will continue to do so.\"</p><p>Last week, a wildfire killed at least 10 forest workers and rescuers fighting a blaze near Eskisehir in western Turkey.</p><p>A firefighter battling the flames died of a heart attack on Saturday.</p><p>Three more people died Sunday in an accident involving a water tanker truck that was used to battle a blaze, Bursa authorities said.</p><p>According to Erdogan, more than 3,000 fires have broken out since the beginning of summer, and authorities warn the situation will remain critical until October.</p><p>A UN report on desertification worldwide estimates that 88 percent of Turkey's territory is at risk: rainfall is expected to decrease 30 percent by the end of the century, while temperatures are expected to rise by 5C to 6C compared to the averages recorded between 1961 and 1990.</p><p>Across the Aegean Sea in Greece, where blazes have ravaged homes and sparked evacuations across the country this summer, firefighters worked Monday to contain outbreaks after bringing dozens under control over the weekend.</p><p>Even as the heat wave gripping the country began to ease, a new forest fire broke out near the university campus east of Athens, in the municipality of Zografou.</p><p>According to firefighters, 65 firefighters, 20 vehicles, seven helicopters and six planes were mobilised to contain the flames.</p><p>Greece has endured heatwave conditions for a week, with temperatures passing 40C in many areas.</p><p>And on the Iberian Peninsula, four Spanish planes joined more than 250 Portuguese firefighters battling a blaze Monday in an isolated mountain region near their border, authorities said.</p><p>The blaze in north Portugal's Viana do Castelo district was spreading in two directions and difficult to tackle because of the strong winds, civil protection chief Marco Domingues said.</p><p>One firefighter has been injured.</p><p>Authorities have put much of northern and southern Portugal on the highest alert for wildfires because of high temperatures and strong winds.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/turkey-battles-wildfires-heatwave-grips-med-3779625\">Link to the original

Why is a percentage not enough to explain it?</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>Among the news of the causes of the fires in these weeks plus the trickle of figures of investigated and arrested for these fires, he highlighted a number of the PP president Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o in his visit to Galicia for the current fires: \"There is an incendiary terrorism activity in Spain, 80% of the fires are intentional\". More recently, he announced among other proposals a \"National Register of Arsonists\", to refer later \"to all persons convicted by a final sentence who have caused a fire\". Neither the 80% overall figure is true nor does it all boil down to arsonists, but one piece of data is not enough to summarize this reality.</p><p><br/>This 80% can be contradicted in several ways. One is with the total number of intentional fires since records began: of the 628,340 fires in the EGIF, 51.9% are classified as intentional by the Large Forest Fire Statistics (EGIF), a consolidated database of the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge. But ending the explanation on this data is also misleading, since this sum ignores the evolution over time, the certainty of the cause and the type of fires.<br/> This sum of the EGIF covers the 56 years from 1968 to 2023. The first record puts the number of intentional fires at 20.9%. At that time a much higher proportion was given to negligence and accidental causes (72.4%). Natural causes and reproductive causes (6.8%) were less common.<br/> But claims with unknown causes are also part of the equation. In 1968 they were a quarter (24.9%), which reduces the proportion of intentional fires to 15.7% in that year, and the total to 51.9% (without the unclarified fires, they would rise to 66.5%).<br/> But neither does the most recent figure of 2023 in this graph alone represent the reality, with only 201 incidents added so far when the trend is to exceed 10,000. Civio, in its project \"Spain in flames\", evidences the lack of information since 2018 in some provinces and especially afterwards.<br/> In addition, it is necessary to wait until 1998 for a necessary layer in this information: in which cases the cause is certain and in which supposed. From such year to 2023, intentional casualties are 56%, but only in 11.85% this cause is recorded as clear. Far from 80%.<br/> Not all arson fires are caused by arsonists. According to the EGIF, they would be the cause of 4.2% of the fires and this is true in about six out of every thousand (0.57%). Not all those convicted of causing these fires would therefore fit this profile.<br/> AUX STEP FOR JS<br/>Returning to the figure of 80% of intentional fires, this also does not hold true when measuring the damage of the fires and not their quantity. And while the Ministry distinguishes between conatos (less than one hectare burned), fires as such (from one hectare) and large fires (more than 500), the breakdown by these types of fire does not change this reality much, with slightly more proportion in large fires (and also a smaller sample). The same is true for those born to arsonists.<br/>These figures call for caution: a single number is not enough to explain this context. If we do not measure arson fires but all fires caused by people, the proportions are closer to 80%. The report for the decade 2006-2015 of the Ministry figures, in fact, that \"81.16% of the claims are caused by human activities, either by negligence and accidents or intentionally\". Again, in this case the certainty of the events is not counted.<br/>What if we do the count by area? Also the official study from 2006 to 2015 gives as most affected the forest area of the northwest (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Basque Country and part of Castilla y Le\u00f3n). A territorial division similar to the most razed by fires this year and that would fit with the place where Feij\u00f3o mentioned that 80%.<br/> The Ministry explains in its annual reports that fires behave differently in the northwest, the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands and inland communities \"in terms of meteorology, vegetation and existing socioeconomic factors\". This is why the country cannot be understood as a whole in terms of fires.<br/> Not only are the dynamics of the fires different, but also what produces them. It is here where 80% of the fires appear: in the northwest the proportion of intentional fires reaches 80.3%, above the Canary Islands (71.2%) and, above all, the inland areas (38.7%) and the Mediterranean (20%).<br/> The percentages by provinces reflect more clearly the Spains of intentional fires from 1968 to 2023: that northwest most punished by the fires caused by the amount of hectares burned, but which also damage quite a lot of enclaves in the south and the Canary Islands.<br/> In terms of the number of claims, Galicia stands out with respect to the rest of the regions, but also Cantabria, the only area above 80% in the overall calculation. Zamora, the worst-hit area, together with Le\u00f3n in its community, is also out of the general norm.<br/> But again, the nuances: when the analysis is only of the fires provoked with certainty since 1998, without taking into account the assumptions, a different country is drawn. Zamora stands out together with Vizcaya and Alicante, but not the patterns of the northwest or Galicia.<br/> AUX STEP FOR JS<br/>The scourge of fires caused by arsonists is not homogeneous either. There are several analyses that can also be made in this regard and each of them will draw a more affected Spain: in quantity, Galicia is precisely, by far, the one that accumulates more fires caused by arsonists (adding the assumptions, the figure is even higher); in proportion to the total number of intentional fires, Catalonia stands out with Girona and Barcelona.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> The dance of numbers is not limited to politics </emphasis><br/>The EGIF data come from the fire reports. The information in each report comes from the forestry personnel in charge of managing the fire, and a person in charge must fill in the document according to the teams deployed in the investigation and extinction of the incident. These records are then centralized in each province. \"Despite its shortcomings, Spain's fire statistics are the best of all European countries\", is highlighted in the instructions for these reports.<br/>However, these data do not match those of the Guardia Civil. The latest yearbooks of the Ministry of the Interior do not include the total number of fires, but only those known by these bodies for which they attribute a cause. While the intentional fires, between the certain and the supposed ones, cover more than 60% of the total from 1988 (first year with the breakdown of certainty) to 2017 (last complete year), those that reach this institution do not pass 9% according to the series 2021-2023 of Interior. \"It is important to emphasize that not all the accidents, especially the accidents with accidents, are of police importance\", they specify in these compilations.<br/>This dance of figures is even more noticeable in the sum of these arson fires with negligence and accidents, accidents also with human cause. While arson accounts for about two thirds of this sum for the EGIF, those with certain cause are close to half, slightly higher than those of the Guardia Civil. In this equation are added the fires with investigated and/or arrested persons, data that already belong to the reports of the Prosecutor's Office until 2020. Its series up to 2023 reduces these percentages to a quarter of the total number of fires.<br/>Already within the intentional fires, the proportion of fires caused by arsonists (plus other people with disorders) compared to the total number of intentional fires is more on a par, but they have nothing to do with those of the Prosecutor's Office. Of those that have ended with investigated and / or arrested, already those caused by arsonists / disorders is around half several years. \"In 2019, as has been happening year after year, the highest percentage corresponded to fires caused by 'disturbed/pyromaniacs',\" it is recorded in the summary of its latest peak in this statistical series.<br/>The gap in numbers is seen in absolute terms in the years where these three sources of information converge. Even excluding the attempted fires (less than one hectare burned), the total number of actual fires considered as arson according to the EGIF is not the same as those that come to the attention of the Guardia Civil and those that end up with investigators and detainees. This makes the sentences for arson in general contrast with these arson totals. \"Most fires do not end in trial,\" Civio warned 12 years ago. The magnitude of the arson fires is fading from the reports of the reports of the reports of the reports of the reports of the fires to the final point of asking for responsibilities, something that would also explain why already in the data of the Prosecutor's Office the arsonists are in the focus than in the other sources that cover a higher total of documented fires.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72503946</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GM2-96F3-RSY7-J30G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1475\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 28, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Sociedad</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D4JV</classCode><className>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000A2MK</classCode><className>GALICIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

As his espresso machine whirs, the headbanded master also starts to prepare a pour-over coffee from beans he grew, fermented and roasted himself.He knows which trees produced which fruit and how that will translate to the cup. His specialty coffee is celebrated, part of a national movement increasingly prizing organic, artisanal processes.Yet the natural ecosystem that fosters the practices of farmers like Chatree faces unprecedented challenges.Thailand's coffee industry is being reshaped by a paradox. Climate change is stressing highland farms and pushing production downward, even as a booming cafe culture in the country's urban hubs drives record domestic demand.With prices rising and imports surging to fill the gap, Thailand's coffee scene is undergoing a rapid transformation marked by fierce competition, bold innovation and a growing push for sustainability.&#x2028;Farmers sit at the start of the chain.Chatree's mature forest plantation sits in Khun Chang Kian village, recognised as one of Thailand's earliest coffee growing regions and located about an hour's drive through windy mountain roads from the downtown of Chiang Mai.Chatree's family has grown the crop for five decades, and his deep experience on this land tells him things are changing here.The rain is becoming erratic, he observes, and the trees bend and shape to their environment.It will play out when their cherries are ready to pick in a few months' time; their flavour will change and if the conditions are not right, there will be fewer of them to process. </p><p>\"Less yield means less money. But the coffee plants are tough like us; they have to adapt to survive in the changing conditions,\" he said.\"Global warming certainly has an impact, but it won't be the end for coffee. There is still a future.\"CLIMATE CHANGE HITTING COFFEE INDUSTRYChatree's optimism is at odds with global trends. Extreme weather is playing havoc with farmers' ability to produce arabica coffee - a typically more expensive variant compared to robusta, with complex flavours and preferred by artisanal cafes.Productivity has plummeted. In 2023, Thailand produced only 15,651 tonnes of coffee beans - about two-thirds of it arabica - where output in the past once hit more than 86,000 tonnes in 2001.A combination of rising temperatures, inconsistent and damaging rainfall events, prolonged droughts and pests is increasingly jeopardising yields.Land under cultivation has also dropped as more farmers shifted to monoculture of crops like maize or those with higher value, like durians.\"The effects go beyond lower yields. It also causes quality to drop - the crop no longer meets the standards we used to expect,\" said Jiraporn Inthasan, a master trainer in regenerative agriculture at Maejo University in Chiang Mai.\"In 20 years we might not have arabica in Thailand anymore. It won't be possible,\" she said.Thailand is not alone in its climate struggles. Brazil and Vietnam, two of the world's biggest coffee producers, suffered disastrous growing seasons in 2024, contributing to global coffee prices hitting a 50-year high in February.There are industry-wide fears that many small-scale farmers will abandon cultivation and new farmers will be reluctant to choose coffee. This type of production is important; smallholders are responsible for growing 70 per cent of the world's coffee.Key coffee-growing areas are right in the climate hitting zone. The crop is mostly grown in a region known as the Coffee Belt - between 20 degrees north and 30 degrees south of the equator. That is also a part of the world among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts.\"It's serious. I'd even call it severe,\" said Naruemon Taksaudom, the founder of HILLKOFF, a business focusing on coffee innovation, training and value-chain development.In the hills of Chiang Dao, north of Chiang Mai, PANA Coffee, a company that covers every step in processing coffee from seed to cup, saw about 11 hectares of its plantations lost to a forest fire last year.The year before, it lost a \"lot of crops\" due to unseasonal rain, said its founder Kompit Panasupon.It was a reminder of the challenge everyone faces, he said, when dealing with the fragilities of crop-growing amid climate change.\"Everyone is feeling the effects right now. It's a big problem that we all have to be serious about. And it's not just about coffee. It's basically every agriculture-related business and every farmer's job,\" Kompit said.Adaptation is possible through investments in climate-resilient varieties and the more widespread adoption of crop diversification and agroforestry. But the clock is ticking as the planet heats further.A DEMAND THAT CANNOT BE STOPPEDBack when coffee cultivation began in Thailand in the late 1960s, Thais hardly drank coffee. Initially, the arabica crop was introduced to the northern highlands and promoted as part of an alternative development model to replace the illicit cultivation of opium.The sector has evolved and in 2025, the broader domestic market is valued at 65 billion baht (US$2 billion), according to Thailand's ministry of commerce.From 1995 to pre-pandemic 2020, annual consumption of coffee in the country increased by more than tenfold. Thais now consume an average of 340 cups of coffee every year.Internationally, the market was estimated to be worth US$245 billion last year, according to Precedence Research, and is projected to grow by about 4.5 per cent per year to US$382 billion by 2034.The organic segment is expected to register the fastest growth in the coffee market during the forecast period, the research found.Within that, Thailand is carving out its niche, not as a major volume player, but rather as a producer of high-quality, specialty and smallholder produced coffee. It is pivoting towards value.Specialty coffee in Thailand accounts for only about 10 per cent of quantity - at around 5,000 tonnes annually - but for 20 per cent of total value. It is a cash cow for those who are able to navigate its nuances and complexities in an increasingly challenging growing environment.While \"specialty coffee\" is a technical industry term that has evaluation requirements and a scoring set for attributes like aroma, flavour, acidity, body, balance and aftertaste, in Thailand it is more commonly used to describe coffee grown by smallholder farmers, with traceability and served in third-wave cafes.While some Thai coffee undergoes technical grading, \"specialty\" is often a looser cultural label.\"Thailand has been lucky: Consumers welcomed coffee culture, and demand - along with interest in new coffee varieties and flavour profiles - grew faster than supply,\" said Naruemon.In the ever-sprawling city of Chiang Mai, there are signs of that demand.Last year, 1,700 new coffee shops opened in Chiang Mai, while 400 closed in the same period, delivery and lifestyle platform LINE MAN Wongnai reported.Akha Ama Coffee Roasters is among this next generation of cafes driving demand for Thai coffee. Even before its 8am opening time, customers are already peering over the chain-link fence blocking the entrance.More than a retail location, co-founder Lee Ayu Chuepa wants it to be a social enterprise committed to sustainability and promoting the efforts of indigenous hilltribe communities who grow the coffee.Lee is also promoting Thai coffee overseas; an Akha Ama roastery opened in Tokyo last year.\"We could not stop the demand. It definitely will grow and that's probably a good thing,\" he said.He said consumers want to know where their coffee comes from; and he can offer both that story and an anchor of support to his people.\"We're finding a balance between generations. Our families have really old wisdom about doing agriculture, so we blend those skills with modern techniques and young people are finding a job that can sustain their living,\" Lee said.Not all farmers have such options. Specialty coffee production remains an outlier activity that requires an investment in skills, knowledge, equipment and, often, marketing.\"Most of the farmers up in the hills are hill-tribe communities or smallholders who don't have the time to hand-sort beans. So larger companies step in to buy their coffee and then develop the branding themselves. Ninety per cent are primarily concerned with one thing: How to maximise their yield,\" Naruemon said.But she acknowledged that demand for specialty coffee has become an opportunity for farmers to lift their quality of life if done right.\"It becomes a virtuous circle. That's my perspective: Healthy soil, good yields, better quality, and healthier lives,\" she said.PANA Coffee is one company trying to connect smallholder farmers and consumers.It is attempting to do specialty coffee at scale and has made major investments in infrastructure at its sprawling complex on the outskirts of Chiang Mai city to ramp up processing of organic high-end beans.The company's philosophy is to lift the entire industry from seed to cup, to improve livelihoods, value and enjoyment of coffee, Kompit said.PANA runs an initiative called Project Shade that involves 22 different grower groups spanning multiple provinces to help farmers implement organic practices into their operations.\"Thailand doesn't produce enough coffee for ourselves. So, there's still room to grow. Whether that's enough land to grow, that's another story. But I really believe that with the existing land, and if more farmers embrace shared, grown organic practice, they can produce a lot more specialty grade coffee,\" he said.In addition, the company runs education courses through an academy to upskill coffee professionals and also invites farmers to taste their own coffee - a rarity for many.\"Then when they go back, it's like a paradigm shift for them, like, 'Oh, if I do this, if I do that, my coffee will taste like this, and more people will want to buy it',\" he said.\"Basically, it's exposure to what the consumers like that allows people who grow coffee to know what to do with their crops, and it's like building a bridge.\"For Lee, he sees the changes starting to manifest in local communities: Young people are staying in the mountains instead of seeking jobs in the city, or returning home with new skills and enthusiasm.\"You look at the other jobs in agriculture, not many people are proud to do them. But in coffee, you feel like a pioneer and we're proud to do it,\" he said.\"I think this is a game changer for Thailand, if we can keep growing the quality.\"FROM COMMODITY TO LUXURY PRODUCT?Coffee roasteries and specialty cafes around the country are being forced to walk a fine line between serving a burgeoning trend and making their business work in a period defined by inflationary costs, a sluggish local economy and limited supply of beans on the market.The rise in the global price in coffee has been profound over the past decade, but especially this year.Arabica coffee has increased in cost by 63 per cent from 2015 to 2024, when it averaged US$5.63 per kilogram. In February this year, it topped US$9 per kg.Robusta - higher in caffeine and usually used for instant coffee or blends - has seen similar trends and nearly a threefold increase in price since 2020.As yields have dropped in Thailand, the scramble to access beans of high quality, to suit what customers increasingly want, has gone full tilt. Cafes are competing for the same domestic supplies and are having to secure coffee through contracts years into the future.\"It's so competitive. It's almost silly at this point. You have to make a commitment to pay for coffee that is not even on the trees yet. And for some people, it might be a huge risk,\" said Han Wang, an artisanal coffee roaster and co-founder of PHIL Coffee in Bangkok.Thailand will also need to import approximately 80,000 tonnes of coffee beans, instant coffee and other coffee products this year to meet local demand, the government said in March.Coffee from non-ASEAN markets, which would include popular source countries in Africa and South America, attracts an import duty of up to 90 per cent.Roasteries and retailers are the ones bearing the raised costs, said Wang. The high levels of competition makes it difficult to significantly increase the price of a cup of coffee, he explained.\"The only way to counteract the import duties is to improve the local coffee. It's actually way better than, like, two decades ago. It's actually crazy good now,\" he said.\"But then, we still face a problem of quantity, in terms of local production.\"As thousands of cafes open each year in Thailand, the tough market conditions means closure rates are high. LINE MAN Wongnai reported that 43 per cent of Thai cafes are shuttering within their first year.To justify higher costs for customers, cafes are framing specialty coffee more as an experience, said Wasin Kusakabe from Nana Coffee Roasters and the Thailand National Brewers Cup 2024 Champion.\"Our philosophy is that we don't sell coffee, but we sell the experience,\" he said.The group's branches are designed differently and its coffee has ranges of flavours, acidity, sweetness, mouth feel, tactile and body.Wasin said the industry is moving towards considering coffee a \"luxury product\" similar to wine and whiskey, where people could often pay 400 to 600 baht per glass. A trendy new-age cafe in Bangkok would typically sell a regular cafe latte or americano for between 100 and 140 baht.\"People have this mindset of coffee as a commodity, but now the perception is starting to shift,\" he said.\"We don't want to increase the prices, but then there's a reason for it. We're trying our best to absorb as much as we can,\" he said.\"But we also want people to be aware of what's going on in our world today.\"Additional reporting by Jarupat BuranastidpornEditor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly named Maejo University's regenerative agriculture master trainer as Jiraporn Wongpaithoon.

It's the exact kind of forests timber companies often plant to intentionally harvest a few decades down the road.</p><p>\"It allows the fire to essentially gain a bunch of momentum and start exhibiting much more extreme fire behavior than if it's encountering road blocks every once in a while: open areas or meadows or areas with really big and more resilient trees,\" said Jacob Levine, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah and lead author on the study.</p><p>While California's forests are adapted for frequent, low-intensity fires that clear out the forest floors and promote regeneration, high-intensity flames can decimate ecosystems so much so that they may never recover.</p><p>Although the study focused on one forest in Northern California, it has implications across the western U.S., where this kind of \"plantation\"-style logging is common.</p><p>The conditions in Plumas National Forest, \"I'd call them very typical for at least Oregon, Washington and California,\" said Scott Stephens, a UC Berkeley professor of fire science and co-author on the study. \"These are places that are more productive, they have more precipitation, they grow trees faster.\"</p><p>For the scientists, the results emphasize just how much work California still must do to address its wildfire problem.</p><p>They hope the results, instead of vilifying logging companies, can help spur a conversation about what forest managers can do better.</p><p>\"If you want to grow timber in the state, contribute to the economy, contribute to home building -- all those are laudable goals,\" Stephens said. \"I think you've got to think about, 'Well, how am I going to do this in the fire environment of today or the future?' \"</p><p>And while public lands are less likely to experience severe fire than timberlands -- with a 57% probability of experiencing high-severity fire, compared with timber lands' 66% -- government forest managers aren't necessarily doing a perfect job either, experts say.</p><p>While timber companies' approaches tend to be too \"hands-on\" -- bulldozing over the natural ecosystem (sometimes literally) -- the U.S. Forest Service still tends to be too \"hands-off,\" experts argue: National forests are still lagging behind on much-needed prescribed burning and mechanical thinning work (or \"forest raking,\" as the president likes to call it).</p><p>The U.S. Forest Service allows logging on about a fourth of its land through agreements with private companies (which President Trump aims to significantly increase), but it has moved away from the practice of planting dense, evenly spaced \"pines in lines\" plantations.</p><p>The forest-fire blame game fueled by these differences in approach has gone on for decades.</p><p>After the 2007 Moonlight fire scorched 65,000 acres, including in Plumas National Forest, both the federal and state governments filed lawsuits against California's largest timber company, Sierra Pacific Industries, alleging the fire was started by a subcontractor's bulldozer that hit a rock and created a spark.</p><p>The company initially settled with the federal government while not admitting any wrongdoing, but, through a lengthy legal drama now living on as Sierra Nevada folklore, the company's lawyer petitioned, alleging that the federal government had concealed the fact that its own fire watch lookout was caught away from his post reeking of marijuana and peeing on his feet.</p><p>The Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear the company's appeal, while a lower court eventually ordered Cal Fire to pay out $15 million for fraud and withholding evidence.</p><p>In recent years, the federal and state governments and private industry have increasingly begun to cooperate on an active management strategy.</p><p>In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom created a task force to develop such a plan. It set a goal of practicing active management, primarily through mechanical thinning and intentional fire, on 1 million acres every year. Both the Forest Service and private timber companies are active participants.</p><p>Stephens and Levine hope their work can help forest managers work smarter, not harder.</p><p>The team analyzed data from planes that used lasers to create a three-dimensional map of the forest -- down to individual trees -- in 2018 before the major fires that burned the majority of the land.</p><p>They then looked at satellite data taken after each fire measuring the resulting severity of the burns.</p><p>The team found that the biggest indicator of how severely a fire burned on one plot of land was how severely it burned on plots next door. This made sense to the researchers: Fire is contagious, meaning a high-intensity fire with a lot of energy and momentum is likely to continue at a high intensity.</p><p>This can also create a spillover effect. Areas susceptible to high-severity fires, like private timber lands, can lead to high-severity fire in surrounding better-managed areas as well, typically up to a little over a mile away.</p><p>The second most important factors were how tightly packed the trees were and how hot, dry and windy the weather was on the day of the fire.</p><p>The effects also compounded: The worse the weather, the more forest density served as a predictor for fire severity.</p><p>The team also found that \"ladder fuels\" between the low-lying ground vegetation and the canopies of trees -- which can help a fire climb high into the canopy -- contributed to fire severity.</p><p>Clustered trees and open spaces in the canopy, meanwhile, resulted in less severe fire.</p><p>Tree density, the most significant indicator related to forest management, is fundamental to timber's business: It allows companies to produce more wood on the same amount of land. But Levine still sees a way forward.</p><p>Moving away from plantation-style logging by planting trees in irregular, clustered patterns and staggering planting over years to create a forest with different-aged trees can make sure tree crowns aren't all perfectly aligned for a fire to rip right through.</p><p>Previous research from Stephens has repeatedly shown that mechanical thinning and prescribed burns are incredibly effective at reducing high-severity fire risk while also improving forest health and preserving biodiversity. (Notably, the researchers couldn't explore the effects of ground vegetation in this new study, since the laser data struggled to detect it.)</p><p>There are already several examples of timber companies that have moved away from plantation-style logging in favor of more natural, fire-resistant forests.</p><p>And although these practices can be more expensive in the short term, Levine is still optimistic they can gain traction as research increasingly shows their effectiveness.</p><p>\"Timber companies are also invested in their forest not burning down,\" he said. \"That's bad for business, too -- if you plant the plantation and then 30 years later, before it gets to the size that it becomes profitable, it goes up in flames.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: DENSE groups of evenly spaced trees, the kind of forests timber companies often plant, were largely to blame for severe fire, a study says.

Wildfire Service - meaning it is not expected to grow.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While no homes were lost, several communities were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-island-mount-underwood-bamfield-wildfire-1.7616405\">without power for almost two weeks</url> after more than 50 power poles burned in remote areas.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lori Daniels, a UBC forestry professor with a focus on wildfires, told CBC that the fire is one of the biggest in about 100 years of record-keeping on Vancouver Island - and that significant wildfires are expected to become more frequent as climate change impacts coastal forests.\u00a0</p><p>She spoke to CBC host Gregor Craigie about the history\u00a0and future of wildfires on Vancouver Island.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How rare, or not, is a fire of this size on\u00a0Vancouver Island?</emphasis></p><p>What we found is there's fires at the turn of the last century, in the early 1900s. Many of those were associated with early logging, with cutblocks that were left with large amounts of slash. We used to cherry-pick which species were harvested and then used for lumber products. Many of the trees were cut and left behind, so lots of wood left behind, lots of woody debris.\u00a0</p><p>And as we know, the warmest and driest part of the year is the heat of the summer. You can imagine those cutblocks are very exposed. The wood is exposed, it dries out, and it was susceptible to fire.</p><p>So if we go back to the early 1920s and 30s in British Columbia, in Washington state, down in Oregon as well, there were fires that were fairly large on the west slope of the coastal ranges that had substantive impacts on our society. But most of those again were related to early logging blocks and much of that slash.</p><p>On the west side of Vancouver Island, and in our wet coastal forest, fire was not historically a large portion of how our ecosystems functioned. But if you come to the east side of Vancouver Island, if we look at old maps going back to the 1850s and 60s when the first surveys were done by settlers and by colonial agencies and government agencies, we actually see that the landscape on the east side of Vancouver Island was very different with Garry oak woodlands, with what were called pine plains that had Douglas-firs and grassy understories.</p><p>And those were sustained by Indigenous cultural fire by the Coast Salish people up and down Vancouver Island. And fire was an important part of those ecosystems, but a very different type of fire than what we've observed in the past couple of months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You talked about how human activity, in particular, may have contributed to some of those bigger fires in the past. And how does that, and understanding other causes of past fires, help us in the future, hopefully?</emphasis></p><p>So we know that in our coastal region, we don't have nearly as much lightning, and lightning ignitions in the historical record are much lower than in the Interior. Simply, our weather systems are different. The influence of the ocean giving us a more mesic\u00a0(moderately moist) environment. Kind of a wetter, cooler environment right next to the ocean really tempers the conditions here. But at the same time, we have seen and we see it in the instrumental record that it's becoming warmer and drier with longer droughts developing.\u00a0</p><p>We've seen that in coastal B.C. over the last decade, many years we've been in high fire danger, extreme fire danger with prolonged droughts...We've seen repeat fires in our coastal forests up the Sunshine Coast, over in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/evacuation-order-lifted-for-all-but-7-zeballos-b-c-properties-affected-by-wildfire-damage-1.5118429\">Zeballos</url> on the west side of Vancouver Island, some of our wettest ecosystems. And then of course, the fires in 2023 and 2025 on Cameron Lake and then of course, the fires out of Port Alberni this summer.\u00a0</p><p>We're going to have to think carefully about how we are managing our forests, how we are managing logging residues. We have to think carefully about the forests surrounding our neighbourhoods and communities. Second-growth forests are more susceptible to fire than the old-growth forests here in our coastal conditions, but most of our communities are surrounded by second-growth forests.</p><p>That's going to require proactive management to think about how to make those forests resilient again. And it will mean in those forests around communities ... thinking about thinning and thinking about managing the fuels on the ground that are contributing to the smouldering combustion that creates all of that smoke that we've all been impacted by.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And you mentioned the Underwood fire is a harbinger of things to come. Does the extent to which it becomes the norm in the future, can that be significantly altered by forest management practices, in your view?</emphasis></p><p>Fire, and fire behaviour, is a mixture of weather and climate, the topography and the fuels, and the fuels are the condition of the forest. And so that's the component that we can alter and change and that we can manage for.\u00a0</p><p>We know that warmer, drier conditions are coming. We know that the droughts are more severe and longer, and we can't change our mountainous topography. On the one hand, it's beautiful, and it gives us amazing environments to live in, but it also makes it very tricky and very challenging to put out those fires. So that leaves us the fuels to manage for and to think about ways that we can make those ecosystems more resilient.</p><p/><p>It's also important for us to remember that most of the ecosystems around us have been highly altered in the last century.</p><p>And many of our changes, whether they're industrial forest management or our attempts to control all fires or our removal of Indigenous fire stewardship, has, in combination, meant that our landscapes have changed and largely become more loaded with trees and fuels that are very flammable.</p><p>And so that challenges us to think creatively, to deeply understand how our ecosystems function, and to come up with ways that the forest can be managed differently than we have been for many decades, to think about resilience, to maintain biodiversity and create resilience for our communities as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What about replanting? Should the same species be planted in Vancouver Island forests, or would you have different recommendations?</emphasis></p><p>I think we've done an excellent job in British Columbia to make sure that we focus on our native tree species and continue to grow back our native tree species. We plant the Douglas-firs, cedars and other species that we consider high priority.</p><p>We are paying attention to seed sources that might be more resilient to climate change and the warmer, drier climate. So there are some really good experiments and trials underway to look at seed sources from further south, where they'll be better adapted to the climate coming towards us, but still our same native species.</p><p>\u00a0And thinking about how to be resilient to climate, to the insects, the pathogens and fire that come with climate change and interact with that changing climate. So diversifying our forests, the tree species within every patch of forest, diversifying our landscapes and managing to make sure that we're reducing the amount of fuel load left behind through our industrial forest management is going to be critical in all parts of the province moving forward.<br/> \u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">With files from On the Island</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadabritishcolumbiamountunderwoodfireaharbingeroffutureislandfires17616001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GK1-FNR3-RWNC-P16H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1227\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.
