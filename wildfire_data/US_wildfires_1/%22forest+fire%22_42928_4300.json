The American space agency said satellite imagery from Monday showed smoke extending across the North Atlantic Ocean to the Iberian Peninsula, France and other parts of western Europe.</p><p>There are 490 fires burning nationally, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency is reporting 110 active fires.</p><p>Canada has already surpassed the record for area burned. Nearly every province in Canada has fires burning. A record 30,000 square miles (80,000 square kilometers) of Canada has burned, an area nearly as large as South Carolina, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">according to the Canadian government.</url></p><p>\"This season has been unprecedented,\u201d Flisfeder said.</p><p>Ontario\u2019s chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore suggested people get into the daily habit of checking air quality this summer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our new normal now is to be looking at all of those parameters,\u201d Moore said.</p><p>The hazy skies and acrid air were obvious in Canada's largest city of Toronto, where child care centers and the school board suspended outdoor activities.</p><p>Almost 1,200 vulnerable people from Cree communities are among the evacuees who have fled northern Quebec because of wildfires and smoke. Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost of the Cree health board said the evacuation process has gone relatively well, but he adds that the situation poses particular health, logistical and cultural challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-f145b883ac478262464508348762b5f720230629</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K4-0HB1-DYMD-641M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><timeReceived>3:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There's a woman on Reels who cleans people's houses for free when they're having a tough time and the mess has gotten out of hand; it's really soothing to watch. I also enjoy any varmint-forward content. I would watch a ferret do anything.<br/>I haven't stopped reading stories about the Rat Hole, which is a perfect impression made by a rat (or maybe a squirrel) in a sidewalk in Chicago's Roscoe Village neighborhood. It's been a huge sensation online, in part because of its whimsicality-it looks as if a rodent plunged straight through the earth, like a cartoon character running through a wall. A couple held their wedding ceremony there, and visitors are leaving gifts and offerings to the \"rat.\" There's just something so joyful about the Rat Hole, despite the almost-certain death of the mammal involved. [Related: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/01/chicago-rat-hole-community-monument-meaning-absurd/677248/?utm_source=feed\">Long live the Chicago Rat Hole.</url>]<br/>The last entertainment thing that made me snort with laughter: The Las Culturistas podcast, which is hosted by the comedians Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang, makes me laugh so hard. I don't even watch half of the shows they talk about, but they just have so much fun yapping with each other. I especially love their annual Culture Awards, which included such prizes last year as the Diva Down Award (Person Who Fell Hard Award) and the Slouching Towards Bethlehem Award for Chicest Book to Hold. I only listen to Las Cultch at the gym, and if they don't have a new episode, I don't go to the gym!<br/>An actor I would watch in anything: Easy: Sharon Horgan. This absolute powerhouse of a comedic actress could release a one-woman Netflix play about, like, the Earth's crust, and I would sprint to my couch to watch it. She's so clever, and she just seems like she'd be a fun, sturdy pal to get drinks with. My favorite shows of hers are Catastrophe, a rom-com she stars in with Rob Delaney; This Way Up, which I would describe as a more heartwarming, Irish version of Fleabag; and Bad Sisters, a black comedy about murder and sisterly love. Sharon is just the best. Sometimes I sit and wonder: What is Sharon up to now? Is she happy? Would she want to hang out? [Related: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/04/catastrophe-season-three-review-marriage/524592/?utm_source=feed\">Catastrophe and the comedy of the self-aware marriage</url>]<br/>A good recommendation I recently received: I am a big fan of the series <url normalizedValue=\"https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781635575569\">A Court of Thorns and Roses</url>, which is, yes, extremely smutty, but is also full of cool faerie-fantasy world-building. The dialogue is cringey, but if you can get past it, the story is worth it. A friend recently recommended that I read <url normalizedValue=\"https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781649374042\">Fourth Wing</url>, which is apparently similar, but with dragons. I've started it, and I'm already hooked: a school for dragon riders? A female protagonist with something to prove? A ruthless and smoking-hot mortal enemy? Count me in.<br/>The last debate I had about culture: I might be stepping in it here. As a onetime Barbie-doll obsessive, I had fun watching the movie. Visually, it was stunning, and Weird Barbie was a genius character. But I don't think the movie, in the end, knew what it was trying to say. America Ferrera's speech felt random to me. Why were the Kens at war? Anyway, it's strange that this film, which has enabled a toy company to sell more toys, has become some sort of stand-in for feminism. And people seem to think it's a crisis of progress that Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig were snubbed in the Oscar nominations for Best Actress and Best Director, respectively, while Ryan Gosling got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Even Hillary Clinton popped up on X, previously known as Twitter, to compare the situation to her losing the 2016 election to Donald Trump.<br/>I guess I just want to remind people: Barbie made over one billion American dollars! Collectively, we must get a grip. [Related: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/01/barbie-greta-gerwig-oscar-snub/677232/?utm_source=feed\">Why the Oscars overlooked Greta Gerwig</url>]<br/>Something delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life: There is a child who lives in my neighborhood, and our dogs play together at the dog park. He has a beagle named Lucy, and I have a scruffy terrier named Sugar. The other day, this kid looked at Sugar and said, \"I call your kind of dog a Scraggle Dog.\" A Scraggle Dog! I can't stop thinking about that. Now, everywhere I go, I'm seeing Scraggle Dogs.<br/>An online creator whom I'm a fan of: I've never loved art museums. Sometimes I wonder if I get art. But there are a few creators whom I follow on the internet because their work makes me laugh or smile. (Maybe that is the point of art?) Anyway, Janet Hill paints lively scenes of people and places, and she has a <url normalizedValue=\"https://janethillstudio.com/products/miss-moon-was-a-dog-governess-lesson-one-be-kind-to-the-wildlife-and-they-may-return-the-favour-one-day\">series</url> in which a governess teaches dogs different lessons on etiquette. I have a framed print of six dogs sitting around a table, wearing fancy little pillbox hats and bow ties as they politely wait to enjoy some cake. I also love <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/elizabeth_draws/?hl=en\">Elizabeth Graeber</url>, who makes these wispy and endearing watercolor portraits of people (and sometimes Scraggle Dogs).<br/>A sculpture that I cherish: One of my terrible habits is that I often scroll through Facebook Marketplace to see what goodies people are selling, and then I convince myself that I need that thing. Recently, I stumbled across a man selling an Old English Sheepdog lamp. It is a ceramic sheepdog with a big light bulb sticking out of its head and a shade on top. The man's mother apparently raised sheepdogs, and, for decades, the lamp sat on a nightstand between her twin bed and her husband's. I can't resist a dog lamp with a good backstory, so I bought it. It's so regal and handsome-an instant classic. Unfortunately, the lamp is very big, and my boyfriend is mad.<br/><br/>The Week Ahead<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url

The American space agency said satellite imagery from Monday showed smoke extending across the North Atlantic Ocean to the Iberian Peninsula, France and other parts of western Europe.</p><p>There are 490 fires burning nationally, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency is reporting 110 active fires.</p><p>Canada has already surpassed the record for area burned. Nearly every province in Canada has fires burning. A record 30,000 square miles (80,000 square kilometers) of Canada has burned, an area nearly as large as South Carolina, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">according to the Canadian government.</url></p><p>\"This season has been unprecedented,\u201d Flisfeder said.</p><p>Ontario\u2019s chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore suggested people get into the daily habit of checking air quality this summer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our new normal now is to be looking at all of those parameters,\u201d Moore said.</p><p>The hazy skies and acrid air were obvious in Canada's largest city of Toronto, where child care centers and the school board suspended outdoor activities.</p><p>Almost 1,200 vulnerable people from Cree communities are among the evacuees who have fled northern Quebec because of wildfires and smoke. Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost of the Cree health board said the evacuation process has gone relatively well, but he adds that the situation poses particular health, logistical and cultural challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-f145b883ac478262464508348762b5f720230628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K1-1361-JC5B-G335-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><timeReceived>11:56 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 28, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Hydrofaction biocrude can be used directly or upgraded for use as a renewable marine, diesel, or aviation fuel. <br/>The MOU formalizes the intent of Invest Alberta and Steeper to realize the development of a first-of-its-kind Hydrofaction commercial plant in Alberta. Invest Alberta will provide Steeper with support to build connections with project stakeholders, optimize potential incentives, advise regarding regulatory requirements, and communicate the impact that this project will have on Alberta's ever-expanding renewable energy landscape. It is anticipated that the project will spur economic growth, create high-quality and sustainable job opportunities within local and Indigenous communities, and further diversify Alberta's renewable technologies sector, reinforcing its status as a global innovation hub. <br/>Steeper's first commercial plant will focus on the use of third generation biomass, which is the most prolifically available on the planet and includes wastes that have no or little commercial value, are not used as a food, and do not displace food-growing land. Examples of this are non-commercial forestry waste such as treetops, limbs, bark and sawdust, bagasse (sugar-cane waste) the biogenic portion of urban waste, and corn stover (all the non-kernel portion of corn production). In Alberta, Steeper's first plant will specifically focus on the large volumes of forestry waste that would otherwise need to be burned to manage forest fire risk. <br/>Steeper is actively identifying potential commercial partners and evaluating sites for construction of this project. This MOU aligns with efforts already underway in relation to activity under Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) where Steeper was awarded $5 million in funding in 2021 focused on establishing a first commercial scale plant in Alberta. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://steeperenergy.com/steeper-energy-collaborates-with-invest-alberta\">https://steeperenergy.com/steeper-energy-collaborates-with-invest-alberta</url>/ </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2023/04/19/steeper-energy-signs-mou-with-invest-alberta-to-commercialize-hydrofaction-tech/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BIOF100626168195307018725876100091</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIOF-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6826-GB31-F03R-N2M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"417\"/><timeReceived>1:11 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

She'll head SFU's Fire and Ecosystems Research Lab, where researchers will study wildfire behaviour and impacts and the conditions that fuel them, including the importance and management of peatlands (bogs, fens and swamps).</p><p>\"The effects of climate change are a contributing factor to this record-breaking wildfire season and now more than ever, there is a need for scientists to work with community partners to understand and mitigate the impacts,\" says Wilkinson. \"The creation of this new Fire and Ecosystems Research Lab responds to the need to study and apply up-to-date knowledge for the protection of our ecosystems and communities.\"</p><p>As head of SFU's Fire and Ecosystems Research Lab, Wilkinson and her group are developing ecosystem management strategies that reduce the negative impacts fire can have on all aspects of the environment and society.</p><p>She applies an interdisciplinary approach to her research by incorporating field assessments and experimental fires with remote sensing and ecological modelling to understand the resilience of ecosystems to wildfire.</p><p>Her expertise as a wildfire and ecosystem scientist is timely, given major fire activity across the country, resulting in lost properties and continuous evacuation alerts and orders. The resulting smoke has caused weeks of poor air quality in Canada and the U.S.</p><p>Wilkinson's current research includes understanding patterns of wildfire severity and identifying ecological tipping points to high-severity fire in boreal lowlands and mountain pine beetle-attacked forests of western Canada.</p><p>Wilkinson, a former NSERC post-doctoral fellow with the University of Toronto's School of Forestry FireLab, is also collaborating with the Canadian Forest Service, Provincial Parks and resource and land managers from various industries. She is responsible for developing a new fuel moisture index for the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System and plans to continue translating academic research findings into actionable management solutions in Canada and internationally.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Recent research:</p><p>One of her most recent papers, published in Nature, Climate Change finds that wildfires reduce the ability of pristine northern peatlands to store carbon, a greenhouse gas, by 35 per cent and enhance emissions from degraded peatlands by 10 per cent.</p><p>The study finds that the impacts of climate change will accelerate carbon losses from peatlands, noting that projected increases in burn severity and burn rate will reduce the carbon sink capacity of northern peatlands by up to 65 per cent by 2100.</p><p>Her most recent work, published in Environmental Research highlights the role peatlands play in also storing toxic metals and metalloids such as lead, arsenic, and mercury and risks to human health of wildfires releasing these pollutants into the atmosphere.</p><p>The study suggests there is an urgent need to focus policy and research on reversing peatland degradation \"that also minimizes future risks for environmental and human health exposure to the toxic environmental legacy held within global peatlands.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Nature Climate Change <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01657-w\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01657-w</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2023/07/wildfire---ecosystem-scientist-leads-new-research-group-at-sfu.html\">https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2023/07/wildfire---ecosystem-scientist-leads-new-research-group-at-sfu.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8214549 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8214549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68P5-M3Y1-DYG2-R0CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 13, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The American space agency said satellite imagery from Monday showed smoke extending across the North Atlantic Ocean to the Iberian Peninsula, France and other parts of western Europe.</p><p>There are 490 fires burning nationally, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency is reporting 110 active fires.</p><p>Canada has already surpassed the record for area burned. Nearly every province in Canada has fires burning.

The associated costs due to required increases in staffing and resources were deferred in the 202123 biennium by a one-time offset of $15 million for both public and private landowners. ODF's 202325 budget, as approved by the state legislature, does not include the offset.</p><p>The Labor Day wildfires of 2020 demonstrated the state's vulnerability to catastrophic wildfires. In response, the 2021 Legislature passed Senate Bill 762 adding wildfire response capacity and preparedness programs to benefit Oregonians.</p><p>Senate Bill 762 directed the Oregon Department of Forestry to create new programs and increase capacity for adequate protection of public and private forestland and rangeland. The cost for increased capacity is shared between public and private landowners through Forest Patrol Assessments. Private landowner rates are provided to county tax assessors July 1 for inclusion in property tax rolls.</p><p>Landowners pay a per-acre assessment to help fund wildfire suppression. To alleviate the initial financial increase to forest patrol assessments, SB 762, passed by the 2021 Legislature, included a one-time offset in the amount of $15 million. This offset was intended to mitigate a sharp increase from previous landowner rates to the new rates that were created by expansion of wildfire capacity in SB 762.</p><p>An extension of the landowner offset was considered during the 2023 legislative session. However, the extension ultimately did not make it into ODF's budget. As a result, the fiscal-year 2024 Forest Patrol Assessments will be provided to county assessors for inclusion in county property tax rolls. Those assessments include the increased costs for fire protection required by law, but without the one-time financial assistance for landowners provided in the 202123 biennium.</p><p>In response, Senator Steiner sent a letter to Republican legislative leadership stating her commitment to seeking solutions to this cost burden for the 2024 legislative session. Click here for that letter. In it, Senator Steiner writes:</p><p>\"After consulting with partners and interests closely involved with these issues, we have committed to convening a workgroup to propose revisions in the assessment and harvest tax structure to better address the cost of grazing and forest fire protection in ways that consider proportionate contributions from various stakeholders.\"</p><p>This legislative workgroup convened by Senator Steiner, in coordination with the Governor's Office, will work to bring potential landowner rate relief and concepts to restructure wildfire funding to the 2024 Legislature. If landowner offsets are again funded by the 2024 Legislature, it will be applied to fiscal year 2025 Forest Patrol Assessments, reducing the per-acre charge in the second year of the biennium.</p><p>An updated funding structure is necessary to address the increasing severity of Oregon's wildfires. ODF protects approximately 16.2 million acres of public and private forestland and rangeland, and hotter and dryer climate conditions require ever-increasing demands on wildfire firefighting resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125996370</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K0-WFN1-DYTH-G1T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 28, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

DEQ air sampling data is part of the AirNow partnership.</p><p>The wildfire season in Canada has been the worst on record. Nearly 6,000 fires this summer have blackened an estimated 38 million acres -- equivalent to about 60,000 square miles. As a comparison, North Dakota comprises about 69,000 square miles. More than 1,000 fires were burning north of the border on Tuesday, with nearly 700 of them considered to be out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>The fires have impacted air quality across North Dakota several times this summer. The latest southward sweep of smoke over the state began late Monday\u00a0and was expected to ease by Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Windy conditions were expected Wednesday, along with showers and potential thunderstorms in the evening impacting western and central North Dakota, forecasters said.</p><p>Wildfire smoke is particularly dangerous because it contains tiny particulate matter, the tiniest of pollutants. When inhaled, it can move deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources including the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires. Such smoke has been linked to several health complications including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.</p><p>People reacting to smoke to the extent that it affects breathing should seek immediate help from a medical provider, according to DEQ. General health-related smoke questions can be directed to the Health and Human Services Operating Center at 701-328-0707.</p><p>Information on wildfires and air quality is on the DEQ website, at\u00a0bit.ly/3OhrD7E. The EPA\u2019s map of fire and smoke conditions is at\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://fire.airnow.gov/\">https://fire.airnow.gov/</url>. The AirNow mobile phone app, and many other weather apps, also include air quality information. Wildfire smoke pattern predictions can be found at\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current/\">https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current/</url>.</p><p>Holiday weekend</p><p>An early look at the Labor Day holiday weekend forecast shows a good chance of abnormally hot weather in the Bismarck-Mandan region.</p><p>The weather service forecast calls for sunny skies and high temperatures in the lower 90s on Saturday and Sunday, with highs in the 80s on Labor Day Monday along with mostly sunny skies. There is a 30% chance of showers Sunday night and Monday.</p><p>Normal high temps for the Labor Day period in the capital city are in the upper 70s, according to weather service data.</p><p>The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map shows more than half of North Dakota in some form of drought -- double the area three months ago -- with nearly one-third of the state in either moderate or severe drought, up from less than 7% at the end of spring. But Burleigh and Morton counties remain out of any drought category.</p><p>North Dakota as a whole has been drying out as summer progresses, however. Topsoil moisture supplies statewide are rated 50% adequate to surplus; 47% of subsoil moisture supplies are in those categories, according to the latest\u00a0crop report\u00a0from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. That compares with 82% and 77%, respectively, at the end of May.</p><p>Pasture and range conditions statewide are rated 49% good to excellent, compared with 65% at the beginning of summer.</p><p>The U.S. Drought Monitor is a partnership of NOAA, the National Drought Mitigation Center and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-10766358</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692F-21V1-JCM7-R00T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 30, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NATIONAL OCEANIC &amp;

According to news reporting out of Kastamonu University by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The main purpose of the study is to examine the impact of drastic and proactive forest fire interventions, which are applied to avoid the risk of loss of life and property close to urban areas, on the continuity of plant species with fire-adapted characters and the potential to cause species loss.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Kastamonu University: \"In this context, the basic assumption of the study is that the reduced frequency of fires caused by suppressed fires in natural areas in order to avoid the risk of forest fires that may affect residential areas, will lead to the reduction of various plant species that sustain their lives thanks to their fire-adaptive characters. As a qualitative data analysis method, the rates of urban and forest areas, the number of forest fires, the amount of burned area and plant species diversity data were used to deal with the study data with document analysis. In the selection of the 10 metropolitan cities that constitute the sample area of the study, the criteria of being in the Mediterranean ecosystem, containing plant species adapted to fire, and being metropolitan (where natural and built environment elements are intertwined) were taken as basis.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The study will create an ecological perspective in fire prevention policies and strategies to be developed through the determination of plant species characteristics in large cities located in the fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystem.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Urbanization of Forest Fires: An Evaluation on Metropolitan Forest Fires in The Mediterranean Ecosystem.

Any fires that start may spread rapidly and become difficult to extinguish.</p><p>In Connecticut, the red flag warning was issued for Hartford, Tolland, and Windham counties. It was also issued for all of Rhode Island, and Massachusetts from the east slopes of the Berkshires east through the remainder of the state, for locations where a snow pack no longer exists.</p><p>Connecticut traditionally experiences high forest fire danger in the Spring from mid-March through May. High winds during this time dry surface fuels and can drive fire to spread quickly.</p><p>Weve had a busy start to the Spring fire season, with several brush fires breaking out around the state in the past few days. DEEP Forestry and Parks staff were called to assist local fire departments on two separate fires yesterday, in Southbury and Meriden. The Southbury fire was about 30 acres in size as of Friday evening. Both fires were contained Friday evening, and DEEP staff have returned to both sites today to monitor conditions and assist local fire personnel as needed.</p><p>DEEP's Division of Forestry constantly monitors the danger of forest fire to help protect Connecticut's 1.8 million acres of forested land. Throughout the Spring forest fire season, DEEP sends daily advisories on forest fire danger levels to DEEP's state park forest field staff, municipalities, fire departments and the media. Forest fire danger levels are classified at low, moderate, high, very high or extreme. In an average year approximately 500 acres of Connecticut woodland are burned by forest fires. You can sign up to receive the daily Forest Fire Danger Report here.</p><p>Its especially important to exercise caution during these periods when forest fire danger levels increase. Its important to obey local laws regarding open fires, carefully dispose of hot charcoal, and completely extinguish smoking materials.

The strike might have been intended for the city's airfield, officials said.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the facilities of aircraft engine manufacturer Motor Sich in the Zaporizhzhia region had also come under attack.</p><p>The Russian barrage followed a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian tanker in the Black Sea near Crimea late Friday. Ukraine also struck a major Russian port with drones earlier the same day.</p><p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned what she called a Ukrainian \"terrorist attack\" on a civilian vessel in the Kerch Strait.</p><p>\"There can be no justification for such barbaric actions, they will not go unanswered and their authors and perpetrators will inevitably be punished,\" she posted on the Telegram messaging app.</p><p>An official with Ukraine's Security Service confirmed to The Associated Press that a Ukrainian drone packed with nearly 1,000 pounds of explosives struck the tanker that was transporting fuel for Russian forces. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>Russia's Federal Agency for Marine and River Transport posted on Telegram that although the drone blasted a hole in the tanker's engine room, there were no casualties among the 11 crew members. On Sunday, a Ukrainian missile hit the Chonhar bridge connecting the Russian-occupied Kherson region and northern Crimea, causing minor damage to the span's roadway, said Vladimir Saldo, the Moscow-installed leader of the Kherson region. He also said several more rockets had been shot down by air defense forces.</p><p>The bridge, which is one of three key spans connecting the Crimean Peninsula to the mainland, was previously attacked on July 22 and July 29.</p><p>Two of the six killed overnight occurred during a Russian airstrike in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, according to the head of the local regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov. Four others were injured.</p><p>Zelenskyy said a guided bomb had hit a blood transfusion center in the area's Kupyan district late on Saturday.</p><p>\"This war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. \"Defeating terrorists is a matter of honor for everyone who values life.\"</p><p>Heavy shelling continued along the front line in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv continued its ongoing counteroffensive. Elsewhere in the Kharkiv region, a 58-year-old woman was killed and a 66-year-old man was wounded after Russian shelling of the village of Podoly, an official said. In Ukraine's eastern Kupyan region, Russian missiles injured a 55-year-old man and ignited a forest fire, officials said on social media. Russian attacks in the Donetsk region villages of Torske and Niu-York killed two people, local Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on social media.</p><p>Ukrainian shelling in Russian-held Donetsk killed a woman in her 80s, Moscow-appointed Mayor Alexei Kulemzin said. The shelling also set the main building of a university on fire, according to Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-installed head of the illegally annexed region.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-5257614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68WN-7HX1-DYWP-82W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Scott announced today.</p><p>The fire, known as the \"Way Fire,\" ignited on August 18, 2014, in the community of Wofford Heights in Kern County. The United States alleges that the fire ignited when, as a result of SoCal Edison's negligence, an insulator broke free from its pin on the cross arm of a SoCal Edison power pole, allowing the conductor to come into contact with another conductor.</p><p>\"This settlement goes a long way toward compensating the public for the damage to public lands caused by the fire and the expense of fighting the Way Fire,\" U.S. Attorney Scott said. \"This office will continue to pursue recovery against those whose carelessness results in fires that place public lands and communities at risk and require public funds to suppress.\"</p><p>\"I'm pleased that this issue was resolved in a positive manner for our agency,\" Randy Moore, Regional Forester for the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region. \"A lot of time and resources go into both fighting fires and cost recovery, and recouping these costs is important.\"</p><p>Since 2012, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California has secured settlements in more than 25 different cases involving wildfire damage to federal lands, with settlements valued at nearly $200 million.</p><p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Vincente A.

This remote tower can only be reached by a dirt fire road. Visitors are welcome at High Point but are not permitted in the tower.</p><p>Boucher Lookout is a 30-foot wooden tower, located at 5,438 feet in Palomar Mountain State Park. It offers commanding views to the south, west and north to Lake Elsinore. On a clear day, you can see Catalina and San Clemente islands and ships at sea. When operational, the public can visit.</p><p>On this late July day at High Point, tropical moisture from Mexico was bringing afternoon thunderstorms to the desert and mountains. My quiet summer day had now become tense.</p><p>Perched in the 13-by-13-foot all-steel cab, on top of a 70-foot metal tower on one of our highest mountains, can be an exciting place in the middle of a thunderstorm, especially when the lightning starts dancing.</p><p>And it was getting close.</p><p>The flash of lightning and roar of thunder were seconds apart. The tower was swaying in the wind and now rain was pouring from the metal roof. As a safety measure, I had turned off radios and I was standing on a wooden stool that has glass insulators on the legs that offers protection should lightning strike the tower.</p><p>I was focused on recording the location of down strikes since those locations will be closely watched for smoldering fires that might erupt when things dry out.</p><p>That's easy to do when a lightning bolt hits several miles away. It's a bit harder when lightning and thunder are simultaneous, meaning it's hitting where you are.</p><p>While this was one of the more exciting days in the tower, many lookout shifts are a peaceful, daylong sit-and-see visit with nature.</p><p>A typical day in the tower starts with check-in by radio with the fire dispatch center, taking weather recordings and reviewing previous logs for any important information.</p><p>Throughout the day, however, lookouts are constantly scanning the landscape for any hint of smoke. Early detection is critical so aircraft and fire equipment can be dispatched as quickly as possible.</p><p>Lookouts also spend a lot of time watching nature. It's common to see hawks or eagles soaring around the towers, flocks of bluebirds, woodpeckers, or a covey of quail.</p><p>Deer, foxes, bobcats and even a mountain lion may wander past the tower, oblivious to the lookout watching from above.</p><p>The silence of the forest might be interrupted with a siren salute from a passing law enforcement helicopter, or a wing waggle from firefighting aircraft passing en route to a fire.</p><p>It's fascinating to watch weather develop through a bird's eye view from the top of a mountain. Tiny clouds on the distant skyline can slowly grow into towering thunderheads, or a rain squall moving in from the coast directed by the whim of the wind.</p><p>Lookouts work only during the day, but many will occasionally spend the night at High Point because of the remote access.</p><p>Sunrises and sunsets are spectacular, especially early and late in the season when cold and warm weather fronts clash creating layers of clouds, fog and mist.</p><p>On nights when a marine layer brings in a blanket of valley fog, the heavenly view from the tower is spectacular with a sparkling Milky Way painted on an inky sky, or the occasional bright meteor flash.</p><p>Being a volunteer fire lookout is mostly a calm and relaxing activity, punctuated by moments of frenzy when  smoke is spotted.</p><p>That's when you spring into action, using the Osborne fire finder to plot bearing and estimated distance so this information can be radioed to dispatch.</p><p>In the meantime, lookouts are part of a long tradition of service by people who care about our wild places.</p><p>A day in a fire lookout tower gives you an intimate look at the cycles of weather, plants, birds and wildlife that, in a sense, lookouts are protecting.</p><p>The Forest Fire Lookout Association is always looking for interested volunteers to work in the towers. Training includes three days of classroom instruction and three shifts in each tower to become certified.</p><p>If you are interested, visit ffla-sandiego.org.</p><p>Maybe I'll see you in the penthouse.</p><p>Cowan is a freelance columnist.

The multi-year project aims to address the unique challenges faced by public and private forested lands in the area, according to Sean Johnson, NRCS District Conservationist in Flathead County. These challenges include wildfire risk, forest health issues, invasive species, habitat fragmentation, and the protection of water resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This was a multi-year process of revisions and drafts trying to get this thing off the ground and funded and we were able to do that last year,\" Johnson says, \"and it's really cool to see the whole thing take place.\"</p><p>By promoting sustainable land management practices under the expert guidance of the NRCS, the partnership helps private landowners contribute to the overall health and ecological integrity of the forested landscapes in the region. All while the Forest Service and other partners work toward the same objectives on public lands.</p><p>\"The goals we share with other land managers is a healthy, resilient forest for multiple uses,\" says Forest Fire Prevention Officer for the Flathead National Forest, Mike West.</p><p>West previously served as the Assistant Fire Management Officer for Fuel Reduction on the Tally Lake Ranger District of the Flathead. These days, he works closely with his Joint Chief's NRCS counterpart, Johnson, to make a landscape-scale difference by treating forests across land ownerships.</p><p>Joint Chiefs' is a partnership primarily between the NRCS and Forest Service, which are both housed under the USDA, that began in 2014. Other partners on this project include the State of Montana, Flathead County, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and numerous private and public stakeholders.</p><p>There are currently more than 40 active projects as part of the Joint Chief's program running across the country, with the muti-year project in Flathead National Forest being one of them.</p><p>According to West, the Forest Service's relationship with the NRCS began through their local Firesafe Flathead group.</p><p>\"When Sean Johnson got here as the District Conservationist, he actually sought us out as a group, which is a lot of different folks the Forest Service, the County, the State of Montana, NRCS, a bunch of homeowners associations, and different fire departments.\"</p><p>Working together made a lot of sense, according to West, \"Because there's not only a lot of work to do on the forest itself, but also a lot of public land interest in doing forest health and fuel reduction projects.\"</p><p>Implementing a Landscape-Scale Approach</p><p>One of the key aspects of the partnership is working with private landowners in the vicinity of public forested lands. The area is characterized by a mix of private and public lands, with many landowners having properties that adjoin or are near the Flathead National Forest. By engaging these private landowners, the partnership can foster a landscape-scale approach to conservation and restoration, ensuring that the benefits extend beyond public lands.</p><p>\"To work across boundaries where you have three or four different private landowners, industry landowners, and the National Forest,\" says West, \"it takes a lot of work and relationships to explain to everybody why it's important to reach a common goal.\"</p><p>West and the Forest Service bring valuable expertise in forest management and conservation planning to the partnership. Their involvement ensures the restoration efforts align with the goals and objectives of the Flathead National Forest, while also considering the needs and priorities of local communities.</p><p>The joint efforts of the NRCS and the Forest Service not only aim to restore and conserve forest ecosystems, but also contribute to the overall well-being of the community. Healthy forests provide numerous benefits, including clean air and water, recreational opportunities, and support for local economies through tourism, outdoor activities, and wood products.</p><p>Keeping the Public Safe</p><p>Another key aspect of the project is public safety. The location of the project being on the west side of the Flathead Valley plays a role in how the Forest Service and NRCS are approaching the project because large fires tend to move from west to east.</p><p>\"Being right here in the wildland urban interface with the prevailing wind direction, these treatments we're doing and connecting all these fuel breaks is very important,\" says West. \"If we have a large fire coming off the National Forest and into the town, it will either allow us a chance to manage the fire or hopefully stop it. Or if not, modify the fire intensity to where we just have a less intense fire coming into where people's home are.\"</p><p>Since the project started, West says they have already connected over 20 miles of fuel breaks across the National Forest and multiple ownerships all in an effort to reduce and mitigate wildfire threats.</p><p>\"Being able to do that work in advance of a wildfire is a lot less stressful and safer because we're not trying to complete that work in a rushed fashion with a fire bearing down on us,\" he says. \"It's a lot easier and safer to do that work on the front end.\"</p><p>West explains firefighters could find themselves having to deal with 20 to 40 and even 100-foot flame lengths rather than the much more desirable 4-footh lengths achievable by putting in the fuel treatments. Not only is this a better fire behavior to deal with during an event, but also one that leaves much less negative after-effect on the land itself.</p><p>Having in-place fuel treatments means less chance of tree torching which creates embers that lead to spot fires.</p><p>\"Post-fire we're much more likely to have a healthy, intact, functioning forest environment instead of a stand replacement like a wildfire where we would lose the majority of overstory trees,\" says West.</p><p>Improving the Land and Changing Minds</p><p>Just a year into the project, West, just like Johnson, is already starting to see changes. \"And not just the vegetation that we're managing,\" he says.</p><p>He points out the amount of interest the work is garnering from more private landowners and other partners is growing and that's a good thing.</p><p>\"When they see the end result of the work, they recognize that 'wow, that does look nice and I do see how that can make a difference',\" he says. \"I think being able to put enough work out there that's square in the public's eye and to be able to tell the story helps a lot because it gets more folks interested in doing other work.\"</p><p>Beyond the local presence, they've caught the attention of policy and decision makers, too.</p><p>\"We've also received Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding in addition to our Joint Chief's allocation which was super helpful,\" says West. Effectively linking two preplanned road constructions through these interconnected fuel breaks has provided firefighters and the public multiple access routes, enhancing safety and accessibility.</p><p>The project is an example of a collaborative conservation effort that preserves forested lands. By working together, West and Johnson are more effectively addressing wildfires and other forest health issues.

That's well above the 10-year average of about 805,000 hectares. The previous record of 7.6 million hectares was set in 1989.<br/>\"Through July, expected warm and dry conditions will increase wildfire risk from British Columbia and the Yukon across the country right to Western Labrador,\" Michael Norton, director general of the Northern Forestry Centre at the Canadian Forest Service, said in a briefing. The area at risk is expected to shrink only slightly in August. \"It is anticipated that many parts of Canada will continue to see above normal fire activity,\" said Norton.<br/>There are currently 639 active fires in Canada, of which more than half are out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Weather patterns across North America have carried the smoke into some of the largest U.S. cities, including New York, triggering weeks of air quality alerts, jeopardizing residents' health and leading to flight cancellations and delays at some of the continent's largest airports.<br/>Marie-\u00c8ve H\u00e9roux, an air quality assessment manager with Health Canada, said in the briefing that seniors, pregnant people, young children and those who spend a lot of time outdoors or have existing health conditions are particularly at risk from exposure to wildfire smoke. \"But in general, everyone's health is potentially at risk, especially when concentrations of pollutants are high and the exposure lasts for a considerable amount of time.\"<br/>Climate change has helped create the perfect conditions for fires to start and spread. The world is experiencing record temperatures, with heat waves scorching China, India, the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. in recent weeks. The onset of El Ni\u00f1o conditions is likely to exacerbate the trend, although it's not expected to affect Canada until late 2023 or early 2024.<br/>However, abnormally hot weather on the west coast right now, extending into the Northwest Territories, may increase the risk of fires in Canada's Arctic. Some fires are already burning inside the Arctic Circle.<br/>\"The heat warnings are out in parts of BC and the Northwest Territories, and we do see that continuing for the foreseeable future with very extreme or anomalous heat in both Yukon and NWT and even a lot of the western parts of Nunavut,\" said Armel Castellan, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.<br/>As the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes shrinks, the jet stream slows and meanders more. That creates high pressure zones - blocking highs - that sit in one place, forcing weather systems to go around them, said Thomas Smith, associate professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8242037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68N4-4YJ1-DY7P-P1YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Columbian Publishing Co.

He was one of 16 researchers who collaborated on the analysis for World Weather Attribution, an initiative that aims to quickly evaluate the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events.<br/>Canada is in the middle of its worst wildfire season on record, with more than 5,800 fires burning over 59,000 square miles from one end of the country to the other, according the the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In Quebec alone, more than 20,000 square miles has burned so far this year - an area 176 times larger than all of last year.<br/>Though the analysis looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, \"and we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,\" Boulanger said.<br/>Ongoing wildfires have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.<br/>The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index - which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation - averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely.<br/>They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely.<br/>Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year's fire season would have occurred with or without climate change.<br/>\"To me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,\" said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. \"It's not just 10 percent more likely or 20 percent - there's a 600 percent\" greater likelihood.<br/>Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn't capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia.<br/>\"I've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time ... and fire season is not over yet,\" he said.<br/>Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 08-26 B6 Canadian Wildfires-Clima_B06<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8262031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691J-R091-JBSN-03S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Columbian Publishing Co.

Reforms to the judicial nomination and judicial discipline process.</p><p>Taxation: Address the issue of property taxes adversely impacted via the removal of Gallagher. (Tax Amnesty or Tax Forgiveness)</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>STIVER:</p><p>Taxes: The removal of Gallagher was not effectively addressed. Residents should have TAX AMNESTY, or TAX FORGIVENESS to account for the sudden marked increase in property taxes.</p><p>Rules and Regulations: Colorado is currently one of the MOST HEAVILY REGULATED states in the nation. If not the MOST HEAVILY REGULATED. (See 1a above). Title 24 clearly states that it is not the intent of the General Assembly to prohibit any individual or business from operating in the state of Colorado or earning income. If that is the WILL and INTENT of the General Assembly? Then why is the General Assembly routinely ignoring it? Each piece of legislation should be accompanied by two documents: 1) Fiscal Note (Cost to Government) and 2) Economic Impact Statement (Cost to individuals and businesses).</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>STIVER: First, it is not the role of government to provide housing. Case in Point: Cabrini-Green (Chicago), Concordia Place (Chicago), Techwood Homes (Atlanta), New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), etc. Many of the government run properties are in a state of disrepair. Instead of housing assistance, how about regulatory relief for builders to construct homes? In the interim, rental assistance programs might provide a level of relief until taxation and regulatory reforms can be implemented.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>STIVER: NONE. At his State of the State Address, Gov. Polis indicated that his office had completed 84% of his energy and climate change goals. Oddly, this was done via VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE by individuals and businesses. NOT GOVERNMENT REGULATION. Such as the attempt to kill the oil and gas drilling in Colorado via <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-159\">Senate Bill 24-159.

Allow the free markets and free enterprise system to grow and prosper. Reduce taxation and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>STIVER: ABSOLUTELY. The removal of Gallagher is having an adverse effect on Colorado property owners. Those hurt the most are the low income and elderly. <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">Senate Bill 24-233 is akin to placing a Band-Aid on a hemorrhaging wound. A TAX DEFERRAL PROGRAM is ZERO TAX RELIEF at all. It merely delays the inevitable and property owners will be faced with an increased tax liability DOWN THE ROAD. With the removal of Gallagher, property owners experienced an increase in their property tax of 20-40%. </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233 merely provides property assessment rate decreases of approximately 2% per annum.</url></p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>STIVER: The Democrat Party enjoys a 46-19 margin. The largest in Colorado history. However, if the members of the Majority Party functioned under the concept of TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY? Every single vote would be 46-19. However, that is not the case. That said, a wise person would determine those pieces of legislation where they can find support. Republicans can no longer blame their ineffectiveness on the Democrat majority. Case in point? <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1212\">HB19-1212 was sponsored by the Democrats, amended by the Democrats, and vetoed by Gov. Polis. How was that possible? The SUNSET AUDIT REPORT. Ninety percent of the dance is showing up. When it comes to the Sunset Audit and Review hearings by the various bureaus, departments, and agencies? The Republican delegation, it has been my experience, is ABSENT.

It is currently represented by Republican Sen. Bob Gardner, who won in 2020 with 58% of the vote. </p><p>Cuva did not return a response.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>VANDERWERF: My top priorities are public safety, infrastructure, and economic health. Solutions for these issues benefit many other areas of our community, and each requires a legislative commitment to getting it right.</p><p>Attainable housing is part of the safety and security that families deserve, as is a commitment to supporting empowered and accountable law enforcement. We must secure well-maintained roads and efficient transportation for people to reach their daily activities in work and recreation. Good schools depend on a healthy economy for a tax base, and equip our future workforce. And on that note, we must strive to mitigate the tax (including inflation) and regulatory burden that government imposes on business in order to improve both supply and demand for goods and services, lest we face capital flight that adversely impacts all of the above aspects.</p><p>A legislature focused on the proper implementation of law \u2014 in purpose and mechanics \u2014 can reduce crime and regulatory burdens alike. One example is school choice as competition delivers innovation. Educators need to teach a better blend of civics, traditional subjects, and life and business skills.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>VANDERWERF: I've been knocking on doors recently, and observed that illegal immigration is the voters' top concern. I would begin by pushing to repeal the state law preventing law enforcement from coordinating with ICE. County sheriffs may work with the FBI or any other federal law enforcement agency they choose. Why not ICE?</p><p>In addition to legislative approaches, I would encourage our federal partners to 1) secure the border, 2) abide by the laws enacted by Congress, and 3) enact immigration reform. Let me clarify that securing the border doesn't mean closing the dozens of legal entry points into the U.S.; it simply means that we deter the illegal use of everywhere else on the border.</p><p>Our current immigration laws can't keep up with those interested in coming to the U.S. so we need federal immigration reform. Nonetheless, we must have laws in place that vet applicants to enter our country before they do so. We are a nation of immigrants, and we appreciate the desire of anyone to better their lives. Many immigrants are hard workers, and we have a lot of unfilled jobs. But we need to make sure that criminals and terrorists do not enter the country.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>VANDERWERF: Land use planning has traditionally been a power kept in the hands of local governments because local land use conditions are highly variable in terms of water availability, expansive soils, proximity to fire risk, differences between mountain and prairie terrain, and many other factors.</p><p>While state government has a role to play, there has clearly been overreach. A one-size-fits-all legislative approach creates winners and losers. For instance, a recently passed Colorado law forces Colorado Springs to pursue denser development around its I-25 corridor. This corridor is less than a mile from some dense forests and only a few miles from the Pike National Forest, an area with high fire risk, a condition not found in Denver. As evidenced by the Waldo Canyon Fire of 2012, forced density from this law will increase fire risk. Unfortunately, legislators (and their unelected advisors) in Denver did not take into account local conditions with this law and created a 'one-size-fits-all' mistake.</p><p>The state should protect personal property rights, a key function of government. If a land owner wants to develop, that needs to be respected, so long as they abide by local code that is sensitive to local conditions.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>VANDERWERF: 'Climate change' is a highly politicized term. A better question for framing this discussion is: 'What is the state's role in protecting the environment?' I am an expedition mountaineer and know the value of a healthy environment.</p><p>The state does have a role in protecting the environment. Much has already been done nationally and locally over the decades but, as always, our work is not complete. However, everything MUST be in balance, including the health of our economy. I believe in protecting our environment including air, land, and water. To do this, public policy must be both truthful and resilient and not be shut down unless you abide by one answer.</p><p>I have broad policy experience in this area including acting as treasurer of the Fountain Creek Watershed District Board. We work all the time on water availability and quality for farmers and residents in the Arkansas River basin. I've also worked with the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments on ozone issues. And I support a balanced approach to energy production, including the expansion of nuclear power.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>VANDERWERF: Government action often gets in the way of a markets which need competition and less regulations to resolve cost of living concerns. Costs are up, housing is up, inflation is up, and since 2018, our state Legislature has passed many laws contributing to our increased cost of living. We are now one of the most expensive states to live in.</p><p>As senator, I will work to address cost of living concerns by freeing up our citizen's ingenuity and markets through less and more efficient regulation. There is potential and I will mention a few. First, we need construction defect policy reform to grow the multifamily housing market. We need senior exemption portability so citizens can downsize thus freeing up larger homes for large families. We should increase our energy supply by all available means, as energy costs are a main driver of inflation. We need to support job training as higher wages also make living more affordable. We need to support ranchers and farmers so they can increase yields. Likewise, we must reverse the state's bias towards overregulation which makes everything more expensive. I look forward to the opportunity to work on these important issues for every Colorado citizen!</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>VANDERWERF: While I will likely support a tax cut ballot initiative, we MUST also reduce the cost of state operations and the burden it places on people and businesses. With my industrial engineering degree and experience in operations research, I am uniquely qualified to help reduce costs and increase efficiencies.</p><p>We often forget the highest purpose of government is to protect citizen rights. Public safety policy protects life, liberty, and property. Infrastructure aids efficient movement of people and goods for work and recreation. Despite this obvious purpose, our state government's massive growth places upward pressure to retain or increase taxes and 'fees' in opposition to TABOR and good sense. We need to go back to basics and use good policy design to make our state government and economy more efficient. I helped lead efforts in El Paso County to do exactly this. Our county has grown a lot in population and yet we increased services, increased fund reserves, recapitalized our road repair fleet, added new parks, innovated, never raised taxes, and still reduced the number of our employees by 200. We used common sense answers to make El Paso County better. I'll bring these common sense solutions to state government.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>VANDERWERF: There are many issues citizens want their legislators to tackle. I have experience and skills to assist with all of them. And I believe deeply in the civility, statesmanship and diplomacy necessary to build coalitions around good ideas.</p><p>Citizen comments from your website touched on many issues, from immigration and high prices to citizens' rights and rural Coloradans' voices. There were also structural concerns like legislator engagement, political civility, and concerns about the general integrity of our Republic.</p><p>I think civility is the overall concern with this question. Working with all legislators is necessary, and it's what our Founding Fathers intended. I have a demonstrated record of bipartisan results. Gov. Polis appointed me to the state Board of Health. I worked with the attorney general to design policy responses to the opioid epidemic. I've also been trusted many times to brief Democrat and Republican federal officials on El Paso County citizens' needs. I have worked with many Democrat state legislators and some have even introduced amendments for me.</p><p>Despite our ideological disagreements, we have common interests. I will pursue statesmanship while adhering to my principles, and successfully advocate for common sense solutions that empower Coloradans to thrive.</p><p>Senate District 18 (Democratic)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judyforcolorado.com/\">Judy Amabile</url></p><p>Age: 66</p><p>City of residence: Boulder</p><p>Occupation: State representative, former owner and operator of Polar Bottle</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://jovitaschiffer.com/\">Jovita Schiffer</url></p><p>Age: 56</p><p>City of residence: Superior</p><p>Occupation: Extended learning and community programs manager</p><p>Senate District 18 is entirely within Boulder County and includes Louisville, Niwot, Paragon Estates and Superior. It is currently represented by Senate President Steve Fenberg, who won in 2020 with 83% of the vote.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>AMABILE:</p><p>Adequate treatment for people with serious mental illness. Too many people are suffering in our streets in homelessness, psychosis, and addiction. We have to create adequate infrastructure to stop this cycle before it starts. I passed a bill to consider involuntary care in the most extreme cases, similar to California's CARE courts. That study was recently completed. I plan to build on this progress through legislation in the Senate.</p><p>Climate action. I passed a bill in 2023 to study issues faced by oil and gas workers as Colorado transitions to clean energy. I want to pursue legislation based on that study in 2025. I also want to continue working to create greater resiliency for inevitable climate-driven challenges like fire disasters and drought. I have passed several insurance reform bills, and a bill to provide insurance options in communities where carriers have exited.</p><p>Housing availability and affordability. This session I passed a bill allowing more ADUs, and I supported the bill to increase density on transit corridors. I also supported protections for renters. If elected I will continue to work on policies to create more affordable housing.</p><p>SCHIFFER: We must simultaneously and comprehensively transform multiple systems to address the economic and social disparities at the root of many of our challenges in SD18. This transformation necessitates a shift in our legislative approach, moving away from singular policy priorities to a focus on policy outcomes that enhance the economic stability, fair treatment, and holistic well-being of all SD18 residents.</p><p>The outcomes-based priorities that will guide my decision on every bill that comes across my desk are:</p><p>Will this policy enhance economic security for everyone in SD18?</p><p>Will this policy be applied in a way that is fair for all SD18 constituents?</p><p>Will this policy create opportunities for physical, emotional, and mental well-being for everyone?</p><p>Specific policy priorities that are urgent and necessary for our communities and others across the state include enacting a ban on the sale, purchase, and transfer of assault weapons, removing the state prohibition on rent control in cities and counties, and acting on <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb23-1300\">HB23-1300's feasibility study to take advantage of new federal guidance that enables states to use Medicaid to pay for housing, food, climate-related supports (e.g., air conditioners), and other social determinants of health.</url></p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>AMABILE: Beyond the three priorities mentioned above, I believe District 18 voters are concerned about income inequality and the wealth gap. Boulder County includes people at every level of the economy, and many working families with kids are really struggling. I'm glad we took strong steps in the 2024 legislative session to help, passing bills to provide tax benefits and transfers to the most vulnerable: families with children, seniors, and people who are trying to gain a foothold on their housing situation. These new policies will make a big difference and cut child poverty by nearly half. Affordability is impacted by many interconnected issues. I have and will continue to work on policies that fundamentally address market conditions (like housing, health care, education, transportation, internet access, etc.) that create income inequality and make our state unaffordable, especially for low income earners.</p><p>SCHIFFER: The issues I hear most about from SD18 are the top concerns my family and the families I work with have faced in my 25 years in Boulder County: pollution and climate crisis impacts, housing affordability and homelessness, and access to affordable and culturally competent mental health treatment and prevention.</p><p>Prevention is vital to creating long-term solutions to housing and homelessness, climate disasters, and behavioral illness. We must focus as much on prevention as we focus on responses to these crises. Prevention means educating and resourcing individuals and businesses to prepare for climate-related disasters, keeping people housed so they don't become homeless in the first place, and addressing factors like lack of stable and affordable housing and healthcare that put all of us at risk for mental illness, especially our youth (e.g., poverty).</p><p>In recent years, we have seen locally how prevention-oriented programs can make a difference. For instance, Boulder's Wildfire Home Assessment Program educates homeowners on protecting their homes and communities. Similarly, the new Building Home peer support program gives formerly unhoused individuals the tools and support they need to stay housed. I will champion these types of initiatives that provide tangible solutions to our community's most pressing issues.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>AMABILE: Housing has become a matter of statewide concern because too many people cannot find an affordable place to live. The housing and land use policies that passed this year aim to strike a balance between what is good for many, and acceptable for most. I was proud to be the prime sponsor of the ADU bill.</p><p>SCHIFFER: All of our communities are dealing with the consequences of our state's failure to develop sufficient housing stock over the past 50 years: higher rates of homelessness, skyrocketing housing costs, and more families spending more than a third of their income on housing. Solutions do not look the same in each city or county across our state. We should give cities and counties the tools and support they need to help achieve statewide goals to create more affordable housing, including ending the statewide ban on rent control. We are in a housing crisis, and we need to enable cities and counties to innovate and problem-solve in a way that advances statewide goals while adapting to local needs. <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-174\">SB24-174 is on the right track by providing technical assistance, guidance, and incentives to enable local governments to identify housing needs, create action plans to meet them, and be accountable for progress on their plans through funding incentives. This state-supported, locally driven approach is precisely the type of problem-solving approach that leads to success: the state gives local communities the tools, resources, and flexibility to solve their problems locally while being held accountable for progress through incentives such as state grants.</url></p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>AMABILE: The state plays a crucial role in regulating and reducing carbon, encouraging a renewable energy economy, and creating greater resiliency against immediate and future climate change impacts. I was the prime sponsor in the House of 14 bills on climate resiliency and sustainability, energy and environment, including establishing the Office of Climate Sustainability, expanding solar rights for homeowners, insurance reform, grant funding for sustainable and resilient rebuilding, changes to plugging orphan wells, prohibiting counties from forced pooling and many more. I will continue to work hard on climate policies that get Colorado to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.</p><p>SCHIFFER: The state should be responsible for regulating the oil and gas corporations contributing to greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate local climate disasters and pollute our air. I was disappointed by the failure of the ban on new oil and gas drilling permits in the last session. As senator, I will support such bans. I understand that legislators and climate advocates sought a compromise with the oil and gas lobby. Their efforts will generate approximately $180M/year for public transit and environmental protection. However, it doesn't account for the cost to residents, cities, and counties of climate-related wildfires ($2B for the Marshall fire), floods ($715M for the 2013 floods), and the mitigation measures cities and counties are racing to put in place due to the escalating climate crisis. Nor does it account for the negative health impacts on Coloradans across the state who breathe some of the poorest air in the country. The climate crisis is worsening, and its initial economic impacts are already proving disastrous for our state. I will also advocate for extracting more money for climate mitigation efforts from the wealthy oil and gas companies that harm our health, put our communities at risk, and destroy our ecosystems.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>AMABILE: We took strong steps to decrease poverty, boost incomes, and support workers and families in Colorado, including an expansion of Colorado's earned income tax credit. The tax package we passed will return $450 million to all Coloradans and cut child poverty nearly in half by creating the Family Affordability Tax Credit, which will put $650 million directly into the pockets of hardworking families with children making under $85,000. Additional legislation will ensure tax credits for working families remain robust in years to come. These credits will return hundreds of millions of dollars to hardworking Coloradans, and include a significant tax credit for child care expenses.</p><p>We voted to return $40 million to Coloradans who provide essential services like child care, home health care, personal care, nursing care, or care for a family member. We also passed a bill to make it easier for seniors and Coloradans with disabilities to receive property tax, rent and heat assistance. We expanded the senior property tax exemption so seniors can keep the exemption even when they move.</p><p>Protecting workers is an important way to foster greater equity. I was the primary sponsor of a measure to crack down on businesses that violate child labor laws. We also passed legislation to increase transparency for gig workers.</p><p>SCHIFFER: In 2012, I lost my home to foreclosure. I went from a stable middle-class life to single parenthood, trying to create stability for my sons on a school district paycheck. What broke my heart most at the time was not losing my home; it was watching my children lose the only home they had ever known. Everyone should have a safe, stable place to call home, regardless of how much money they have. Corporate greed pushes Colorado families out of their homes and communities for profit. There are many ways to address cost-of-living. We need wages that keep up with housing costs and affordable healthcare for all, and every family needs access to high-quality care for elderly parents, children, or other family members who cannot care for themselves. We must end exclusionary housing practices, provide more funding for safety net programs such as emergency rental assistance and eviction protection, and fund policies such as low-interest loans for more people to move from renting to home-owning and the county-supported down payment assistance program that allowed me to repurchase a home in 2020. Funding for these programs should come via taxes on the investors and investment companies profiting from our housing markets.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>AMABILE: No.</p><p>SCHIFFER: No. I would only consider deeper property tax cuts when we have other ways to fund critical programs such as education, public transportation, and climate mitigation. The housing market is becoming a source of distress for more and more of us. Rent-backed securities, short-term rentals, and corporate landlords are driving up prices for everyone, leading to more homeowners needing help to keep up with property tax payments and at risk of losing their homes. We need to tax the groups who have turned our fundamental human right to housing into a tool for corporate profit, not homeowners struggling to keep up with higher and higher costs of food, energy, housing, healthcare, and other basic human needs.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>AMABILE: Absolutely. I am known for reaching across the aisle and much of the legislation I've passed in the General Assembly has earned bipartisan support. My style is both collaborative and tough. I am not afraid to take on difficult issues or take hard votes. I'm willing to stand up to my own caucus when I think that's the right thing to do.</p><p>SCHIFFER: Absolutely. Whatever side of the political aisle we are on, we all want stable and affordable housing, quality healthcare, clean air and water, healthy food, and communities where we and our families are safe and secure. Finding common ground is vital in policymaking to balance diverse perspectives and contribute to the legitimacy and acceptance of laws and policies. It also prevents gridlock and polarization, ensuring policymakers can adapt policies to meet the needs of a diverse state like Colorado. When policymakers with diverse perspectives pursue common ground, they bring us closer to a society that serves all of us rather than a select few. However, politicians must be steadfast in our commitment to not compromise on fundamental democratic values, such as freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and religion, equality and justice for all, free and fair elections, the peaceful transfer of power, and respecting and defending human rights.</p><p>What is one bill, vote or other legislative action you've taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?</p><p>AMABILE: <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1303\">HB22-1303, which directed $65 million in Federal ARPA dollars to increase capacity at the Colorado Mental Health Institute and create 125 new residential care beds statewide. It was a tough fight, and I'm glad I was successful. These resources are coming online now, and they will make a difference. We have a mental health crisis in our state. It is complicated and has developed insidiously over the decades. When I started in the General Assembly, most lawmakers couldn't seem to fathom why we have a homelessness problem, why our jails are overflowing with people who are mentally ill, or what we should do about it. I believe my work has helped change the conversation. Lawmakers are now working with more clarity and urgency to address inadequate care. We have a long way to go and I want to build on these wins in the Senate.</url></p><p>You are running against a current state lawmaker. Are there any votes they have taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?</p><p>SCHIFFER: Yes. I am running for an open Senate seat. My opponent currently serves in the House. She is not term-limited but chose to vacate her House seat to run for Senate. A few bills stand out from her last House session, where I would have taken a different position. Three of the bills relate to enhancing protections for victims of sexual assault: <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1072\">HB24-1072, </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1460\">HB24-1460, and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-113\">SB24-113. I would have voted 'yes' to all three of these bills; my opponent voted 'no.' As the mother of two multiracial sons, I appreciate the risks young men face in the criminal justice system, especially men of color. I also understand the lifelong trauma victims of sexual assault face, especially when reporting is itself a traumatic experience. I will support victims of sexual assault, especially as a senator for a district that includes a college town. I would have voted against </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1233\">HB24-1233, which loosened restrictions on how HOAs collect payments on delinquent unit owners and created additional fees for homeowners. My opponent voted 'yes.' As someone who lost a home to foreclosure in 2012, I will support the dignity of families struggling to make ends meet.</url></p><p>Senate District 19 (Democratic)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lindseyforcolorado.com/\">Lindsey Daugherty</url></p><p>Age: 37</p><p>City of residence: Arvada</p><p>Occupation: State representative, family juvenile law attorney and guardian ad litem</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.voteobi.com/\">Obi Ezeadi</url></p><p>Age: 39</p><p>City of residence: Westminster</p><p>Occupation: Westminster City Council member</p><p>Senate District 19 is centered in Jefferson County and includes parts of Arvada and Westminster. It is currently represented by Democratic Sen. Rachel Zenzinger, who won in 2020 with 59% of the vote.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>DAUGHERTY: My top three priorities for the 2025 legislative session are to continue supporting our workers and amplifying their voices, making healthcare more affordable and transparent, and investing in public education.</p><p>EZEADI: Cost of living is my top priority. First, I will work to significantly lower childcare costs to support working families, making it easier for parents to return to work while ensuring their children receive high-quality care. Second, I will advocate for comprehensive strategies to make housing more accessible and affordable, coupled with initiatives to reduce healthcare costs, ensuring that every family in our district can live a healthy, secure life without financial strain. And third, I am committed to securing full funding for our public schools and ensuring our teachers are well-compensated. This investment in education is critical for equipping our youth with the skills they need for the future and strengthening our community's overall economic and social well-being.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it</p><p>DAUGHERTY: Affordability is the biggest issue facing my community right now. The rising cost of groceries, prescription drug costs, childcare, and housing have all contributed to making it more expensive to live in my community and across Colorado. If elected, I will address these issues through a creative and pragmatic approach, ensuring that Coloradans are not priced out of their communities. That means increasing protections for our renters and homeowners, pushing for increased funding for affordable housing development, ensuring support for hardworking families through tax credits and ensuring fully-funded public schools, and making sure all Coloradans have access to quality, affordable healthcare.</p><p>EZEADI: Residents in our district are increasingly concerned about the lack of civility and collaboration at the state Capitol, which has contributed to a toxic political environment. Addressing this issue is crucial for effective governance and restoring public trust in our legislative processes. If elected, I will prioritize fostering a culture of respect and bipartisanship. I plan to initiate and support measures that promote open dialogue and cooperation across party lines. By working together, we can more effectively tackle the pressing issues facing our state and ensure that our legislative actions reflect the diverse needs and values of all Coloradans.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>DAUGHERTY: I am committed to addressing these housing challenges through policies and legislation that promote affordability and availability. This includes pushing for increased funding for affordable housing development, supporting renters' rights and protections, promoting innovative housing solutions, and addressing zoning laws that can restrict housing development. Housing is an issue that must be addressed through both state and local initiatives. That is why having an open line of communication with my local district leaders is key to ensure that we can tackle these issues together and effectively.</p><p>EZEADI: By streamlining zoning laws, providing incentives for developers to build affordable units, and investing in public infrastructure, the state can effectively increase the availability of housing people can afford while ensuring sustainable community growth. In tackling housing issues, I will prioritize addressing missing-middle homeownership gaps, particularly for townhomes and condos, incentivize municipalities, and ensure that all development plans include a sustainable water supply strategy due to our state's finite water resources.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>DAUGHERTY: The state has a sizable role in an equitable climate future. Climate change disproportionately affects communities of color and people living in impoverished areas. We need to make sure that these communities have a voice at the table and are able to fully participate in legislation that actively affects their day to day living standards. For starters, we need to actively enforce and strengthen our pre-existing regulations so that big polluters are both held accountable and held to higher standards. I also fully support investing in renewable energy sources and having a just transition for our workers into a new green economy. It is only together, from all levels of government, can we even begin to adequately address the climate crisis we are currently facing.</p><p>EZEADI: The state must lead in combating climate change through robust environmental policies. I support transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in green public transport, and enforcing stricter pollution controls. Additionally, I would advocate for policies that promote water conservation and sustainable land management to protect our natural resources and public health. A just transition is essential to ensure that the shift towards renewable energy is equitable and does not leave workers or communities behind. This involves a comprehensive strategy that includes retraining programs, economic diversification, and targeted support for affected workers and regions.</p><p>Specifically, I advocate for the establishment of a Just Transition Fund that provides financial assistance and job training for workers transitioning from fossil fuel industries to emerging sectors. Additionally, I support policies that incentivize the creation of green jobs in areas most affected by the energy transition, ensuring these jobs offer competitive wages and benefits. Collaborative efforts with unions, industry, and educational institutions are crucial to develop tailored training programs that meet the specific needs of the local workforce. My approach also includes actively involving affected communities in the planning and implementation processes to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are addressed, thereby fostering an inclusive economy that benefits all.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>DAUGHERTY: As housing costs skyrocket, more people are facing impossible choices between paying rent or buying groceries. This crisis disproportionately impacts communities of color, lower-income households, and renters who are being pushed out of the communities they call home.</p><p>Income inequality prevents too many Colorado families from building economic security. Empowering workers is critical to addressing these inequities. I have consistently stood with workers and unions and sponsored bills to expand workers' compensation benefits, protect injured workers from unfair clawbacks, and require employers to notify staff about tax credits to boost their take-home pay. In the state Senate, I'm eager to focus on improving our systems for paid family and medical leave, so employees don't have to choose between work and family.</p><p>EZEADI: To effectively address cost-of-living concerns, the Legislature should focus on creating more affordable housing, reducing healthcare costs, and increasing educational opportunities that lead to better-paying jobs. Policies that provide tax incentives for lower and middle-income families and regulate utility costs can also help make daily expenses more manageable for all Coloradans.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>DAUGHERTY: I am proud of what we accomplished at the state Legislature this past session, though property taxes are an ongoing issue that we need to further address. Also, it is crucially important that we center this conversation around balancing the need of lowering property taxes with making sure critical public services like education and fire departments are fully funded. We need to work together on a long-term solution, and I don't believe the current ballot initiatives provide us with that long-term solution as it stands.</p><p>EZEADI: Property taxes are too high for most working families in my district. We need to lower them and hopefully the ballot initiatives this year will pass and do that. While I understand the appeal of even deeper property tax cuts, I believe we must balance tax relief with the need to fund essential services like education, healthcare, and public safety. I would prefer to refine the Legislature's recent work to target tax relief more effectively at those who need it most without compromising public services.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>DAUGHERTY: I really appreciate this question because, currently, our country is very divided and political rhetoric can be extremely vitriolic. We need good governance to ensure the continuation of our democracy, and finding common ground is crucial to achieving that goal. Not everyone in my district voted for me, but their voices still matter in our legislative process. My door is always open to all of my constituents, and I take that very seriously because I want to know how the policy we enact will impact my community.</p><p>While I certainly do not agree with my colleagues across the aisle all of the time, it is very important to me to find spaces where we can come together to find common ground so that we can craft better and more nuanced legislation for our communities. In the past, I have worked with my colleagues across the aisle to successfully sponsor and pass bills such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-182\">SB22-182 Economic Mobility Program, and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb23-1201\">HB23-1201 Prescription Drug Benefits Contract Term Requirement. If elected to the state Senate, I will continue to strive to best represent the needs of all of my constituents.</url></p><p>EZEADI: Bipartisanship is crucial for effective governance. I find common ground with members of the opposite party on issues like veterans' affairs, infrastructure, and emergency preparedness. It's vital to work across the aisle to craft policies that serve the best interest of all citizens, ensuring robust and resilient democratic processes.</p><p>What is one bill, vote or other legislative action you've taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?</p><p>DAUGHERTY: My experience of being a family and juvenile law attorney and guardian ad litem has uniquely ingrained in me a passion to fix the disparities in our criminal justice system and to support our at-risk youths. I also have a strong track record of passing bills that make our justice system more equitable, fair, and transparent.</p><p>For example, my bill, <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1017\">HB24-1017, Bill of Rights for Foster Youth ensures Colorado's foster youths are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve by addressing critical areas like protection from discrimination, access to education and healthcare, preparation for adulthood, and a written notification of their rights. I am extremely proud of the work we did on that bill, and I fought really hard to make sure the most vulnerable in our population have their voices amplified and uplifted in our law.</url></p><p>I am qualified to be elected because I have the experience and expertise to be effective starting on Day No. 1 in the state Senate, and if elected, I would be the only woman attorney in the state Senate. Moreover, my experience as a family law attorney means I know how to mediate, negotiate, and get results for my constituents.</p><p>You are running against a current state lawmaker. Are there any votes they have taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently? </p><p>EZEADI: As this is an open seat with the current state senator being termed out, I have not spent my time analyzing my opponent's voting record. I wish my opponent success, but I am focused on the positive campaign I am running, based on my strong connection with the community and the clear vision I have for our future. I had the privilege of volunteering for the current state senator back in 2023 and learned in-depth about the state budget while working in her office, which has significantly informed my understanding of effective governance. I am dedicated to continue the excellent levels of communication and community engagement that the constituents have come to expect. I believe the residents of our district deserve a senator who not only understands their issues but has lived through similar struggles and has the proven diverse professional and municipal experience to problem solve, and is committed to a government that genuinely works for everyone.</p><p>This commitment is reflected in my winning 60% of the vote at the County Assembly and the robust support of over 150 active volunteers. My campaign is driven by a deep-seated desire to serve and the urgent need to address the compounding crises that affect us all. I firmly believe that my unique experiences and the strong community backing make me the best candidate for this moment.</p><p>Senate District 23 (Republican)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natalieforcolorado.com/\">Natalie Abshier</url></p><p>Age: 59</p><p>City of residence: Mead</p><p>Occupation: Construction technology specialist</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/KirkmeyerforColorado23/\">Barbara Kirkmeyer</url></p><p>Age: 65</p><p>City of residence: Brighton</p><p>Occupation: State senator</p><p>Senate District 23 includes part of Larimer and Weld Counties. It is currently represented by Republican Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, who won the seat in 2020 with 55% of the vote.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>ABSHIER: </p><p>Illegal Immigration: Open borders are detrimental not only to the citizens of this country but also to the people who are making their way into our country. LEGAL immigration is humane. Illegal immigration is not. Problems caused by open borders.</p><p>Human, sex and drug trafficking: This issue endangers men, women and children being used by the cartels and the bad actors who support open borders has led to death of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of innocent human beings.</p><p>Fentanyl epidemic: This dangerous drug is being brought across our open borders and is causing great harm to thousands of people in Colorado and across the country.</p><p>Crime &amp; Safety: We must stop treating victims as criminals and criminals as victims. Lowering the standards for law enforcement doesn't help people who are victims nor is it helping those who continue to live a life of crime. I support law enforcement to keep our communities safe and making sure victim rights are protected.</p><p>Limiting government, reducing spending and protect TABOR: I will stop the out-of-control spending and limit the government's intrusion into private lives and small businesses.</p><p>Parental Rights: Parents must be able to educate their children by methods they feel are right for their family, whether that's public, charter, private or home schooling. Every student deserves to receive an excellent education. Public schools must not be controlled by the government or education unions who care more about protecting their own interests rather than focusing on improving student test scores and preparing students for life after their K-12 education.</p><p>KIRKMEYER: Education funding and accountability. Repeal cashless bail policies that put dangerous criminals back on the street. Criminalize (refelonize) the possession of fentanyl, a poison which is killing far too many Coloradans.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>ABSHIER: Illegal immigration is the biggest issue of concern for residents in our community. Colorado citizens must come first before illegal immigrants who've come here through by reckless Democrat policies. Open borders are detrimental not only to the citizens of this country but also to the people who are making their way here. It's my priority to stop funding illegal immigration in Colorado and enforce the laws already in place. We must stop sanctuary statuses that are responsible for death and destruction across Colorado. LEGAL immigration is humane immigration.</p><p>KIRKMEYER: People say Colorado is no longer a great place to raise a family or start and run a business. It's just too expensive! I've already made progress in cutting the cost of living. In 2024, I took on the Democrats and won. We got $1.3 billion in property tax relief passed. We have more work to do to cut the cost of living. I will continue to work to end punitive, costly regulations on our energy and agriculture workers and to bring additional tax relief.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>ABSHIER: The state should let the market along with local jurisdictions decide housing development. Zoning laws are changing the landscape of Colorado \u2014 we must reign in the overzealous zoning laws and protect our property values. Regulations should be reduced and local communities must be able to control where and how housing development should occur. I believe in small government and less regulation. Smaller, limited government is crucial to maintaining our constitutional republic. The state shouldn't be involved in creating or changing laws related to housing development.</p><p>KIRKMEYER: In the 2024 session I passed <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-174\">SB24-174 that focuses on partnership versus preemption and requires housing needs assessments and action plans. Housing development and density decision-making should lie with local governments, not at the state level. Why should state government dictate one-size-fits-all regulations and policies on communities across our diverse state?</url></p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>ABSHIER: Colorado has gone too far by regulating shopping bags and creating over-reaching guidelines that negatively impact our ability to maintain our oil and gas industry as well as driving up energy costs across the state. Government shouldn't be involved in creating or changing laws related to climate change by enacting over-reaching, business killing laws and mandates.</p><p>KIRKMEYER: Re-introduce <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-095\">SB24-095. This bill, had it passed, would have provided a $850 voucher for high emitter vehicles unable to pass the emissions test to get the vehicle fixed, thereby reducing tons of pollution in Colorado. The Democrats killed the bill in committee. The number one thing the state can do to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses is property forest management. One Colorado forest fire can emit millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We should thin forests, remove dead trees, and plant more trees to mitigate forest fire risk and remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</url></p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>ABSHIER: The role of our government is to protect the citizens from foreign and domestic enemies by maintaining military and police forces for the protection of its citizens against loss of life, property and liberty. Once again, smaller, limited government is crucial to maintaining our constitutional republic. The government should stay out of private property and private market issues.</p><p>KIRKMEYER: Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods and services. Conservative solutions are the answer: reduce runaway spending, cut taxes, and rein in punitive regulations that kill jobs and drive-up prices.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>ABSHIER: Yes, most definitely.</p><p>KIRKMEYER: Additional property tax cuts are needed. We have more work to do. I have concerns about the various ballot measures currently under consideration.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>ABSHIER: The common ground with Democrats is to address illegal immigration, statewide crime and fentanyl access and abuse.</p><p>KIRKMEYER: I was listed by Colorado Politics twice in the top three bipartisan teams. I have worked across the aisle on many policies and will continue to do so. This includes legislation to fully fund education and eliminate the budget stabilization factor , decreasing property taxes (<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233), securing funding for higher education, affordable and sustainable housing (</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-174\">SB24-174) and ensuring water rights are not infringed on while the protecting our rivers and wetlands (</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1379\">HB24-1379).</url></p><p>Are there any votes the incumbent has taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?</p><p>ABSHIER: <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb23-101\">SB23-101, Candidate Ballot Access for Primary Elections: This bill that would've eliminated the caucus and assembly process in Colorado, resulting in only allowing candidates to get on the ballot by gathering signatures on a petition. I would've never voted for, much less sponsored, this horrendous bill. Thankfully, it didn't pass.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233: This bill was co-sponsored and helped pass a property tax increase while trying to convince voters that it's really a tax decrease and it was the 'responsible thing to do.' In reality, property tax rates go up under this bill and won't save Coloradans any money. This legislation is a scam that will will cause property taxes to go up and its real purpose is to try and convince voters to not pass a property tax cut and cap ballot measure this fall. I would've never co-sponsored or voted for this bill.</url></p><p>What is one bill, vote or other legislative action you've taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?</p><p>KIRKMEYER: In the face of an overwhelmingly Democrat-controlled Legislature, I took a leading role in developing, negotiating, and passing <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">Senate Bill 233, which cut property taxes by $1.3 billion this year. This is just one example of how I am a conservative fighter who wins.</url></p><p>Senate District 28 (Democratic)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idriskeith.com/\">Idris Keith</url></p><p>Age: 50</p><p>City of residence: Aurora</p><p>Occupation: Attorney</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mikeweissman.com/\">Mike Weissman</url></p><p>Age: 47</p><p>City of residence: Aurora</p><p>Occupation: State representative, attorney</p><p>Senate District 28 cuts across Adams and Arapahoe counties and includes parts of Aurora and Watkins. It is currently represented by Democratic Sen. Rhonda Fields and historically favors Democrats by 32 points. </p><p>Weissman did not return a response.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>KEITH: First, I will work to expand school safety measures which keep our children safe. Schools must be places to learn and learning is difficult if children do not believe they are safe. Additionally, we must expand access to pre- and post-school programming to build structure and stability for the next generation of Colorado leaders and thinkers. Second, I will invest in public infrastructure including modernizing public schools, providing more competitive pay for our educators and support staff, enhancing access to sustainable and safer public transit, and expanding more affordable health care. In particular, we must prioritize mental health coverage and defending a woman's freedom to make her own health care choices and access to IVF. Third, I will work to finally address the housing crisis and expand access to quality, yet affordable, housing with the intent to expand the middle class.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>KEITH: My team and I have knocked on more than 10,000 doors in the past few months. During this process, my neighbors in Senate District 28 have shared their concerns and their hopes. As I listened, the common issues were affordable housing and well-paying jobs that can support a family. My wife and I agree. Many people are one emergency from a financial disaster. As your next state senator in District 28, I will make it my mission to remove needless administrative barriers, unnecessary expenses, and unexpected red tape that make single family dwellings, multi-unit housing, and mixed-use modern construction difficult to attain. We can solve this issue, but we must stop the politics of do-nothingism to score political points. The people of Senate District 28 and the people of Colorado deserve concrete steps to meet the end goal of home ownership.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue? </p><p>KEITH: The bills recently passed were well-intentioned and they should have an impact on the current housing crisis. Nevertheless, there remains much to be done to make Colorado an affordable, safe, and practical place to live and work. Specifically, we must dispense with party labels and begin and remind ourselves of our sacred duty to the families who rely on us to protect this great state. </p><p>We must revisit popular bills which would make condominium construction quicker and easier in Colorado. In fact, the bill was so popular that it garnered more than 70% in popular support prior to its defeat last term. This is unfortunate. The people deserve quality mixed-use developments which bring local grocery stores and small businesses closer to our higher density neighborhoods. This act would nearly eliminate food deserts and limit the impact of store relocations similar to a Wal-Mart that chose to close their location in Senate District 28; thus, depriving over 100,000 District residents easy access to fresh produce and quality food to feed their families.</p><p>Furthermore, we must proactively address Colorado's sustainable future by framing the housing issue as a state-wide crisis as opposed to a local Denver/Aurora challenge. A more effective approach to how Colorado grows and supports our whole economy will make sure that the decisions we make today will sustain our state tomorrow. This requires respect for one's peers and for all voices to have input in problem resolution.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature? </p><p>KEITH: Colorado lies at the crossroads of several critical threats to our community due to climate change: massive wildfires, dangerous hailstorms, stifling heat waves, and unpredictable air quality. While we can control only so much of this global crisis from the position of our state, it is my commitment to approach our responsibility from multiple angles. That is, we must work to prevent causes where possible by reducing our carbon footprint responsibly, expedite responses to crises when they occur, and to mitigate impacts including offering full support to those impacted by climate events. As the world economy changes, we must ensure that our citizens are leading the movement for high-paying and cutting edge renewable energy jobs.</p><p>Colorado, similar to several Western states, is subject to the unpredictability of climate change \u2014 water shortages, wildfire risks, extreme heat and sudden cold snaps. We have, in the past, worked to build minor relationships with those states which have borne enduring outcomes. For example, the Colorado Water Congress is a marked example of collegial interstate partnership. However, we must expand upon this type of partnership and work to effectively resource programs that will address our needs such as multi-state compacts to build and maintain helicopter and plane-based wildfire containment and mitigation strategies. We must also modernize our forecasting and relationship to our water resources.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status? </p><p>KEITH: We continue to suffer the economic aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of businesses closed and there were instances of price gouging resulting in costs of living increasing throughout the nation. Colorado has always been a small business state \u2014 we support those who live and work in our communities.</p><p>We must work together to revive competition and a tenacious sense of service in Colorado. When choice and innovation flourish, companies who engage in price gouging are held accountable by their competitors who can deliver goods and services at a more reasonable price. I will work to support the creation of a new generation of local businesses, and especially seek to enhance our programs that train, support, and offer grants to women- and minority-owned small businesses in our state.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session? </p><p>KEITH: The voice of Colorado's voters is paramount and I support popular measures that help us better understand and consider that which is right for our state. I am deeply supportive of the work our leaders performed during Gov. Polis' special session.</p><p>I am concerned that subsequent tax cuts will force our neighbors to weigh how much we treasure other initiatives voters have passed like universal pre-k against minor tax reductions that do not directly benefit the many who rent properties in Colorado. We must work to better address the cost of living crisis in Colorado by focusing on measurable outcomes for our neighbors.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy? </url></p><p>KEITH: A key component of leadership is building broad consensus to execute your program. It is difficult to lead when you intentionally exclude others based on their political philosophy. Ultimately we must seek outcomes that benefit all of our citizens, regardless of political philosophy. I am running to help ensure that we can build a pragmatic legislature that focuses on how we, together, can find common ground. Leaders should want a Colorado that works for everyone.</p><p>You are running against a current state lawmaker. Are there any votes they have taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently? </p><p>KEITH: As a Democrat and long-time resident of Aurora, I am proud that the work of our leaders across the years has helped push our community forward and built a brighter Colorado. My opponent has taken several stances in the recent past which, as a father, cause me grave concern.</p><p>Just this year my opponent chose to kill a common sense bill that addressed the crime of gun theft in Colorado. Currently, improper storage of a firearm is a greater crime than theft of that firearm from someone's home. The bill, <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1162\">HB24-1162 sought to address that inequity and make clear that firearm theft is a serious offense. This reasonable bill would save lives and provide better protection for our community at a time when District 28 residents express concern about the increased influx of firearms that maim or kill.</url></p><p>Indeed this is a troubling trend that has continued.

There will be a risk of smoke and low visibility on areas of the highway as a result.</p><p>The pile-burns are scheduled to begin this month, then continue into the early spring, according to a release from the Forest Service. Fires will be located near Quartz Creek, Crescent Creek, the Russian River Campgrounds and near Hope Point trailhead, with 200 acres planned for burn.</p><p>Burning the piles, produced by ongoing spruce beetle mitigation and other hazardous fuel reduction activities, is necessary to mitigate the risk of wildfire and the severity of any that do occur, the release said.</p><p>Steps will be taken to minimize the impact of smoke on the public; the release said personnel will monitor conditions and work with the National Weather Service to pick times \"most favorable to smoke dispersion.\" Despite that effort, smoke may be seen along the Sterling Highway, especially in the late evening and early morning.</p><p>The release said the most likely areas to experience smoke impact are Sterling Highway Mileposts 43, 45 and 53, located between the Seward Highway Junction and Cooper Landing, near Quartz Creek Road and near Russian River Campground Road respectively. In Hope, smoke may be seen near Porcupine Campground and the Hope Point trailhead.</p><p>For more information about pile burning and smoke, check @ChugachForestAK on Twitter.</p><p>Reach reporter Jake Dye at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jacob.dye@peninsulaclarion.com\">jacob.dye@peninsulaclarion.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2023 Homer News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOMNWS-news20230118PYL4418219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOMNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67C0-PG21-F0HF-81P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"274\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

According to news reporting originating from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Crown vertical profiles (CVP) play an essential role in stand biomass and forest fire prediction. Traditionally, due to measurement difficulties, CVP models developed based on a small number of individual trees are not convincing.\" </p><p><br/> Regional Innovation And Development of The National Natural Science Foundation of China; Special Fund Project For Basic Research in Central Universities; Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides new insights for researching trees' CVPs. However, there is a limited understanding of the ability to accurately describe CVPs with TLS. In this study, we propose a new approach to automatically extract the crown radius (CR) at different heights and confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach with field measurement data from 30 destructively harvested sample trees. We then applied the approach to extract the CR from 283 trees in 6 sample plots to develop a two-level nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model for the CVP. The results of the study showed that the average extraction accuracy of the CR when the proposed approach was applied was 90.12%, with differences in the extraction accuracies at different relative depths into the crown (RDINC) ranges. The TLS-based extracted CR strongly correlated with the field-measured CR, with an R2 of 0.93.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Compared with the base model, the two-level NLME model has significantly improved the prediction accuracy, with Ra2 increasing by 13.8% and RMSE decreasing by 23.46%. All our research has demonstrated that TLS has great potential for accurately extracting CRs, which would provide a novel way to nondestructively measure the crown structure. Moreover, our research lays the foundation for the future development of CVP models using TLS at a regional scale.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Novel Approach to Characterizing Crown Vertical Profile Shapes Using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS).

The Government of Canada is committed to helping Canadians whose lives are affected when emergencies happen, helping communities deal with the realities of increased climate-related risks and disasters, and, ultimately, increasing our resiliency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada, concluded a visit to Manitoba where he met with his counterpart the Honourable Lisa Naylor, Manitoba's Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, and Minister of Consumer Protection and Government Services.</p><p>In his first of several roundtables, the Minister met with stakeholders and key emergency management partners, including local governments, non-governmental organizations and Indigenous organizations, to discuss lessons learned from recent emergencies, with the goal to collectively better prepare for future events and the range of hazards faced in Canada. While in Winnipeg, he toured Manitoba's Emergency Management Organization Centre and visited the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), which played a key role in the coordination of this year's historic wildfire season.</p><p>During his visit, the Minister also announced five payments totaling $193,720,186 to Manitoba through the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) program, to assist with response and recovery costs associated with the 2022 spring flood, 2020 June rainstorm, 2019 October storm, 2016 June flood, and the 2014 spring flood.</p><p>Through these arrangements, the Government of Canada continues to support the province of Manitoba to respond and recover from disasters.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"As the effects of climate change increase the frequency of disasters like flooding, we are committed to supporting Canadians, and keeping them safe. These payments will help support the province of Manitoba with their recovery and rebuilding efforts, as we work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Prioritizing our resiliency towards recurring extreme weather events will help strengthen our adaptability and our ability to better recover.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada</p><p>\"Keeping Manitobans safe and responding quickly and effectively to emergencies when they happen is a priority for our government, and partnering with the Federal Government is important to ensure this goal is met. I was pleased to welcome Minister Sajjan to Winnipeg, and I look forward to continue working together on increasingly critical issues such as protecting Manitobans in the context of a changing climate.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Lisa Naylor, Manitoba's Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, Minister of Consumer Protection and Government Services</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* In Canada, emergencies are managed first at the municipal level and if assistance is needed, the municipality requests it from the province or territory. If the emergency escalates further, provinces or territories can get help from the federal government.</p><p>* In the event of a large-scale disaster, the Government of Canada provides financial assistance through the DFAA program to provinces and territories, at their request, for eligible disaster response and recovery expenses that exceed what they could reasonably be expected to bear on their own. Provincial or territorial governments design, develop and deliver disaster financial assistance, deciding the amounts and types of assistance that will be provided to those who have experienced losses.</p><p>* The DFAA provides assistance when response and recovery costs exceed what individual provinces or territories could be expected to bear on their own. Federal government payments are calculated on a per capita basis and are cost-shared with the province or territory. The amount cost-shared is determined by an established formula of up to 90 percent of the costs of eligible expenses.</p><p>* Eligible expenses under the DFAA include, but are not limited to, evacuation operations, restoring public works and infrastructure to their pre-disaster condition, as well as restoration or replacement of individuals' uninsurable principle dwellings, restoration of small businesses, and farmsteads and mitigation measures to reduce the future vulnerability of repaired or replaced infrastructure.</p><p>* Under the DFAA, provinces and territories have six months following the end of a disaster event to request financial assistance from the federal government. Once an event has been designated under the DFAA, provinces and territories have up to five years to submit their final claim.</p><p>* Following the approval of an Order-in-Council which is required to make payments, in the first 12 months following the end of an event, a province or territory may request in writing advance DFAA payments to address early requirements. These requests must contain supporting documentation, including actual interim expenditures and projected estimates, for review by the federal auditor. Based on this audit review, Public Safety Canada determines the total amount of the advance payments which should not exceed half of the projected federal cost-share.</p><p>* Since the inception of the program in 1970, the DFAA has been a reliable source of support for provinces and territories. As of March 2023, the Government of Canada has provided $7.9 billion in post disaster assistance to help provinces and territories with the costs of response and returning infrastructure and property to pre-disaster condition.</p><p>* Budget 2023 committed $48.1 million over five years, starting in 2023-2024, to identify high-risk flood areas and implement a modernized DFAA program which would incentivize mitigation efforts. This work is being informed by the findings and recommendations of an independent advisory panel and the input of provinces and territories. A modernized program is expected in April 2025.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/11/minister-sajjan-reaffirms-support-to-the-province-of-manitoba-to-respond-and-recover-from-disasters.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/11/minister-sajjan-reaffirms-support-to-the-province-of-manitoba-to-respond-and-recover-from-disasters.html</url></p><p>Contact: Joanna Kanga, Press Secretary, Office of the President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Joanna.Kanga@kpc-cpr.gc.ca\">Joanna.Kanga@kpc-cpr.gc.ca</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8369782 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8369782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69N2-4061-DYG2-R2N2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1110\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 16, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Black Hills National Forest - issued the following press release:</p><p>With the recent snowfall across the Black Hills National Forest, Ranger Districts will be focusing efforts on burning thousands of hand and machine slash piles. Piles are created from timber sale slash and tree thinning operations.</p><p>Piles are only ignited when managers are confident that the project can be undertaken safely with considerations to snow cover, wind, temperature, available staffing, and smoke dispersal. Public and firefighter safety is always the number-one priority in all burning operations. Firefighters continually monitor and check the piles for several days after they have been lit.</p><p>\"It is very important to reduce fire and insect hazards by reducing fuel buildup,\" said Jason Virtue, Black Hills National Forest Fire Management Officer. \"We appreciate the support from the communities. Being able to reduce these fuels this time of year makes fire suppression operations safer during the summer months.\"</p><p>Smoke will be visible and may impact local communities across the Black Hills for the next several months.

I knew that Smokey was based on a real bear cub who had been rescued from a forest fire but I knew nothing else about his history until I recently read an article about Capitan, New Mexico.</p><p>According to the U.S. Forest Service website on Smokey, the original Smokey Bear was a fictional bear dreamed up as a symbol in 1944 for the Forest Service's campaign on forest fire prevention. However, in 1950, his name was bestowed on a bear cub who was rescued from a forest fire in New Mexico.</p><p>There were two back-to-back forest fires in early May 1950 in the Capitan Mountains, which are part of the Lincoln National Forest. The first began on May 4th and burned about 1,000 acres before it was brought under control on May 6th. On that same day, however, a second fire, the Capitan Gap fire started and, due to high winds, it quickly raged out of control. On May 9th, firefighters from Taos Pueblo and soldiers from Fort Bliss discovered a tiny North American Black Bear cub who had survived the fire. The soldiers rescued the cub whom they named initially named Hotfoot Teddy. Shortly thereafter they changed his name to Smokey Bear after the fictional character. A New Mexico game warden named Ray Bell realized the cub needed specialized attention and arranged for the cub to be flown to Santa Fe for treatment by veterinarian Dr. Ed Smith.</p><p>After recovering, the bear cub was moved to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. According to Timeless Heritage: A History of the Forest Service in the Southwest, 1998, the bear was flown to Washington and met by a company of dignitaries, including Senator Chavez of New Mexico.</p><p>In 1952, Congress passed a law (ch. 327, 66 Stat. 92) prohibiting the use or manufacture of the character Smokey Bear by unauthorized persons. The law allowed the Secretary of Agriculture to authorize specific persons to use the Smokey Bear character. This law also directed the Secretary to deposit in a special account fees collected from the authorized use of the Smokey Bear character. These fees were to be used \"for furthering the nationwide forest-fire prevention campaign.\"</p><p>In the meantime, as the living representative of the Smokey Bear campaign, the bear was so popular and received so many letters when he lived at the zoo, that he was issued his own zip code. Smokey lived at the zoo for 26 years until he died in 1976. His body was sent back to Capitan, New Mexico, where it is buried. The New Mexico Energy, Mineral and Natural Resources Department now operates a park that houses his body and hosts exhibits focusing on forest health and fire ecology. However, as a symbol, Smokey Bear lives on and in 2019 celebrated his 75th birthday as the symbol of forest fire prevention.</p><p>A final note on the name Smokey Bear versus \"Smokey the Bear.\" According to the New Mexico Smokey Bear Historic Park website, a \"the\" was added to Smokey's name when a song was written about the bear so the lyrics would match the melody.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124795524</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63X8-RH01-JCBF-S438-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 22, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We meet C\u00e9sar, a humble man out of work, moving rapidly to join the efforts to assist in its extinguishment. The sirens are ever present as a reminder of the danger the fires pose to the community around him.\u00a0</p><p>Land acquisition, from the beginning of time, has been a matter of contention and frustration. Troncoso's film presents us with a perspective not commonly portrayed; someone willing to get their hands dirty for, in their view, noble reasons. C\u00e9sar's sister Mabel, struggles with an illness that will leave her out of work, and serves as the reason C\u00e9sar goes down a dark path. The family's economic situation, coupled with this curveball, is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Fragility is key here: C\u00e9sar's economic fragility, and the fragility of his sister's health.\u00a0</p><p>After seeking employment at a job placement centre, C\u00e9sar finds H\u00e9ctor, a real estate developer, seeking to extend his frontier into protected land. C\u00e9sar works with his nephew to clear and fence H\u00e9ctor's land, showing him the ropes of how to properly burn incendiary twigs. At a gathering, H\u00e9ctor is accused of land grabbing. He defends his employer, showing he's willing to get physical on his behalf.</p><p>Towards the end of Bajo la corteza, we see C\u00e9sar start a forest fire at H\u00e9ctor's behest. The costs of his actions are revealed through radio snippets featuring community members lamenting the loss of their homes, and clips of the destruction the blaze wreaks upon the landscape. The film's debut on local and international stages followed the 2022 Corrientes wildfires in Argentina.</p><p>C\u00e9sar himself revisits the charred land he set fire to. Perpetrators are smart to avoid returning to the scene of their crime, but C\u00e9sar isn't a criminal and clearly has a conscience. His actions put him at great odds with himself, and later with Mabel, who pieces together what he has done. She rejects the money he brings to her. The final act of the film is a lesson in teaching the art of deduction as this chain of events is more implicit than explicit.\u00a0</p><p>Local film buffs are familiar with The Cinematheque and it delivered a brilliant experience, as should be expected of the venue. Troncoso's film was in good hands and lived up to the expectations set by many other great motion pictures that graced that screen. With its long takes, neorealist characteristics and pertinent storyline, Bajo la corteza is a reminder that the most unexpected situations and people can have a profound effect on our environment and communities.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5372700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66F3-Y5P1-DY7P-T03C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peak: Simon Fraser</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 20, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Van Couver</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

The Willow Piles Prescribed Fire, which would only move forward pending suitable conditions, is the first such for the Carson National Forest after the USDA Forest Service National Prescribed Fire Review was released in September 2022.</p><p>\"We are thoughtfully moving forward with our prescribed fire program,\" said Carson National Forest Supervisor James Duran. \"I want to ensure staff are getting to know the new guidelines and to hold space for conversations in the community as we plan more prescribed fire operations around the Forest.\"</p><p>An open house for the public to drop in to discuss the Willow Piles Prescribed Fire and future projects in the Tres Piedras area will be held between 5:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Feb.1 at the Tres Piedras Ranger Station, 22280 Hwy. 64, Tres Piedras, NM 87577.</p><p>Prescribed fires are utilized to remove hazardous fuels, return nutrients to the soil and improve forest health. Fuels specialists write prescribed fire plans that identify - or prescribe - the best conditions under which forest vegetation and debris will burn to get the best results safely. Burn plans consider temperature, humidity, wind, moisture of the vegetation and conditions for smoke dispersion.</p><p>*The rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/carson/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1086187\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/carson/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1086187</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4288571</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67DB-65X1-JD35-F183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><timeReceived>3:16 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 HT Media Ltd.

Perhaps the best thing about what has come to be known as Toyota's Project ETA is the fact that Robertson and his team were able to create it from whole cloth because they thought it might come in handy as inventories tightened and direct consumer ordering increased.</p><p>Robertson, 53, has been with Toyota since joining its massive Georgetown Assembly Plant in 1993 and has held a variety of executive roles over the years.

DEM will advise the public again several days before it has identified a more reliable \"burn window\" in which to conduct a prescribed fire operation. The agency will further notify Rhode Islanders by timely social media posts and distributing flyers to abutting landowners and neighbors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A burn window refers to when the environmental variables such as fuel moisture and weather conditions are balanced so that the fire will accomplish its goals, which include reducing fuels (i.e., combustible materials on forest floors and in grasslands), modifying wildlife habitat, and restoring ecological function while remaining under control. One of the biggest factors in determining a burn window is forecasting the weather. Whereas a 10-day forecast is accurate about only half the time, a five-day forecast can accurately predict the weather around 90% of the time, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>Wind is an equally critical factor. DEM's \"go/no-go\" decision on which of the burns to conduct will likely come down to wind speed and direction, to allow for the optimal dispersal of smoke. At this point in their preparations for a busy burn season, however, DEM burn managers are targeting parcels at Pratt Farm in the Arcadia Management Area, located on the Exeter-Richmond line, as the location of the first prescribed burn in 2023.</p><p>\"Pratt Farm and the surrounding forestland is a fire-adapted ecosystem that depends on the use of prescribed fire to maintain healthy vegetation and wildlife habitats,\" said Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin. \"The project at Pratt Farm will be the start of our prescribed fire season this spring. We plan to conduct burning here and at other DEM properties across the state throughout the spring and fall.\" MacMeekin described the Pratt Farm fire - which will target one or more parcels at the DEM-run management area - as \"a grassland burn, with the goal of removing the grass thatch layer, to open and release the seedbank and promote native, warm season grasses such as little bluestem and big bluestem.\"</p><p>Currently, the grasslands at the site are recently converted hayfields whose grasses are mostly nonnative and cool season species. Also, pitch pine saplings are scattered throughout the field site. Pitch pine refers to the high resin content of this important native tree's knotty wood. It thrives on dry rocky soil that other trees cannot tolerate. \"The application of consistent, prescribed fire will help to restore the fields to native grasses and pitch pine barrens. Pitch pine barrens are especially important habitats for moths, leafhoppers, pollinators, box turtles, Northern black racers, and whip-poor-wills, Eastern towhees, and several songbirds,\" MacMeekin said.</p><p>Last month DEM announced it was planning more prescribed fires in 2023 for the reasons stated above and to reduce the risk of unplanned, high-severity, destructive wildfires. In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought that the state only now is recovering from, Rhode Island experienced more than 80 wildland fires. Parched conditions forced DEM to ban outdoor fires at all state campgrounds, parks, and management areas for a two-week period in August.</p><p>By increasing its use of prescribed fire, Rhode Island will be better aligning its land management policies and practices with neighboring states. From 2018 to 2022, Massachusetts ignited 223 prescribed fires totaling 7,148 acres and Connecticut had 18 prescribed fires totaling 300 acres. In the same five-year period, Rhode Island conducted three prescribed fires totaling around 75 acres. Among other benefits, common ecological restoration goals with other states help to strengthen climate change resilience across southern New England.</p><p>Experts from DEM's Forest Fire Program, a subsidiary of the Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment, will lead the prescribed burns. They will employ detailed operational and safety plans. Planning is critical for every burn. A prescribed burn plan developed by a qualified burn boss must be in place before a burn is conducted. Firebreaks and other site preparations are made. Fire behavior, fuels, and weather are monitored throughout the burn, and if the prescription parameters are exceeded, the fire is shut down. The burn is carried out by a skilled crew under the direction of a qualified burn boss. DEM burn managers have obtained the required local permits and an exemption from state air pollution control regulation Part 4: Open Fires (250-RICR-120-05-4). Managers also have communicated with the Exeter No. 2 Fire Chief, Hope Valley-Wyoming Fire Chief, Rhode Island Southern Firefighters League, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the DEM Division of Fish &amp; Wildlife, and the DEM Office of Air Resources.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ri.gov/press/view/45357\">https://www.ri.gov/press/view/45357</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8102668 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8102668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67T1-CMD1-JC11-14MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><timeReceived>10:15 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 17, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Bennetts were represented by lawyer William L. Lutz of Las Cruces.</p><p>Gallegos and Baake argued that it's clear the public has established a prescriptive easement over private lands owned by the Bennetts and others and that the public has the right to continue to use the road. In order to establish a prescriptive easement, they said the public has to have used the road openly, without asking permission from any private landowners, for more than 10 years.</p><p>The road extends westerly 2.9 miles from the end of Main Street in the town of Kingston to the entry of the Aldo Leopold Wilderness portion of the Gila National Forest. The road leads up the canyon that holds Percha Creek to a trailhead on the Ladrone Gulch Trail, that allows access into the Black Range and the Aldo Leopold Wilderness for hikers or horseback riders.</p><p>The road has long been delineated on U.S. Forest Service maps as Forest Road 40E. For years, there's been a USFS sign at the base of the road that states, \"Private Property. Please Stay on Roadway for Next 1 Mile. Forest Road 40E Open to Public.\"</p><p>Association member Chuck Heard, of Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., testified his family has been in the Kingston area since the 1920s and still owns property there. He said his fondest childhood memories center on times spent in the canyon with his brothers and other family members.</p><p>\"Early 1960s, we were up there all the time,\" Heard said. \"That was some of the best times of my childhood, going up there with my grandfather.\"</p><p>Heard said his family never asked anyone for permission to use the road. Now 69 years old, he showed a photograph of himself as a toddler standing at the end of the road in the trailhead area.</p><p>After military service, Heard said he returned to the area and worked for a time for the Forest Service in the Black Range Ranger District. He said he did road maintenance on the road for the agency. \"We'd make sure the road was clear so vehicles could drive by,\" he said.</p><p>Other area residents testified that they, too, had used the road for decades without ever asking for permission.</p><p>Deborah Brandt of Las Cruces, a registered nurse and professional herbalist, testified that she owns a residence in Kingston where she stays regularly. She said has used the road since 1996. She said she commonly took field trips up the road to show others the medicinal use of rare plants that grow in the canyon.</p><p>Steve Morgan, a resident of Kingston since 2007 and a retired landscape architect, said he worked with the Forest Service to address runoff issues on the road following a large forest fire in 2013.</p><p>\"Since the mining days in the 1880s and 1890s, the road has been used,\" Morgan said. He said he and his wife commonly walked their dog on the road without asking for permission before the Bennetts closed it.</p><p>Before the Bennetts installed their gate, it was a 15-minute walk to access the trailhead, Morgan said. He said the sides of the canyon are steep and rugged and said there's almost no other way to access the trailhead with the road closed. He said reaching it from Kingston now would require a seven-hour trip through the mountains around the private parcels and that anyone using horses or needing handicapped access couldn't reach it.</p><p>Jesse Deubel, executive director of the NMWF, testified that the organization represents the interests of New Mexicans including hunters and anglers in accessing and protecting public lands and wildlife.</p><p>\"It's very important to us to ensure that the public retains access to the public lands that belong to all New Mexicans,\" Deubel said. The NMWF was founded by Aldo Leopold in 1914..</p><p>Under questioning of Lutz, Bennett said he bought his roughly 20-acre parcel that is crossed by Forest Road 40E in 2022 and installed his gate across it early this year because he was concerned about people stealing firewood from his land and otherwise trespassing. He said the road crosses his property for less than a third of a mile.</p><p>Before installing the gate, Bennett said he put up no-trespassing signs on both sides of the road where it crossed his property, \"because we were concerned with problems with people going off the road.\"</p><p>Bennett testified he doesn't live on the property where he installed the gate, but intends to build a cabin on his land in the area. He said there's only one place on his property where he could build, but said it's close to the road. \"Obviously, we don't want people we don't know going by our front door twenty-four-seven,\" he said.</p><p>Under questioning by Gallegos, Bennett said he has handed out keys to the gate to 12 friends.</p><p>Gallegos asked Bennett that if a family came from Socorro that wanted to go up Forest Road 40E to reach the trailhead, \"They can't go enjoy that road because they're not your friends?\"</p><p>Bennett responded that there are other roads into the national forest.

When questioned on the scene, Martin claimedthat he attempted to kill a spider by burning it with a lighter, but accidentally lit a bush, which started the fire. <br/>'When he attempted to burn the spider, the surrounding brush ignited and the fire began spreading very rapidly,' an affidavit of the case said. <br/>'Not sure why exactly he felt the need to burn the spider,' Utah County Sergeant Spencer Cannon said about Martin. <br/>When he was arrested, local authorities found a jar filled with marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his belongings, leading them to believe that the man may have been high when he first started the fire, the Daily Beast[2] reported. <br/>'Um, don't do drugs kids (and don't start spiders on fire during a drought),' Utah Governor Spencer Cox tweeted that night after the case was first reported. <br/>Over 60 acres of U.S. Forest Service land within the Pleasant Grove Ranger District were reportedly burned by Tuesday, though the two crews assigned to controlling the flames say that they expect to contain most of the flames by the end of Tuesday. <br/>Martin will be facing charges of reckless burning, as well as possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. <br/> A massive 60-acre forest fire was ignited in Utah on Monday after a man who was reportedly on drugs accidentally lit a bush on fire while trying to kill a spider.

The fleet is part of rescEU, a European reserve of resources that responds to emergencies. Positioned in Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden, 12 firefighting airplanes and 1 firefighting helicopter will be ready for deployment this summer when wildfires require a joint European response to save lives, livelihoods and the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic said: \"Last year we witnessed the second worst forest fire season on record in the EU. This served as a painful reminder of devastating effect that forest fires have on the lives of Europeans. As of today, the entire EU's rescEU fleet of 13 firefighting aircraft is operational as to ensure a layer of additional protection for lives, livelihoods and the environment. This would not be possible without the cooperation of Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden who are hosting the firefighting helicopter and planes. With this fleet in place, the EU boosts the continent's preparedness to face forest fires.\"</p><p>Scientific forecasts for this year's forest fire season predict above-average risks for central Europe and across the Mediterranean. Especially the summer months tend to be warmer and drier than previous years.</p><p>rescEU firefighting capacities in 2022</p><p>The 2022 rescEU firefighting fleet includes 12 airplanes and 1 helicopter from six EU Member States, ready to be deployed to any EU country in times of need.</p><p>The fleet consists of:</p><p>* 2 firefighting airplanes from Croatia, 2 firefighting airplanes from France, 2 firefighting airplanes and one helicopter from Greece, 2 firefighting airplanes from Italy, 2 firefighting airplanes from Spain and 2 firefighting airplanes from Sweden.</p><p>The fleet is strategically positioned across EU Member States, which operate and maintain the aircrafts. Through its fully EU-financed rescEU fleet the European Commission is boosting the capacity of national responders across Europe. This comes in addition to more than 200 firefighters and technical equipment from Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and Norway that will be positioned in Greece to allow for immediate support to national first responders throughout the wildfire season.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background</p><p>The EU ensures a coordinated approach to preventing, preparing and responding to forest fires. When the scale of a forest fire overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Once activated, the EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre coordinates and finances assistance made available by EU Member States and six additional Participating States. In addition, the EU has created the European Civil Protection Pool to have a critical number of readily available civil protection capacities allowing for a stronger and coherent collective response. Should the emergency require more life-saving assistance, the Commission activates its rescEU firefighting fleet to confront disasters in Europe. The EU's Copernicus emergency satellite mapping service complements operations with detailed information from space.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For More Information</p><p>Forest Fires (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/civil-protection/forest-fires_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/civil-protection/forest-fires_en</url>)</p><p>rescEU (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/resceu_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/resceu_en</url>)</p><p>EU Civil Protection Mechanism (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en</url>)</p><p>European Civil Protection Pool (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/european-civil-protection-pool_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/european-civil-protection-pool_en</url>)</p><p>Emergency Response Coordination Centre (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en</url>)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3719\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3719</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-7865847 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7865847</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65PM-1NJ1-DYG2-R3YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>2:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 16, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

DEM will advise the public again several days before it has identified a more reliable \"burn window\" in which to conduct a prescribed fire operation. The agency will further notify Rhode Islanders by timely social media posts and distributing flyers to abutting landowners and neighbors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A burn window refers to when the environmental variables such as fuel moisture and weather conditions are balanced so that the fire will accomplish its goals, which include reducing fuels (i.e., combustible materials on forest floors and in grasslands), modifying wildlife habitat, and restoring ecological function while remaining under control. One of the biggest factors in determining a burn window is forecasting the weather. Whereas a 10-day forecast is accurate about only half the time, a five-day forecast can accurately predict the weather around 90% of the time, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>Wind is an equally critical factor. DEM's \"go/no-go\" decision on which of the burns to conduct will likely come down to wind speed and direction, to allow for the optimal dispersal of smoke. At this point in their preparations for a busy burn season, however, DEM burn managers are targeting parcels at Pratt Farm in the Arcadia Management Area, located on the Exeter-Richmond line, as the location of the first prescribed burn in 2023.</p><p>\"Pratt Farm and the surrounding forestland is a fire-adapted ecosystem that depends on the use of prescribed fire to maintain healthy vegetation and wildlife habitats,\" said Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin. \"The project at Pratt Farm will be the start of our prescribed fire season this spring. We plan to conduct burning here and at other DEM properties across the state throughout the spring and fall.\" MacMeekin described the Pratt Farm fire which will target one or more parcels at the DEM-run management area as \"a grassland burn, with the goal of removing the grass thatch layer, to open and release the seedbank and promote native, warm season grasses such as little bluestem and big bluestem.\"</p><p>Currently, the grasslands at the site are recently converted hayfields whose grasses are mostly nonnative and cool season species. Also, pitch pine saplings are scattered throughout the field site. Pitch pine refers to the high resin content of this important native tree's knotty wood. It thrives on dry rocky soil that other trees cannot tolerate. \"The application of consistent, prescribed fire will help to restore the fields to native grasses and pitch pine barrens. Pitch pine barrens are especially important habitats for moths, leafhoppers, pollinators, box turtles, Northern black racers, and whip-poor-wills, Eastern towhees, and several songbirds,\" MacMeekin said.</p><p>Last month DEM announced it was planning more prescribed fires in 2023 for the reasons stated above and to reduce the risk of unplanned, high-severity, destructive wildfires. In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought that the state only now is recovering from, Rhode Island experienced more than 80 wildland fires. Parched conditions forced DEM to ban outdoor fires at all state campgrounds, parks, and management areas for a two-week period in August.</p><p>By increasing its use of prescribed fire, Rhode Island will be better aligning its land management policies and practices with neighboring states. From 2018 to 2022, Massachusetts ignited 223 prescribed fires totaling 7,148 acres and Connecticut had 18 prescribed fires totaling 300 acres. In the same five-year period, Rhode Island conducted three prescribed fires totaling around 75 acres. Among other benefits, common ecological restoration goals with other states help to strengthen climate change resilience across southern New England.</p><p>Experts from DEM's Forest Fire Program, a subsidiary of the Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment, will lead the prescribed burns. They will employ detailed operational and safety plans. Planning is critical for every burn. A prescribed burn plan developed by a qualified burn boss must be in place before a burn is conducted. Firebreaks and other site preparations are made. Fire behavior, fuels, and weather are monitored throughout the burn, and if the prescription parameters are exceeded, the fire is shut down. The burn is carried out by a skilled crew under the direction of a qualified burn boss. DEM burn managers have obtained the required local permits and an exemption from state air pollution control regulation Part 4: Open Fires (250-RICR-120-05-4). Managers also have communicated with the Exeter No. 2 Fire Chief, Hope Valley-Wyoming Fire Chief, Rhode Island Southern Firefighters League, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the DEM Division of Fish and Wildlife, and the DEM Office of Air Resources.</p><p>For more information on DEM programs and initiatives, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dem.ri.gov\">www.dem.ri.gov</url>.

Peeler and other UM researchers have studied where to optimize ongoing wildfire mitigation efforts and reduce carbon loss due to wildfire, benefitting communities and climate at the same time.</p><p>During a wildfire, most carbon loss occurs when litter, duff and downed woody material is consumed by the fire. But over time trees killed during a fire decompose, producing another source of carbon loss. The study identifies locations where communities and agencies can consider implementing proactive forest management to reduce negative impacts from wildfires, including carbon loss.</p><p>Peeler's study recently was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. It highlights widespread \"opportunity hot spots\" in the western U.S. for using proactive forest management - such as forest thinning, prescribed fire and cultural burning - to reduce the risk of losing carbon to future wildfires.</p><p>The study is a collaboration among UM, The Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers evaluated where living trees and the carbon they store are at risk of burning in the future. They then compared these areas to areas highlighted in the Forest Service's Wildfire Crisis Strategy, identifying where human communities are most vulnerable to wildfire. Areas of overlap highlight \"opportunity hot spots\" where action can reduce the risk from wildfire to both carbon and communities.</p><p>\"Our approach can help land management agencies plan where to invest in proactive forest treatments that simultaneously reduce wildfire-caused carbon loss and protect communities from wildfire,\" Peeler said. \"It also could be applied to reduce risk from wildfire to other important values such as municipal water, culturally important plants, recreation and wildlife habitat.\"</p><p>Congress recently passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which includes a \"wildfire crisis strategy\" to dramatically increase the pace of forest restoration across the West. The plan includes unprecedented levels of funding ($3 billion dollars) from the federal government to reduce fuels in fire-adapted forests across 50 million acres in the next 10 years, which is at least two times more than current rates.</p><p>\"As a fire ecologist, it's an exciting time working on this topic, with billions of dollars dedicated to proactive forest treatments in the western U.S.,\" Peeler said. \"It's a historic chance for science to drive where this money will be delegated.\"</p><p>A big objective of the project was to prioritize where treatments would get the biggest bang for the buck in terms of carbon.</p><p>Proactive forest management can reduce the number of trees killed in wildfires by reducing excess fuels, reducing the negative impacts of a century of fire suppression and global warming. It also can keep more living trees on the landscape after wildfire, where they continue to capture and store carbon from the atmosphere and provide seeds for future forests.</p><p>\"The message we want to emphasize is that we don't have to choose between people and climate when we decide where we want to prioritize spending this money,\" Peeler said.</p><p>The Conversation published an article by Peeler on this topic. The Nature Conservancy also published a news release on protecting communities and carbon from forest fires.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Environmental Research Letters <url normalizedValue=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acf05a\">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acf05a</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.umt.edu/news/2023/09/090823fire.php\">https://www.umt.edu/news/2023/09/090823fire.php</url></p><p>Contact: Jamie Peeler, postdoctoral research fellow, W.A.

Below you will find his insights about the Mexico-India relationship and their shared goals and opportunities. </p><p><br/>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. <br/> TAMANNA BEMBENEK: You have named three key priorities for the India-Mexico relationship: tech, trade and tourism. In the current geopolitical climate, what unique opportunities do you see for Mexico and India to work together specifically around trade? <br/> AMBASSADOR PANKAJ SHARMA: The three pillars of tech, trade and tourism derive from the priorities laid out by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, and we are working towards forging mutually beneficial collaborations in each of these areas. As far as trade is concerned, the confluence of various factors presents a favorable environment for collaboration. <br/> Firstly, with global shifts in supply chain dynamics, India and Mexico can collaborate to offer alternative manufacturing and sourcing options, providing more resilience to disruptions. <br/> Secondly, leveraging the complementary strengths that both countries share can lead to mutually beneficial partnerships, especially in sunrise sectors such as renewable energy. <br/>Ambassador Sharma (left) at a recent event with the governor of Quertaro, Mauricio Kuri. (IndEmbMex/X) <br/>Thirdly, identifying specific sectors of mutual interest such as pharmaceuticals, automotive and information technology can contribute to boosting bilateral trade and investments. <br/> Last, but not least, there is a need to simplify trade procedures and regulations, as well as reduce barriers to trade.  <br/> Today bilateral trade relations between India and Mexico are on an upswing, reaching an all-time high of US$ 11.4 billion in 2022. India is Mexico's tenth-largest trading partner. To expand this trade potential, the Embassy of India in Mexico launched an initiative to establish The Trade &amp; Commerce Council of India, which aims to foster cooperation between the businesses of India and Mexico. <br/> When we talk about tourism, the number of Mexicans visiting India has slowly increased as we come out of the shadows of COVID-19 pandemic. Indians have also started looking at Mexico, especially for destination weddings. If we smooth out the challenges in terms of visas, direct flight connectivity and flight costs, I am sure that we can grow tourism between our countries. <br/> TB: India has made great strides in raising its profile as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. What can Mexico learn from India? <br/> PS: Both India and Mexico have made great strides, which is evident from the recent economic data. India has become the world's 5th largest economy, while Mexico has become the 12th largest economy. Mexico continues to attract investments with its nearshoring opportunities, while India with its economic reforms is becoming a manufacturing hub of Asia. <br/>A worker puts together a sedan at the BMW plant in San Luis Potos. (BMW) <br/>India has done well to implement ease-of-doing business reforms. In addition, introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in 2016 brought a paradigm shift in handling corporate insolvency. As a result of these reforms, India has made the highest jump by any large country since 2011 in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index. <br/>India has also focused on digital transformation. The Digital India program, launched in July 2015, is a flagship program of the Government of India that has transformed the country into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The government's focus on digital public infrastructure has resulted into India being the second-fastest digital adopter among 17 major economies of the world.  <br/> This has created a huge market for a host of digital services, platforms, applications, content, and solutions, and an attractive opportunity for global and local businesses to invest in emerging technologies like AI, block chain, or quantum technology. <br/>India's focus on infrastructure development, including transportation, energy and connectivity has played a crucial role in supporting economic growth. <br/> The Indian government's push on skill development is paying dividends. Under the Skill India Mission, launched in 2015, the focus is on short and long-term training programs for the country's workers. Between 2017 and 2023 more than 10 million people have been trained under this program to create a more equitable, inclusive and sustainable future. <br/> Lastly, India is successfully diversifying its economy, moving beyond traditional sectors to embrace technology and innovation. With 100+ 'unicorns', India has the world's third-largest startup ecosystem. India has also made a huge leap of 41 places in seven years in the WIPO's Global Innovation Index with a 50% increase in the filing of patents in the last seven years. <br/> However, all of this growth would be pointless if the last person in the queue did not benefit. Staying faithful to Mahatma Gandhi's 'Antyodaya' concept (working towards uplifting the poorest populations) the government is aiming to make economic growth as inclusive and equitable as possible. <br/> TB: The Indian Embassy together with the Mexican Foreign Affairs Ministry held the first joint IT forum in Mexico City in October last year. What does Mexico need to do to attract more IT investment from India? <br/> PS: Mexico has already become an attractive destination for IT investments, not only due to the nearshoring opportunities, but also the fact that Mexico has some of the best IT educational institutions and skilled professionals. <br/>Ambassador Sharma at an event with LTI Mindtree representatives in Mexico City. (IndEmbMex/X) <br/>We already have the presence of several major IT companies from India, like HCLTech, TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Birla Soft, Tech Mahindra in Mexico. System Soft technologies and Grey Matter solutions are recent additions. LTIMindtree has opened its first delivery center in Mexico City. More Indian companies like Avahi, Aryanco Partners are exploring the Mexican market and will enter soon. So there is already a good flow of Indian investments in this critical sector in Mexico.  <br/> The India-Mexico High Tech forum was an attempt to bring together these IT companies from both India and Mexico and brainstorm on some of the key emerging areas, such as Fintech and Artificial Intelligence, and to build useful synergies. <br/> TB: What does Mexico need to do to attract more pharmaceutical/medical device investment from India? <br/> PS: Pharmaceutical products are an important component of our trade basket with Mexico and an important sector for Indian investment.We already have the presence of Sunpharma, Torrent, Cipla, Heterodrugs, Zydus, Dr.Reddy's, Lupin, Micro Labs, Accord Pharma and others in Mexico. However, there is still scope to further expand the presence of Indian pharmaceutical players, which will substantially benefit the Mexican people by making a wide variety of quality medicines available at an affordable cost, in keeping with the priorities of President L\u00f3pez Obrador. <br/> TB: What can India do to deepen the relationship with Mexico? Why is a strong India- Mexico relationship important in today's world? <br/> PS: The continued high-level exchanges have helped to increase bilateral ties between the two countries.The two visits to India by former foreign minister of Mexico Marcelo Ebrard 2022 and 2023 outlined new areas of cooperation, particularly in science and technology and health. To give an example, ImmunoAct, an Indian company, is collaborating with the Salvador Zubirn National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition (INCMNSZ), Instituto Politcnico Nacional (IPN) and AMEXCID to bring new cancer therapy to Mexico at a substantially lower price than other cancer therapies. <br/>Marcelo Ebrard (far right) visited the ImmunoAct facility in Mumbai in March 2023. (LinkedIn/ImmunoACT) <br/>During the most recent visit of former foreign minister Ebrard to India in March 2023, a MoU was signed for joint research in priority areas of hydraulics, electric mobility and low-cost vaccines. <br/> The space industry is another potent area of collaboration between our two countries. Recently, India achieved an important feat by becoming the first country to land a space probe on the South Pole of the moon and only the fourth country ever to soft-land on moon. The world was surprised to learn that the cost of this project was just US $75 million. India also successfully sent an orbiter to Mars, which cost only US $73 million, showcasing the Indian space agency's capability of launching highly cost-effective and successful projects. We already have a few memorandums of understanding between Mexico and India in the areas of remote sensing and forest fire management. <br/> In the dynamic landscape of today's globalized world, a robust relationship between India and Mexico holds paramount significance. <br/> Both nations are pivotal players in their respective regions, and a strong partnership can contribute to a more balanced and diversified global order. By fostering closer economic ties, sharing technological advancements, and collaborating on regional and global issues, India and Mexico can collectively contribute to the stability of an increasingly interconnected world. Economically, closer India-Mexico ties open up vast opportunities for trade and investment. Both countries possess unique strengths and resources that complement each other. Collaborative efforts can result in job creation and bring overall economic prosperity for both the nations. <br/> Lastly, the alignment of India and Mexico on shared values such as democracy, multiculturalism, and a commitment to international law provides a strong foundation for diplomatic cooperation. By working together on global issues ranging from climate change and sustainable development to global health challenges, we will contribute to the overall stability and progress of the global community. <br/> TB: What is something that has surprised you about Mexico and Mexicans in your time here? <br/>The Ibero-American University in Mexico City held an 'India Day' event to celebrate Indian culture in February. (IndEmbMex/X) <br/>PS: I am grateful that my job gives me the opportunity to travel and experience life in different places. In Mexico, I am surprised by the sheer number of delicious tacos and no matter how hard I try, I can't convince anyone to share their mole recipes with me. I guess that's a well-guarded secret in Mexico! But in all seriousness, the warmth and kindness of people, the vibrant culture and the incredible landscapes leave me in awe of this great country.  <br/> TB: Many Mexicans are fascinated by Indian culture. What cultural ties between India and Mexico are you looking to promote or emphasize? <br/> PS: It is quite heartening to witness Mexican admiration for Indian culture. India and Mexico are two ancient civilizations and we are proud of our history, culture and traditions. The Mexican Nobel Laureate and ambassador Octavio Paz beautifully captured these similarities in his writings. To further build upon this, there's a need to weave a bond of shared experiences that transcends geographical boundaries. <br/> One way we are bringing India closer to Mexico is through the Gurudev Tagore Indian Cultural Center. Not only have we opened the doors to our friends in Mexico to celebrate the Indian festivals together in Mexico City, but we have also brought various cultural troupes and organized cultural programs in different cities of Mexico to enable a deeper exploration of language, literature and traditional practices. I invite all my Mexican friends to be part of our celebrations and enjoy the various dance, yoga, music and other classes on offer. <br/>India has been a regular participant of the Cervantino and Santa Lucia cultural festivals, as well as FINI (International Image Festival) and FIL (International Book Fair). Cultural engagements with local institutions are as important. We have a few major events planned in the coming weeks, such as an 'India Day' in partnership with the Ibero-American University and an Indian film festival to be held in various cities of Mexico. <br/> Our hope is to create a greater understanding that goes beyond stereotypes, forging a strong bridge between the people of India and Mexico. However, governments are just one part of this kind of cultural bonding. It is the people who are the real ambassadors of culture, and we are proud to have a vibrant Indian community living across Mexico, which has done commendable work in bringing the two countries closer. <br/> For updates on Indian government initiatives in Mexico, follow the Embassy of India in Mexico on X[2]. <br/> This article is the third in Mexico News Daily's 'India in Focus' series.

)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thousands ordered to flee wildfires advancing on one of the largest cities in Canada's far north crammed into a local airport on Thursday to board emergency evacuation flights, as convoys snaked south to safety on the only open highway.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The order late Wednesday to evacuate Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories marked the latest chapter of a terrible summer for wildfires in Canada, with tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes and vast swathes of land scorched.</p><p>Tiffany Champagne was one of many awaiting flights at the airport in Yellowknife.</p><p>\"I have asthma and the wildfire smoke was making it increasingly difficult to do anything,\" Champagne, wearing a face mask, told the CBC. \"I'm just kind of mentally checked out at this point.\"</p><p>As of early Thursday, more than 1,000 wildfires were burning, including about 230 in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>More than 20,000 residents of Yellowknife, the regional capital, have been given until noon Friday to leave by road or on commercial and military flights.</p><p>\"We're all tired of the word unprecedented, yet there is no other way to describe this situation in the Northwest Territories,\" regional premier Caroline Cochrane said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty warned drivers that the flames were skirting the edges of highways and they would encounter limited visibility as thick smoke turned the sky orange.</p><p>Flights to nearby Alberta province were scheduled to depart Yellowknife starting at 1:00 pm (1900 GMT) Thursday.</p><p>\"Kilometers of vehicles started leaving yesterday, and there were folks flying out yesterday and today,\" she told public broadcaster CBC.</p><p>A wildfire was within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of Yellowknife on Thursday.</p><p>Yellowknife declared an emergency earlier this week, and that was soon expanded across the huge northern territory as firefighters were forced to pull back in some areas.</p><p>Strong winds stoked the flames, and several towns and Indigenous communities were already under evacuation orders.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, our wildfire situation has taken another turn for the worse with a fire burning west of Yellowknife now representing a real threat to the city,\" NW Territories environment minister Shane Thompson told reporters late Wednesday.</p><p>\"Without rain, it is possible (the fire) will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\"</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would \"assist however we can.\"</p><p>Several military aircraft were dispatched along with more than 120 soldiers to help beat back the flames.</p><p>In what had already been declared the Northwest Territories' largest-ever evacuation, the emptying of Yellowknife now means half the population of the near-Arctic territory will soon be displaced.</p><p>On Monday, the Canadian military started airlifting residents of smaller communities in the region to safety after roads were engulfed in flames.</p><p>For many, it was the second time in recent months that residents were forced to leave their homes.</p><p>Separated by several hundreds of kilometers, most of the villages in the territory are difficult to evacuate by land, officials said.</p><p>Images shared on social media and on Canadian television showed large swaths of blackened forests.</p><p>On those cars and trucks that made it out before roads became impassable, headlights were melted and paint peeled off the vehicles.</p><p>On social media, Maggie Noble said the escape from Yellowknife was \"slow going\" in the darkness, taking her sister five hours to drive just 100 kilometers.</p><p>According to wildfire official Mike Westwick, the situation \"continues to be critical, with thick smoke hampering efforts to bring the blazes under control.</p><p>The evacuation of Yellowknife is the second time a Canadian city has been cleared due to wildfires since 100,000 residents of Fort McMurray in Alberta's oil and gas producing heartland were forced out in
