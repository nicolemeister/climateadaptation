We're a long way from declaring victory,\" the captain of the fire service for the local Var region, Olivier Pecot, told AFP. <br/>\"The wind has picked up, has changed direction slightly, and the fire is starting to spread in areas that hadn't been impacted,\" he added. <br/> People on the beach watch a Canadair aircraft fill its tank from the sea in the bay of Saint-Tropez.

It is a disaster,\" said Concha Agero, deputy director of the French Office of Biodiversity, adding that the reserve \"is one of the last spots sheltering the Hermann tortoise.\" <br/>Charred power lines lay on the ground Tuesday, as well as vines in place. <br/>Many trees were burnt around their trunks but their branches were intact, suggesting the fire had ripped through at speed. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162922262869325879100134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D1-4X01-JCMN-Y0C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><timeReceived>5:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 17, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001TJO</classCode><className>BOMBARDIER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC3721 AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>BBD.A (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

It's burning on both sides of Salmon River Road, and crews are working to reduce the impact to recreationalists, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's Inciweb page[1]. The area is a popular launch point for boaters on the main stretch of the Salmon River and take-out spot for boaters on the Salmon's Middle Fork, according to Amy Baumer, public affairs officer with the Salmon-Challis National Forest, which currently reports 'very high' fire danger[2]. Fires start easily and can spread quickly when conditions reach very high.[3] <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.org/mt-fire-report-2022\">https://montanafreepress.org/mt-fire-report-2022</url>/ What else you need to know: <br/> 07.15.202207.18.2022  <br/> 07.14.202207.15.2022  <br/> 07.14.202207.14.2022  <br/><br/><br/>The Hog Trough Fire east of Hamilton is adding to the smoke in southwest Montana. At about 50 acres as of Tuesday morning, the lightning-sparked fire is burning in a scar from fires in the 2000s. According to the Bitterroot National Forest Facebook page[4], the fire was unstaffed as of Monday due to the remote and rugged location. The Gird Point Lookout is watching the fire for growth and reports back to fire managers with the Bitterroot and Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forests. <br/>Fire danger in the Bitterroot National Forest is listed as high.[5] In response to high temperatures and windy conditions, Ravalli County on July 18 declared a burn ban for the remainder of the summer.[6] <br/>Smoke from the Hog Trough and Moose fires is expected to move east and reduce visibility [7]through the I-90 corridor from Butte to Bozeman. <br/>On July 16, the Moors Mountain Fire [8]in the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness outside of Helena burned about 90 acres and shot smoke high onto the valley's horizon. A lightning storm Thursday night and Friday morning is likely to blame for the ignition, according to Chiara Cipriano, public affairs officer with the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest. <br/>Fire retardant was dropped on the ridgeline and five smokejumpers set up an anchor point to manage the fire. The next day, a 20-person crew hiked to the location and a team traveled from central Montana to assist the local response. <br/> related <url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.org/2021/10/15/montana-fire-season-2021/\">https://montanafreepress.org/2021/10/15/montana-fire-season-2021/</url> Fire season 2021: Early to start, late to finish, and smoky in the middle[9] The state's first major winter storm dropped snow on parts of southern Montana early this week, signaling the final act of an active fire season that had prompted Gov. Greg Gianforte to issue a wildfire emergency declaration in July and mobilize hundreds of National Guard troops to assist in suppression efforts. <br/><br/><br/>On July 18, two hand crews and six aircraft worked the fire. Containment was unknown as of Tuesday. <br/>Everyone's keeping an eye on the winds, Cipriano said. On Monday it was blowing east toward private property and crews were working the east and north sides of the fire, digging fire lines in an attempt to mitigate property damage. Those winds didn't push the fire eastward, Cipriano said, and aren't a current concern. The Great Falls branch of the National Weather Service reported wind gusts of 54 mph at the Helena Regional Airport on July 18, and gusts up to 77 mph at the Cut Bank airport in Glacier County on Tuesday. <br/>'The next 10 days look hot and dry so I think it's a valid concern that this is a time to be taking all the fire precautions seriously.' Chiara Cipriano, public affairs officer, Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest <br/>The Jellison Fire[10], also near Helena on the eastern end of the Little Belt Mountains, was caused by lightning. Reported on July 12, the fire was well under control in about four days and is now 100% contained. A combination of moisture and few fires competing for resources has made responding and extinguishing fires easier so far this summer than last, Cipriano said. <br/>'The next 10 days look hot and dry so I think it's a valid concern that this is a time to be taking all the fire precautions seriously,' Cipriano said Monday. <br/>The lightning-caused Wilks Gulch Fire, 100% contained as of July 13, burned just east of Hot Springs. <br/>On Monday, Missoula County banned outdoor burning and bumped its fire danger to high[11]. All of the state's national forests, excepting the Beaverhead-Deerlodge, are reporting moderate or higher fire danger as of Tuesday. The Ashland and Sioux ranger districts in the Custer-Gallatin National Forest are reporting very high fire danger. <br/>The National Interagency Coordinating Center expects hot, dry and breezy conditions and drying fuels to activate fires faster and make them more resistant to control[12] over the coming week. <br/> latest stories GOP approves platform calling for total ban on abortion, hand-counting ballots and adherence to the party line[13] A majority of the delegates to the 2022 Republican Party Platform Convention repeatedly approved amendments to the platform that steer the party further to the right at a time when it already enjoys near-historic control over the state. <br/><br/> Recounts results confirm Bukacek won utility board GOP primary[14] Ballot recounts conducted in four counties, which concluded Monday, confirm that Flathead Valley internal medicine doctor Ann 'Annie' Bukacek has won the Republican primary for a seat on the five-member board that regulates the state's monopoly utility power, water, garbage and telecommunications companies.

It's an essential component of lab instruction for many Virginia Tech faculty in the College of Natural Resources and Environment, including Carolyn Copenheaver, an associate professor who teaches forest ecology.</p><p>But because these outdoor labs don't take place in a traditional classroom, students often let their guards down.</p><p>A few years ago, Copenheaver was approached by female students sharing their experiences of harassment in the field.</p><p>That's when she realized that something had to change.</p><p>Fast forward a few years, and Copenheaver now is leading a charge to address sexual misconduct and harassment in her courses, which all involve field labs. In the process, she has become an outspoken resource for helping other faculty to maneuver this delicate topic.</p><p>In October, Copenheaver, along with three other colleagues, published the results of numerous focus group discussions with faculty at universities across the country. The discussions centered on how to address and prevent sexual harassment in higher education agriculture and natural resources programs with outdoor lab spaces.</p><p>The findings, which outline a list of best practices for faculty, were published in the North American College and Teachers of Agriculture journal. The work was funded by a USDA Higher Education Challenge Grant, and Copenheaver said she hopes to apply for another grant to continue this work.</p><p>She also has spoken with several professional groups about the work.</p><p>For many years, even during her own time in college, Copenheaver said she normalized some of the behavior and language that she heard in her forestry classes. She chalked up the language to the fact that the majority of students in those courses are male and some of the words were spoken as jokes. For example, in some of her classes for forestry majors at Virginia Tech, there may be only one female student among an all-male roster.</p><p>Copenheaver herself was one of few females in her master's and doctoral programs, and she now recalls being a victim of sexual harassment. She heard certain language so often that she assumed it was what women had to endure in her field.</p><p>\"I didn't even know that's what it was,\" she said.</p><p>Others who worked with Copenheaver for the project include Adam Coates, an assistant professor of forest fire ecology and management at Virginia Tech; Adam Downing, a Virginia Cooperative Extension agent for agriculture, natural resources, and forestry in the Northern District; and Saskia van de Gevel, department chair and professor of geography and planning at Appalachian State University.</p><p>After talking with faculty from at least 10 universities, Downing said it was clear that many found it difficult to talk about sexual harassment in front of their students.</p><p>\"There are words in this realm that people don't want to say out loud,\" he said. \"We need to be able to do that to have meaningful conversations. I think just looking for opportunities to have these conversations, not just checking the boxes that 'I got my Title IX training done,' would have some good outcomes.\"</p><p>After hearing from her students, Copenheaver sought help about what she could do and change from Anthony Scott, chief of inclusion and belonging in the Division of Student Affairs at Virginia Tech.</p><p>Scott said that it is essential that faculty address these issues in front of their students and see this as an important teaching opportunity.</p><p>\"We are supposed to be preparing these students to go out in the world and make a difference,\" he said. \"We can no longer continue to suggest through our silence that issues of equity and diversity and inclusion and belonging, that these issues aren't just as important as figuring out a mathematical formula.\"</p><p>In the fall semester, Copenheaver initiated conversations about sexual harassment with her students and included explicit expectations in her syllabi. She will continue doing this going forward.</p><p>Copenheaver's research into these topics is unique to many agriculture and natural resources programs, said Wendy Fink, who is executive director of the academic programs section, and assistant vice president of food, agriculture, and natural resources at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. Copenheaver presented her work for a subcommittee of the APLU this past summer.</p><p>\"I think her research is very much needed in the fields of agriculture and natural resources,\" Fink said. \"Raising awareness on how to prevent sexual harassment or assault, including through bystander training and creating a culture that encourages reporting, remains critical to creating safer working and learning environments for everyone.\"</p><p>Natalie Hedrick, a junior who is majoring in forestry at Virginia Tech, said she appreciates that Copenheaver is talking with her classes about how to treat one another appropriately.</p><p>\"I think it's a conversation that needs to happen in every major within colleges,\" she said. \"It's better to say it 1,000 times than one. The repetition is key with people our age. Especially when we go out into the field, language does change.\"</p><p>Hedrick said Copenheaver helps her students feel that they are a part of a community.</p><p>\"You don't feel uncomfortable asking questions,\" Hedrick said.</p><p>This is the kind of environment that Copenheaver wants to continue to foster - one in which students are not afraid to come to her with any questions or concerns.</p><p>\"If we're not comfortable with it, if you have a student who is a victim, they will sense that you are uncomfortable, and they will never come to you,\" she said. \"My goal is to be clear in my communication about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable in my classroom space. And my classroom space extends beyond the four walls where we have lectures. If I'm there, you're in my class.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124953994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64J6-FRM1-JCBF-S0CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1040\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 14, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The five grants will generate more than $980,000 in matching contributions for a total conservation impact of $1.56 million.</p><p>The grants were awarded through the Southwest Rivers Program, a partnership between NFWF and the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Trinchera Blanca Foundation, an affiliate of The Moore Charitable Foundation, founded by Louis Bacon.</p><p>\"Headwater streams in the Southwest are critical to not only support native fish and wildlife, but also to storing water that can support downstream communities and farms during dry spells,\" said Jeff Trandahl, executive director and CEO of NFWF. \"These projects will restore streams and meadows that provide essential habitat for native fish like Gila trout and Rio Grande chub and also address watershed impacts from forest fire and drought.\"</p><p>The projects supported by the five grants announced today will address two key strategies for species and habitat restoration in headwaters streams of the Rio Grande and Gila River: 1) increasing water availability for species and their habitats; and 2) riparian and instream habitat restoration and enhancement.

It was a reckoning.</p><p><br/>The tech giants that have shaped our lives, online and off, over the course of the 21st century have at last hit a wall. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple all saw their valuations fall, sometimes precipitously. Many <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/09/tech-layoffs-2022.html\">slashed</url> their workforces; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/14/1136659617/tech-layoffs-amazon-meta-twitter\">at least 120,000</url> tech workers lost their jobs this year. The myth of the genius founder, which insulated so many of these giants from so much criticism for so long, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/elon-musk-texts-twitter-trial-jack-dorsey/671619/?utm_source=feed\">was debunked before our eyes</url>.<br/>These companies, launched with promises to connect the world, to think different, to make information free to all, to democratize technology, have spent much of the past decade making the sorts of moves that large corporations trying to grow ever larger have historically made-embracing profit over safety, market expansion over product integrity, and rent seeking over innovation-but at much greater scale, speed, and impact. Now, ruled by monopolies, marred by toxicity, and over-reliant on precarious labor, Silicon Valley looks like it's finally run hard up into its limits.<br/>Call it the improbable paradox of the modern tech giant. Some of the most powerful, profitable, and expansive companies in human history-associated at least nominally with wide-ranging innovation-are stuck. They're failing utterly to create the futures they've long advertised, or even to maintain the versions they were able to muster. Having scaled to immense size, they're unable or unwilling to manage the digital communities they've built. They're paralyzed when it comes to product development and reduced to monopolistic practices such as charging rents and copying or buying up smaller competitors. Antitrust investigations beckon. Their policies <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/329666/views-big-tech-worsen-public-wants-regulation.aspx\">tend to please no one</url>; it's <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1456&amp;amp;context=elj\">a common refrain</url> that antipathy toward Big Tech companies is one of the few truly bipartisan issues.<br/>You can just feel it, the cumulative weight of this stagnation, in the tech that most of us encounter every day. The act of scrolling past the same dumb ad to peer at the same bad news on the same glass screen on the same social network: This is the stuck future. There is a sense that we have reached the end of the internet, and no one wants to be left holding the bag.<br/>How these companies respond to this troubled new era will have major repercussions. This is why throughout 2022, we've been pitched a mishmash of virtual- and augmented-reality projects and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/620538/?utm_source=feed\">\"metaverse\" concepts</url>. It's why the tech giants that preside over today's toxic online communities are now promising to force them onto our faces. It's why there's brewing resentment among <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1605520628810776577\">certain</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/elon-musk-blames-activists-twitter-155302421.html\">tech-industry heavyweights</url> who believe <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/19/peter-thiel-facebook-new-right/\">they've seen their visions stymied</url>. It's why others are jumping ship, leaving massive planks of online infrastructure open to acquisition and further disarray.<br/>There's a palpable exhaustion with the whole enterprise, with the men who set out to build the future or at least get rich, and who accomplished only one and a half of those things.<br/><br/>The most obvious example of tech's quagmire, of course, is Twitter. From his overinflated bid to buy the company for a price that doubled as a weed joke to his catastrophic tenure as CEO, Elon Musk and his tortured dalliance with the social network was the most-watched tech saga of the year. By November, Musk had slashed half the staff and reinstated some of the site's most controversial banned users, including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-twitter-reinstates-neo-nazi-andrew-anglin-account-1234640390/\">neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin</url> and former President <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/musk-restores-trump-twitter-liberal-resistance/672208/?utm_source=feed\">Donald Trump</url>. He used his new perch to promote right-wing conspiracies, to mock nonbinary people and Anthony Fauci, and to suspend journalists. Advertisers balked and paused spending on the platform. Prominent users sent farewell tweets. Now, at the end of the year, amid <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-technology-business-lawsuits-san-francisco-05386baf1788168fb27c8a35bfe366c7\">lawsuits</url>, potential <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-executives-could-face-big-ftc-fines-former-officials-2022-11-14/\">Federal Trade Commission</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/30/eu-raises-prospect-of-big-fine-or-ban-if-twitter-fails-to-follow-new-legislation\">European Union law violations</url>, a shriveled staff, and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/technology/elon-musk-twitter-shakeup.html\">mounting pile of unpaid bills</url>, Twitter's future is very much in question.<br/>But the relentless Musk/Twitter drama shouldn't overshadow the conditions that allowed it to erupt in the first place: The platform has been in a state of arrested development for a long time. It has struggled to add users and to keep toxic content, abusive accounts, and disinformation off its platform. It's popular among a subset of people-especially comedians, journalists, and politicians-but it hasn't turned a profit since 2019, and even then, profit-turning was a rarity. It's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-elon-musks-twitter-faces-mountain-of-debt-falling-revenue-and-surging-costs-11669042132#:~:text=Twitter%20is%20and%20was%20a,%241.14%20billion%20the%20previous%20year.\">posted a loss</url> in eight of the past 10 years.<br/>Twitter has always presented itself as a crucial online public square. If that were the case, why was Twitter's board so quick to hand over the keys to a notoriously thin-skinned and often malicious troll? The answer is as simple as it is cynical: \"The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders,\" Bret Taylor, Twitter's independent board chair, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html\">said in a press release</url>. The money saw the writing on the wall and got out while the getting was good. They knew what a mess Twitter was and perhaps even had the sense, like many of us do, that the era of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/?utm_source=feed\">social media may be ending altogether</url>.<br/>The company, we were reminded this year, has long been dysfunctional. In August, when Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, submitted a whistleblower complaint alleging major vulnerabilities at the company, he described a security culture so lax that at any given time, an employee could access a U.S. senator's account with no oversight. Foreign-intelligence agents, he claimed, could and had infiltrated Twitter's inner ranks with ease. Zatko blamed Twitter's executives for placing profit over safety and for running, as he said, \"a company that was managed by risk and by crises, instead of one that manages risk and crises.\"<br/>The revelations echoed those that wracked Facebook the year before, when Frances Haugen alleged that the world's largest social-media network had, among other things, allowed regimes to use the platform to fan ethnic violence.<br/>The big social networks are stuck. And there is little profit incentive to get them unstuck. That, after all, would require investing heavily in content moderators, empowering trust and safety teams, and penalizing malicious viral content that brings in huge traffic. Instead, Musk's Twitter opted to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139822833/twitter-covid-misinformation-policy-not-enforced\">no longer enforce</url> a policy against COVID misinformation, or Facebook's \"cross-check\" system that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/06/meta-protecting-business-partners\">shielded valuable high-profile users</url> from moderation. Rather than drafting and implementing robust policies to address toxicity, harassment, and user security, the networks' leadership has opted, essentially, to ignore the problems. Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey up and bailed, first as CEO in the fall of 2021, then from the company's board altogether this spring.<br/>Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has apparently become so disillusioned with reality that he decided to try to invent a new one, and to shovel us all into it. For example: When Meta held its Connect conference in October to showcase its progress on the metaverse, the stars of the show were, well, legs. That lone syllable quickly became a comic shorthand for the entire event: Meta's big breakthrough, after a year and $15 billion spent trying to build its metaverse, was that its pixelated cartoon avatars had pixelated appendages now. (The mockery that followed was especially acute after it turned out that Meta had even <url normalizedValue=\"https://kotaku.com/zuckerberg-facebook-meta-legs-feet-video-vr-staged-fake-1849656315\">faked the legs</url>.) The bluster did accomplish what <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/620538/?utm_source=feed\">the company's metaverse was built to do in the first place</url>, though: distract us from the fact that Facebook's user growth has slowed to a crawl, that the platform is losing ground to TikTok, and that it's mired in controversy and moderation woes. With each passing day, Facebook's metaverse aspirations look more like a Hail Mary fantasy, a beleaguered CEO's escape attempt to a 3-D virtual world where he might leave behind the misery of his dull 2-D version.<br/>The company has lost hundreds of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-stock-down-earnings-700-billion-in-lost-value/\">billions of dollars</url> in value this year. It laid off more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/\">11,000 people</url>, or 13 percent of its staff, in November.<br/><br/>It's not just social media that's in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/?utm_source=feed\">decline</url>, already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/instagram-tiktok-twitter-social-media-competition/672305/?utm_source=feed\">over</url>, or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zy7m/social-media-entering-flop-era?utm_source=email&amp;amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;amp;utm_content=daily&amp;amp;utm_campaign=221213\">worse</url>.<br/>In September, when Apple held its annual iPhone-launch event, few were surprised when its newest models <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/iphone-14-apple-annual-upgrade-improvements/671380/?utm_source=feed\">were nearly identical</url> to the past dozen or so. And just weeks before, news broke that the Department of Justice was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/26/justice-department-antitrust-apple-00053939\">considering a sweeping antitrust lawsuit</url> against the tech giant for anticompetitive practices. As its mighty iPhone sales figures have plateaued and its business has grown more conservative-it hasn't released a culturally significant new product line since 2016's AirPods-Apple has begun to embrace advertising.<br/>Over the summer, Apple began allowing companies to buy ads on the front page of the App Store. In October, reports surfaced that Apple was <url normalizedValue=\"https://digiday.com/media/apple-is-quietly-pushing-a-tv-ad-product-with-media-agencies/\">exploring ads for its TV+ service</url> too. \"Apple Is an Ad Company Now,\" Wired <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-is-an-ad-company-now/\">declared</url>. Meanwhile, the company is squeezing more out of the developers who rely on the App Store to distribute their work, reaping profits at a margin that in 2019 were alleged to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows#:~:text=Apple%20Inc.'s%20App%20Store,obtained%20from%20the%20iPhone%20maker.\">an eye-watering 78 percent</url>.<br/>But Apple isn't alone in its monopoly-growth pangs. Google continues to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://digiday.com/media/the-rundown-here-are-the-2022-global-media-rankings-by-ad-spend-google-facebook-remain-dominate-alibaba-bytedance-in-the-mix/\">the world's largest ad company</url> and rakes in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02a46d8b-bf4a-4c88-b0c3-f2df02fcf88b\">nearly 60 percent</url> of its business from search listings. It makes money from its YouTube ads and cloud business too, but its fundamentals remain largely the same as a decade ago. Yet as Google has consolidated its monopoly, the quality of its flagship search product <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90673924/its-not-just-you-google-search-really-is-getting-worse\">has gotten worse</url>. Result pages are cluttered with ads that must be scrolled through in order to find the \"~organic\"' items, and there's reason to think <url normalizedValue=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/is-google-getting-worse/\">the quality of the results has gotten worse over time</url> as well. (Internet users delighted in sharing <url normalizedValue=\"https://petapixel.com/2022/07/13/google-says-young-people-using-instagram-and-tiktok-to-search/\">reports</url> that young people are turning to TikTok and Instagram instead of Google to search the web.) YouTube, meanwhile, is facing many of the same policy quagmires as Facebook and Twitter, especially when it comes to content moderation-and similarly failing to meaningfully address them.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/google-search-algorithm-internet/661325/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The open secret of Google Search</url>]<br/>Like Apple, as its core product-search-has been seeing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-alphabet-googl-q2-earnings-report-2022-11658802135\">revenues level off</url> for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/15/11614714/digital-ad-report-google-hitting-plateau-on-search-feeling-heat-from\">a while now</url>, Google has behaved less like the tech innovator of its mythology and more like a monopoly of world-swallowing corporations past. It has thrown its weight around to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/doj-poised-to-sue-google-over-ad-market-as-soon-as-september\">ensure that it dominates the digital-ad marketplace</url> and turned further toward Goliath-scale rent seeking, both <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/google-play-eu-antitrust/\">in its own app store</url>, Google Play, and in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/cloud-hardware-among-divisions-that-outpaced-googles-soaring-headcount\">expansion of its Cloud business</url>. As a result, Google, too, is facing antitrust action from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/doj-poised-to-sue-google-over-ad-market-as-soon-as-september?leadSource=uverify%20wall\">the Department of Justice</url>-little surprise, given that it controls the world's dominant search engine, web browser, and mobile-device operating system all at once. Google's quest for new revenue streams has led it to a place where so many of the once-idealistic tech giants seem to have wound up-at the Department of Defense. In December, the Pentagon announced that it had extended a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nextgov.com/cxo-briefing/2022/12/amazon-google-microsoft-oracle-awarded-9b-pentagon-cloud-contract/380596/\">$9 billion DOD contract</url> to Google-along with Oracle, Amazon, and Microsoft-to help build a \"tactical cloud.\"<br/>Keep in mind that Amazon makes the bulk of its profits-when it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2022/04/28/amazon-loses-38-billion-in-profits-but-andy-jassy-is-not-concerned/?sh=172e3d33656e\">turns</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1196256/it-took-amazon-amzn-14-years-to-make-as-much-net-profit-as-it-did-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2017/\">them</url>-from its Amazon Web Services cloud-internet business. Despite Amazon's behemoth size and e-commerce imprint, its margins on its retail business are thin-last quarter, it <url normalizedValue=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx\">logged a loss</url>. Amazon has expanded relentlessly on the back of AWS profits, low consumer prices, and what amounts to systematic worker exploitation. Now that growing numbers of its workers across the nation are standing up and organizing, its equation is in jeopardy. It's little surprise that the company has opposed the Amazon Labor Union and <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/amazon-refuses-to-make-peace-with-unions-even-after-the-1849839810\">continues to contest</url> the result of warehouse workers' historic vote last April to unionize at a Staten Island fulfillment center. In November, in response to a National Labor Relations Board complaint, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-region-29-wins-federal-court-order-requiring-amazon-to-cease-and\">federal court ordered Amazon</url> to cease and desist its practice of \"firing employees for protected activities.\"<br/>Some of Amazon's most famous projects and products also hit spectacular walls this year. Back in March, we learned that Amazon's prototype delivery drones <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-04-10/amazon-drone-crashes-delays-put-bezos-s-delivery-dream-at-risk?leadSource=uverify%20wall\">kept crashing in test flights</url>; one even started a forest fire in Oregon. Alexa, Amazon's ubiquitous virtual assistant, is apparently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-job-layoffs-rise-and-fall-2022-11\">losing billions of dollars a quarter</url>-enough to be deemed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/\">\"colossal failure\"</url> by a former employee-and was the division hit hardest when <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/amazon-begins-layoffs-of-up-to-10000-jobs-blames-uncertain-economy/\">the company began slashing thousands of jobs</url> this past fall. (Amazon's CEO announced that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23465169/amazon-layoffs-continuing-2023-ceo-andy-jassy\">more job cuts were coming in 2023</url> too.)<br/>Aside from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/aws-earnings-q1-2022.html\">renting out more access to its web infrastructure</url>, Amazon's road to perpetually expanding profits lies in opening more fulfillment centers and working more employees to the bone using sophisticated and punitive surveillance and productivity systems-a proposition that is running up against a rising labor movement, a tight employment market, and a public that supports union drives at Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://perfectunion.us/poll-americans-strongly-support-unionizing-amazon-workers/\">by overwhelming margins</url>.<br/><br/>What a grim outcome for the internet, where the possibilities were once believed to be endless and where users were promised an infinite spectrum of possibility to indulge their creativity, build robust communities, and find their best expression, even when they could not do so in the real world. Big Tech, of course, never predicated its business models on enabling any of that, though its advertising and sloganeering may have suggested otherwise. Rather, companies' ambitions were always focused on being the biggest: having the most users, selling the most devices, locking the most people into their walled gardens and ecosystems. The stuckness we're seeing is the result of some of the most ambitious companies of our generation succeeding wildly yet having no vision beyond scale-no serious interest in engaging the civic and social dimensions of their projects.<br/>So it's fitting that Elon Musk has come to dominate the conversation about the tech sector at the moment it's most sharply fallen short of its lofty promises. Silicon Valley has always been built on the mythology of the heroic founder, and few come more thoroughly shrouded in myth than Musk-and this was a year in which that mythology unraveled.<br/>Musk was once the actual <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a40871355/tony-stark-iron-man-elon-musk/\">inspiration for the cinematic Iron Man</url>: He was believed by many to be a superhero capable of creating electric cars, sending rockets to Mars, and delivering the future to all of us. Now he's the thrashing, bullheaded avatar of Big Tech in the 2020s: unfathomably rich and powerful but also lodged in the mud, amplifying toxicity and discord, and at distinct risk of entering a sustained decline.<br/>Or take Elizabeth Holmes, whose unicorn start-up Theranos was once a darling of Silicon Valley, and who was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/technology/elizabeth-holmes-sentence-theranos.html\">sentenced in November to more than 11 years in prison</url> for defrauding investors about her company's technology, which never worked. Or Sam Bankman-Fried, the erstwhile crypto wunderkind and champion of effective altruists who was embraced by the Democratic Party, and who promised to help usher in the age of cryptocurrency with his exchange, FTX, and to work to improve the lives of future humans everywhere. He ends the year bankrupt, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/nyregion/sbf-bail-agreement-explained.html\">out on bond</url>, and accused of multiple counts of fraud. Customers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ftx-bankruptcy-funds-returned-sam-bankman-fried/\">may never get back the money</url> they entrusted to Bankman-Fried's collapsed exchange. So perhaps it's not just Big Tech but the very model that engendered it-in which a visionary is entrusted with millions to invent the future, with scant oversight-that has hit a wall.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/sbf-ftx-downfall-cryptocurrency-regulation-future/672461/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Sam Bankman-Fried got what he wanted</url>]<br/>There's an air of irony that, as we close out the year, the latest buzzing industry trend is automated image and text generation. Tools such as OpenAI's DALL-E and ChatGPT use huge neural networks to try to assemble new-looking products from massive expanses of old data that has been vacuumed up from the internet as Big Tech has made and managed it-images, articles, and posts created in service of feeding the platform incentives of the Web 2.0 monopolies.<br/>It's telling to see who is most excited about these tools: founders and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-openai-cost-regulations/672539/?utm_source=feed\">investors</url>. Some of the images have gone viral, but there's already an accompanying weariness and plenty of pushback from working artists and illustrators. And no matter how wondrous, it's seemingly only a matter of time before these platforms get bought or cloned by the giants, or turned into some onerous subscription-fee service that will steamroll the human creators of the source material. This is Silicon Valley again making a show of preparing to devour its own tail.<br/>Somewhere in here, Big Tech's AI generators seem to be insisting, amid the last internet we spoiled, that there has to be something new. Something we can use. They shouldn't be so certain.<br/>This article has been updated to reflect that Sam Bankman-Fried has been released from federal custody on bond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-bigtechfalltwittermetaamazon672598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:676J-WFW1-DYY9-J320-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2832\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The national forest surrounding it announced a full closure set to begin later this week \u2014 the first time that has happened since 2006.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Intense heat that has hampered firefighting efforts more broadly was expected to moderate in the coming days. But, the National Weather Service noted it could bring uncertainty for fire crews.</p><p>\u201cThe humidity and the possibility of some scattered rainfall is a good thing,\" said meteorologist Andrew Taylor. \"The lightning is not a good thing.\u201d</p><p>In California, firefighters still faced the difficult task of trying to contain a large forest fire in rugged coastal mountains south of Big Sur that forced the evacuation of a Buddhist monastery and nearby campground.</p><p>In New Mexico, lightning-sparked blazes have been scorching the southern part of the state where a large portion of the Gila Wilderness remains closed, and fire officials are closely watching the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.</p><p>More land has burned across Arizona so far to date with new wildfire starts quickly shifting resources. While humans are to blame for an overwhelming majority of wildfires, lightning started a 31-square mile (80-square kilometer) blaze west of Sedona that was moving toward Flagstaff.</p><p>A top-tier management team had been ordered to oversee the blaze that's burning in grass, juniper, chaparral and ponderosa pine.</p><p>Some campers already evacuated, and residents of rural areas have been told to prepare to evacuate on a moment's notice, said Coconino County sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton.</p><p>If the fire continues its northeastern push, hundreds of people in Flagstaff \u2014 a college city about two hours north of Phoenix \u2014 also could be impacted, Paxton said.</p><p>Fire officials were mapping out a plan to starve the Rafael Fire of fuel as it moves through rugged terrain, canyons and wilderness, said fire information officer Dolores Garcia.</p><p>As of Monday, it was moving parallel to Interstate 40 along the Coconino and Yavapai county lines.

(AP) \u2014 Dozens of wildfires were burning in hot, dry conditions across the U.S. West, including a blaze touched off by lightning that was moving toward northern Arizona's largest city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The mountainous city of Flagstaff was shrouded in smoke Monday, and ash was falling from the sky. The national forest surrounding it announced a full closure set to begin later this week \u2014 the first time that has happened since 2006.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Intense heat that has hampered firefighting efforts more broadly was expected to moderate in the coming days. But, the National Weather Service noted it could bring uncertainty for fire crews.</p><p>\u201cThe humidity and the possibility of some scattered rainfall is a good thing,\" said meteorologist Andrew Taylor. \"The lightning is not a good thing.\u201d</p><p>In California, firefighters still faced the difficult task of trying to contain a large forest fire in rugged coastal mountains south of Big Sur that forced the evacuation of a Buddhist monastery and nearby campground.</p><p>In New Mexico, lightning-sparked blazes have been scorching the southern part of the state where a large portion of the Gila Wilderness remains closed, and fire officials are closely watching the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.</p><p>More land has burned across Arizona so far to date with new wildfire starts quickly shifting resources. While humans are to blame for an overwhelming majority of wildfires, lightning started a 31-square mile (80-square kilometer) blaze west of Sedona that was moving toward Flagstaff.</p><p>A top-tier management team had been ordered to oversee the blaze that's burning in grass, juniper, chaparral and ponderosa pine.</p><p>Some campers already evacuated, and residents of rural areas have been told to prepare to evacuate on a moment's notice, said Coconino County sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton.</p><p>If the fire continues its northeastern push, hundreds of people in Flagstaff \u2014 a college city about two hours north of Phoenix \u2014 also could be impacted, Paxton said.</p><p>Fire officials were mapping out a plan to starve the Rafael Fire of fuel as it moves through rugged terrain, canyons and wilderness, said fire information officer Dolores Garcia.</p><p>As of Monday, it was moving parallel to Interstate 40 along the Coconino and Yavapai county lines. The fire was about 16 miles from Flagstaff, but it's hard to say how quickly it was spreading through various terrain, Garcia said.</p><p>Two national forests in northern Arizona made rare announcements to close completely to visitors starting Wednesday because of concerns they won't have enough resources to respond to any future wildfires.</p><p>\u201cWe have limited resources, and we\u2019re tapped right now,\u201d said Brady Smith, a spokesman for the Coconino National Forest that surrounds Flagstaff.</p><p>The Coconino last issued a full closure in 2006. The nearby Kaibab National Forest, which borders the Grand Canyon, last fully closed in 2002. Both forests are popular for hiking, camping, fishing and other recreation because they sit at higher elevations and are much cooler than the state's desert areas.</p><p>Arizona is at the highest level of preparedness for wildfires. A large wildfire burning near Superior, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) west of Phoenix, was nearly 70% contained Monday. The 282-square-mile (730-square-kilometer) blaze was human-caused.</p><p>Residents near the small communities of Pine and Strawberry remain evacuated because of another wildfire that has danced among the treetops, with flames jumping ahead carried by wind. Some local roads also were closed.</p><p>Firefighting crews have yet to contain any of the wildfire's perimeter. The lightning-sparked blaze was estimated at 51 square miles (132 square kilometers) Monday and is being managed by a top-tier team.</p><p>Firefighters in Oregon were focused on two wildfires, one burning near the state's highest peak and another in the southern part of the state that was threatening 125 structures.</p><p>In Utah, several wildfires were burning in bone-dry conditions. The largest near the small town of Enterprise in southern Utah forced evacuations over the weekend. But homeowners were allowed to return as containment reached 50%. ___</p><p>Associated Press writer John Antczak in Los Angeles and Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-93aea01f8925d12f7f85be40e893cc8020210621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62YV-YB51-JC5B-G4WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><timeReceived>11:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 21, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These expected temperatures follow warm temperatures in recent weeks. Damage from freezing weather now can significantly reduce yields of certain fruits and vegetables that are in the flowering stage.</p><p>The DEP and Department of Agriculture are allowing these steps to protect farmers livelihoods and to ensure that consumers will be able to enjoy an ample supply of Jersey produce later this year.</p><p>The DEP intends to exercise its authority and discretion under the Air Pollution Control Code, N.J.A.C. 7:27, et seq., and other applicable authorities to permit the following procedure for open burning or the use of smudge pots to assist farmers to protect their crops in low temperatures.</p><p>Farmers who believe they will need to conduct open burns and/or use smudge pots must provide notice to the DEPs 24-hour Communications Center at 1-877- WARNDEP (1-877-927-6337).</p><p>Notification to DEP does not require the implementation of either technique but ensures proper procedures are followed should they become necessary.</p><p>If a farmer does not call DEP in advance but uses either technique, the farmer must notify DEP by 9 a.m. the following day. The farmer will be asked which technique was used.</p><p>Farmers must record the incident number provided to them by the Communications Center. The following information is to be provided:</p><p>Name of the individual making the decision to conduct the open burning/use of smudge pots and name of the farm;</p><p>Actual street address of the farm on which either technique will be used (no P.O. Boxes);</p><p>Telephone number of a contact at the farm;</p><p>Predicted temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at the agricultural operation when the technique will be used;</p><p>Wind speed anticipated when the technique will be used;</p><p>Predicted hours of open burning and/or use of smudge pots;</p><p>Materials expected to be burned.</p><p>At the time of the initial call to the Communications Center, farmers will be given an email address and incident number.</p><p>Within two days, they must submit to DEP via this email address the following information:</p><p>The DEP Communications Center incident number;</p><p>Ambient temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at the time the technique was used;</p><p>Actual wind speed at the orchard at the time the technique was used;</p><p>A statement verifying that all restrictions in the open burning or use of smudge pots were followed.</p><p>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and New Jersey Forest Fire Service caution all farmers and agriculture businesses with respect to the use of open burning in high wind velocity conditions. Please take note that farmers are encouraged to utilize smudge pots for warming as necessary during higher wind conditions.</p><p>Use of open burning when wind velocity is greater than 5 mph is strictly prohibited, may contribute to wildfire risk, and can carry significant penalties.</p><p>Smudge pots must be fueled only with either kerosene or No. 2 fuel oil.</p><p>Open burning can consist only of either the following materials: clean and untreated scrap lumber, felled trees, clippings pruned from trees and shrubs, hedgerows, or firewood. Absolutely no refuse, trade waste, tires or garbage of any type may be added to the authorized open burning material.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124408213</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62H2-4CG1-JCBF-S4X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 21, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WWJ</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000639</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X12</classCode><className>POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp; REMEDIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000049</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WWJ</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX577</classCode><className>TRENTON, NJ, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Because of this, some people have started to float ideas about other approaches intended to create a feeling of safety or coordination in this time of uncertainty. One phrase that keeps popping up is \"herd immunity.\" But what does that actually look like? And is it a good idea or even safe to be talking about? Detroit Today host Stephen Henderson digs into this theory and talks with an expert about what herd immunity is... and what it's not.</p><p>Listen by clicking the audio player above to find out the basics of herd immunity with Dr. Emily Martin</p><p>Guest:</p><p>Dr. Emily Martin, Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Martin says she usually wears a cow costume when teaching her students about herd immunity. She explains that herd immunity is about the number of people in a population who cannot be infected by a disease because they have already developed immunity to it. Because of that, the disease can't spread through the population anymore and thus, tires out. \"If everybody got infected, you wouldn't have a lot of transmission in a community,\" says Martin. \"The problem is - we're only at an immunity level of about 10 percent, so we have a long way to go.\"</p><p>\"If you think about a forest fire, you could say there's still a lot of dry wood that could set fire,\" explains Martin when talking about where we are currently at in terms of total population immunity. She also points out that this virus is unique. \"We are seeing evidence of long term effects for lung damage, cardiac changes and [we're] seeing people report fatigue for a long time after they have contracted COVID-19\", says Martin. As far as a light at the end of the tunnel, Martin says she is feeling optimistic about a vaccine. She says she's never seen a disease create a coordinated effort of this size, where there are so many people working on a vaccine at the same time.

Paul R. LePage issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Due to increased wildfire risk, fire occurrences, and staffing shortages, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Maine Forest Service (MFS) is temporarily halting issuing online open burning permits required for the outdoor burning of brush and wood debris. These conditions will remain in effect until the state sees an adequate level of precipitation. Also, MFS Director Patty Cormier is urging Maine's fire chiefs and town forest fire wardens to use extreme caution or suspend the issuance of written open burning brush permits.</p><p>Campfire permits, required for some remote campsites in unorganized towns, remain available. MFS reminds everyone to obtain landowner permission and seek campfire permits which are available from MFS. Recreational campfires on one's own property for cooking and warming, unless prohibited by local ordinance, do not require an open burning permit and are not subject to this suspension. The suspension of online permits for brush burning will continue until further notice.</p><p>\"While we are temporarily suspending Maine's online burning permit systems, we are also going to rely on the experience of our Forest Rangers and our dedicated partners in the municipal fire service to ensure that Maine is protected from this current wildfire threat,\" commented Cormier.</p><p>MAINE WILDFIRE UPDATE</p><p>Maine is experiencing an abnormally high number of wildfires. To date, Forest Rangers have responded to 712 fires, representing 871 acres. This is the second-highest fire count in 10 years, and it's only June. So far, there has been a 170% increase in wildfires caused by campfires compared to 2019.</p><p>CAMPFIRE SAFETY TIPS</p><p>* Before considering burning, check <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mainefireweather.org\">www.mainefireweather.org</url> for local fire conditions.</p><p>* Keep the fire small, not tall. That way, if you have to leave suddenly, it is easy to extinguish.</p><p>* The campfire should be at least 50 feet away from any structures and on level ground.</p><p>* Do not use accelerants to start your fire.</p><p>* Always have plenty of water on hand and tools available to put out the fire.</p><p>* When you are done, check the fire several times to ensure it is out.</p><p>* Supervise children and pets near the fire and never leave your fire unattended.

August 18, 2020</p><p>Over the last few years of frequent and intense wildfire seasons, many parts of the U.S. have experienced hazardous air quality for days on end. At the same time a number of low-cost air quality monitors have come on the market, allowing consumers to check the pollutant levels in their own homes and neighborhoods. So, air quality scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) wanted to know: are these low-cost monitors any good?</p><p>The answer is: yes -- to a degree.</p><p>Published recently in the journal Sensors, their study tested four models of low-cost air quality monitors during actual wildfire pollution events and found that their readings of PM2.5 -- or particulate matter under 2.5 microns, which has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular issues -- were consistently higher than the reference monitor used by the regulatory agencies; however, since each monitor had a relatively consistent response to the smoke, it is possible to use the readings to estimate true PM2.5 levels. Overall, the researchers concluded that the monitors can provide actionable information.</p><p>\"We compared the low-cost monitors to one that is used by regulatory agencies in air monitoring stations. It turns out their correlations are phenomenally good. When one goes up, the other goes up at the same time, and it is proportional. That gives us a lot of hope for being able to use them for real information,\" said Woody Delp, one of the lead authors of the study. \"And it could let someone know how well their new portable air filter is reducing smoke particles. But from an absolute point of view, it's becoming clear these sensors require some adjustments and checks to use the numbers.\"</p><p>For the study, titled \"Wildfire Smoke Adjustment Factors for Low-Cost and Professional PM2.5 Monitors with Optical Sensors,\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/13/3683\">https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/13/3683</url>\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer) Delp and co-author Brett Singer tested four low-cost air quality monitors:</p><p>IQAir AirVisual Pro</p><p>PurpleAir Indoor</p><p>Air Quality Egg</p><p>eLichens Indoor Air Quality Pro station</p><p>These devices, which cost in the range of a few hundred dollars, were compared to reference monitors used by regulatory agencies and researchers, which cost $20,000 or more. They also tested two monitors that are used by researchers and industrial hygienists and cost in the range of $5,000 to $10,000. Additionally, the researchers compared public data from PurpleAir PA-II monitors to nearby regulatory monitoring stations impacted by four wildfires in 2018.</p><p>Calibrations and adjustment factors</p><p>In the past, air quality monitoring has been limited to the high-priced professional monitors, making them inaccessible for personal use. The manufacturers recommend that the devices be calibrated to the specific pollution source of interest because the sensors use an optical sensing technique that responds differently to different sources. Pollution from a backyard barbecue or car exhaust may differ in size and density from pollution from a forest fire, and a forest fire may emit different types of particles than an urban fire.</p><p>The low-cost monitors use the same optical sensing technique -- estimating particle concentrations based on light scattering -- but use mass-produced optical sensors that are not as precisely machined as those in the professional-grade devices. In contrast, the most expensive monitors, those used by regulatory agencies, are calibrated using gravimetric analysis, which is based on the weight of particles.</p><p>With the air quality monitors deployed at Berkeley Lab inside a well-ventilated single-story laboratory building, the researchers collected data as the Camp Fire burned in Northern California in the fall of 2018. They found that the four low-cost monitors substantially overreported PM2.5 levels, by factors of 1.6 to 2.4 times higher than the readings on the regulatory reference monitor. However, the relative changes correlated well with both the regulatory and professional monitors.</p><p>The researchers calculated an adjustment factor of approximately 0.48 when using PurpleAir PA-II monitors outdoors during the Camp, Carr, and Mendocino Complex Fires in California and the Pole Creek Fire in Utah (meaning the readings should be multiplied by 0.48 to estimate the true PM2.5 level). This correction is very close to one of the data conversion options (\"LRAPA\") given on the PurpleAir website.</p><p>Good for other indoor pollutants too</p><p>In a separate study earlier this year, Delp and Singer, along with first author Zhiqiang Wang, evaluated six low-cost air quality monitors by comparing their output to reference PM2.5 and PM10 measurements from 21 common residential sources, such as frying, grilling, microwaving popcorn, vacuuming, and burning candles. The study (<url normalizedValue=\"https://indoor.lbl.gov/publications/performance-low-cost-indoor-air\">https://indoor.lbl.gov/publications/performance-low-cost-indoor-air</url>\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer), published in the journal Building and Environment, was an update to their 2018 study (<url normalizedValue=\"https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2018/08/22/mixed-report-card-for-low-cost-indoor-air-quality-home-monitors/\">https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2018/08/22/mixed-report-card-for-low-cost-indoor-air-quality-home-monitors/</url>).</p><p>They found that for most pollution sources, the low-cost monitors tracked with the professional ones within a factor of two for PM2.5. Delp said the consumer monitors \"enable people to identify activities that emit fine particulate matter inside their homes and to determine if operating filters or just keeping windows closed is effectively reducing exposure inside when there is very bad air pollution outside. For these purposes, they work as well as professional grade monitors, and appear to be very reliable.\"</p><p>\"We are impressed and excited by the usefulness and performance of these air quality monitors that cost under $300,\" said Singer, head of the Indoor Environment Group (<url normalizedValue=\"https://indoor.lbl.gov\">https://indoor.lbl.gov</url>/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer) in Berkeley Lab's Energy Technologies Area (<url normalizedValue=\"https://eta.lbl.gov\">https://eta.lbl.gov</url>/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer).</p><p>Both studies were supported by the Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Indoor Environments Division.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-EED818045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOVPUB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MC-95G1-DYVR-P0MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247474</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Energy Department Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Professor David Liu used \u201cbase editors\u201d in mice to correct the genetic mutation behind progeria, a rare condition characterized by premature aging, retarded development, and early death. Still, more work needs to be done before gene \u201cbase editors\u201d can be used in humans.</p><p>Initiating a revolution in genome editing, \u201cbase editors\u201d have received great global demand. They were distributed over 9,000 times to more than 3,000 laboratories around the world. Scientists were able to publish more than 300 papers on this technique, used in different organisms ranging from bacteria to mice.</p><p>\u201cBase editing\u201d is a precise genome editing method; like a genetic pencil, that rewrites DNA base letters, which cause genetic mutations and potentially genetic diseases. This technology, which is in constant development, chemically rewrites one DNA base to another by rearranging the atoms of one DNA base to resemble a different base. In 2019, Professor David Liu created with his team \u201cprime editing\u201d which offers more targeting flexibility and greater editing precision.</p><p>With over 75 issued U.S. patents, Professor Liu was referred to as the \u201cGene Corrector\u201d by Nature magazine topping its list of \u201cTen People Who Mattered This Year\u201d in 2017 and was included in the \u201cForeign Policy Leading Global Thinkers list\u201d. He is also a biotech entrepreneur, cofounding \u201cEditas Medicine\u201d, which uses CRISPR therapies (tool for editing genomes) to \u201cdiscover, develop, manufacture, and commercialize transformative, durable, and precise genomic medicines for a broad class of diseases\u201d.</p><p>The Science Prize (Mathematics) was awarded jointly to Professor\u202fMartin Hairer, Chair in Probability and Stochastic Analysis at Imperial College\u2019s Department of Mathematics, and to Professor\u202fNader Masmoudi, a distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the New York University of Abu Dhabi and head of his Research Center on Stability, Instability and Turbulence.</p><p>Professor Martin Hairer developed the theory of regularity structures which gave a precise mathematical meaning to several equations that were previously outside the scope of mathematical analysis. He published his theory in 2014 providing tools and manuals for solving many previously incomprehensible equations called the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). These equations involve chance and describe how randomness throws disorder into different phenomena like coin tossing, stock price changes, wind movement in a tunnel, or forest fire growth. He transformed the area of SPDEs by introducing fundamental new techniques and was able to solve equations like KPZ equation which describes the evolution of the boundary at which two substances meet over time.</p><p>Professor Hairer is a world leader in probability theory and analysis and has authored a monograph and over 100 research articles. His work has been distinguished with several prizes and awards, most notably the LMS Whitehead and Philip Leverhulme prizes in 2008, the Fermat prize in 2013, the Fr\u00f6hlich prize and the Fields Medal in 2014, a knighthood in 2016, and the Breakthrough prize in Mathematics in 2020.</p><p>As for Professor Nader Masmoudi, he was able to unlock the mystery around many physics problems which remained unsolved for centuries. He found a flaw in \u201cEuler\u2019s\u201d mathematical equations which for more than two centuries described the motions of fluids under any circumstance. He discovered that Euler\u2019s equations do not apply to all circumstances, as previously thought, and proved that they could break or fail under certain conditions related to fluids. His work helped solve and understand many problems related to fluid-modeling like weather predictions and airplane turbulence.</p><p>For the past 20 years, Professor Masmoudi\u2019s research has been at the forefront of Partial Differential Equations, Fluid Mechanics, and Dynamical Systems. He has been cited by more than 8000 papers for his works in pure and applied mathematics. He has been recognized with numerous awards, including the Best Scientific Paper Award in Annales de l\u2019Institue Henri Poincar\u00e9, a Chair from the Fondation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris, The Fermat Prize, and the Chair Schlumberger from the IHES in Paris.</p><p>In addition to Medicine and Science, King Faisal Prize recognized this year the achievements of outstanding thinkers and scholars in the field of Arabic Language &amp; Literature, and honored exemplary leaders who played a pivotal role in serving Islam, Muslims, and humanity at large.</p><p>The Arabic Language and Literature Prize about \u201cArabic Literature Studies in English\u201d was awarded to Professor Suzanne Stetkevych, Chair of the Department of Arabic &amp; Islamic Studies at Georgetown University, and to Professor Muhsin Al-Musawi, Professor of Arabic and Comparative Literary Studies at Columbia University.</p><p>Professor Suzanne Stetkevych was awarded the prize for her extensive research and work analyzing Arabic literature with unmatched depth from the pre-Islamic period to the revivalist period. Her research approach resulted in the renewal of the critical perspective and methods of studying classical Arabic poetry.</p><p>Professor Muhsin Al-Musawi received the prize for being a well-established authority in the field of Arabic literature demonstrating his encyclopedic knowledge in both classical and modern Arabic literature. His research and studies have made great impact on students and researchers in the field of Arabic studies, both in the Arab world and the West. He handled Arabic literature as a world literature.</p><p>The Service to Islam Prize was awarded to the former Tanzanian President His Excellency Ali Hassan Mwinyi and to Professor Hassan Mahmoud Al Shafei. His Excellency Ali Hassan Mwinyi actively participated in Islamic advocacy, spreading the spirit of religious tolerance, educating Muslims, and translating many Islamic resources and references into Swahili language. In parallel, Professor Hassan Mahmoud Alshafei served Islamic sciences through teaching, writing, authenticating, and translating, and has contributed to the establishment of the International Islamic University in Islamabad and the development of its colleges\u2019 curricula.</p><p>The Islamic Studies Prize for this year on \u201cIslamic Heritage of Al- Andalus\u201d was withheld because the nominated works did not meet the criteria of the prize.</p><p>Since 1979, King Faisal Prize in its 5 different categories has awarded 282 laureates from 44 different nationalities who have made distinguished contributions to different sciences and causes. Each prize laureate is endowed with USD 200 thousand; a 24-carat gold medal weighing 200 grams, and a Certificate inscribed with the Laureate\u2019s name and a summary of their work which qualified them for the prize.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>     Attachments </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>         King Faisal Prize Award Ceremony 2022       </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>         King Faisal Prize Award Ceremony 2022       </p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">Maysa Shawwa King Faisal Prize 00966581747005 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Maysa.Shawwa@kff.com\">Maysa.Shawwa@kff.com</email> </pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRIZNE-8512442</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRIZNE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:653S-SW81-F15X-20SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1278\"/><timeReceived>2:33 PM PT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

Fire crews managed to stop its movement there but additional evacuations were ordered for the western Antelope Valley.</p><p>In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.</p><p>The so-called Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.</p><p>The blaze was in the Angeles National Forest near Lake Hughes.</p><p>Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph was expected later in the afternoon.</p><p>\"In addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that's going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behavior,\" NWS meteorologist Matt Mehle said.</p><p>Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said</p><p>There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.</p><p>Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire. He was identified as Osmin Palencia, 36, and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started.</p><p>Another blaze came dangerously close to a neighborhood in the city of Corona, east of Los Angeles, before crews controlled it. And a Northern California fire in the community of Sloughhouse, near Sacramento, burned about 500 acres before firefighters stopped its forward spread.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4425992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-TN61-JCDM-J046-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Woodward Communications, Inc.

There's something about the dancing flames and woody smoke that's utterly soothing, especially in the fall, when weather cools and the days grow short.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>If you're new to building campfires, they can sometimes be a challenge to light and maintain. Plus, there are certain laws you should know about what you can burn and where.</p><p><br/>Furthermore, if not built correctly and in the right place, campfires can easily cause forest fires. In fact, campfires are the third leading cause of forest fires in Maine this year, according to Forest Ranger Thomas Liba. Of the 1,050 fires the Maine Forest Service has responded to, 159 have been the result of a campfire, he said.</p><p><br/>\"I was just out on the Appalachian Trail the day before yesterday for an unextinguished campfire,\" he said. \"And last week, out on Seboeis Lake, an acre and a half burned because of an unextinguished, illegal campfire.\"</p><p><br/>So before you strike a match, here are a few things you should know about building a campfire in Maine.</p><p><br/>You may need a permit</p><p><br/>Organized towns may have ordinances that require campfire permits, but the state does not require campfire permits for a small recreational campfire on property you own. Therefore, before building a campfire in an organized town, check with local fire officials or the town office to see if a campfire permit is required.</p><p><br/>In unorganized towns, the Maine Forest Service issues campfire permits for remote \"permit\" campsites. Recreational maps often distinguish between campsites that require a permit and campsites that don't require a permit, which are less common.</p><p><br/>Campfire permits for \"permit\" sites can be obtained by contacting the local forest ranger, but the Maine Forest Service recommends calling the Maine Forest Service regional headquarters (that's closest to the unorganized town you're looking to build a campfire in) Monday through Friday the day before you need the permit. Due to changing fire danger levels, campfire permits are not issued more than two days in advance.</p><p><br/>\"When in doubt, call because rangers would love to answer questions over writing a ticket,\" Liba said.</p><p><br/>A burning permit, which is different from a campfire permit, is for burning brush piles and wood debris. This type of fire is often larger and may be subject to more restrictions.</p><p><br/>Check the fire danger rating</p><p><br/>Before lighting a fire, it's best to check the daily fire danger rating in your area. This rating, on a scale of 1 through 5 or green through red, will give you an idea of how many factors that day could contribute to a campfire getting out of control and possibly becoming a forest fire. Things like wind and moisture level are taken into account when determining fire danger. On the scale, 1 or green means low fire danger, while 5 or red means extreme fire danger.</p><p><br/>You can check the daily fire danger rating of different regions in Maine at mainefireweather.org.</p><p><br/>\"The onus is on you to make sure you're being safe,\" Liba said. \"So if it's windy, we'd like you to choose not to have a campfire.\"</p><p><br/>Campfires should be kept small</p><p><br/>While there's no strict guidelines for how to build a campfire, their size and use is important. In general, campfires are small and contained, and intended for recreational purposes.</p><p><br/>\"We're talking the stereotypical campfire -- small diameter, low flames, just for enjoyment, cooking, warmth, sitting around at the end of the day,\" Liba said.</p><p><br/>Bonfires or burn piles are entirely different. They tend to be much larger, and their purpose is to burn a great amount of material. For these larger types of fires, a burning permit is required. For this, the Maine Forest Service offers an online burning permit system at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.maineburnpermit.com\">www.maineburnpermit.com</url>.</p><p><br/>How to contain your fire</p><p><br/>A wide variety of different structures can be used to help contain your campfire. One common structure is a ring built of stone, metal or some other type of noncombustible material. Other options include a variety of commercially-made fire pits and chimineas.</p><p><br/>If using a fire ring, it's important to clear combustible materials such as sticks and dead leaves away from the edges of the ring. A good rule of thumb is to clear the perimeter at a length that's least 1.5 times the diameter of the fire ring, Liba said. In addition, add crushed stone or mineral soil to that area.</p><p><br/>\"Add something that isn't going to burn if the campfire goes beyond that campfire ring,\" Liba said. \"Look for overhanging branches that could dry out and ignite overhead as well.\"</p><p><br/>You can't burn just anything</p><p><br/>In Maine, it's illegal to burn trash and most manmade materials in a campfire. The only debris that can be burned is \"wood wastes\" that are free from metal, plastics, coatings and chemical treatments. Examples of wood wastes are brush, stumps and wood chips. Painted and unpainted wood, paper and cardboard are also OK to burn, in accordance with Maine law.</p><p><br/>In addition, your firewood must originate from Maine. Maine currently has a ban on firewood from out of state to slow the spread of invasive forest pests such as the emerald ash borer.</p><p><br/>Different types of wood burn differently. In general, conifer species burn fast and hot, Liba said, while hardwood burns slow.</p><p><br/>\"Any good dry wood will suffice in getting a fire going,\" Liba said. \"I like using some birch bark and some pine twigs, then maybe some cedar, which burns quickly and hot to get the fire going. Then, for a long-lasting fire, beech and maple give a good bed of coals.\"</p><p><br/>Liba also says to steer clear of burning fallen leaves in your campfire. In fact, rake leaves away from your fire so there's no chance of them igniting, he said.</p><p><br/>\"They smoke a lot and they blow around,\" Liba said. \"They may escape your fire ring and result in a forest fire.\"</p><p><br/>Start small and be patient</p><p><br/>One of the most common mistakes people make when building a campfire is making it too big, too fast, Liba said.</p><p><br/>\"When you put wood on a fire, it takes a little time for it to combust,\" he said. \"A lot of times people pile on a lot of wood and then suddenly have a much larger fire than intended.\"</p><p><br/>Start small and be patient. Before you know it, you'll have a toasty campfire to gather around while spending time outdoors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRDLY-27071168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6111-PKX1-JBRS-Y0MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bangor Daily News</copyright><publicationName>Bangor Daily News (Maine)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 7, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CA23</classCode><className>CAMPING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001262</classCode><className>ORDINANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001030</classCode><className>LICENSES &amp; PERMITS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N721211MM</classCode><className>RV PARKS &amp; CAMPGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF3T</classCode><className>NEW CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1HI</classCode><className>BANGOR, ME, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3OI</classCode><className>APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Professor David Liu used \"base editors\" in mice to correct the genetic mutation behind progeria, a rare condition characterized by premature aging, retarded development, and early death. Still, more work needs to be done before gene \"base editors\" can be used in humans.</p><p>Initiating a revolution in genome editing, \"base editors\" have received great global demand. They were distributed over 9,000 times to more than 3,000 laboratories around the world. Scientists were able to publish more than 300 papers on this technique, used in different organisms ranging from bacteria to mice.</p><p>\"Base editing\" is a precise genome editing method; like a genetic pencil, that rewrites DNA base letters, which cause genetic mutations and potentially genetic diseases. This technology, which is in constant development, chemically rewrites one DNA base to another by rearranging the atoms of one DNA base to resemble a different base. In 2019, Professor David Liu created with his team \"prime editing\" which offers more targeting flexibility and greater editing precision.</p><p>With over 75 issued U.S. patents, Professor Liu was referred to as the \"Gene Corrector\" by Nature magazine topping its list of \"Ten People Who Mattered This Year\" in 2017 and was included in the \"Foreign Policy Leading Global Thinkers list\". He is also a biotech entrepreneur, cofounding \"Editas Medicine\", which uses CRISPR therapies (tool for editing genomes) to \"discover, develop, manufacture, and commercialize transformative, durable, and precise genomic medicines for a broad class of diseases\".</p><p>The Science Prize (Mathematics) was awarded jointly to ProfessorMartin Hairer, Chair in Probability and Stochastic Analysis at Imperial College's Department of Mathematics, and to ProfessorNader Masmoudi, a distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the New York University of Abu Dhabi and head of his Research Center on Stability, Instability and Turbulence.</p><p>Professor Martin Hairer developed the theory of regularity structures which gave a precise mathematical meaning to several equations that were previously outside the scope of mathematical analysis. He published his theory in 2014 providing tools and manuals for solving many previously incomprehensible equations called the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). These equations involve chance and describe how randomness throws disorder into different phenomena like coin tossing, stock price changes, wind movement in a tunnel, or forest fire growth. He transformed the area of SPDEs by introducing fundamental new techniques and was able to solve equations like KPZ equation which describes the evolution of the boundary at which two substances meet over time.</p><p>Professor Hairer is a world leader in probability theory and analysis and has authored a monograph and over 100 research articles. His work has been distinguished with several prizes and awards, most notably the LMS Whitehead and Philip Leverhulme prizes in 2008, the Fermat prize in 2013, the Frohlich prize and the Fields Medal in 2014, a knighthood in 2016, and the Breakthrough prize in Mathematics in 2020.</p><p>As for Professor Nader Masmoudi, he was able to unlock the mystery around many physics problems which remained unsolved for centuries. He found a flaw in \"Euler's\" mathematical equations which for more than two centuries described the motions of fluids under any circumstance. He discovered that Euler's equations do not apply to all circumstances, as previously thought, and proved that they could break or fail under certain conditions related to fluids. His work helped solve and understand many problems related to fluid-modeling like weather predictions and airplane turbulence.</p><p>For the past 20 years, Professor Masmoudi's research has been at the forefront of Partial Differential Equations, Fluid Mechanics, and Dynamical Systems. He has been cited by more than 8000 papers for his works in pure and applied mathematics. He has been recognized with numerous awards, including the Best Scientific Paper Award in Annales de l'Institue Henri Poincare, a Chair from the Fondation Sciences Mathematiques de Paris, The Fermat Prize, and the Chair Schlumberger from the IHES in Paris.</p><p>In addition to Medicine and Science, King Faisal Prize recognized this year the achievements of outstanding thinkers and scholars in the field of Arabic Language &amp; Literature, and honored exemplary leaders who played a pivotal role in serving Islam, Muslims, and humanity at large.</p><p>The Arabic Language and Literature Prize about \"Arabic Literature Studies in English\" was awarded to Professor Suzanne Stetkevych, Chair of the Department of Arabic &amp; Islamic Studies at Georgetown University, and to Professor Muhsin Al-Musawi, Professor of Arabic and Comparative Literary Studies at Columbia University.</p><p>Professor Suzanne Stetkevych was awarded the prize for her extensive research and work analyzing Arabic literature with unmatched depth from the pre-Islamic period to the revivalist period. Her research approach resulted in the renewal of the critical perspective and methods of studying classical Arabic poetry.</p><p>Professor Muhsin Al-Musawi received the prize for being a well-established authority in the field of Arabic literature demonstrating his encyclopedic knowledge in both classical and modern Arabic literature. His research and studies have made great impact on students and researchers in the field of Arabic studies, both in the Arab world and the West. He handled Arabic literature as a world literature.</p><p>The Service to Islam Prize was awarded to the former Tanzanian President His Excellency Ali Hassan Mwinyi and to Professor Hassan Mahmoud Al Shafei. His Excellency Ali Hassan Mwinyi actively participated in Islamic advocacy, spreading the spirit of religious tolerance, educating Muslims, and translating many Islamic resources and references into Swahili language. In parallel, Professor Hassan Mahmoud Alshafei served Islamic sciences through teaching, writing, authenticating, and translating, and has contributed to the establishment of the International Islamic University in Islamabad and the development of its colleges' curricula.</p><p>The Islamic Studies Prize for this year on \"Islamic Heritage of Al- Andalus\" was withheld because the nominated works did not meet the criteria of the prize.</p><p>Since 1979, King Faisal Prize in its 5 different categories has awarded 282 laureates from 44 different nationalities who have made distinguished contributions to different sciences and causes. Each prize laureate is endowed with USD 200 thousand; a 24-carat gold medal weighing 200 grams, and a Certificate inscribed with the Laureate's name and a summary of their work which qualified them for the prize.</p><p>Attachments</p><p>- King Faisal Prize Award Ceremony 2022</p><p>- King Faisal Prize Award Ceremony 2022</p><p>COMTEX_404955614/2241/2022-03-29T17:33:51</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HUGIN-404955614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HUGIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:653S-SY31-DYRK-606V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">263816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><timeReceived>5:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2022 GLOBE NEWSWIRE.

Photo: Rodger Bosch/AFP via Getty ImagesA massive wildfire spread from the foothills of Table Mountain to the University of Cape Town Sunday, burning historic South African buildings and forcing the evacuation of 4,000 students, per Times Live[1].The big picture: Visitors to the Table Mountain National Park and other nearby attractions were also evacuated and several roads including a major highway, were closed. South Africa's oldest working windmill and the university's Jagger Library, which houses SA antiquities[2], are among the buildings damaged. A helicopter flies near a smoke cloud from the Cape Town fire. Mostert's Mill, built in 1796, are among the historical structors damaged in the fire, Mayor Dan Plato said[3].

At least one firefighter has been treated for burns, according to Plato.

Officials and experts have linked such intense weather events to climate change. <br/> The thick pine forests on Evia which made it appealing to tourists have turned in into a nightmare for firefighters.

The Greek Coast Guard said 349 people were taken off the island early Sunday. <br/> A local resident fights a fire flare-up north of Athens Photo: AFP / Louisa GOULIAMAKI  <br/>On Saturday, nine people were evacuated from a beach surrounded by flames by the coastal village of Psaropouli, the ANA news agency reported. <br/>Some 260 Greek firefighters with 66 vehicles were battling the blazes on Evia, helped by 200 more from Ukraine and Romania with 23 vehicles and seven aircraft. <br/>One fire service official told the Eleftheros Typos newspaper that the heat from the fires on Evia and elsewhere was so intense that \"the water from the hoses and the water-dropping aircraft was evaporating\" before reaching the blazes. <br/>Flames were devouring houses in the villages of Ellinika, Vasilika and Psaropouli. <br/> Devastated forest in the aftermath of a blaze near Mount Parnitha, north of Athens Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>Local officials were critical of the efforts to control the fires, which erupted on the island on August 3. <br/>\"With what we have seen so far the fire won't be under control any time soon. I have no more voice left to ask for more aircraft. I can't stand this situation\", Giorgos Tsapourniotis, mayor of Mantoudi in Evia told Skai TV on Saturday. <br/>He added that many villages were saved because young people stayed there despite the evacuation order and kept the fires away from their homes. <br/>\"We are in the hands of God. The State is absent. If people leave, the villages will burn for sure,\" said Yannis Selimis, 26, from the village of Gouves in northern Evia where locals were ordered to evacuate. <br/>\"For the next 40 years we will have no job and in the winter we are going to drown from the floods without the forests that were protecting us,\" said Selimis. <br/>Greek deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias said late Saturday that provisional shelter was provided to 2,000 people who have been evacuated. <br/>Meanwhile, in the Peloponnese region in the southwest, fire fronts in the towns of East Mani, Ilia and in Messinia remained active with many villages and settlements evacuated. <br/>Rescuers on Sunday dispatched a helicopter to airlift an injured firefighter from the densely-forested Mount Parnitha just north of Athens where he was fighting a flare-up. <br/>Blazes have raged for several days in the northern suburbs of Athens, though there was no longer any active front by Sunday. <br/>In the previous 10 days, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average number of hectares burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/>Because of this situation deemed the worst in decades, Greece requested help through the European emergency support system, and reinforcement were sent from several countries. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162842673250925979100087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63B3-7PR1-F03R-N3HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><timeReceived>12:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 8, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

In the world of nature, the focus is carbon gases releases from forest and rangeland fires.</p><p>In California last year, wildfires released about half the typical annual emissions from that of the transportation sector and forest fire pollution topped annual emissions from all of the state's power plants, according to climate reporter Tim McDonnell.</p><p>While managing our wildlands to offset CO2 releases is drawing increasing attention and lots of money, the impact of water pollution remains on the backburner without heat. In our country, water quality is measured differently.</p><p>A Google search of the 20 Water Pollution Facts for the U.S. and the World, author Merlin Hearn does not mention greenhouse gas released from rivers as a pollution problem. The focus is on untreated sewerage, leaking septic systems and pesticides.</p><p>However, studies have shown that many of the world's rivers and streams are over-saturated with carbon dioxide, according to freelance writer Sara Witman: \"In 2013, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists discovered that freshwater rivers and streams release about 5 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all the world's lakes and reservoirs combined, a much higher amount than previously believed.\"</p><p>USGS studied more than 100 streams from Florida to Lake Quinault on Washington state's Olympic Peninsula.</p><p>Recently, BBC Global News filmed a documentary on the impacts of water pollution in Hong Kong on greenhouse gas build ups.

In addition, it's estimated that aquatic systems like rivers and lakes contribute more than 50 percent to atmospheric methane, and global river nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions have come to exceed 10 percent of human emissions,\" Comer-Warner reported.</p><p>In rivers flowing through large cities, higher emissions are becoming a growing problem. In some cases, urban rivers have been found to emit four times more than of the amount of greenhouse gases than rivers in natural sites.</p><p>\"When the river water quality deteriorated from acceptable to polluted, the concentration of CO2 and methane (CH4) in the rivers increased tenfold while N2O (nitrous oxide) concentrations were boosted by 15 times,\" Long Tuan Ho, postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University, Belgium, found.</p><p>Pollution of surface water is a problem for over half of our planet's population and more than 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, groundwater, and industrial waste are discharged into U.S. waters annually.</p><p>Along with removing contaminates, as Hong Kong officials have identified, we need to focus on reducing greenhouse gases emissions from rivers, lakes and streams.

Thirteen fires continue in five provinces. <br/>The Greek fire service said Saturday blazes were raging in the Attica peninsula that includes Athens, in Evia, the country's second largest island and located east of the capital, and the Peloponnese region in the southwest. <br/>North of Athens, a fierce blaze tore through vast areas of pine forest, forcing yet more evacuations of villages overnight and blowing thick, choking smoke and ash all over the Greek capital. <br/>Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country has been shut down as a precaution and migrant camps were evacuated. <br/>In the Evia village of Limni, more than 1,300 people fled the fires on ferry boats. Another 23 were evacuated Saturday morning from the beach at Rovies. <br/>Local authorities on the island called for more air support in the firefighting efforts. <br/>Around 5,000 tourists and residents were also forced to flee another fire in the Peloponnese region. <br/>Eleni Drakoulakou, the mayor of East Mani, told ERT TV on Saturday that 50 percent of the Peloponnese town has been burnt, blaming a lack of water-dropping air support during the critical first hours of the wildfire. <br/>Meanwhile, the ANA news agency said two people were being held on suspicion of arson. <br/>In Athens, police arrested a woman in a park on Friday as she was carrying two lighters, petrol and flammable materials, a few minutes after a fire broke out there. <br/>A 43-year-old man was arrested in the area of Krioneri and charged with arson, according to ANA. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX10876716283439363302597910004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639W-9RJ1-F03R-N39J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><timeReceived>1:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 7, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0008EIE</classCode><className>COMMERCE &amp;

Tiny enough to perch comfortably on a fingertip, the ultra-compact chameleon -- dubbed Brookesia nana -- has the same proportions and world-weary expression as its larger cousins around the world Photo: Zoologische Staatssammlung Munchen / Frank GLAW The male's body -- about the size of a peanut -- was 13.5 millimetres long (half an inch), with the tail adding another nine millimetres. </p><p>By contrast, the female measured 29 mm from its nose to the tip of its tail.The pair remain the only specimens of the species ever found.Islands connected long ago to neighbouring continents are known for miniaturised versions of animals that crossed ephemeral land bridges, a phenomenon known as \"island dwarfism\".\"There are numerous extremely miniaturised vertebrates in Madagascar, including the smallest primates and some of the smallest frogs in the world,\" said co-author Andolalao Rakotoarison of the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar.But the \"island effect\" does not apply to B. nana, which lives exclusively in mountainous regions some 1,300 metres (4,200 feet) above sea level, the researchers concluded. Since the mid-20th century, Madagascar has lost about 45 percent of its forest cover Photo: Zoologische Staatssammlung Munchen / Frank GLAW \"We have no good explanation as to why this species is so small,\" said Glaw.What scientists do know is that the diminutive reptiles are likely teetering on the edge of extinction, even if the International Union for the Conservation for Nature (IUCN) -- keepers of the Red List of threatened species -- has yet to do an assessment.\"Habitat destruction is the biggest threat to the amphibians and reptiles of Madagascar,\" said Glaw.\"Maybe in the future it will be climate change, but for now it is deforestation.\"Since the mid-20th century, Madagascar has lost about 45 percent of its forest cover.B. nana and another mini-chameleon discovered by Glaw and his colleagues on a small island off the coast of Madagascar are especially vulnerable because their range is so small.Brookesia micra lives on less than two square kilometres,\" Glaw explained.\"One big catastrophic event -- a forest fire -- and the population might be lost very quickly.\"Madagascar in a global \"biodiversity hotspot\", accounting for five percent of the world's unique plant and animal species.The island nation has one of the highest rates of poverty in the world, and lacks resources for conservation and natural resource management. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767161257622272525876100190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61Y0-2MC1-F03R-N3T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><timeReceived>1:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 6, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D78I</classCode><className>REPTILES &amp;

Adam Kinzinger indicated in a Thursday appearance on CNN's \u201cNew Day\u201d that he will vote to remove Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments when the proposal comes to the floor of the House of Representatives.</p><p>Host John Berman first asked Kinzinger to describe what happened in the Republican conference that took place Wednesday night, where Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/03/kevin-mccarthy-not-remove-marjorie-taylor-greene-committees-supports-liz-cheney-leadership-role/\">Greene</url>, who have both recently come under fire from fellow Republicans, addressed the meeting.</p><p>\u201cI don't reveal details from conference because - but what I'll tell you about last night was Liz survived ... She defended herself, but on the Marjorie Taylor Greene stuff ... I won't go into a lot of details but she did address the issue, and I didn't hear an apology personally,\u201d Kinzinger responded. \u201cMaybe she did say it, but the bottom line is, I think until she publicly disavows all her comments from the past and says, you know, everything going forward, you know, I don't take it too seriously.\u201d</p><p>Cheney faced calls to be removed from her position as House Republican Conference chair after breaking with a majority of the party to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump on Jan. 13. She survived the vote to <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/03/liz-cheney-house-republicans-leadership/\">remain in her position</url> with the final tally being 145-61.</p><p>Greene began receiving heavy criticism after it surfaced she liked past Facebook posts that called for the execution of some members of Congress. Her previously expressed support for <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/01/cancer-looney-lies-mitch-mcconnell-slams-marjorie-taylor-greene-comments-911-school-shootings-clintons/\">multiple conspiracy theories</url> and QAnon has also been a point of condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans. She was seen in a past video <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/01/27/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-parkland-shooting-survivor-harassing-qanon-gun-control/\">accosting</url> Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg on the streets of Washington, D.C., and was forced to push back after she seemed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/01/29/marjorie-taylor-greene-rothschild-family-anti-semitic-california-fire-cancel-culture/\">implicate</url> a wealthy Jewish family used a \u201claser beam\u201d to start a forest fire for financial gain.</p><p>House Democrats are expected to <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/03/house-democrats-force-vote-strip-marjorie-taylor-greene-committees/\">introduce a proposal</url> Thursday to strip Greene of her committee assignments on the Budget Committee and the Education and Labor Committee.</p><p>\u201cHow will you vote today on the House floor about whether to strip her of her posts?\u201d Berman asked about Greene. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/03/jim-jordan-ilhan-omar-first-amendment-marjorie-taylor-greene/\">(RELATED: 'I Actually Believe In The First Amendment': Jim Jordan Says Ilhan Omar Shouldn't Lose Committee Assignments)</url></emphasis></p><p>\u201cI intend to vote for it. The only thing that could change is if today she comes out and publicly shows that she has moved on ... That takes eating a lot of humble pie and it's probably going to hurt her fundraising base so I'm not sure that's going to happen because I honestly think a lot of this kind of boisterousness on her end is to get a bunch of Twitter followers and to raise a bunch of money,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cIf she does that publicly today, you know, then I reserve the right to vote against the resolution on the floor. Otherwise, I do intend to vote to remove her from her committees and I think it should have been done by the Republicans.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>John Berman and Rep.

It's the first fire emergency for the Australian Capital Territory area since 2003 when wildfires killed four people and destroyed almost 500 homes in a single day. The threat is posed by a blaze on Canberra's southern fringe that has razed more than 53,000 acres since it was sparked by heat from a military helicopter landing light on Monday, the Emergency Services Agency said. </p><p>\"The state of emergency sets a clear expectation for our community that we need you to be vigilant,\" Emergency Services Minister Mick Gentleman told reporters. \"This is the worst bush fire season in the ACT since 2003.\" The fire is burning at emergency level -- the highest on a three-tier scale of danger -- and embers have created dangerous spot fires nearby, agency officials said. Residents of southern Canberra suburbs and surrounding villages have been advised to prepare to either protect their homes or evacuate. Roads were blocked to the village of Tharwa late today because the fire posed too much danger for residents to evacuate or return to their homes. The fire is the most dangerous of dozens of blazes burning Australia's drought-stricken southeast. Unprecedented fires across southern Australia have claimed at least 33 lives since September, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and razed more than 10.6 million hectares (26.2 million acres). The fire danger is forecast to escalate across the southeast in the Australian Capital Territory and the states of New South Wales and Victoria as summer temperatures rise over the weekend. The state of emergency gives Canberra's local government additional powers to block roads, direct people's movements, control their property and undertake firefighting work on private land. -- Rod McGuirk, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9R-4K01-DY7N-F1T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"315\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Hundreds of firefighters backed by aircraft have been battling several forest fires around Chernobyl for the past 10 days. They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant. </p><p>Emergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass. Chechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl. The emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 60 miles south of the plant, were within norms. Yesterday, activists warned the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities. Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within about 1.2 miles of one of the radioactive waste depots. Last week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass \"for fun\" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly. Yesterday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities. The 1,000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the April 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave. Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires. -- Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWG-TJS1-DY7N-F00R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"369\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The game lets you play as a small flying and walking animal known as a Sugar Glider, and it will help convey the effects of climate change on nature, said Sebastien Nadeau, cofounder and chief technology officer, in an interview with GamesBeat. The game looks gorgeous, and the video embedded in this post has been viewed more than half a million times. </p><p>The funding comes from Game Seer Venture Partners, and it takes the form of venture debt, as a kind of bridge financing from one milestone to another. The team started the game more than four years ago. The team raised initial funding from the Canadian Media Fund, and also raised money via a Kickstarter campaign. Montral game veterans Laurent Bernier, Nathanael Dufour, and Nadeau formally started the company in 2016 to create immersive, innovative, and story-driven interactive games. Above: The Sugar Glider is the hero of Away. Image Credit: Breaking WallsAnd based on the trailer, the title looks beautiful, as it conveys with a lot of realism what it's like to be an animal surrounded by lush plants and deadly predators. The founders had decades of experience making triple-A titles at Ubisoft. They decided to branch out and start a small game studio together. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gamesbeat-summit-2020-tickets-60771924462?aff=article'We\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gamesbeat-summit-2020-tickets-60771924462?aff=article'We</url> had this dream of building our own company and we decided to make that dream come true,' Nadeau said. The inspiration came from nature documentaries, said Nadeau. They wanted to make a game where you really felt like you were immersed in nature. Climate change is one of the central themes of Away, as you can see in the trailer where there's a forest fire that threatens all of the animals. They chose the Sugar Glider because it gives you flexibility of movement, vulnerability in the environment, and a sense of scale of how big the world is. The idea is to get players to reflect more deeply on the consequences of climate change. The Sugar Glider has to fight snakes and scorpions, as well as deal with environmental threats such as a forest fire or flood. Above: Away has great visual quality. Image Credit: Breaking Walls'When you look at those documentaries like Planet Earth, you see they can create incredible stories about nature, even though no words are spoken,' Nadeau said. 'We felt merging gameplay and animal documentaries could lead to a new sub-genre of video game.' Breaking Walls wants to self-publish its own titles and preserve its own creative freedom from start to finish. It talked to different publishers, but ultimately decided it wanted a strong relationship with its consumers, which was much easier to do through self-publishing. 'From the beginning, we wanted a strong relationship with the people who were going to play it,' Nadeau said. Breaking Walls went through a lot of testing to figure out the gameplay that works. The team was also good at getting attention from others for its work through the video trailer and other ways such as on Reddit, said Bertran Verizneau, CEO of Game Seer Venture Partners, in an interview. Breaking Walls met with Game Seer Venture Partners at the Game Developers Conference in 2019, and they saw eye-to-eye. They built a deal that would work for both sides, giving the team more cash without sacrificing creative freedom, both sides said. 'We were on the same page creatively, and they gave us more freedom to do this on our own,' said Andre-Paul Johnson, head of growth at Breaking Walls, in an interview. Above: The Sugar Glider squares off against the scorpion. Image Credit: Breaking WallsBreaking Walls has about 10 people on its team. The team has been working remotely, on lockdown. 'We're trying to keep the key team spirit high regardless of the situation,' Nadeau said. The game bears some resemblance to Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey[3], the game produced by Patrice Dsilets and his team at the Montreal-based Panache Digital Games. But this game feels very different. The release date isn't set yet, but the game is being targeted for the PC (via Steam) and the PlayStation 4. 'There are similar themes, but explored from different perspectives,' Johnson said. 'It feels more personal when you are the animal and the surroundings are falling apart. The environment itself becomes an enemy. As a Sugar Glider, you are very vulnerable and it gives you a new perspective on natural disasters.'

We exist in a vacuum of chaos where violence, prejudice and suffering run rampant with only outdated, racist, sexist laws put in place to try and temper that chaos - and this year I have had a very difficult time coming to terms with that fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But chaos and disorder aren't always bad. In fact, sometimes it can even lead to good.</p><p>This past year has felt a bit like watching a train run off its rails and crash into a ditch and then that wreck escalating into a forest fire that then catches the attention of aliens who then invade our planet until finally the whole world explodes.</p><p>I don't know about you guys, but I'm exhausted.</p><p>I want to return to the whole reason I started writing these opinion pieces in the first place: to remind our readers - and myself - that with as much bad that exists in our world, there is so much good. I think we all could use a story with a happy ending, so allow me to reinstate your hope in humanity.</p><p>One brisk January day, Pam Willis, 50 years old, was enjoying her daily Facebook scroll when she stumbled upon a story about seven siblings: Adelino, 15 years old; Ruby, 13; Aleecia, 9; Aubriella, 7; Leo, 5 and Xander, 4.</p><p>The siblings experienced a great tragedy, losing their parents in a car accident, and they were searching for a new home. Almost as if it was divine intervention, Pam instantly felt a connection to these children.</p><p>\"I can't explain it,\" Pam said, \"I just knew I was supposed to be their mom.\"</p><p>After tagging her husband, Gary Willis, 53 years old, in the post, she asked him what he thought. To her surprise he suggested that they should adopt the children. The couple already shared five adult children together and had been fostering children for years at this point, but they had never discussed adoption.</p><p>That night, they immediately called the number listed at the bottom of the children's story and just two months later Pam and Gary were matched with the children.\u00a0</p><p>Pam learned during the screening process the kids had experienced a great deal of instability in their short lives. Their late parents battled addiction and the family experienced bouts of homelessness as well as days with no food.</p><p>\"I think they didn't quite trust that we were real,\" Pam said in an interview with TODAY, \"like maybe we were going to go away. I think it's hard to trust when so much has been taken away from your life.\"</p><p>One night when Aleecia came into her foster parents' room in the middle of the night, Pam asked her if she had a bad dream and Aleecia responded, \"No, I just wanted to make sure that you were still there.\"</p><p>For the first six months, the kids struggled to adapt to their new home and even struggled to sleep through the whole night. But the kids had nothing to worry about because Pam and Gary weren't going anywhere and last August the couple officially adopted the seven kids.</p><p>\"They have given us a second chance at parenting, and we've given them a second mom and dad,\" Pam wrote on an Instagram post. \"They are our Second Chance seven.\"\u00a0</p><p>You can follow Gary and Pam and the Second Chance seven on Instagram, and if you still can't get enough of the family, check out this video.\u00a0</p><p>I bet you can't watch it without shedding a tear.

Confiscated exotic wildlife like macaws, crocodiles, parrots and howler monkeys now end up in locally funded shelters like Agua Azul[1]and Villa Fantasia[2] in Guadalajara.But what if the mistreated or confiscated animal is a puma or a jaguar, unaccustomed to living in a cage or even in the roomy enclosures provided by modern zoos? </p><p><br/>This is when the wildlife rescue centers turn to the UMAs. <br/>An UMA is an Animal Management Unit licensed by the government to care for or raise exotic or endangered creatures \u2014 from crocodiles to tarantulas \u2014 as well as jaguars. <br/>Pancho, 15 years old, is enjoying his last days at Potrero de Mulas. In the wild, pumas rarely live beyond the age of 13. Chris Lloyd <br/>Mexico has only a handful of UMAs permitted to handle this big-cat breed, and one of the most fascinating of these is the Potrero de Mulas (Mule Pasture), hidden away in a jungle-filled valley 35 kilometers east of Puerto Vallarta, at 830 meters altitude. <br/>The Potrero de Mulas website says that, besides being a UMA, it is a center for ecotourism, environmental education and recreational activities, with cabins to rent, a campsite, trails to follow, rock walls to climb and great food (for groups over 20). <br/>Apart from all this, photos show Mule Pasture to be an extraordinarily beautiful place, despite its less-than-attractive-sounding name.I contacted the owner, Marisol Lovera. <br/>'You are welcome to stay with us,' she told me,' but you will need four-wheel drive to get here.' <br/>From Mascota to Puerto Vallarta this Jalisco road sign reminds visitors that they are in big cat territory. <br/>So off we went a few weeks later, in the robust Toyota Tacoma of Canadian geologist Chris Lloyd. It's a four-hour drive from Guadalajara to the little town of La Estancia, located on the highway between Mascota, Jalisco, and Puerto Vallarta. <br/>La Estancia is where the fun began. <br/>I had been told that you needed to drive across 30 rivers to reach Potrero de Mulas. Well, by my calculations, that's not true. I counted only 24 crossings, and they were all streams, not rivers. <br/>By the time we crossed the last one, we were convinced that the 'many streams' were really just one insanely meandering creek known as Arroyo Bulera, which seems to have more twists in it than a Ken Follett novel. But it is thanks to the endlessly undulating Bulera that Potrero de Mulas has its enchanting lagoon, a great place for a swim after tramping around in the jungle. <br/>The Inca jay, Cyanocorax yncas, is one of 53 bird species you might see at Potrero de Mulas. Emmanuel Guevara <br/>Upon our arrival, we enjoyed a delicious meal of pollo en salsa de mostaza (chicken in mustard sauce) and brochetas de champi\u00f1ones (mushroom kabobs), after which we headed off to see the jaguars. <br/>We didn't have far to walk: just a few steps away from the restaurant, we were introduced to Negrita, a black jaguar. <br/>'She came to us three months ago from the Tlajomulco Wildlife Rescue Center[3],' said Lovera. 'She had been turned over to them after being confiscated from someone who had kept her in a rather small cage \u2014 containing nothing but a slab of concrete for a floor \u2014 for five or six years. All that time, she had been living on a poor diet, so she had lost weight. Her hair was matted and dull, and she had sores on her back. <br/>During Negrita's whole life, she had never heard the sounds of nature or of another feline, only the voices of human beings. <br/>Rescued after six years of mistreatment, Negrita, a black jaguar, is now healthy, happy and often visited by suitors. <br/>'So when she arrived here, we tried to put her into a roomy enclosure, but she was frightened. So we are temporarily keeping her here close to us,' Lovera said.'And now, after just a few months, she has overcome all this. Now she seems happy when she's visited by suitors who come calling at night. And she is back to her correct weight and looking good. <br/>'Because of her, by the way, we know that there are a lot of big cats roaming freely around this area, and we have even caught them on video. She is just about ready to go live in one of the big enclosures.' <br/>We then crossed the gorgeous lagoon next to the dining hall and came to the first of several big-cat-sized enclosures, each of which is typically 2,000 to 5,000 square meters in size.Here we caught a glimpse of a puma or cougar named Pancho, an old-timer of 15 years. <br/>'Pancho came to us from Nayart in 2008,' said caretaker Enrique L\u00f3pez. 'The vet said we should feed him ground beef because his teeth are bad, but he didn't go for it. He likes his meat au naturel.' <br/>How to cool off after a day of hiking in a cloud forest. <br/>The next enclosure was the home of Nairi the Lynx. She had been burned in a huge forest fire that devastated Guadalajara's Primavera Forest two years ago. <br/>'When they found Nairi in the forest, her paws were burned, as well as her ears and her tail,' L\u00f3pez said, 'so she didn't look exactly like a lynx.' <br/>Her rescuers brought her to Villa Fantasia Rescue Center, where they took good care of her. <br/>'They gave her a baby bottle and everything, but she suffered from stress and got depressed. So they brought her here, where she's doing really well,' L\u00f3pez said. 'Someone is going to give us a male lynx, which is also imprinted and used to human beings, and we hope they will have babies that we can release in the Primavera forest.' <br/>Next, we wandered along a dirt road through the jungle for 500 meters without seeing any more big cats \u2014 until we arrived at the last enclosure, a really big one, 12,000 square meters in size. Here we were delighted to spot Maya, a female jaguar who had been confiscated in Quintana Roo by the federal environmental protection agency Profepa in 2015. <br/>After a rappel, visitors climb the via ferrata on the center's 'natural climbing wall.' ITESO <br/>Maya seemed happy to see us and came right up to the fence to say hello. We were entirely absorbed in taking photos of her when suddenly \u2014 in a flash and apparently out of nowhere \u2014 a full-sized male jaguar made its dramatic appearance by pouncing onto the fence at the end of a flying leap, as if to say, 'Hey! I live here too!' <br/>This, we learned, was Selva, Maya's mate. In 2019, the pair of them had two babies, Yamil and Itzia, who are doing well in another enclosure. <br/>Should you ever get tired of watching the big cats, Potrero de Mulas also has a 900-meter-long interpretive trail that introduces visitors to the flora of this cloud forest. Here you can see the Pacific Magnolia, the endemic Jalisco Pine and evenCyathea Costaricensis, the world's tallest tree fern. <br/>Following what seems to be the local custom, the trail cuts across the serpentine Bulera Creek numerous times. Crossing it requires hopping from rock to rock, so for this hike, you'd better wear shoes that aren't afraid of water. <br/>Maya the jaguar lives with her mate Selva in an enclosure 12,000 square meters in size. <br/>Potrero de Mulas also has zip lines and a high sheer rock wall for rappelling, with a via ferrata (iron rungs fixed in the wall) for climbing back up. <br/>While engaged in these activities, or just wandering about, you can't help but notice that this is also a wonderful place for bird-watching. <br/>Four nicely printed guides to the local birds describe 53 species. In no time at all, birder Chris Lloyd spotted a green jay, a cinnamon-rumped seed eater, a grey-crowned woodpecker, an orange-fronted parakeet and a sulfur-bellied flycatcher, which isn't even in the guides. <br/>Like most UMAs in Mexico, Potrero de Mulas receives no help from the government. Its expenses are somewhat offset by fees paid by visitors. <br/>Beside caring for big cats, Potrero de Mulas is also dedicated to the reintroduction of animals like the white-tailed deer and this peccary. <br/>'Here we have six cabins of different sizes,' says Marisol Lovera, 'each with a kitchen, hot water and internet. So we can house 22 guests. In our campground, which also has internet, we can take another 20, and then we have a hostel where we can accommodate 16 more people.' <br/>Look for the route to Potrero de Mulas on Wikiloc.[4]If you don't happen to have four-wheel drive or a truck, you can leave your car in a safe place in La Estancia and transport to Potrero de Mulas will be arranged. <br/>For more information, see their web page in English[5].

Feedback from the survey will be used to shape the future of nature-based recreation in Rhode Island including fishing, hunting and boating, and management of state owned/operated conservation lands and management areas. Survey data will also help prioritize funding for future conservation efforts and support the growth and management of outdoor recreation.</p><p>\"We encourage Rhode Islanders to participate in this important survey and share information about their involvement in activities such as fishing, hunting, boating, hiking, and bird-watching on state conservation lands,\" said DEM Director Janet Coit. \"Their valuable feedback will help us create better outdoor opportunities for all Rhode Islanders and visitors. Providing people with places to get outdoors and enjoy nature is part of DEM's core mission, is good for health, and fosters our next generation of environmental stewards.\"</p><p>DEM invites a broad representation of stakeholders including local and state leaders, environmental organizations, private-sector groups, and all others interested in outdoor recreation to take the survey and share their thoughts about the use of state lands. Hearing directly from the people that use Rhode Island's network of management areas and conservation lands will help DEM gauge the level and type of use, how the public values state lands, and develop ideas for better management and funding to keep areas open, staffed, and operational.</p><p>The survey takes only a few minutes to complete and is available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dem.ri.gov/naturesurvey\">www.dem.ri.gov/naturesurvey</url>.</p><p>The effort is part of a broader project DEM is conducting to assess the Division of Fish and Wildlife and the Division of Forest Environment's strategic priorities, oversight, and stewardship of state-owned/operated conservation and management areas, including fishing access areas and boat ramps. The project includes lands that are directly managed by DEM's Divisions of Fish and Wildlife and Forest Environment; state parks and beaches are not included. Visit the list of state-owned/operated conservation and management areas by clicking here.</p><p>With more than 60,000 acres of state of land, including 25 state management areas, 400 miles of hiking and biking trails, 200 fishing spots, and over 200 public boat ramps in Rhode Island, recreationists of all kinds have plentiful options of places for hunting, fishing, hiking, boating, photographing wildlife, watching birds, or just enjoying the outdoors.</p><p>DEM's Division of Fish and Wildlife is responsible for managing thousands of species of wildlife, including freshwater species. Revenue generated from fishing and hunting license and permit sales supports Rhode Island fish and wildlife conservation programs. A critical source of funding, these monies are leveraged to match federal Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program dollars that support nature-based recreational opportunities for fishing, hunting, and boating in Rhode Island.</p><p>A steward of forest-based recreation, DEM's Division of Forest Environment manages 40,000 acres of state-owned rural forestland including the Arcadia and George Washington Management Areas. The Division also works across the state with property owners along with rural and urban communities on a wide range of forestry topics including forest health, forest fire prevention, community tree planting, and private forest land management to maximize the positive benefits forests bring to all Rhode Islanders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124238106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61XJ-4P81-DYTH-G45M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 3, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Strong data and efficiency are de rigueur.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Precision financing</emphasis>BanksPhotos / E+ / Getty</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 2020s have flung biotech from the heights of pandemic exuberance, when cash grew on trees and anyone with a lab coat could take a company public, to the belt-tightening lows of 2022, with layoffs, liquidations and falling valuations.</p><p>As the dust settles in 2023, a more discriminate financing environment is emerging. There is still plenty of private money about: $35 billion of venture capital was raised in 2022, more than during pre-pandemic 2019. But investors aren\u2019t giving it away so easily. With little insight into when the wider economic malaise will end, many venture capitalists continue to face tough decisions about which of their portfolio companies to support. A quick exit via an initial public offering (IPO) is no longer an option: IPOs in 2022 fell to just 25% of pre-pandemic levels, and few expect much change this year (Fig. 1). Pharma acquirers haven\u2019t picked up the slack, either: mergers and acquisitions during 2022 were smaller, and rarer, than many anticipated at the start of the year (Nat. Biotechnol. 40, 1546\u20131550; 2022). Pfizer\u2019s proposed $43 billion acquisition of Seagen in March 2023 may catalyze more action, but several pharma CEOs are talking down mega-mergers. Raising new venture capital (VC) funds has become tougher, too. Limited partners (who fund the VC funds) are shutting off the taps as they nurse their public holdings and want evidence of payback on their invested funds before putting more money to work. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023 hasn\u2019t helped confidence in biotech fundraising (or bank stocks), even if federal action does secure companies\u2019 existing deposits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fig. 1 Historical biotech IPOs.</emphasis> The IPO window slammed shut in 2022, leaving no exits for private companies.</p><p>Source: BioCentury BCIQ Database.</p><p>To attract funding in 2023, biotechs need strong data (ideally clinical data), a differentiated asset or technology, disciplined spending, sensible time frames and realistic valuation expectations. Such basics were forgotten during the upturn, and inflated private valuations persisted beyond it \u2014 partly explaining the lower investment and merger and acquisition activity during 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Haves and have-nots</emphasis></p><p>The chosen few can still win large rounds. In the first few weeks of 2023, Danish biotech Hemab Therapeutics, chaired by Alnylam\u2019s former founder CEO John Maraganore, raised a $135 million series B to support a phase 1/2 study of a bispecific antibody for a rare clotting disorder, Glanzmann thrombasthenia, and Lyon, France-based Amolyt Pharma, run by serial entrepreneur Thierry Abribat, pulled in $138 million in a series C on the back of positive phase 2a data for long-acting parathyroid hormone receptor-1 agonist eneboparatide for hypoparathyroidism. Both are well above the average B and C rounds raised in 2022, and even beat heady 2021\u2019s averages (Fig. 2). So, by far, did Cargo Therapeutics\u2019 $200 million series A , raised on the back of phase 1 results for its autologous CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, in development for large B cell lymphomas that are relapsed or refractory to CD19 CAR-T cell therapy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fig. 2 | Trends in biotech private financing over five years.</emphasis> Private funding round averages fell in 2022; C rounds slumped sharply in number and size. Top, series A rounds. Middle, series B rounds. Bottom, series C rounds.</p><p>Source: BioCentury BCIQ Database.</p><p>A couple of biotechs have even pulled off successful IPOs, thanks to clinical-stage assets and buyers lined up in advance: Structure Therapeutics, designing small molecules targeting G-protein-coupled receptors for metabolic and pulmonary diseases, raised $185.3 million on the NASDAQ in February, followed days later by Mineralys\u2019s $192 million IPO that will fund phase 2/3 trials of lorundrastat, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, for resistant hypertension. Listings remain a rarity, though: the BioCentury BCIQ database records just five biotech IPOs in 2023 so far, raising a total of just over $430 million.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a moment of separation \u2014 between the \u2018haves\u2019 and have-nots\u2019,\u201d says Antoine Papiernik, managing partner at Sofinnova Partners, which co-led the Amolyt deal.</p><p>In this ruthless meritocracy, the \u2018haves\u2019 needn\u2019t necessarily be clinical-stage companies. Platform technologies that promise multiple novel programs are fashionable. RNA-based discovery engines have become hot property since the runaway successes of Moderna and BioNTech, with five $100 million-plus financings during 2022 and 2023, including MPM Capital- and BioImpact Capital-founded Orna Therapeutics\u2019 $221 million series B in 2022 (Box 1).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Box 1 Taking RNA therapeutics mainstream</emphasis></p><p>The 23 RNA-based company financings in 2022 were double 2019\u2019s count. Before 2022, no single one had surpassed $100 million. Inspired by Moderna and BioNTech\u2019s mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, researchers are digging into various forms and designs of RNA to unlock new therapeutic opportunities.</p><p>Orna\u2019s circular RNA-based medicines (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nat. Biotechnol.</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41587-022-00005-1;\">https://doi.org/10.1038/d41587-022-00005-1;</url> 2022) may be more effective, more stable and simpler to produce. Merck signed up with $150 million up front in an August 2022 deal that could be worth up to $3.65 billion. Arch Ventures-backed Nutcracker Therapeutics raised a $167 million series C on its promise of faster RNA therapeutics design, development and manufacturing, while six-month-old Orbital is trying to extend RNA therapeutics\u2019 delivery to more cell types and prolong half-life. ReCode Therapeutics, which is optimizing mRNA and gene correction for precision genetic medicines, including for cystic fibrosis, bumped up an earlier $80 million series B to $120 million in mid-2022 with funding from Bayer and Amgen\u2019s venture arms. Other companies are attempting to drug RNA using small molecules; Atomic AI, for example, raised a $35 million series A in January (Nat. Biotechnol.41, 305; 2023).</p><p>There\u2019s seed-stage action, too: in 2023, Italy\u2019s Resalis Therapeutics, which targets non-coding micro-RNA to tackle metabolic disease, attracted \u20ac10 million ($11 million) in seed funding from local VC firm Claris Ventures and angels.</p><p>Gene-editing groups are also on the right side of the line. Chroma Medicine\u2019s epigenetic editing approach targets innate gene regulation processes like methylation, rather than cutting or nicking DNA. It attracted a $135 million series B on March 1, led by GV (Google Ventures), Alphabet\u2019s venture arm. Metagenomi, inspired by CRISPR\u2019s provenance in bacteria, is mining microbes to help build novel precision editing tools. In early 2023 it added $100 million to a $175 million series B begun the year before. This wasn\u2019t a distressed extension round; investors were competing for a share of potential next-generation gene-edited therapies. \u201cWe wanted to increase our holding\u201d and couldn\u2019t get enough the first time around, says Naveed Siddiqi, senior partner, venture investments at Novo Holdings, which co-led the 2023 tranche. The company is still preclinical, but animal gene editing models offer the prospect of good translation into the clinic, notes Siddiqi. With sufficient cash to get to proof of concept and cash-generating deals with antisense pioneer Ionis and with Moderna, Metagenomi will be \u201cready to go public once the market opens,\u201d says Siddiqi.</p><p>Synthekine\u2019s cytokine engineering platform pulled in a $100 million series C at the start of this year, led by The Column Group, fresh with two $615 million funds, one for early-stage and one for later-stage ventures, raised in June 2022. Synthekine\u2019s PEGylated \u03b1/\u03b2\u2212biased interleukin-2 partial agonist STK-012, engineered to preferentially stimulate tumor-antigen activating T cells, is only in phase 1 (for advanced solid tumors), but the biotech has four further preclinical immuno-oncology programs, including cytokine-empowered CAR-T cells designed to be more potent, more durable and less toxic.</p><p>Cell- and gene-therapy companies in 2022 raised just over $3 billion in private investment. That\u2019s only half of 2021\u2019s bumper $6 billion, reflecting manufacturing and commercial challenges in the field, overcrowding, and the broader slowdown. But 2022 still brought 11 deals worth more than $100 million (top ten in Table 1), including a $270 million series C for gene therapy player Kriya Therapeutics, led by Patient Square Capital, and $300 million series C for Flagship Pioneering-backed Tessera Therapeutics, seeking to simplify CAR-T cell therapy using its \u2018gene writing\u2019 platform. This uses mobile genetic elements (also called transposable elements, or \u2018jumping genes\u2019) to \u2018write\u2019 therapeutic messages into the genome, potentially enabling RNA-based CARs to be inserted into T cells in vivo, skirting the need for complex, burdensome T cell extraction and re-infusion processes. The 2022 cell- and gene-therapy funding total was level with 2020\u2019s and well ahead of 2019\u2019s ($1.88 billion) and 2018\u2019s ($1.16 billion). So far in 2023, about a dozen private gene- and cell-therapy companies have raised a combined $525 million, according to BioCentury. Flagship Pioneering-founded Ring Therapeutics added an $86.5 million series C to that total on March 9; funds will help advance preclinical nucleic acid-based medicines harnessing anellovirus-based vectors.</p><p>The winner\u2013loser triage can be drawn out. Strong companies that need cash but haven\u2019t quite reached data readout may get a down round \u2014 investment at a lower valuation than in the previous round, leaving existing investors (and management) with smaller shares of a smaller pie. But at least there will still be a pie. Luckier ones may achieve the same valuation as at their last financing; such flat rounds are, in the current climate, \u201cthe new up rounds,\u201d says Novo\u2019s Siddiqi. Bridge financing (often a cash loan that converts into equity) can help firms reach a specific milestone, like a data readout or licensing deal. But beware shifting goalposts as investors demand more progress before funding the next round (Box 2).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Box 2 Who are your investors?</emphasis></p><p>Not all investors are equal, and that\u2019s especially true during troubled times. Multiple backers are better than one, as they offer more flexibility in subsequent rounds. Investors with longer time horizons are better positioned to weather a storm; that includes those, like Hellerup, Denmark-based Novo Holdings (backers of Hemab and Amolyt), with open-ended or \u2018evergreen\u2019 funding structures. These are not tied to generating returns over a specific time period, as fixed funds are.</p><p>If fixed funds are involved, investors with a several fund types and flexibility in where they invest also bring advantages. Naarden, Netherlands-based Forbion, for instance, can use up to a third of its $500 million Growth Opportunities fund to support firms across its Forbion Ventures Fund franchise or that of seed- and early-stage partner BioGeneration Ventures (subject to external validation). Similarly, Third Rock Ventures can tap its newest (2022) $1.1 billion Fund VI to support the strongest companies from its previous two funds. In challenging markets like today\u2019s, \u201cit\u2019s important to show strong insider backing,\u201d says Sander Slootweg. Investors unable to prop up their own projects will struggle to attract outside money.</p><p>Venture debt \u2014 loans to venture-backed companies \u2014 are another option, but rising interest rates make this an expensive last resort. Royalty-based financing deals have also accelerated, as companies seek cash today in exchange for a share of sales-linked royalties later. These deals are more common among public companies.</p><p>Other biotechs have had little option but to shutter shop or eke out the cash they have, including by cutting programs and staff. Layoffs seen in 2022 are continuing, with over a dozen so far this year, according to Fierce Biotech\u2019s Layoff Tracker. </p><p>In times like these, though, one biotech\u2019s distress can be another\u2019s opportunity \u2014 both to seize assets and to attract new money. Disc Medicine in December 2022 scooped up struggling Gemini Therapeutics\u2019 cash and its NASDAQ listing, raising an additional $53.5 million from existing and new investors Access Biotechnology and OrbiMed along the way. Disc has three clinical-stage programs for various hematological diseases, including bitopertin, a small-molecule glycine transporter 1 inhibitor, for erythropoietic porphyrias. Since listing, it has raised another $62.5 million, mostly from Bain Capital Life Sciences, betting on positive clinical data readouts later this year.</p><p>Private precision oncology firm Enliven Therapeutics played a similar reverse-merger trick with listed Imara, which had run out of road. Thanks to a concurrent $165 million in private financing, along with Imara\u2019s leftover cash, newly public Enliven found itself with $300 million \u2014 enough to see it through to early 2026. (Plus, CEOs are recycled: Imara\u2019s leader Rahul Ballal is now running new fibrosis-focused Mediar Therapeutics, which raised an $85 million series A on March 15.) Private biotech mergers can also trigger fresh funding, not always on disadvantageous terms: when cell-therapy company Ensoma bought gene-editing minnow Twelve Bio in January 2023, Twelve\u2019s founding investor Arix Bioscience co-led an $85 million financing round in the enlarged group at a modest premium, according to Arix CEO Robert Lyne.</p><p>Whatever the funding strategy, and however high-profile the company, failed data means game over. Liquidation plans emerged in February 2023 for Flagship-backed Rubius Therapeutics, which had been trying to turn red cells into therapeutics. Rubius was worth almost $2 billion at its 2019 IPO despite having no clinical assets. A further crunch is expected during the second half of 2023 as biotechs that raised money at the start of the bull market in 2020 run out of road and investor reserves are depleted. \u201cThere will be difficult decisions\u201d during 2023 for even top-tier VC portfolios, says one investor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Early-stage insulation</emphasis></p><p>There are positives. Innovation isn\u2019t slowing, and early-stage (seed and series A) investing remains relatively unscathed, says Edward van Wezel, managing partner at Naarden, Netherlands-based BioGeneration Ventures. The number of A rounds remained steady in 2022, and their average size dipped much less than that of C rounds (Fig. 2). BioGeneration maintained its (mostly European) deal flow through 2022 despite the shock in the rest of the market; for example, with a $5.7 million seed financing for Complement Therapeutics, a preclinical Manchester University spin-out working on new therapies for complement-mediated diseases through knowledge of factor H-related proteins. \u201cCurrent market conditions are irrelevant to the outcomes of companies created today,\u201d says Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Formela, partner at Atlas Venture, also focused on seed and early-stage funding. Sofinnova expects to do more seed and early-stage activity over next 24 months. Third Rock is putting more money and time into seed development to generate more data and thereby enable meatier series A\u2019s, says partner Jeffrey Tong, which, in turn, give firms some wiggle room to produce the value-inflecting clinical or proof-of-platform data they\u2019ll need for the next stage. Look no further than Cargo, funded to take its lead through phase 2 and advance its pipeline, or Rapport Therapeutics, which raised a $100 million series A in March 2023 from Third Rock, Arch Venture Partners and Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation to progress its central nervous system pipeline. Rapport is using regional receptor-associated proteins to develop small molecules that target neurotransmitter receptors specifically, potentially enabling greater efficacy and fewer side effects than current treatments.</p><p>For investors with money to spare, now is a great time to invest, whatever the stage. \u201cWe make more money starting companies during down cycles,\u201d said Arch Venture Partners\u2019 co-founder and managing director Robert Nelsen in January 2023. Arch closed a $3 billion biotech-creation Fund XII at the end of June 2022, barely 18 months after its previous, $1.9 billion fund. And this time, the quality and experience of companies, entrepreneurs, boards and investors is streets ahead of what it was in the downturns of 2001 and 2008, adds Sofinnova\u2019s Papiernik. New funds have emerged, helping build \u201cthe largest ever war chest of investable capital\u201d in biotech, according to PitchBook data cited in a report from Silicon Valley Bank before its demise (Box 3).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Box 3 Bigger money.</emphasis></p><p>Inaugural healthcare funds from Patient Square Capital ($3.9 billion) and tech-focused B Capital ($500 million from two funds), both announced this year, highlight the growing interest in biotech of private equity and large investment firms. Like all investors, they seek to buy low and sell high, but with many with tens of billions of dollars under management, these groups put large sums to work: Patient Square has deployed $3 billion since the downturn really took root in mid-2021, including leading a $270 million C round to fund Kriya Therapeutics\u2019 machine learning-powered discovery-to-manufacturing gene therapy platform. Patient Square joins the likes of Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle and Intermediate Capital Group, which have bought or allied with life-sciences-focused VC funds over the last few years.</p><p>Meanwhile, tech\u2013biotech convergence is carving out a new segment: newcomer Dimension (founded by two experienced venture capitalists, from Obvious Ventures and Lux Capital) in January announced a $350 million fund targeting the tech\u2013life sciences interface, with four biology-software ventures already under its wing, including machine learning-powered drug discoverer Enveda Biosciences.</p><p>This sector maturity is also reflected in a broadening range of investment strategies. Founder-entrepreneurs have new options to help them get out of the blocks, tailored to today\u2019s straitened times. Curie.Bio, unveiled in February by serial entrepreneurs Alexis Borisy and Zach Weinberg, describes itself as a \u201cdrug discovery copilot and seed investor.\u201d It offers founders $5\u20138 million in seed money and targeted drug discovery support in exchange for only 40% of equity, rather than the 60\u201390% that early investors typically pocket. The promise of greater control has added sweetness, as many biotech teams are forced into flat or down rounds that dilute their holdings even further. Curie.Bio\u2019s top-tier backers, including GV, Casdin Capital and Arch Venture Partners, have put in $520 million, of which $270 million will be invested in early-stage companies. The rest will help build an R&amp;D services arm via a network of almost 100 contract research organizations and alliance management professionals. Curie.Bio\u2019s 60-person-strong team of experienced drug discoverers and developers, spanning medicinal chemists, structural biologists and more, will copilot founders along a capital-efficient route \u201cfrom idea to industrial-grade drug embodiment,\u201d says Borisy. That means potent, selective drug candidates ready to be tested in appropriate physiological systems and to progress through development. Successful founders get a 12- to 24-month \u201cindustrial grade\u201d plan, access to facilities and resources (without having to build or buy them) and, if their idea works, an open door to Curie.Bio\u2019s network of follow-on investors. Four ventures are already up and running; the Curie.Bio team is agonistic on modality, and ideas can come from anywhere \u2014 academia or industry, US or global.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A European story?</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, Europe\u2019s share of global venture financing and IPOs fell while Asia\u2019s grew. European companies accounted for barely more than 10% of global private financing in 2022 \u2014 $3.5 billion, down from 15% in 2021 (Fig. 3). Yet overlooking Europe is unwise, says Novo\u2019s Siddiqi. The region\u2019s biotech valuations didn\u2019t bubble over as much as those in the United States during the pandemic, and still today, \u201cEurope offers great value for the science it\u2019s producing,\u201d he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fig. 3 | Regional private investing in biotech.</emphasis> Europe falls below Asia\u2013Pacific as the Americas remain strong.</p><p>Source: BioCentury BCIQ Database.</p><p>Siddiqi claims it\u2019s now possible to finance a European company through to a regulatory filing, with a nod to Amolyt, aiming to start phase 3 studies of eneboparatide this year. (Novo Holdings\u2019 ventures investment group co-led Amolyt\u2019s 2019 series A when the drug was preclinical.) Another nod goes to Basel, Switzerland-based Noema Pharma, which in March raised a $112 million series B, co-led by Forbion and Jeito Capital, to advance its clinical-stage neuroscience pipeline. Sofinnova-founded Noema, built around discarded assets from Roche, has three phase 2b trials, including ones for basimglurant, an mGluR5 inhibitor for severe pain in trigeminal neuralgia and seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex, and gemlapodect, a phosphodiesterase-10a inhibitor for Tourette\u2019s syndrome and stuttering. \u201cFor me, the 2023 story is about Europe,\u201d says Siddiqi.</p><p>Early-stage financing has improved in Europe over the last decade, and later stage growth funds now exist. But not all investors are optimistic about Europe\u2019s chances of growing full-sized biotechs. A lack of functioning public markets for biopharma and insufficient growth capital continue to hold it back, according to one trans-Atlantic investor. With moving to the United States almost a sine qua non for European biotechs, money and talent drain away. Most damagingly, so does the chance of a local champion to help spawn follow-on success stories. There may also be pickings for overseas buyers: in January 2023, Nanjing, China-based ReLive Biotechnologies bought German-listed Co.Don, including rights to its European Medicines Agency-approved regenerative cell therapy, Spherox, used to treat articular cartilage defects, plus GMP (good manufacturing practice)-standard manufacturing facilities. Co.Don\u2019s technology hadn\u2019t taken off, but the company provides a foothold for ReLive and its global ambition. Founded in 2021, ReLive concurrently raised a $35 million series A from Shanghai Healthcare Capital (Table 1).</p><p>Still, Europe\u2019s strong science base means companies will continue to be created, even if they do later leave. Dresden, Germany-based Seamless Therapeutics emerged mid-March with $12.5 million in seed money from Wellington Partners and Forbion to build reprogrammable recombinase enzymes that can edit a wide range of gene sequences. The technology stems from Frank Buchholz\u2019 lab at the University of Dresden. \u201cThe best opportunities may lie in the very early stages, at the academic\u2013industry interface,\u201d says David Schilansky, CEO of Home Biosciences.</p><p>Home Biosciences is doing something similar to Curie.Bio, on a smaller scale, with academic founders in Europe. Seeded in 2021 with $15 million from Redmile Group and Sofinnova, Home identifies promising academic science and brings the skills and resources to take it to a proof-of-concept-stage, VC-ready venture with its own pipeline. These skills, housed centrally, include a contracting approach that tech transfer offices can readily understand, plus management, due diligence and access to experts. \u201cGreat science is there, at the right price, though European technology transfer offices can be hard to decipher,\u201d especially in France and Germany, says Schilansky. \u201cLots of people think they can buy European science, but can\u2019t \u2018talk European\u2019,\u201d adds the trans-Atlantic investor.</p><p>Home\u2019s innovation hunt is focused on underinvested areas including kidney disease, fibrosis, bone and muscle disorders. Home has two ventures up and running: One Biosciences, a single-cell and artificial intelligence (AI) platform backed by the Paris-based Institut Curie; and a fibrosis venture, Sequantrix, from Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Aachen in Germany. Two more are in the works.</p><p>Home is seeking a \u20ac30\u201335 million ($33\u201338 million) series A. Schilansky is more positive about its chances this year than he was in 2022, when many investors were struggling to support their existing flock. Yet, with Curie.Bio pulling in half a billion dollars in half the time, it\u2019s clear that the trans-Atlantic funding chasm remains.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Efficiency rules</emphasis></p><p>Efficiency is a common thread spanning biotech investment strategies and R&amp;D in 2023.</p><p>Curie.Bio can offer founders a better deal because they\u2019re not building a new set of infrastructure around each project. Asset-centric approaches that accelerate programs to the next data point with minimal capital and overheads are multiplying along the R&amp;D spectrum as external funding sources become more discriminating \u2014 and with no end in sight.</p><p>TVM Capital\u2019s \u201cproject-focused company\u201d approach was born out of necessity after the 2008 crash. Then, as now, many investors had veered away from risky biotech, recalls Luc Mareng\u00e8re, managing partner. TVM\u2019s limited partners challenged them to come up with a faster, cheaper and more predictable drug development format. So TVM teamed up with Eli Lilly, whose Chorus subsidiary was already taking a \u2018fail-fast\u2019 approach to in-house programs, running experiments that could quickly rule assets out (or in). TVM initially sourced programs from big pharma, including Lilly, but now the bulk of the deal flow is from biotechs looking to raise money. \u201cWe cherry-pick what we like, put it in a de novo company and develop it,\u201d with each project-focused company having preferred access to Chorus, says Mareng\u00e8re.</p><p>It's an attractive solution for biotechs that can\u2019t fund everything (or anything) themselves. On 1 February, TVM committed up to $24 million to Recurv Pharma, set up to take the novel taxane cancer chemotherapy RP-001 through phase 2a proof of concept in solid tumors. RP-001, originally licensed from Stony Brook University (part of the State University of New York system) by TargaGenix, is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid\u2013taxoid conjugate, encapsulated in an oil-in-water drug delivery system that may provide a safer, more efficacious treatment alternative to regular taxane therapy. Recurv is the eighth project-focused company from TVM\u2019s $478 million Life Science Innovation Fund II.</p><p>\u201cWe bring the capital, a development partner and a motivated buyer,\u201d says Mareng\u00e8re, referring to Lilly\u2019s option rights to the programs. The model \u201cis as relevant in 2023 as it was in 2008.\u201d</p><p>Blackstone Life Sciences-backed operating company Neurvati offers tailored partnering options to biopharma companies with promising clinical-stage neuroscience assets. It accelerates selected programs through later-stage development, with committed capital from Blackstone Life Sciences. Neurvati\u2019s team designs studies to de-risk the assets, which are dropped into independent subsidiaries. The trick is matching the resources to the assets: \u201cThe structure, strategy and clinical development plan that you put around a Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy (DMD) program is very different to what you\u2019d require for a schizophrenia\u201d asset, says president and CEO Bruce Leuchter, who also co-founded digital therapeutics company Click Therapeutics. Neurvati\u2019s first subsidiary, GRIN Therapeutics, is developing radiprodil, an NR2B-selective <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis>-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) negative allosteric modulator, for genetically defined developmental epileptic encephalopathies. Radiprodil failed phase 2 trials of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in 2010, and a trial in infantile spasms was stopped in 2016.</p><p>Neurvati\u2019s emergence in late 2021, plus the recent financings by Rapport and Noema Pharma, reflect growing interest in central nervous system-related conditions. High failure rates have burned investors, but also left massive unmet need. The attention on newer treatments like Biogen\u2019s Aduhelm (aducanumab) and Eisai and Biogen\u2019s Leqembi (lecanemab) in Alzheimer\u2019s disease offer a glimpse into the demand for new neurology therapies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Computing new drugs</emphasis></p><p>Computational biology firms applying AI or other in silico tools to drug discovery and development attracted $1.6 billion in 2022, according to data from PitchBook and Silicon Valley Bank \u2014 less than in 2021 ($2.8 billion) but more than in 2020 ($1.1 billion). Financing deals for such firms also achieved some of 2022\u2019s highest post-money valuations, even though many are preclinical. High-profile advances like OpenAI's chatbot (ChatGPT) or, in the sector, DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold technology for predicting 3D protein structure, continue to attract investment into the AI\u2013biopharma interface.</p><p>Excitement is warranted: these computational tools aren\u2019t just accelerating and expanding regular R&amp;D activities \u2014 for instance, by trawling through and screening massive chemical spaces. Together with molecular biology tools, they are helping scientists uncover entirely new drug target estates and more precise ways of drugging them. They allow molecular behavior to be visualized and explored in detail: Eikon Therapeutics, whose platform tracks individual proteins inside living cells, set 2022\u2019s high-water mark in January with a half-a-billion-dollar series B. AI is also being used to generate brand new proteins or molecular structures. \u201cWe create drugs, straight out of the computer, that can either hit new or challenging targets,\u201d said Alex Snyder, chief medical officer at Flagship-backed Generate Biomedicines, during a J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference panel in January 2023. \u201cThe goal is to design them, test them, learn and repeat.\u201d Generate Biomedicines and Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine, also using generative AI, both raised large rounds in 2021 (a $370 million series B for Generate Biomedicines, a $255 million C round for Insilico); Insilico topped up with a $60 million D round last year. New startups continue to emerge. </p><p>So far, the promised drastically increased success rates and reduced R&amp;D timelines haven\u2019t materialized. \u201cAI has not found\u201d a new drug, as Atlas\u2019s Formela notes. But it has helped redirect some therapies: UK-based BenevolentAI redirected Lilly\u2019s Janus-associated kinase inhibitor Olumiant (baricitinib) during the pandemic, making it the first approved immunomodulatory medicine for COVID-19. In February 2023, Insilico Medicine received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) orphan drug designation for a small molecule inhibitor discovered by its generative AI platform, which has completed Phase 1 trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Chinese regulators also granted investigational new drug authorization for an oral 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitor for Covid-19, designed using Insilico\u2019s generative chemistry platform. The platform generated a suite of 3CLpro-like compounds that were tweaked to optimize binding. (3CLpro is key to SARS-CoV-2 replication.)</p><p>AI will not, on its own, revolutionize drug R&amp;D. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a bit of a phase where the tool [AI] is enshrined as the differentiated element that will change everything,\u201d says OrbiMed general partner Peter Thompson, acknowledging some hype around the space. It\u2019s a useful tool that will be applied with others: Flagship-backed Treeline Biosciences, for instance, uses computational science alongside structural biology and medicinal chemistry to uncover and drug difficult or previously unknown oncology drug targets. It raised $261 million in October 2022. Nimbus Therapeutics used computer modeling and structure-based design to develop an oral, highly selective allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor for which Takeda, in December 2022, paid $4 billion up front. Nimbus would never have produced that drug \u2014 in phase 2b for psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases \u2014 without a large medicinal chemistry team, notes Atlas\u2019s Formela.</p><p>Hence, \u201cwe currently invest in companies that use these tools, but not ones that brand themselves exclusively as AI discovery companies,\u201d says Forbion managing partner Sander Slootweg. \u201cThe proof of the pudding is [getting a new drug into] the clinic\u201d and beyond.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Precision financing</emphasis></p><p>That expression captures most investors\u2019 mood in 2023 (and perhaps beyond): they want much firmer proof that an approach or asset is working before they put dollars behind it.</p><p>Precision financing will replace generalizations: the IPO window will be open for the winners but closed for the rest. Large private rounds will be available to those with compelling clinical data \u2014 or a highly productive platform \u2014 but out of reach of the rest.</p><p>Few expect markets to bounce back anytime soon. \u201cIt may take another two years,\u201d suggests Sofinnova\u2019s Papiernik.</p><p>While the shakeout continues, companies focused on developing products that serve patients will find money, Papiernik says. They may also be part of a more resilient sector thereafter. As TVM\u2019s Mareng\u00e8re puts it, \u201csometimes even a forest fire is good for the landscape.\u201d</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Table 1 Top financings in cell and gene therapy</p><p><table><tgroup

Business Times News: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com\">http://www.ibtimes.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Dozens of villages were evacuated in tourist hotspots in southern Turkey on Sunday as wildfires that have claimed six lives raged for the fifth day, while Greece, Italy and Spain were also hit by blazes. </p><p><br/>Fanned by soaring temperatures, strong winds and climate change -- which experts say increases both the frequency and intensity of such blazes -- this year's fire season has been significantly more destructive than the previous average, EU data shows. <br/>Turkey is suffering through its worst fires in at least a decade with nearly 95,000 hectares (235,000 acres) burnt so far this year, compared with an average of 13,516 at this point in the year between 2008 and 2020. <br/> Fire crews continue to battle wildfires in Turkey Photo: DHA  <br/>A neighbourhood in the tourist city of Bodrum has been evacuated, CNN Turk broadcaster reported, as flames were fanned by strong winds from the nearby Milas district. <br/><br/>Unable to leave by road, 540 residents were taken to hotels by boats, the channel said. <br/>There were more evacuations in the resort city of Antalya, NTV broadcaster reported. <br/> Nearly 300 firefighters, two water bomber planes and five helicopters were battling to put out a forest fire in Greece Photo: Eurokinissi / STR  <br/>After hitting record levels last month, temperatures are set to remain high in the region. <br/> A temperature of 49.1 degrees Celsius (120.3 Fahrenheit) was recorded in the southeastern town of Cizre on July 20. <br/>And the mercury is expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius in Antalya on Monday. <br/> More than 330 people have received medical treatment since the fires in Turkey broke out Photo: AFP / -  <br/>Turkey's defence ministry released satellite images showing the extent of the damage, with forest areas turned black and smoke still visible. <br/>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been criticised after it emerged that Turkey had no firefighting planes despite one-third of its territory being forested and fires becoming an increasing problem. <br/>According to EU figures, Turkey has been hit by 133 wildfires in 2021 so far compared with an average of 43 by this point in the year between 2008 and 2020. <br/> A graph showing the progression in area burnt by wildfires in EU countries so far in 2021 compared to the 2008-2020 average Photo: AFP / Jonathan WALTER  <br/>Firefighters were also battling fires in Greece, after a major blaze broke out early Saturday near Patras in the west. <br/>Five villages have been evacuated and eight people hospitalised with burns and respiratory problems in the region, which remains on alert. <br/>Turkey has suffered its worst fires in at least a decade Photo: AFP / -  <br/>Around 20 homes have been burnt down, according to a provisional figure from the fire brigade. <br/>The mayor of nearby village Aigialeias, Dimitris Kalogeropoulos, called it \"an immense catastrophe\". <br/>Around 30 houses, barns and stables were consumed by flames in the villages of Ziria, Kamares, Achaias and Labiri. <br/>\"We slept outside overnight, terrified that we would not have a house when we woke up,\" a Labiri resident told Greek TV station Skai. <br/>The seaside resort of Loggos was also evacuated, with nearly 100 residents and tourists sent to the nearby city of Aigio. <br/>According to EU data, 13,500 hectares had been burnt in Greece, compared with an average of 7,500 at this point in the year from 2008-2020. <br/>Italy was again hit by fires after more than 20,000 hectares of forest, olive groves and crops were destroyed by a blaze in Sardinia last weekend. <br/>More than 800 flare-ups were recorded this weekend, mainly in the south, Italy's fire brigade said. <br/>\"In the last 24 hours, firefighters have carried out more than 800 interventions: 250 in Sicily, 130 in Puglia and Calabria, 90 in Lazio and 70 in Campania,\" the brigade tweeted. <br/>It added that firefighters were still working against blazes in the Sicilian cities of Catania, Palermo and Syracuse. <br/>While the south of Italy has been burning, the north has suffered wild storms. <br/>\"The cost of the damage caused throughout the northern Italian countryside by the violent storms and hail during this crazy summer amounts to tens of millions of euros,\" the Coldiretti agricultural organisation said. <br/>In Spain, dozens of firefighters backed by water-dropping aircraft were battling a wildfire that broke out Saturday afternoon near the San Juan reservoir, about 70 kilometres (40 miles) east of Madrid. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The plane was flying from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast.</p><p>China Eastern Flight 5735 was traveling 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph) at around 29,000 feet when it entered a steep and fast dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane plunged to 7,400 feet before briefly regaining about 1,200 feel in altitude, then dove again. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds after starting to fall.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board. It was about an hour into the flight, and nearing the point at which it would begin descending into Guangzhou, when it pitched downward.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an \u201call-out effort\u201d by the rescue operation, as well as for an investigation into the crash and to ensure complete civil aviation safety.</p><p>Relatives of crew members arrived at a China Eastern office near the Kunming airport where the plane took off, state broadcaster CCTV reported. On Monday night, an Associated Press journalist saw police officers and security guards patrolling outside the office with flashlights, ordering journalists to leave.</p><p>At a hotel near the airport, about a dozen people, some in jackets identifying them as members of China's aviation agency, huddled around tables and read documents.</p><p>State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern\u2019s fleet were ordered grounded. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model. China has more 737-800s than any other country \u2014 nearly 1,200 \u2014 and if identical planes at other Chinese airlines are grounded, it \u201ccould have a significant impact on domestic travel,\u201d said aviation consultant IBA.</p><p>Boeing 737-800s have been flying since 1998, and Boeing has sold more than 5,100 of them. They have been involved in 22 accidents that damaged the planes beyond repair and killed 612 people, according to data compiled by the Aviation Safety Network, an arm of the Flight Safety Foundation.</p><p>\u201cThere are thousands of them around the world. It\u2019s certainly had an excellent safety record,\u201d the foundation\u2019s president, Hassan Shahidi, said of the 737-800.</p><p>The plane was not a Boeing 737 Max, the planes that were grounded worldwide for nearly two years after deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>China\u2019s air-safety record has improved since the 1990s as air travel has grown dramatically with the rise of a burgeoning middle class. Before Monday, the last fatal crash of a Chinese airliner occurred in August 2010, when an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-business-health-airlines-europe-7783ef2f6e459040e7c95b30c29eabec\">hit the ground short of the runway</url> in the northeastern city of Yichun and caught fire. It carried 96 people and 44 of them died. Investigators blamed pilot error.</p><p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board tweeted Monday that it had picked a senior investigator to help with the crash investigation. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the 737-800 in the 1990s, said it was ready to help in the investigation if asked.</p><p>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was in contact with the U.S. safety board \u201cand our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\u201d Boeing shares fell 3.6% during trading in New York. The safety board said engine maker CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran, would provide technical help on engine issues.</p><p>Crash investigations are usually led by officials in the country where the crash occurred, but they typically include the airplane\u2019s manufacturer and the investigator or regulator in the manufacturer\u2019s home country.</p><p>Shahidi said he expects investigators to comb through the maintenance history of the plane and its engines, the training and records of the pilots, air traffic control discussions and other topics.</p><p>Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of the country\u2019s top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.</p><p>The aircraft was delivered to the airliner from Boeing in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years. China Eastern Airlines uses the Boeing 737-800 as a workhorse of its fleet \u2014 the airline has more than 600 planes, and 109 are Boeing 737-800s.</p><p>Broadcaster CCTV said China Eastern set up nine teams to deal with aircraft disposal, accident investigation, family assistance and other pressing matters.</p><p>The CAAC and China Eastern both said they had sent officials to the crash site in accordance with emergency measures.</p><p>China Eastern online made its website have a black-and-white homepage after the crash.</p><p>The accident quickly became a leading topic on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo platform, with 1.34 billion views and 690,000 discussions.

Operations in difficult terrain come as second nature to them, and they have more than enough capacity in their hydraulic system for demanding conditions\", says Juha Haverinen, Ponsse's product manager of forwarders.\" When the rescue authorities asked us if we were willing to develop this product together, we were ready right from the beginning, because rescue professionals and our customers had a clear demand for firefighting equipment\", Juha continues.</p><p>The firefighting equipment is available for PONSSE Buffalo and PONSSE Elephant forwarders. The minimum loader requirement is PONSSE K90+.</p><p>There when needed</p><p>The firefighting equipment is delivered to the fire location as a single package - and after it has been connected to forest machine hydraulics, the equipment is ready to operate. The 10 m\u00b3 water tank of the firefighting equipment can be filled with its own pump from a natural water source or the tank of a fire truck. The water cannon has a range of 47 metres and a turning radius of 360 degrees.</p><p>A carefully thought-out system\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">An economical solution - the forwarder can be engaged in productive forest operations when the firefighting equipment is not needed. The water tank withstands the use of various chemicals mixed with water, as well as seawater. It is also light enough to be lifted into the machine load space. The powerful pump can fill the water tank from a natural water source or the tank of a fire truck. The wireless remote controller can adjust the water spray direction vertically and horizontally, as well as the spray pattern.</emphasis></p><p>The local rescue department is responsible for planning firefighting activities. A properly trained rescue employee is responsible for the safety of firefighting. Rescue personnel operate the firefighting equipment and guide the forest machine operator's actions when putting out fires.</p><p>At the video you can see how it works.Video</p><p>Join webinar to learn more about the new product. Sign up</p><p>The webinar will be held in English, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, Russian and Finnish.</p><p>PONSSE firefighting equipment complies with the requirements of the European Union Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. Before the firefighting equipment is placed on the market outside the EU the local distributor (e.g. subsidiary, authorized dealer) needs to ensure that the equipment fulfills the local laws and regulations.</p><p>Further information</p><p>Juha Haverinen, Ponsse Plc, Product Manager, Forwarders,<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:juha.haverinen@ponsse.com\">juha.haverinen@ponsse.com</email>, tel. +358 40\u00a0839 8529.</p><p>This information was brought to you by Cision<url normalizedValue=\"http://news.cision.com\">http://news.cision.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://news.cision.com/ponsse-oyj/r/ponsse-firefighting-equipment-for-forwarders,c3235346\">https://news.cision.com/ponsse-oyj/r/ponsse-firefighting-equipment-for-forwarders,c3235346</url></p><p>The following files are available for download:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO88348&amp;sd=2020-11-11\"/> View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ponsse-firefighting-equipment-for-forwarders-301170934.html</p><p>SOURCE Ponsse Oyj</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=IO88348&amp;Transmission_Id=202011110805PR_NEWS_USPR_____IO88348&amp;DateId=20201111\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-IO8834820201111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618G-2DJ1-JB72-14VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"508\"/><timeReceived>8:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The plane was flying from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China Eastern Flight 5735 was traveling 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph) at around 29,000 feet when it entered a steep and fast dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane plunged to 7,400 feet before briefly regaining about 1,200 feel in altitude, then dove again. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds after starting to fall.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board.

Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model. China has more 737-800s than any other country \u2014 nearly 1,200 \u2014 and if identical planes at other Chinese airlines are grounded, it \u201ccould have a significant impact on domestic travel,\u201d said aviation consultant IBA.</p><p>Boeing 737-800s have been flying since 1998, and Boeing has sold more than 5,100 of them.

It carried 96 people and 44 of them died. Investigators blamed pilot error.</p><p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board tweeted Monday that it had picked a senior investigator to help with the crash investigation.

The safety board said engine maker CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran, would provide technical help on engine issues.</p><p>Crash investigations are usually led by officials in the country where the crash occurred, but they typically include the airplane\u2019s manufacturer and the investigator or regulator in the manufacturer\u2019s home country.</p><p>Shahidi said he expects investigators to comb through the maintenance history of the plane and its engines, the training and records of the pilots, air traffic control discussions and other topics.</p><p>Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of the country\u2019s top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.</p><p>The aircraft was delivered to the airliner from Boeing in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years.

Many posts expressed condolences to the families of victims, while others questioned the planes\u2019 safety.</p><p>The twin-engine, single-aisle Boeing 737 in various versions has been flying for more than 50 years and is one of the world\u2019s most popular planes for short and medium-haul flights.</p><p>The 737 Max, a later version, was grounded for about 20 months after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.

Drought Response Committee, meeting via conference call on June 9, 2021, upgraded the drought status to Incipient Drought for six South Carolina counties: Clarendon, Florence, Georgetown, Horry, Marion and Williamsburg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As designated by the South Carolina Drought Response Act, Incipient is the first level of drought, followed by: Moderate, Severe and Extreme. The general discussion among the Committee focused on how recent rain came just in time to keep more counties out of drought. The Committee requested to meet again in two weeks, recognizing that without persistent, widespread rainfall conditions can quickly deteriorate during the hot summer months.</p><p>Clint Elliott with Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority requested the Committee consider upgrading Horry and Georgetown counties.</p><p>\"Horry and Georgetown have had some severe dry conditions since March,\" Elliott said, \"and while the rains in the last couple of weeks helped, most of it came down quickly and subsequently was seen more as runoff than soaking. What was absorbed helped green up things, but more would be needed to get us back to a more normal state.\" Elliott also discussed the low flows in the Waccamaw River.</p><p>The Waccamaw River in Horry County was significantly impacted by the dry spring, with flows dropping from 1,000 cubic feet per second on April 1 to 18 cubic feet per second on June 1. The Northeast Drought Committee decided there was enough support to upgrade Florence, Horry and Marion counties to the first level of drought, and the Central Drought Committee followed by also upgrading the neighboring counties of Clarendon, Georgetown and Williamsburg.</p><p>According to State Climatologist Hope Mizzell, many locations across the Pee Dee received less than 5 inches of rain over the three-month period from March to May, which for some areas set a record for the driest ever. The drought was rapidly intensifying and spreading, then the pattern changed and much-needed rain arrived. Florence Regional Airport recorded only 4.28 inches from March to May, which is 50 percent of normal and the second-driest on record. Turn the calendar to June, and over the last nine days Florence received 3.07 inches of rain.</p><p>Priyanka More, SCDNR hydrologist, provided an update of the hydrologic conditions showing that improved streamflow levels across much of the state from recent rains along with groundwater levels remaining at or above normal status support the no-drought status for most counties. However, streamflow levels on the Waccamaw River continue to remain well below normal and support an incipient status for Horry, Florence and Marion counties.</p><p>The Committee also considers forest health and forest-fire threat before making its declaration. Darryl Jones, Forest Protection chief for the S.C. Forestry Commission, said South Carolina had an active spring wildfire season due to the dry conditions, with above-normal numbers of fires in both April and May. However, recent rains have helped spur new growth, and that has reduced the fire danger in the short term. While some areas are still dry, the chance of new wildfire ignitions is generally much lower now.</p><p>The West Drought Management Committee came to its decision quickly that conditions at this time did not warrant a drought declaration for the Savannah River Basin. While there was more discussion from the Southern Drought Committee, it also voted to maintain a no-drought status.</p><p>The Committee is cautiously optimistic based on the normal- to above-normal rainfall forecast, but will reconvene on June 23 to re-evaluate conditions statewide.</p><p>Media Contacts:</p><p>Hope Mizzell, SCDNR State Climatology Office:</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MizzellH@dnr.sc.gov\">MizzellH@dnr.sc.gov</email></p><p>Priyanka More, SCDNR Hydrology:</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:morep@dnr.sc.gov\">morep@dnr.sc.gov</email></p><p>Rob Devlin, SCDHEC:</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Devlinrj@dhec.sc.gov\">Devlinrj@dhec.sc.gov</email></p><p>Darryl Jones, S.C.

Forest fire managers impose restrictions on forest visitors only as necessary. While the threat of wildfire is still present, weather and fuels conditions have improved enough to reduce the probability of a major fire.</p><p>Phase B is the second level of wildfire-prevention restrictions, generally implemented when the fire danger is high. PURs are phased in as conditions warrant and may differ from forest to forest. Restrictions under Phase B include:</p><p>* Campfires, wood stoves, or briquet fires are prohibited except within designated wilderness areas (outside Lakes Basin closure) or established fire pits in developed recreation areas. Liquid or bottle gas stoves may be used.</p><p>* The use of chainsaws or other non-vehicle internal combustion engines is prohibited. (Chainsaw operation associated with commercial and personal-use firewood permits are regulated under the conditions of the permit and are not impacted by this PUR.) Generators are permitted only when contained in the bed of a pickup truck or in an area cleared of all flammable materials within 10 feet.</p><p>* Smoking is allowed only in enclosed vehicles, buildings, or cleared areas.</p><p>* Vehicle travel is allowed only on roads and trails that are clear of standing grass or other flammable material. Off-road or off-trail vehicle travel is not allowed, nor is vehicle travel on National Forest roads where access has been impeded or blocked by earthen berm, logs, boulders, barrier, barricade, or gate, or as otherwise identified in a Fire Order.</p><p>Forest visitors are urged to continue using great caution with any source of ignition and should be prepared to fight any campfire they ignite. Campfires must be attended at all times and be completely extinguished and cold prior to leaving. Ensure that you have at least one gallon of water and a shovel or similar tool before starting any campfire.</p><p>The public's awareness of the risk of wildfire and cooperation is essential to a safe fire season. Recreationists, firewood cutters, hunters, and other forest users can all help by closely adhering to restrictions, operating safely and cautiously, and keeping up-to-date on the latest orders and regulations.</p><p>Regulated closures may be in effect on State and private lands protected by Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) in northeast Oregon.

The plane was flying from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast.</p><p>China Eastern Flight 5735 was traveling 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph) at around 29,000 feet when it entered a steep and fast dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane plunged to 7,400 feet before briefly regaining about 1,200 feel in altitude, then dove again. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds after starting to fall.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board. It was about an hour into the flight, and nearing the point at which it would begin descending into Guangzhou, when it pitched downward.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an \u201call-out effort\u201d by the rescue operation, as well as for an investigation into the crash and to ensure complete civil aviation safety.</p><p>Relatives of crew members arrived at a China Eastern office near the Kunming airport where the plane took off, state broadcaster CCTV reported. On Monday night, an Associated Press journalist saw police officers and security guards patrolling outside the office with flashlights, ordering journalists to leave.</p><p>At a hotel near the airport, about a dozen people, some in jackets identifying them as members of China's aviation agency, huddled around tables and read documents.</p><p>State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern\u2019s fleet were ordered grounded. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model. China has more 737-800s than any other country \u2014 nearly 1,200 \u2014 and if identical planes at other Chinese airlines are grounded, it \u201ccould have a significant impact on domestic travel,\u201d said aviation consultant IBA.</p><p>Boeing 737-800s have been flying since 1998, and Boeing has sold more than 5,100 of them. They have been involved in 22 accidents that damaged the planes beyond repair and killed 612 people, according to data compiled by the Aviation Safety Network, an arm of the Flight Safety Foundation.</p><p>\u201cThere are thousands of them around the world. It\u2019s certainly had an excellent safety record,\u201d the foundation\u2019s president, Hassan Shahidi, said of the 737-800.</p><p>The plane was not a Boeing 737 Max, the planes that were grounded worldwide for nearly two years after deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>China\u2019s air-safety record has improved since the 1990s as air travel has grown dramatically with the rise of a burgeoning middle class. Before Monday, the last fatal crash of a Chinese airliner occurred in August 2010, when an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-business-health-airlines-europe-7783ef2f6e459040e7c95b30c29eabec\">hit the ground short of the runway</url> in the northeastern city of Yichun and caught fire. It carried 96 people and 44 of them died. Investigators blamed pilot error.</p><p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board tweeted Monday that it had picked a senior investigator to help with the crash investigation. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the 737-800 in the 1990s, said it was ready to help in the investigation if asked.</p><p>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was in contact with the U.S. safety board \u201cand our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\u201d Boeing shares fell 3.6% during trading in New York. The safety board said engine maker CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran, would provide technical help on engine issues.</p><p>Crash investigations are usually led by officials in the country where the crash occurred, but they typically include the airplane\u2019s manufacturer and the investigator or regulator in the manufacturer\u2019s home country.</p><p>Shahidi said he expects investigators to comb through the maintenance history of the plane and its engines, the training and records of the pilots, air traffic control discussions and other topics.</p><p>Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of the country\u2019s top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.</p><p>The aircraft was delivered to the airliner from Boeing in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years. China Eastern Airlines uses the Boeing 737-800 as a workhorse of its fleet \u2014 the airline has more than 600 planes, and 109 are Boeing 737-800s.</p><p>Broadcaster CCTV said China Eastern set up nine teams to deal with aircraft disposal, accident investigation, family assistance and other pressing matters.</p><p>The CAAC and China Eastern both said they had sent officials to the crash site in accordance with emergency measures.</p><p>China Eastern online made its website have a black-and-white homepage after the crash.</p><p>The accident quickly became a leading topic on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo platform, with 1.34 billion views and 690,000 discussions. Many posts expressed condolences to the families of victims, while others questioned the planes\u2019 safety.</p><p>The twin-engine, single-aisle Boeing 737 in various versions has been flying for more than 50 years and is one of the world\u2019s most popular planes for short and medium-haul flights.</p><p>The 737 Max, a later version, was grounded for about 20 months after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. In December, China\u2019s aviation regulator cleared the Max to return to service, making the country the last major market to do so, although Chinese airlines have not yet resumed flying the Max.</p><p>The deadliest crash involving a Boeing 737-800 came in January 2020, when Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard accidentally shot down a Ukraine International Airlines flight, killing all 176 people on board.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press researcher Yu Bing and news assistant Caroline Chen in Beijing, researcher Si Chen in Shanghai, videographer Dake Kang in Kunming, China, writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, video producer Penny Wang and writer Adam Schreck in Bangkok and airlines writer David Koenig in Dallas also contributed.</p><p>___</p><p>This version has replaced a reference to a 2010 crash to CORRECT that plane carried 96 people and 52 survived, not that the 44 who died was the total on board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-b0644cb141eb7313bfa4e1e25003301720220322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6525-KJ41-DYMD-61MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><timeReceived>12:46 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 22, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The plane was flying from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast.</p><p>China Eastern Flight 5735 was traveling 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph) at around 29,000 feet when it entered a steep and fast dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane plunged to 7,400 feet before briefly regaining about 1,200 feel in altitude, then dove again. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds after starting to fall.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board. It was about an hour into the flight, and nearing the point at which it would begin descending into Guangzhou, when it pitched downward.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an \u201call-out effort\u201d by the rescue operation, as well as for an investigation into the crash and to ensure complete civil aviation safety.</p><p>Relatives of crew members arrived at a China Eastern office near the Kunming airport where the plane took off, state broadcaster CCTV reported. On Monday night, an Associated Press journalist saw police officers and security guards patrolling outside the office with flashlights, ordering journalists to leave.</p><p>At a hotel near the airport, about a dozen people, some in jackets identifying them as members of China's aviation agency, huddled around tables and read documents.</p><p>State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern\u2019s fleet were ordered grounded. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model. China has more 737-800s than any other country \u2014 nearly 1,200 \u2014 and if identical planes at other Chinese airlines are grounded, it \u201ccould have a significant impact on domestic travel,\u201d said aviation consultant IBA.</p><p>Boeing 737-800s have been flying since 1998, and Boeing has sold more than 5,100 of them. They have been involved in 22 accidents that damaged the planes beyond repair and killed 612 people, according to data compiled by the Aviation Safety Network, an arm of the Flight Safety Foundation.</p><p>\u201cThere are thousands of them around the world. It\u2019s certainly had an excellent safety record,\u201d the foundation\u2019s president, Hassan Shahidi, said of the 737-800.</p><p>The plane was not a Boeing 737 Max, the planes that were grounded worldwide for nearly two years after deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>China\u2019s air-safety record has improved since the 1990s as air travel has grown dramatically with the rise of a burgeoning middle class. Before Monday, the last fatal crash of a Chinese airliner occurred in August 2010, when an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-business-health-airlines-europe-7783ef2f6e459040e7c95b30c29eabec\">hit the ground short of the runway</url> in the northeastern city of Yichun and caught fire. It carried 96 people and 44 of them died. Investigators blamed pilot error.</p><p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board tweeted Monday that it had picked a senior investigator to help with the crash investigation. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the 737-800 in the 1990s, said it was ready to help in the investigation if asked.</p><p>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was in contact with the U.S. safety board \u201cand our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\u201d Boeing shares fell 3.6% during trading in New York. The safety board said engine maker CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran, would provide technical help on engine issues.</p><p>Crash investigations are usually led by officials in the country where the crash occurred, but they typically include the airplane\u2019s manufacturer and the investigator or regulator in the manufacturer\u2019s home country.</p><p>Shahidi said he expects investigators to comb through the maintenance history of the plane and its engines, the training and records of the pilots, air traffic control discussions and other topics.</p><p>Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of the country\u2019s top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.</p><p>The aircraft was delivered to the airliner from Boeing in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years. China Eastern Airlines uses the Boeing 737-800 as a workhorse of its fleet \u2014 the airline has more than 600 planes, and 109 are Boeing 737-800s.</p><p>Broadcaster CCTV said China Eastern set up nine teams to deal with aircraft disposal, accident investigation, family assistance and other pressing matters.</p><p>The CAAC and China Eastern both said they had sent officials to the crash site in accordance with emergency measures.</p><p>China Eastern online made its website have a black-and-white homepage after the crash.</p><p>The accident quickly became a leading topic on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo platform, with 1.34 billion views and 690,000 discussions. Many posts expressed condolences to the families of victims, while others questioned the planes\u2019 safety.</p><p>The twin-engine, single-aisle Boeing 737 in various versions has been flying for more than 50 years and is one of the world\u2019s most popular planes for short and medium-haul flights.</p><p>The 737 Max, a later version, was grounded for about 20 months after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. In December, China\u2019s aviation regulator cleared the Max to return to service, making the country the last major market to do so, although Chinese airlines have not yet resumed flying the Max.</p><p>The deadliest crash involving a Boeing 737-800 came in January 2020, when Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard accidentally shot down a Ukraine International Airlines flight, killing all 176 people on board.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press researcher Yu Bing and news assistant Caroline Chen in Beijing, researcher Si Chen in Shanghai, videographer Dake Kang in Kunming, China, writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, video producer Penny Wang and writer Adam Schreck in Bangkok and airlines writer David Koenig in Dallas also contributed.</p><p>___</p><p>This version has replaced a reference to a 2010 crash to CORRECT that plane carried 96 people and 52 survived, not that the 44 who died was the total on board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-b0644cb141eb7313bfa4e1e25003301720220322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6525-KJ61-DYMD-61MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><timeReceived>12:46 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

A massive orange haze produced by the inferno in mid-September drifted across the nation to the East Coast. </p><p>As of Sept. 17, there were 79 active wildfires in 10 states, all of them in the western United States, according to the National Fire Information Center[1]. Through Sept. 17, there have been 42,512 fires this year covering 6.9 million acres. This year's wildfires will undoubtedly take their place among the most devastating in American history. 24/7 Wall St. has created a list of the most destructive wildfires in the U.S. this century. We reviewed data on wildfires that burned 100,000 acres or more in this century from the National Interagency Fire Center's Fire (NIFC) and Aviation Management Web Applications Program to compile our list. Click here to see the most destructive wildfires in the U.S. this century.[2] Click here to read our methodology.[3] Fires can occur anywhere, at any time, but certain conditions can drastically increase the risk and severity of fires. Drought, for example, dries out flora, which becomes flammable, creating conditions for an easily spreadable forest fire. Many of the wildfires on the list are classified as complex fires. The NIFC defines complexes as two or more fires burning in the same general area and managed as one event. The devastating forest fires have raised issues about the role human-induced climate change and development that encroaches on forests play in fires. Other issues considered include the need for controlled burns and other methods to limit the buildup of dead trees and brush that fuel wildfires.  Because of extended drought, high temperatures, and dry grasslands, the western continental states and Alaska have fallen victim to most of the severe wildfires in the nation's history. These fires have also been some of the nation's worst natural disasters. Here is the worst natural disaster in every state[4].

Fortunately, the Department of Music has continued performing concerts through streaming services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This concert was special because both bands were able to assist one another with support and feedback.</p><p>\"Students get motivated when they perform for someone,\" said David Faires, a music faculty member. \"It is very strange when you end a big song that is exciting, and when there is no clapping, you have to imagine it.\"</p><p>It is still unusual for artists to perform on stage when no one is watching them in-person. Luckily, both bands functioned as a small audience for one another. Students were pleased to play for those who have an understanding of how music works.</p><p>Along with the absence of a larger live audience, there were some other challenges related to the preparation and organization of the concert. All of the instruments had a bell cover that worked as face masks which reduce the spreading of the elements that release when people speak or sing. In modern realities, even musical instruments are forced to wear personal protective equipment.</p><p>Every concert is unique because teachers find special compositions that bring distinct moods and thoughts to those who perform and for those who listen.</p><p>\"We, as the directors, always try to select music that is going on to be meaningful to our students and the audience,\" said Diane Soelberg, the director of bands.</p><p>For this concert, all the compositions from the University Band were connected to England.</p><p>\"The first piece that we performed had small English folk songs,\" Faires said. \"And then the next piece we picked was about the Canterbury Cathedral in England.\"</p><p>The Symphony Band had another varied set of compositions.</p><p>\"The Symphony Band started with the piece from the earlier Baroque style,\" Soelberg said. \"And then the woodwind piece that we did by Eric Satie, who was the early 20th-century composer. The next song, 'Ash,' was written recently in the 21st century, so I tried to get a variety of faces from periods and then different styles, of course.\"</p><p>These two bands represented a variety of different cultures, styles and stories that were hidden in the compositions.</p><p>The concert's program featured the words of the American composer, Jennifer Jolley, who composed \"Ash.\"</p><p>\"I never saw snowfall as a child growing up in Southern California; it was more a phenomenon that I saw in cartoons or read in children's books,\" Jolley wrote. \"I did, however, witness my first ash-fall when I was in elementary school. I looked up into the clouded sky and saw specks of ash falling from it ... At that time, I couldn't comprehend how an enormous forest fire could create a small flurry of ash-flakes. Now I have the ominous understanding that something so magical and beautiful comes from something so powerful and destructive.\"</p><p>The composition performed by the Symphony Band reflected a story that had a powerful influence on the young artist. The combinations of songs each have different backgrounds and tell new stories.</p><p>Many other concerts will occur this semester.</p><p>\"We have a couple of jazz bands,\" Soelberg said. \"Then we have a whole bunch of choirs, and we have mixed men's and women's choirs. There is also opera and string orchestras, so there is a really big variety.\"</p><p>Moreover, every week on Thursday night, there is a broadcast for jazz. That is available on this website, along with all the music events.</p><p>There are a lot of music groups involving different instruments and different levels of skills. So for those students who are not music majors, there is still a chance to play in the band and perform on the stage.</p><p>\"We have a lot of students on campus who used to play instruments, and they do not know that they can still play,\" Faires said. \"They can play and study something else. I try to advertise this all the time because a lot of them do not realize it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5007763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62W2-92X1-JBSN-3360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Scroll: Brigham Young University-Idaho</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 8, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Rexburg</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>ID</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS9J</classCode><className>CONCERTS &amp;

Activities include excavators with thumbs rehabilitating dozer lines and spreading seed. Crews continue to assess containment lines and address interior hot spots where they can. Recent IR (Infrared) flight data shows hot spots which crews will focus on in the coming days. The closure order has been amended for the fire perimeter to prevent public entry, Order 02-486 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd841378.pdf\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd841378.pdf</url>) and replaces Order 02-484. Suppression efforts are focused in Luna Canyon, Lujan Canyon, Bull Canyon and on the north and east edges of the fire perimeter where snow has provided containment. Local resources are being utilized when and where appropriate.</p><p>The Carson NF and New Mexico Forestry Division continue to work together and coordinate firefighting efforts. Collaborative plans are being created to return in the spring to assess conditions and do further repair if necessary.</p><p>Weather: A weather event is expected for the weekend. Subtropical moisture increases across western New Mexico Saturday with showers and a few thunderstorms possible Saturday afternoon. Widespread (mainly) rain, with snow above about 11,000-feet, moves into the area Saturday night. Snow levels drop rapidly Sunday morning, with accumulating snow favoring areas above 7,000-feet or so.</p><p>Smoke: Smoke from the Luna Fire may be visible as interior pockets of fuel continue to burn. An interactive smoke map at <url normalizedValue=\"https://fire.airnow.gov\">https://fire.airnow.gov</url>/ allows you to zoom into the area to see the latest smoke information. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures.
