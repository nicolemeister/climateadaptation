Traditional policy analysis easily generates biased results due to different individual perspectives and personal experiences. Text mining emerges as an efficient way, but is not widely used in urban greening policy analysis. Moreover, existing policy studies are mostly limited to topic categorization, and there is a lack of systematic policy text analysis and real-time policy tracking. Here, we constructed a multidimensional dynamic policy analysis framework for systematic evaluation of urban greening policies by introducing AI big models and text mining. With Wuhan as an example, the framework was used to analyze the evolution of policy topics, distribution of annual topics, and spatial and temporal changes in greening indicators. Moreover, the framework supports real-time tracking and in-depth interpretation of policies, and the results can be presented through visualization scenarios. Analysis with the framework revealed variations of greening policies in Wuhan over the past 15\u00a0years, such as transformation from basic greening to ecological remediation and policy focus shift from flower planning to wetland protection. This methodology marks a new paradigm for intelligent policy evaluation, and significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of policy formulation and implementation in smart cities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>With the continuous growth of city size, density, and population, urban green spaces play an increasingly critical role in ensuring the sustainability and livability of cities. At the same time, in the context of severe impacts from global climate change on urban environments, urban greening policies are becoming increasingly important in improving the quality of urban ecosystems and living environment in cities1,2. Effective greening policies can not only significantly improve urban air quality and mitigate the urban heat island effect, but also increase public green space, thereby significantly improving the life quality of the residents3. Currently, the functions, benefits, and protection of urban green spaces have received great attention in the world2. Many countries have issued relevant policies of vegetation protection, such as the Biodiversity Offset Policy in Australia4 and the Urban and Community Forestry Act in the United States5. Since the \u201creform and opening up\u201d, China has enacted a series of policies and regulations to strengthen urban greening and ecological construction and management, such as the Regulations on Urban Greening in China and the Shanghai Municipal Greening Regulations6. However, the design and implementation of urban greening policies face numerous challenges, such as policies being disconnected from reality, insufficient consideration of economic feasibility, and poor cross-departmental coordination in practice7,8. These obstacles not only limit the achievement of policy objectives but also highlight deficiencies in the scientific rigor of policy design.</p><p>In-depth analysis of the content and objectives of greening policies is crucial to improving the rationality and adaptability policies. Greening policy is a subset of policies designed to enhance the ecological environment, address climate change, and ensure ecological security7. It adopts the fundamental methodologies and frameworks of policy assessment. Therefore, policy evaluation research provides theoretical and practical guidance for assessing greening policies. Policy evaluation is a systematic analysis of the policy system through scientific methods9, and can reveal the formulation motivation, design framework, and implementation process of policies, providing an empirical basis for policy theoretical research10,11. According to Varone et al.\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Handbook of Public Policy Evaluation</emphasis>, policy evaluation research now extends beyond traditional analyses of content, implementation, and effects to an integrated framework that includes goal achievement, social impacts, and democratic accountability9,12,13. For instance, policy evaluation now emphasizes not only policy effects but also resource allocation efficiency and long-term impacts on social well-being14. These advancements provide theoretical and methodological support for analyzing policies, including greening policies.</p><p>Policy content analysis is an important part of policy evaluation, and helps understand the intention, scope, and expected outcomes of a policy through in-depth interpretation of the policy documents, which is crucial for the evaluation of greening policies. Traditional approaches for policy content analysis mainly rely on qualitative interviews, literature reviews, or expert reviews to analyze the content and impacts of policies15,16. For example, Schwartz et al.16 delved into the green infrastructure policies of Ambos Nogales through policy categorization, stakeholder interviews, and focus group discussion. They also conducted a content analysis and an objective review of the qualitative data collected to identify the barriers for the implementation and regulatory opportunities, and explored the strategies to enhance urban greening. However, these approaches are often time-consuming and heavily dependent on personal experiences, while policy documents often involve complex legal language and multi-layered information structures, which together pose great challenges to traditional approaches when dealing with large-scale policy texts.</p><p>With the development of technology, text mining has been widely used in the field of policy analysis, providing an automated and efficient way to process and parse large amounts of textual data15. With Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, text mining allows quick identification of topic distribution17, 18\u201319 and extraction of keywords20,21, as well as the determination of affective tendencies22,23 and structural patterns, thereby revealing the trends and potential impacts of policy changes. It is currently widely used in public policy evaluation13,24, 25\u201326, social science studies27, 28\u201329, and market research30, 31\u201332, and is employed to capture the main topics of policy texts and the public\u2019s attitudes toward policies. For example, Park and Yong15 assessed the congruence between South Korea\u2019s energy policy and its official press releases using word frequency analysis and latent semantic analysis, revealing a direct link between government communiqu\u00e9s and energy policy. Li et al.17 analyzed the policy documents related to new energy vehicles by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) thematic modeling and econometric methods, revealing their significant impact on the market promotion of new energy vehicles. Dai et al.33 examined the policy texts of the bike-sharing industry by using word frequency and clustering analysis, identified three primary and nine secondary indicators, and revealed the governance challenges and government responses. Wu et al.22 analyzed Chinese residents\u2019 opinions on mandatory waste separation by sentiment analysis and LDA thematic modeling, providing a solid basis for improving policies associated with waste separation. These approaches have allowed researchers to effectively extract the core information from complex policy documents and improve their understanding of the policy content, thereby providing robust analytical tools for the analysis of greening policies.</p><p>Current research on greening policies has been mostly focused on the management practices of urban green spaces, policy evaluation of green infrastructure, and impacts of policies on greening effectiveness3,16,34, 35\u201336. For example, Baycan-Levent and Nijkamp34 compared green space policies in European cities through an extensive expert questionnaire. Feng et al.36 employed trend estimators and Mann\u2013Kendall tests to analyze the changes in vegetation cover in China to explore how government policies promote greening. Bush3 systematically evaluated local government greening policies in Melbourne, Australia, by using a transition management approach. Kwartnik-Pruc and Trembecka35 analyzed the data provided by Central Statistical Office of Poland to understand the urban distribution and types of public green spaces, focusing on the status of public green space policy implementation in the city of Krakow. However, most greening-related studies still mainly rely on traditional content analysis methods, such as questionnaires and case studies, which may yield biased interpretations due to researchers\u2019 varying experiences or perspectives, thereby constraining the scope and depth of policy analysis. In addition, there is still a noticeable gap in research on how policies guide urban greening efforts. More importantly, while significant progress has been made in text mining to deal with content analysis of policy texts in other fields, these studies have failed to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis. Current research on policy content assessment is mainly limited to some aspects such as topic classification and word frequency analysis, and there have been no systematic approaches that can comprehensively assess the deeper meaning of policy texts. In addition, there is a lack of real-time tracking and in-depth interpretation of policy dynamics, as well as intuitive and dynamic interactive visualization tools for policy makers.</p><p>In order to fill the research gap and address these challenges, this study constructs a dynamic, multi-dimensional policy analysis framework by introducing AI big models and text mining techniques, with the aim to systematically analyze the content of urban greening policies. The framework was then innovatively used to analyze different levels and spatiotemporal dimensions of greening policies by taking Wuhan City as an example: exploring the historical thematic evolution of greening policies at the macro level, mining the annual topic distribution and hot keywords at the meso level, and assessing regional greening indicators at the micro level. This study contributes to greening policy evaluation by: (1) Providing policymakers with a quantitative foundation for decision-making by identifying priority areas for greening resource allocation through thematic classification and indicator extraction. (2) Supporting dynamic policy adjustments to address emerging environmental needs by tracking real-time policy trends. (3) Offering visualization tools, such as word cloud analysis and geospatial displays of greening indicators, to enhance policymakers\u2019 and the public\u2019s understanding of policy impacts, thereby improving decision-making transparency and public engagement. This framework not only enhances policymakers\u2019 understanding of policy design and objectives but also improves the timeliness and precision of policy adjustments, ultimately fostering the effective implementation and continuous improvement of urban greening policies.</p><p>To achieve these objectives, this study first details the framework\u2019s design and technical implementation using the Wuhan case study in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section. It then evaluates its application outcomes in \u201cResults\u201d section and discusses limitations and future directions in \u201cDiscussion\u201d section, thereby offering a comprehensive analysis from theory to practice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Framework for intelligent analysis of greening policy texts based on text mining and AI big models</emphasis></p><p>In this study, we developed an intelligent analysis framework for greening policy texts based on text mining and AI big models, aiming to improve the rationality and practicality of policy analysis. The framework consists of the following seven main components (Fig. 1). 1) Automated timed data collection and preprocessing, which allows automatic collection of greening policy texts from government gazettes and related agencies to ensure real-time data update and consistency for subsequent analysis. 2) Policy keyword extraction, which employs NLP techniques to extract keywords and phrases from the texts to reveal the core content of the policy. 3) Policy topic categorization, which allows automatic identification and classification of the main topics in policy documents with topic modeling techniques to quickly understand the policy focus. 4) Extraction of greening core indicator: which means identification and extraction of key greening planning indicators from the policy documents, such as green space area and greenway construction, and is a key to assessing the effectiveness of policy implementation. 5) Policy AI interpretation, which uses AI big models to deeply interpret the policy text, analyze its main goals, and predict the possible outcomes of policy implementation. 6) Real-time policy tracking, which can collect dynamic data related to greening policies to provide real-time feedback to policy makers. 7) Visualization of the intelligent analysis results, which can display all analysis results through user-friendly interfaces, including charts, timelines, and maps, to facilitate the intuitive understanding of policy makers and researchers on the policy trends and specific objectives. Overall, the framework integrates seven functions to create a multi-level system for analyzing urban greening policies across macro, meso, and micro dimensions, addressing the time-consuming nature and interpretive biases of traditional methods in processing large-scale policy texts. These functions are interconnected through multidimensional analysis logic: (1) automated data collection and preprocessing establish the data foundation; (2) keyword extraction and thematic categorization identify macro trends and meso-level priorities of greening policies; (3) core indicator extraction and AI-driven interpretation assess micro-level indicators and policy outcomes; and (4) visualization integrates multi-level results into intuitive decision-making insights. This multi-layered design ensures comprehensive and systematic analysis while addressing specific policy needs, thereby enhancing the scientific rigor, timeliness, and practicality of policy formulation.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Framework for intelligent analysis of greening policy texts based on AI big models and text mining.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>Wuhan was chosen as the study area for this study due to its unique urban characteristics and environmental challenges. As an important industrial and commercial center in central China, Wuhan is characterized by abundant water resources and vast green spaces, but it is also faced with great environmental pressures due to rapid urbanization37. In recent years, urban heat island effect and air pollution have become increasingly serious38,39. Official data indicate that Wuhan\u2019s average annual temperature increased significantly from 1951 to 2018, with a warming rate of 0.30 \u00b0C per decade40,41. The average annual PM2.5 concentration in 2023 was 38 \u03bcg/m3, exceeding the national ambient air quality secondary standard by 9% and rising 8.6% from 202242, highlighting the urgent need for effective greening policies. In this context, Wuhan government has implemented several greening and ecological policies43, 44, 45\u201346 to increase the green space area, improve the ecological environment, and enhance the sustainable development of the city. These policies make Wuhan an ideal city to study the impact and effectiveness of urban greening policies and provide a good basis for this study. Therefore, this study explores the rationality, design effectiveness, and core content of these policies, to facilitate future informed urban greening policymaking.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Automatic data collection and pre-processing</emphasis></p><p>In the automatic data collection and data pre-processing stage, this study focuses on systematic collection and organization of urban greening policy texts in Wuhan. The data were mainly obtained from two official platforms: Wuhan Municipal People\u2019s Government Portal (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wuhan.gov.cn/\">https://www.wuhan.gov.cn/</url>) and the official website of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Landscape and Forestry (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ylj.wuhan.gov.cn/\">https://ylj.wuhan.gov.cn/</url>). By searching these websites using the keywords \u201cgreening program\u201d, \u201cgreening\u201d, and \u201cparks\u201d, the relevant policy documents can be precisely located. The specific steps are as follows.</p><p>Automated data collection. This study develops automated crawler scripts via Python, which can automatically crawl the corresponding text data in the specified websites. The captured text data include 12 greening policy texts (2009\u20132024) for thematic analysis, and 10 additional greening-related activity records from the past six months for real-time information delivery (Table 1). The acquired textual data were subsequently stored into a MySQL database with records including document source, year, and textual content to ensure that the data are organized and searchable.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Policy documents related to greening in Wuhan.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\"

Although limited data may hinder precise tracking of policy evolution, this study validates the methodological framework\u2019s feasibility and effectiveness, supported by available data. Future research can enhance accuracy by expanding the dataset to address specific needs and application contexts.</p><p>Data pre-processing. The following steps are taken to process the data in order to improve the accuracy of the analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Text cleaning</emphasis> Python\u2019s standard and RE libraries are used to remove HTML tags, spaces, special characters, and numbers, as these are irrelevant in most text analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Segmentation processing</emphasis> Text segmentation can split continuous text into individually manageable lexical units. Chinese text segmentation is particularly critical because Chinese writing is not separated by distinct spaces like English. This study utilizes a specialized Chinese word-splitting tool, Jieba, to ensure efficient and accurate recognition of Chinese words33,47.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Removal of stop words</emphasis> The common stop words that do not contribute to the analysis are removed, such as \u201cand\u201d and \u201cis\u201d, and the list of stop words in the field of greening are customized to exclude specialized but unrecognizable words, such as \u201chectare\u201d and \u201carea\u201d.</p><p>These preprocessing steps are aimed to optimize the dataset and provide clean and accurate input data for subsequent topic modeling and keyword extraction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy keyword extraction</emphasis></p><p>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a common weighting technique used in information retrieval and text mining to assess the importance of a word to a set of documents or one document in a corpus48. In this study, the TF-IDF model was used to extract keywords from policy texts. The algorithm involves two concepts: term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).</p><p>TF represents the occurrence frequency of a word in a document and is normalized to the number of words. For the word  in document , its TF is calculated as follows49:</p><p>1</p><p>where  is the number of occurrences of the word  in document , and the denominator is the sum of occurrences of all words in document .</p><p>IDF measures the general importance of a word in a document collection. To calculate the IDF value of a particular word, the total number of documents in the document collection is first divided by the number of documents containing the word, and then the natural logarithm is taken to obtain the IDF value for the word:</p><p>2</p><p>where  represents the total number of texts in the document collection and  denotes the number of documents containing the particular word . In order to prevent the denominator from becoming zero if  does not appear in any document, the denominator is usually added by one to ensure the stability of computation and avoid the error of dividing by zero.</p><p>Finally, TF-IDF can be obtained by multiplying the two:</p><p>3</p><p>The TF-IDF score can indicate the importance of the word in the document, with a higher value indicating higher uniqueness of the word in the document.</p><p>The TF-IDF model was chosen because it can effectively distinguish between high-frequency words and key words in a document, and is particularly powerful in analyzing policy texts containing specialized terminology, which can accurately identify highly indicative words. This model improves the accuracy and depth of text analysis by attenuating the influence of common words and emphasizing key thematic vocabulary50. Specifically, this study calculates the TF-IDF value of each word in a policy document and selects the top 30 words with the highest TF-IDF value as the keywords of the document, which are used to reveal the policy content and tendency in depth. This method not only improves the accuracy of keyword extraction, but also enhances the systematicity of policy text analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy topic classification</emphasis></p><p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a statistical model that contains a three-layer structure of words, topics, and documents, and is designed to identify implicit topics in large-scale document sets. In this study, we used LDA as a core tool for policy topic classification. The model assumes that each document is generated by a set of implicit topics, with each being defined by a probability distribution of words51. It can reveal the statistical patterns of texts, and deeply parse the structure and topic content of policy texts26. The LDA model can be applied to a wide range of policy documents. Although the framework supports dynamic analysis, we selected traditional LDA with topic similarity analysis (Step 4) over Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM) to track policy topic evolution, as LDA is more computationally efficient and balances complexity and dynamism effectively52,53. Additionally, LDA reduces computational costs with limited data, minimizing the overfitting risk associated with DTM51.</p><p>Topic modeling with LDA has significant advantages over traditional text analysis methods such as frequency statistics or manual classification. First, it can automatically extract topics through probability distribution, which significantly reduces human error and subjectivity. Second, the model can handle unstructured text and reveal deep semantic connections by simulating the text generation process. In addition, LDA supports categorization of multi-theme documents, which can accurately reflect the complexity of documents and provide a dynamic and precise analytical perspective for complex policy texts26.</p><p>The operation process of the LDA model can be divided into the following steps. First, the text is preprocessed (such as word splitting and deactivation removal) to construct a document-vocabulary matrix. Next, topics are randomly assigned to each document, and based on these initial topic assignments, iterative computations are performed to adjust the probability distribution of each word across topics and the distribution of each topic across documents. This iterative process relies on two key Dirichlet distributions: for each topic , the distribution  of the word  is governed by the prior distribution , while document  in the subject distribution  is controlled by the prior distribution , where  and  are model hyperparameters that affect the dispersion degree of topics in a document and that of words in a certain topic, respectively54.</p><p>By iteration until model convergence, the LDA model can output the topic distribution of each document and the lexical distribution of each topic. The results not only reveal the underlying topic structure in the document set, but also improve understanding of the implicit semantic hierarchy in the text. By analyzing these probability distributions, we can characterize each topic in detail, and thus further explore the key messages and trends of the policy texts. The specific steps are as follows.</p><p>Data categorization: according to the needs of the study, the greening policy texts are categorized into two classes for different analysis purposes. The first category of data is used for topic evolution analysis, and segmentation of the policy text data was primarily based on the number distribution of texts. Specifically, the data are segmented into four phases: 2009\u20132012, 2013\u20132015, 2016\u20132021, and 2022\u20132024, with each phase including three years of policy texts. This arrangement not only ensures data consistency and sufficient sample size within each phase, but also allows the comparison of changes and development trends of the policies between different phases. The second category of data is used to reveal the distribution of annual topics in recent years, including separate analyses of the data for 2022, 2023, and 2024 to explore in detail the policy priorities and changes in each year.</p><p>Determination of the optimal number of topics : To determine the optimal number of topics , it is necessary to calculate the consistency score and perplexity of the topic model, both of which are effective in evaluating the performance of the model. Perplexity measures the model\u2019s ability to predict the new text, reflecting the model\u2019s generalization ability, while consistency score assesses the differentiation between the topics generated by the model, i.e., whether the vocabularies of different topics are highly unique and relevant. A lower perplexity typically indicates that the model has better predictive accuracy and internal consistency, whereas a high consistency score represents that there are clear boundaries between topics, and the vocabulary contained in each topic is highly relevant and unambiguous26,55. Although both perplexity and consistency score can be used to determine the , we found that consistency score is more effective in evaluating the model as it can more directly and clearly reflect the optimal number of topics, which better meets our research needs of analyzing policy texts and revealing policy topics. Therefore, the  with the highest consistency score was chosen as the basis for topic categorization in this study (Fig. 2).</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Thematic consistency scores of greening policies in Wuhan.</p><p>Topic classification with LDA: After determination of , the LDA model was parameterized. Supported by prior validations and research26,56,57, we adopted default settings of \u03b1 = 50/k and \u03b2 = 0.01 for LDA. The parameter \u03b1 controls topic sparsity per document, with a higher value (e.g., 50/k) promoting more topics, ideal for diverse policy texts. Conversely, a lower \u03b2 (e.g., 0.01) concentrates vocabulary distribution per topic, improving interpretability51.Such settings can help the model to better learn the associations between documents and topics as well as between words and topics. The model was iterated 1000 times to ensure adequate learning and stable results.</p><p>Calculation of topic similarity: After completion of topic model training for each stage, the topic similarity between successive stages was calculated to identify the evolution and persistence of topics over a time span. Specifically, the calculation involves integration of the topics at each stage into text strings according to the contained vocabulary. For two consecutive stages, we transformed the textual data using the TF-IDF vectorization method and computed the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors, which is a metric used to assess the directional similarity between the two sets of data with the following equation15:</p><p>4</p><p>where  and  are two TF-IDF vectors,  is the dot product of the vectors, and  and  are the modes of the vectors (i.e., the lengths of the vectors). The result of this formula ranges from \u2212 1 to 1. When the cosine similarity value is 1, \u2212 1, and 0, it indicates that the two vectors have exactly the same, opposite, perpendicular direction, respectively.</p><p>Calculation of the share of each topic in each year: For the annual data, we calculated the share of each topic in each year. This step provides data support for policy development and adjustment by analyzing the occurrence frequency of each topic in each year\u2019s documents and proportionally assigning the topics to each document, thereby revealing the focus and changes in policy concerns in each year. The specific calculation process is as follows.</p><p>Topic occurrence frequency: The times that each topic appears in each document is counted to obtain the absolute frequency  of each topic, where  represents a specific topic and  represents a specific document.</p><p>Total topic frequency: The total occurrence frequency  of all topics in all documents, i.e., the sum of all , is calculated.</p><p>Topic percentage calculation: For each topic, the percentage is derived from the ratio of its occurrence frequency in all documents to the total frequency of all the topics:</p><p>5</p><p>where  denotes the percentage of topic , reflecting the importance of that topic relative to all topics in the year.</p><p>In this way, the percentage of each topic can be used to indicate its relative weight in the annual policy, providing a quantitative basis for analyzing the policy focus in each year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI extraction of greening core indicators</emphasis></p><p>In policy text analysis, extraction of core indicators is a key step to understand and quantify the effects of policy implementation. The common approaches include named entity recognition and entity relationship extraction, which are mainly used to identify and classify key entities in a text (such as locations, names of people, organizations, or other proper names) and their interrelationships in an unstructured text. Named entity recognition aims at tagging out specific entities in the text, while entity relationship extraction further analyzes the semantic connections between these entities, such as attribution and location relationships, thereby enabling more accurate and data-driven analysis and decision support58,59.</p><p>In this study, we chose Baidu\u2019s AI Qianfan Big Model Platform (<url normalizedValue=\"https://qianfan.cloud.baidu.com/\">https://qianfan.cloud.baidu.com/</url>) to extract the core metrics of greening efforts. This platform allows one-step big model development and service operation for enterprise developers, providing multi-functional natural language processing capabilities including Wenxin Yiyin\u2019s underlying model and third-party open-source big models. The platform is based on Baidu Intelligent Cloud and adopts the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework as the underlying support, which is capable of realizing high-precision and high-performance model output through a small amount of data adjustment. The application of Qianfan Big Model avoids the complex training process of traditional deep learning models on entity relationship extraction, which greatly saves the development and training time. In addition, the platform provides AI development tools and a complete development environment, making it fast and accurate to handle large-scale and diverse policy documents60. The use of the Baidu AI Qianfan Big Model enables the researcher to focus on building and validating a methodological framework for policy analysis without inputting too many resources into the development and optimization of technical details. In this way, the researchers can more effectively focus on parsing and applying the policy data, thereby promoting the integration of theoretical research and practical application.</p><p>The module leverages a large language model and prompt engineering to generate structured greening metrics (e.g., year, region, metric value) in JSON format, enabling subsequent visualization and analysis (Supplementary Table S1). The specific operational process includes the following steps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Prompt design</emphasis> Prompts are directive to guide a large model. The instruction can be a question or a text description with multiple parameters. Based on the prompts provided, the large model will generate corresponding texts or images60. In the large model, prompts affect the quality of the output as instructions. We carefully designed the prompts and debugged them to ensure that they correctly guide the model in extracting key information from the text, such as \u201cyear\u201d, \u201cregion\u201d, \u201ctype of indicator\u201d, \u201cvalue\u201d, and \u201cunit\u201d (Supplementary Table S1).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Interface call</emphasis> The API of Baidu AI Qianfan model is programmatically called, and the pre-processed policy text and prompts are input.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Data storage</emphasis> The results extracted by the model are formatted and stored directly into a MySQL database, which facilitates subsequent data analysis, visualization, and provides structured data support for policy evaluation and decision-making.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy AI interpretation</emphasis></p><p>This module uses the Baidu AI Qianfan Big Model for in-depth analysis and understanding of policy texts, following the AI processing workflow outlined in \u201cAI extraction of greening core indicators\u201d section, to produce standardized policy interpretations for decision-making support. Its advanced semantic understanding capability is especially suitable for dealing with complex or large-scale policy documents, which can greatly improve the standardization and objectivity of interpretation. For instance, using tailored prompt engineering, the model generates a summary of policy objectives, key terms, and potential impacts (Supplementary Table S1), enabling policymakers to quickly understand core policy elements.</p><p>The operation process is similar to the \u201cExtraction of greening core indicators\u201d module, which first determines the interpretation needs and designs appropriate prompts to guide the AI model to focus on the key contents or issues of the policy text. Through the programming interface, the pre-processed policy text is submitted to the large model and parameters are configured to perform in-depth semantic analysis (Supplementary Table S1). Ultimately, the model outputs will form policy interpretations to provide important insights and support to policy makers and analysts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Real-time policy tracking</emphasis></p><p>Real-time policy tracking is a key component of this study, designed to enable continuous monitoring of policy releases. While current data sources remain limited, the tracking module lays the foundation for integrating multi-source data (e.g., greening policies from government platforms, social media evaluations) to provide policymakers with comprehensive policy dynamics for timely adjustments and optimized designs. The specific operation process is as follows.</p><p>Setting of a monitoring module: An automated policy monitoring module is set up, which regularly scans the official websites of the government and related departments on a daily basis to identify newly released or updated policy information. This module utilizes search with keywords such as \u201cgreening\u201d and \u201cparks\u201d and automated crawling to ensure that all relevant policies are captured in time.</p><p>Real-time push: Once a new policy is identified, the module will automatically extract and store key metadata in the database, including the policy\u2019s publication source, date, title, and link. The data are pushed to the front-end display interface in real-time through a customized interface, ensuring that decision makers and analysts can instantly receive the latest policy changes and information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Visualization of intelligent analysis results</emphasis></p><p>In this study, a series of cutting-edge front-end and back-end technologies and tools were used to visualize the results of intelligent analysis. The front-end part mainly uses basic technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combined with the Vue.js framework to build the user interaction interface to ensure the responsiveness and interactivity of the application. For data visualization, we chose AntV G2Plot charting library and AntV L7 geographic information visualization tool from AntV, which together support the graphical representation of complex data and dynamic display of geographic information. The back-end part utilizes Python and Flask frameworks to develop API for processing the front-end requests and realize data interaction with MySQL database, thereby ensuring real-time data processing and feedback.</p><p>The whole visualization provides not only a convenient tool for researchers to observe and analyze the impact of policies, but also an intuitive platform for policy makers and the public to understand policy directions and trends, which greatly enhances the transparency and public participation in policy research, thus promoting the open sharing of information and democratization of the decision-making process.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Topic evolution of urban greening policies</emphasis></p><p>This study utilizes Sankey diagrams to analyze the topic evolution of urban greening policy texts in Wuhan between 2009 and 2024 (Fig. 3). The policy texts are explicitly divided into four phases in order to explore the focus shifts and development trends of policies in each phase.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Topic evolution of urban greening policies in Wuhan (2009\u20132024). The figure shows the evolution of topics and correlation analysis of greening policies in Wuhan. The streamlines of different colors represent different topics related to greening policies; the thickness of the streamlines indicates variations in the attention of each topic over time; and the intersections between streamlines reveal the correlations and interactions between different topics. By tracing individual streamlines, it is possible to understand how a particular greening topic has evolved from the past to the present as well as anticipate the future trend.</p><p>As shown in Fig. 3, the policies in the early phase (2009\u20132012) were mainly focused on basic urban greening construction and ecological protection, specifically including greening projects on urban rooftops and community parks, as well as the planning and layout of urban green spaces and roads. Moreover, the policies were intended to promote three-dimensional greening and ecological gardens, aiming to improve the life quality of residents and the urban ecological environment through urban park construction and ecological development.</p><p>In the middle phase (2013\u20132015), the topics were expanded to the integration of landscaping and culture, highlighting the interplay between nature and culture, and focusing on the greening renewal and maintenance of community parks. In addition, the policies continued to promote three-dimensional urban greening, plan and renovate urban green spaces to meet new development needs, and strengthen the landscape effect of road greening. A new nodal management approach was added to systematically promote urban and rural greening, while ecological development was focused on specific directions and began to pay attention to the protection of forest greenways and wetlands.</p><p>In the later phase (2016\u20132021), the focus of policies further shifted to in-depth ecological protection and publicity, including urban park and wetland protection, urban garden ecological publicity and greenway construction, resulting in enhanced stability of urban ecosystems, landscape afforestation, and neighborhood greening. In addition, this phase also emphasized the management of road greening, reflecting greater attention to the details and quality of urban greening.</p><p>For the latest phase (2022\u20132024), the policies were mostly focused on urban green ecological planning, which was aimed to comprehensively build an urban green ecological system and continuously optimize urban green space planning and management. The focus of construction was wetland and forest protection, while investment in urban park infrastructure was increased to enhance the service function of parks and the citizens\u2019 environmental awareness through public participation activities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Annual topic distribution and hot keywords</emphasis></p><p>In this study, an annual topic distribution analysis was carried out to provide a time-dynamic view on the focus of the greening policies in Wuhan, which can reveal the evolution and adjustment of policy priorities over time. From 2022 to 2024, the focus of greening policies in Wuhan showed definite trends and shifts. In 2022, the policies were mainly focused on \u201cflower planting and flower city construction\u201d (36%) and \u201cnational greening and garden renovation\u201d (32%), reflecting high priorities of urban beautification and citizen participation. However, forestry industry development and requirements only accounted for about 10%, indicating that relatively little importance was attached to forestry development in that year. The policy focus in 2023 shifted to \u201cpark greening and facility construction\u201d (27%) and \u201cwetland conservation and roadside greening\u201d (32%), indicating an increase in attention to urban green space infrastructure and wetland protection. \u201cAfforestation and forestry development\u201d showed an obvious increase relative to that of the previous year, and accounted for 19% of the total, indicating a gradual increase in interests in forestry development. By 2024, \u201cpark green space and garden construction\u201d (34%) and \u201cwetland flowering and ecological restoration\u201d (29%) became the main topics, indicating that growing importance was attached to ecological restoration and garden construction. At the same time, some new topics such as \u201cgreen tree planting and forest manager system\u201d (6%) and \u201cforest fire prevention and national land greening\u201d (15%) emerged, revealing the refinement of policies on forest management and ecological protection.</p><p>The results of hot keyword analysis for the last three years also demonstrate the shifts of attention focus of greening policies in Wuhan in different years (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S2). In 2022, \u201cgreening\u201d, \u201cgreen space\u201d, and \u201cwetland\u201d were the most dominant keywords, highlighting the emphasis on urban greening, green space construction, and wetland protection. By 2023, although \u201cgreening\u201d was still a high-frequency keyword, \u201cstation\u201d and \u201cgreenway\u201d exhibited obvious increases in frequency, indicating the focus on improving the quality of urban life. In 2024, there were significant changes in the most important keywords, with \u201crestoration\u201d and \u201cresource recycling\u201d becoming the dominant keywords, with the emergence of some new concerns such as \u201clow temperature\u201d, \u201crain and snow\u201d, and \u201cfrost\u201d. Moreover, the appearance of keywords such as \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cfriendly\u201d indicates the emphasis on a child-friendly environment. Overall, \u201cgolden autumn\u201d, \u201cflowers\u201d, and \u201csea of flowers\u201d were the focus of attention for the three years, suggesting a continued interest in seasonal landscapes and urban beautification.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Distribution of annual topics and hot keywords of greening policies. In (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), the font size of the keywords is adjusted according to their TF-IDF values to indicate the importance and occurrence frequency of the keywords. The users can view the specific TF-IDF value of each keyword in real time through mouse interaction to further understand the statistical weight of each keyword in the policy text.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial and temporal changes in annual greening indicators</emphasis></p><p>According to the data from 2021 to 2024, the planning of Wuhan for the four core indicators, including newly constructed green space, renovated green space, greenways, and tree planting, show significant spatial differences and temporal changes (Fig. 5). The planning data show different development focus and adjustment trend between the central and distant urban areas. In central urban areas, such as Jiang\u2019an and Jianghan Districts, the planning data for newly constructed and renovated green spaces reached the peak in 2022 and were then adjusted. For example, in Jiang\u2019an District, newly constructed green space increased to 10 ha and renovated green space reached 26.1 ha in 2022, after which the newly constructed green space remained almost unchanged and the renovated green space declined to 5 ha in 2024. Tree planting and greenway construction also showed a relatively stable trend, with greenway construction increasing in 2022 and 2024, such as three kilometers in Jiang\u2019an District in 2022 and 2024, and three kilometers and two kilometers in Jianghan District, respectively. Tree planting generally remained stable despite of some fluctuations in central urban areas. For example, the number of trees planted in Jianghan District between 2021 and 2024 remained at 5000 to 10,000 trees, reflecting an emphasis on optimizing the quality of existing green space and increasing ecological facilities in central urban areas.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Core greening indicator values and temporal and spatial changes in Wuhan (2021\u20132024). The greenway plan map of 2021 in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) is missing because all zone plans have a value of zero. The legend uses a gradient from \u201clow\u201d to \u201chigh\u201d rather than specific numbers to standardize the range of data across maps.</p><p>In distant urban areas, especially Wuhan Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone (Hannan District) and Jiangxia District, the scale of newly constructed green space and tree planting significantly exceeds that of central urban areas with a steadily growing trend. For example, the newly constructed green space in Jiangxia District increased from 220 ha in 2021 to 230 ha in 2024, and the number of trees planted in the same district increased from 550,000 to 600,000. Newly constructed green space in Hannan District increased from 160 ha in 2021 to 200 ha in 2022, and reached 220 ha in 2023, followed by a decrease to 150 ha in 2024. The number of trees planted remained between 100,000 and 300,000 in the region, showing a continued large-scale investment in greening. In addition, the focus of greenway construction has shifted from central to distant urban areas, especially in 2024, with distant urban areas demonstrating positive growth, reflecting more investment in connecting new facilities and improving the life quality of residents. For example, Wuhan Airport Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone (Dongxihu District) and Hannan District have greenway construction plans of five and ten kilometers in 2024, respectively. This change marks a geographical shift in policy focus, highlighting strategic adjustment to expand urban boundaries and enhance ecological functions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greening policy evolution and strategy analysis</emphasis></p><p>Analysis of topic evolution in this study reveals the evolution of policy topics from infrastructure to integrated ecological management, which reflects the response of policy makers to the emerging needs of urban development and the adaptation of global trends in environmental protection. In early phases, the policies were mainly focused on increasing the area and ecological quality of urban green space and enhancing the ecological functions of cities by promoting three-dimensional greening and ecological gardens. Over time, the focus of policies was gradually shifted to the integration of nature and culture, greening renewal and maintenance of community parks, and adaptation to urban green spaces to meet new urban development needs, reflecting a response to national strategies for urban renewal and ecological civilization61.</p><p>Second, the analysis of annual topic distribution and hot keywords further confirms the sensitivity and responsiveness of Wuhan in addressing environmental challenges and meeting the needs of citizens. The evolution of topics from \u201cflower planting and flower city construction\u201d to \u201cwetland flowering and ecological restoration\u201d, as well as the emergence of the new topic \u201cgreen tree planting and forest manager system\u201d indicates that policy adjustments have become more focused on ecological civilization and forest construction. The changes in keywords reflect not only the public\u2019s increased attention to the quality of greening, but also their rising awareness of environmental protection, which drives the policy to develop in a more integrated and sustainable direction. For example, with increasing impacts of global climate change, the keywords \u201crestoration\u201d and \u201cresource recycling\u201d appeared in 2024, signifying that the city is beginning to strengthen the restoration and sustainable use of ecosystem services and natural capital besides traditional greening efforts62. In addition, the appearance of keywords such as \u201clow temperature\u201d, \u201crain and snow\u201d, and \u201cfrost\u201d reflects the policy makers\u2019 concern and response strategies for extreme weather events, and indicates that Wuhan has integrated disaster risk management and sustainable utilization into its urban planning63. These keywords not only reflect the policy responses, but also indicate the dynamic adjustment and balance between social needs and environmental goals.</p><p>Finally, there are great differences in strategies between different regions, indicating full consideration of urban planning on the functional positioning and development needs of different regions, as well as strategic adjustment of the city in expanding urban boundaries and enhancing ecological functions. An in-depth analysis of regional greening indicators shows that Wuhan\u2019s greening policies are clearly differentiated between central and distant urban areas. Greening policies in central urban areas focus on optimizing and maintaining existing green spaces to enhance the residential and commercial attractiveness of the urban core, which matches with the high-density urban layout and complex socio-economic activities in these areas. For example, in central urban areas such as Jiang\u2019an and Wuchang districts, the policy strives to improve the quality and accessibility of public spaces by constructing new greenways and converting green spaces to promote the health of residents and social interaction64. In distant urban areas such as Jiangxia District and Hannan District, on the other hand, the policies are more focused on large-scale newly constructed green space and tree-planting projects to support the rapid urbanization and expansion needs of these areas65, while providing enough greenery to alleviate the environmental pressures that may result from industrial development.</p><p>Overall, the analysis of topic evolution, annual topic distribution, and regional indicators reveals the strategies of policy makers in resource allocation and urban greening efforts. These strategies not only reflect a precise grasp of the stage of urban development and regional characteristics, but also provide valuable experiences for other cities, especially in promoting sustainable urban development and ecological civilization. Supported by existing research and relevant official policies61, 62, 63, 64\u201365, these findings are further validated, reinforcing their scientific rigor and reliability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Challenges for policy makers and relevant strategies</emphasis></p><p>This study reveals that despite the remarkable achievements of greening efforts in Wuhan, there is still a retarded progress in intelligent construction and collaborative management. In an era of information technology, it is particularly important to improve the level of intelligence in greening construction. Currently, there are more than 1,000 parks in Wuhan, but the number of smart parks is still insufficient to meet the needs of a modern city, which limits the effective collection, monitoring, and management of data. Therefore, it is crucial to strengthen the information infrastructure and improve the level of intelligence in greening policies. The government should make more investment into the construction of smart parks, wetlands, and scenic spots, as well as introduce smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), visual recognition, and big data analytics to enhance the efficiency of greening management and visitor experience66,67. In addition, the government should establish a comprehensive urban greening information platform68, which can not only integrate GIS and remote sensing technologies to improve the efficiency of planning and execution of greening projects, but also enhance the public\u2019s interaction and sense of participation.</p><p>In May 2024, the Wuhan Consolidation and Creation of Natural Resources and Urban\u2013Rural Development Bureau merged different planning, management, and supervisory responsibilities to form an integrated agency69. This initiative provides a good example for landscape greening, since successful greening planning and construction not only relies on the landscape construction department, but also requires the synergistic support from various departments such as urban planning, environmental protection, and finance. Currently, information silos and inadequate coordination mechanisms hinder the effective use of greening resources and the overall implementation of policies. Therefore, it is crucial to further reform the landscaping and greening construction agencies to enhance interdepartmental information sharing and decision-making consistency. In addition, it is also critical to establish a cross-departmental platform for collaborative work, which can improve the communication and collaboration among different departments and the work efficiency, so as to synergistically promote urban greening. For example, the urban planning department can release planning updates through the platform; the landscape construction department can adjust the design and implementation of greening projects based on such information; and the financial department can monitor the fund flow to ensure the rational use of funds. These strategies can not only improve the management efficiency and public satisfaction of urban greening, but also enhance the sustainability and adaptability of greening policies, thus promoting the sustainable development of cities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advantages of the proposed policy analysis framework</emphasis></p><p>This study combines AI big models and text mining and proposes an intelligent spatiotemporal analysis framework for greening policies, which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to parse policy texts, and extracts and analyzes the key information in policies through a systematic approach to reveal the intrinsic connections and evolutionary trends of policy documents.</p><p>First, compared with traditional methods of policy analysis, such as questionnaires and expert reviews, this framework utilizes machine learning algorithms and AI big models to enable real-time, intelligent policy text analysis, which can more accurately identify the trend of policy changes, automatically extract the topics and core metrics, and readily analyze the dynamic development of metrics over time and geographic location. Secondly, the framework supports AI interpretation and real-time policy tracking to help relevant departments to quickly respond to policy requirements and improve the accuracy of policy implementation. In addition, AI interpretation can objectively analyze the policy perspectives and avoid the subjectivity of expert analysis, which not only improves the efficiency of policy analysis and interpretation, but also enhances the transparency and predictability of policy outcomes. Furthermore, the framework has a certain degree of universality and can be extended and applied to other cities or fields, such as urban construction and transportation planning, by simply designing the prompts in a targeted manner and training the corresponding intelligence to extract and interpret the corresponding core indicators for adaptation to the specific policy environment and data characteristics. For example, in urban construction, by customizing the prompts such as \u201cland use change\u201d, \u201cpark development\u201d, and \u201cold neighborhood renovation\u201d, the AI model can automatically extract policy planning objectives and implementation goals from the relevant policy texts, thus helping more accurate decision making and policy evaluation.</p><p>In summary, this study develops a multidimensional policy analysis framework that integrates AI big models and text mining techniques. The framework covers data collection, topic modeling, keyword extraction, policy AI interpretation, real-time tracking, and application scenario visualization, providing an innovative method and tool for policy analysis. This framework not only is suitable for building an intelligent policy analysis platform (Fig. 6), but also can significantly improve the rationality and precision of policy formulation and implementation, thus supporting decision makers and researchers in complex policy environments and enhancing the effectiveness of policy responses.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Visualization of intelligent analysis results for greening policies in Wuhan. As shown in the animation (Supplementary Animation S1), we constructed a visualization webpage for the intelligent analysis of greening policies in Wuhan. The website provides real-time policy monitoring and AI-driven interpretation functions, as well as multi-dimensional analysis visualization and dynamic interaction, which can be effectively integrated into the policy evaluation system to provide scientific decision support for policy makers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitations and future research</emphasis></p><p>Despite many advantages of the policy analysis framework proposed in this study, there are still some limitations, which may also be possible directions for future research. First, the Baidu AI Big Model is still faced with challenges in processing longer policy texts, especially when the text has a high complexity, which may affect the processing efficiency and output accuracy of the model, thus limiting the possibility to generalize it to a wider range of application scenarios. In addition, although the use of AI big models in the framework significantly saves the time cost of model training, its paid use will increase the cost, and the model promotion and application are also confronted with certain restrictions. Second, the framework mainly focuses on the analysis of textual data and fails to fully integrate other types of data, such as greenfield implementation and monitoring data, which may limit its ability to understand the impacts of policies from multiple dimensions. Indeed, the effects of greening policies often need to be assessed through real-time monitoring data such as real green space conditions and ecological changes, and a comprehensive assessment of policy impacts needs to take a variety of data sources into account so as to gain a more comprehensive perspective. Although the framework achieves multi-level analysis through seven functions, its modules lack sufficient depth to fully address specific policy analysis needs, limiting its responsiveness.</p><p>Future research could expand and deepen the current study in several directions. First, research could explore how to combine multiple data types, including quantitative and qualitative data, to construct more comprehensive policy analysis models. In addition, it should be determined how to use AI big models to enhance the interpretive power and transparency of greening policy texts. To address the limited module-specific needs analysis, future research could enhance customization for targeted policy requirements, thereby improving the framework\u2019s utility and depth. Finally, future research should also consider the validation and adjustment of the present framework in more regions and cities of different sizes to assess its adaptability and effectiveness in different policy environments. Through cross-regional experimentation and feedback, the framework can be continuously optimized to better serve the diverse policymaking needs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>Urban green space plays an important role in sustainable urban development. In-depth analysis and assessment of the content and objectives of greening policies are crucial to understanding the intent of the policies and improving the rationality and adaptability of the policies. This study for the first time applies AI big models and text mining to create a multidimensional and dynamic policy analysis framework for systematic assessment of urban greening policies. The framework can analyze policy texts in real-time, intelligently and precisely track policy change trends, automatically extract topics and core indicators, and analyze the dynamic changes of indicators in time and space. In addition, through integrated visualization display, the framework not only enhances the policy makers\u2019 understanding of policy effects, but also improves the timeliness and accuracy of policy adjustment, which can promote the effective implementation and continuous improvement of urban greening policies. This methodology is not limited to greening policy analysis, and can also be widely applied to other policy areas, especially in urban planning and sustainable development policymaking. Future research could explore how to further optimize the analytical model, as well as include more data types and more complex policy environments, to provide policy makers with more comprehensive and accurate decision support. Overall, this study breaks through the limitations of traditional policy analysis and paves a new way to utilize AI big models and text mining techniques for policy evaluation, providing powerful tools and methodologies for policy analysis and application in smart cities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors would like to thank Wuhan University for providing funding and facilities for this research.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Wu, W-B.

Harpold, who also conducts research as part of the College's Experiment Station, is principal investigator of the study funded by the U.S. Forest Service and recently published in Water Resources Research.</p><p>Adrian Harpold, an associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources &amp; Environmental Science, is principal investigator of the study recently published in Water Resources Research.</p><p>That increased water would be particularly valuable, especially in drought years, to farmers and cities in central California and northern Nevada who rely on Sierra snowpack for much of their water supply. The new research doesn't delve into financial considerations but focuses exclusively on the amounts of water generated by thinned forests.</p><p>Complex factors affect water yield</p><p>When forests are thinned, either through prescribed burning or mechanical removal, less rain and snow is intercepted and lost in the tree canopy, and more reaches the ground, Boardman said. Snow and rain captured by the tree canopy is likely to evaporate, while snow and rain that reaches the ground is more likely to feed water to streams.</p><p>At the same time, removal of some large trees reduces the demand for water. Fewer trees, after all, require less water, and thus runoff increases.</p><p>While forest managers long have viewed increased water yields as a side benefit of forest-thinning operations that have focused on reducing forest fire risk, the computer models applied by Harpold and Boardman present a nuanced look at the complexities involved.</p><p>For instance, Boardman noted that even though removal of trees reduces some of the demand for water, plants in the forest understory (bushes, grasses and other small plants) often thrive when larger competitors are removed. The understory, in turn, requires more water after thinning operations, although not as much as the amount required by large trees. Thus, not all the snow and rain that reaches the ground when larger trees are removed will necessarily translate into more runoff.</p><p>At the same time, the research found that large-scale flooding risks don't increase significantly even when thinned forests yield more water. Some small infrastructure such as road culverts might be affected by greater localized runoff, but the large reservoirs such as the Oroville Dam that nearly failed from flooding in 2017 show low sensitivity to the forest restoration efforts.</p><p>The origins of the research project go back to Harpold's involvement in the Tahoe West Project with the U.S. Forest Service, which eventually led to the opportunity to expand to a regional scale.</p><p>Forests that have been thinned, such as this stand in the Yuba River Basin, are healthier and more fire-safe and are likely to produce more water from runoff. Photo by Elijah Boardman.</p><p>Harpold approached Mark Wigmosta at the Department of Energy, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory about collaborating around his hydrological simulation model. The project led to hiring Boardman who, Harpold said, ultimately \"did all the work.\" For example, to sort through the millions of simulations needed to make predictions in different scenarios for large river basins - the Truckee, American, Bear and Yuba - into the next 100 years of changing climate, Boardman took advantage of the Pronghorn High-Performance Computer Cluster in the University's Office of Information Technology. Despite the technical challenges, Boardman said he is using the analytical tools used for this research in other watersheds worldwide and continuing to collaborate with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.</p><p>Funding source for thinning?</p><p>The new study dovetails with the work of the Tahoe Central Sierra Initiative, a science-based effort by private, federal and state partners to restore the resilience of 2.4 million acres of forested wildlands in the Sierra Nevada. As part of that initiative, the U.S. Forest Service is assessing the potential markets for water supply, wood products and carbon storage that could financially support forest-thinning operations.</p><p>Thinner forests, in turn, are viewed by leaders of the Tahoe Central Sierra Initiative as a key element in the reduction of risks from high-severity wildfires in the many forests that are overgrown today as the result of more than a century of fire-suppression efforts.</p><p>Harpold notes that another nonprofit initiative, Sacramento-based Blue Forest, already is using the promise of increased water yields from thinned forests to help support bonds that it sells to finance urgent forest-resilience projects.</p><p>Along with improved supplies for agriculture and municipal water customers, increased water yields from thinner forests can benefit aquatic and riparian ecosystems and potentially improve the operation of hydropower plants, Harpold and Boardman said in their study.</p><p>While the costs of large-scale thinning operations across the Central Sierra are daunting - even if water yields and other environmental benefits produce some revenue - Boardman said targeted forest thinning could be cost-effective. He explained that forest managers could use results such as his to select watersheds with especially dense forests that typically receive high amounts of precipitation (snow and rain).</p><p>The soon-to-be-minted Dr. Boardman now is putting the skills he developed as a doctoral student working with Harpold into creation of a new Nevada-based company, Mountain Hydrology LLC, that provides water forecasting and hydrological research.

The Camden County Office of Emergency Management has been monitoring the fire events through their peers in the surrounding counties and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. In addition, we deployed assets from the Department of Public Safety to assist firefighting at the Bethany Run wildfire burning on the Voorhees and Evesham border last week. The 360-acre event was contained this weekend, but wildfires continue to burn throughout the state most notably a 2,500-acre fire in West Milford that is currently 0% contained. Nevertheless, these fires are not, for the most part physically near us but the wind has carried some of the smell and ash our way.</p><p>The state has been under a drought watch since Oct. 17 and we are currently in a historic period of time experiencing no rainfall since September. Hopefully, that will come to end today and help to disperse the smoke in the atmosphere and provide an overdue assist to the brave members of the state Forest Fire Service and all of the local fire departments supporting them.</p><p>That said, depending on the force and trajectory of the wind, residents may continue to smell more smoke during the shifting atmospheric conditions. Based on that, know that the source of the forest fire is not threatening homes and that Camden County is not under any threat. We will continue to monitor this situation and update the public if more pertinent information is relayed back to us from our partners.</p><p>For all of our neighbors that have respiratory conditions please limit your time outdoors and keep your windows closed during this time.

The Camden County Office of Emergency Management has been monitoring the fire events through their peers in the surrounding counties and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. In addition, we deployed assets from the Department of Public Safety to assist firefighting at the Bethany Run wildfire burning on the Voorhees and Evesham border last week. The 360-acre event was contained this weekend, but wildfires continue to burn throughout the state most notably a 2,500-acre fire in West Milford that is currently 0% contained. Nevertheless, these fires are not, for the most part physically near us but the wind has carried some of the smell and ash our way.</p><p>The state has been under a drought watch since Oct. 17 and we are currently in a historic period of time experiencing no rainfall since September. Hopefully, that will come to end today and help to disperse the smoke in the atmosphere and provide an overdue assist to the brave members of the state Forest Fire Service and all of the local fire departments supporting them.</p><p>That said, depending on the force and trajectory of the wind, residents may continue to smell more smoke during the shifting atmospheric conditions. Based on that, know that the source of the forest fire is not threatening homes and that Camden County is not under any threat. We will continue to monitor this situation and update the public if more pertinent information is relayed back to us from our partners.</p><p>For all of our neighbors that have respiratory conditions please limit your time outdoors and keep your windows closed during this time.

Within hours of the L.A. emergencies, bookstores assembled displays and libraries gathered resources to help young people comprehend the threat. Publishers and news outlets shared titles to educate readers about fire and natural disaster.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Pacific Palisades and Altadena, hundreds of homes have been lost to brush fire, along with schools and libraries. Displaced kids will be unable to rejoin classmates or neighborhood friends for the foreseeable future. Bea Goodwin, a bookseller at Book Alley in Pasadena, put together a list of middle grade titles about grief and resilience, and a set of picture books including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">They Hold the Line: Wildfires, Wildlands, and the Firefighters Who Brave Them</emphasis> by Dan Haley, illustrated by Molly Mendoza (Chronicle, 2023) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">When the Storm Comes</emphasis> by Linda Ashman, illustrated by Taeeun Yoo (Penguin/Paulsen, 2020), a book not about fire but about sheltering from scary weather.   </p><p>In her neighborhood, Goodwin said, \"People are looking to mass donate\" books to families, and \"customers are replacing children's libraries. I threw an entire  box together for an Altadena moms' Facebook group collecting children's book donations,\" and a customer purchased the Harry Potter series for their niece upon learning that the niece's home had been destroyed.   </p><p>Goodwin also created a GoFundMe for Book Alley's owner, Tom Rogers, his wife Emily Rogers, and their two adult sons, Thomas and Sam, who lost their Altadena home in the Eaton Fire. Fortunately, Book Alley was unharmed, but \"three of the Altadena schools burned too,\" Goodwin said, \"and a ton of businesses in this historically Black neighborhood went up in flames.\" Since January 10, the Book Alley crowdfunding appeal has attracted hundreds of donors and raised its goal. \"Everyone truly is coming together,\" Goodwin said. Indeed, many stores have instituted easy ways for customers to donate-such as rounding up a purchase for fire relief-and Skylight Booksellers Union in Los Feliz hosted a supply drive for L.A.'s unhoused and newly displaced communities.   </p><p>To acknowledge fire's dangers and unite the reading community, we've gathered a list of titles that address why fires occur, how people escape a blaze, and how communities help one another. These narratives represent personal experiences of natural disaster, professional expertise around battling fire or evacuating safely, and accounts of domesticated and wild animals, and hardy plants and seeds, surviving the worst.   </p><p>Picture Books   </p><p>Dear Wild Child: You Carry Your Home Inside You by Wallace J.

Within hours of the L.A. emergencies, bookstores assembled displays and libraries gathered resources to help young people comprehend the threat. Publishers and news outlets shared titles to educate readers about fire and natural disaster.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Pacific Palisades and Altadena, hundreds of homes have been lost to brush fire, along with schools and libraries. Displaced kids will be unable to rejoin classmates or neighborhood friends for the foreseeable future. Bea Goodwin, a bookseller at Book Alley in Pasadena, put together a list of middle grade titles about grief and resilience, and a set of picture books including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">They Hold the Line: Wildfires, Wildlands, and the Firefighters Who Brave Them</emphasis> by Dan Haley, illustrated by Molly Mendoza (Chronicle, 2023) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">When the Storm Comes</emphasis> by Linda Ashman, illustrated by Taeeun Yoo (Penguin/Paulsen, 2020), a book not about fire but about sheltering from scary weather.   </p><p>In her neighborhood, Goodwin said, \"People are looking to mass donate\" books to families, and \"customers are replacing children's libraries. I threw an entire  box together for an Altadena moms' Facebook group collecting children's book donations,\" and a customer purchased the Harry Potter series for their niece upon learning that the niece's home had been destroyed.   </p><p>Goodwin also created a GoFundMe for Book Alley's owner, Tom Rogers, his wife Emily Rogers, and their two adult sons, Thomas and Sam, who lost their Altadena home in the Eaton Fire. Fortunately, Book Alley was unharmed, but \"three of the Altadena schools burned too,\" Goodwin said, \"and a ton of businesses in this historically Black neighborhood went up in flames.\" Since January 10, the Book Alley crowdfunding appeal has attracted hundreds of donors and raised its goal. \"Everyone truly is coming together,\" Goodwin said. Indeed, many stores have instituted easy ways for customers to donate-such as rounding up a purchase for fire relief-and Skylight Booksellers Union in Los Feliz hosted a supply drive for L.A.'s unhoused and newly displaced communities.   </p><p>To acknowledge fire's dangers and unite the reading community, we've gathered a list of titles that address why fires occur, how people escape a blaze, and how communities help one another. These narratives represent personal experiences of natural disaster, professional expertise around battling fire or evacuating safely, and accounts of domesticated and wild animals, and hardy plants and seeds, surviving the worst.   </p><p>Picture Books   </p><p>Dear Wild Child: You Carry Your Home Inside You by Wallace J.

According to news reporting originating in Nanning, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The integration of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with electromagnetic generator (EMG) holds promise for the efficient harvesting of broadband wind energy, yet the challenge of coupling these two systems into one high-durability unit has persisted. Herein, a novel magnetic attraction coupling principle is proposed to enable seamless switching between TENG unit and EMG unit across varying rotation speeds without the need for additional mechanical components, thereby enhancing the energy harvesting efficiency of the magnetotropic hybrid generator (MHG).\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province, Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents, National Key R&amp;D Project from Minister of Science and Technology. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Guangxi University, \"The rotating magnetic field induces the Si-Mn steel plates to operate in a contact-separation mode within a compact space, producing a 270 V open-circuit voltage output, while the excess magnetic flux is captured by coils to generate an induced current of 5 mA. Most importantly, the overall structure is free from mechanical wear, maintaining consistent performance after 130 000 cycles. The harvested wind energy by MHG is utilized to power human infrared sensors, flame sensors, and Bluetooth hygrometers, providing a long-term, stable power supply for forest fire early warning systems. This study pioneers a novel and robust mechanism that effectively combines TENG and EMG using magnetotropic property, opening a new avenue for efficiently harvesting wide-band mechanical energy. The magnetotropic hybrid generator represents a cutting-edge hybrid generator that effortlessly switches between triboelectric nanogenerator and electromagnetic generator modes to maximize wind energy capture.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Boasting potential applications in wildfire detection and IoT devices, this device offers a compact, sturdy, and long-lasting solution for improved energy efficiency and reduced wear, providing significant contributions to the domain of mechanical energy harvesting. image.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Magnetotropic Hybrid Generator With Self-switching Mechanism for Long-term Forest Fire Prevention.

It is unknown if any of them are injured.</p><p>The sheriff's office said a search and rescue crew will drop in and hike with them to the end of a trail at Cacade Lakes.</p><p>Ty Conners with the sheriff's office said deputies on Sunday found four vehicles belonging to the backpackers in the Royal Fire zone.</p><p>Conners said they contacted the vehicle owners to learn how many people were in the vehicles.</p><p>When they could not get ahold of the group, Conners said officials tried searching Sunday night using aircraft equipped with both night and heat vision.</p><p>Conners said the four vehicles were found at the Palisades Creek trailhead, located at the southern border of the burn area. The sheriff's office said the group intended to go camping on the opposite side of the burn area, but the trailhead was caught in the flames.</p><p>The northbound trail ends at Cascade Lakes, so Conners said deputies hoped to intercept the group as they head south from the lakes.</p><p>The Royal Fire started Sunday in the Tahoe National Forest west of Soda Springs near Soda Springs Road. Five homes are under an evacuation warning, which means residents are not required to leave but are recommended to do so in case fire conditions become dangerous.</p><p>Smoke from the fire was visible from Interstate 80 when it first started. As of Monday, smoke is not as visible, with mostly some haze present. Crews said the fire continues to burn in a remote area that is difficult to access.</p><p>As of Monday, the fire has burned 169 acres and has no containment. Containment is not used to measure how much of the fire is out, but it is used to define how much of a perimeter is established around the burn area to prevent flames from spreading.</p><p>The Tahoe National Forest said the cause of the fire is under investigation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

According to news originating from Urmia University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildfires present a major global environmental issue, exacerbated by climate change.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Urmia University: \"The Iranian Northern Zagros Forests, characterized by a Mediterranean climate, are particularly vulnerable to fires during hot, dry summers. This study investigates the impact of climate change on forest fires in these forests from 2006 to 2023. The analysis revealed significant year-to-year fluctuations, with notable fire occurrence in years 2007, 2010, 2021, and 2023. The largest burned area occurred in 2021, covering 2655.66 ha, while 2006 had the smallest burned area of 175.27 ha. Climate variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, heat waves, and solar radiation were assessed for their effects on fire behavior. Strong correlations were found between higher average temperatures and larger burned areas, as well as between heat waves and increased fire frequency.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally, higher wind speeds were linked to larger burned areas, suggesting that increased wind speeds may enhance fire spread. Multiple linear regression models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, explaining 84% of the variance in burned areas and 69.6% in the variance in fire frequency. These findings document the growing wildfire risk in the Northern Zagros region due to climate change, highlighting the urgent need to integrate scientific research with policies to develop effective wildfire management strategies for sustainable forest management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Unveiling the Role of Climate and Environmental Dynamics in Shaping Forest Fire Patterns in Northern Zagros, Iran.

Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning a decade (2012\u20132022), this study analyzes the influence of meteorological conditions, urban emissions, and seasonal biomass combustion.

The model demonstrated good performance (MAE = 4.38, RMSE = 5.80, R2 = 0.9972) and was extensively verified using tenfold cross-validation to ensure robustness towards overfitting and non-stationary effects. Statistical significance tests, particularly the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, were used to confirm the performance disparities among model variations, therefore substantiating the roles of essential architectural elements. Attention weight visualization and head-wise interpretability studies demonstrated unique patterns in feature significance across heads. The model\u2019s efficacy was also assessed against traditional and contemporary state-of-the-art methods tested on similar <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 forecasting tasks, demonstrating its enhanced accuracy. This research provides predictive insights pertinent to regulatory decision-making about seasonal air quality management encountered in Delhi. The scalability of the proposed framework is demonstrated by comparing it to conventional and transfer learning-based models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>As academics emphasize, air pollution is a critical worldwide challenge with far-reaching effects on welfare, the environment, and economic growth. Cities such as Delhi in India have very elevated pollution levels, underscoring the severity of these issues1,2. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is determined by measuring several pollutants, including particulate matter (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 and PM10) and Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions3,4 Absorption of pollutants such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 is correlated with respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, premature mortality, and environmental consequences, including global warming and the release of greenhouse gases. Biomass combustion is a sustainable source of airborne particulate matter (PM) and chemical gases, which profoundly influence both local and global climates. It also presents significant health hazards to people. This type of combustion encompasses various activities, including wildfires and post-harvest agricultural burning, commonly referred to as crop residue burning (CRB) or \u201cstubble\u201d burning5. Stubble burning in North India, a practice that has been conducted for more than twenty years, involves farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and adjacent states incinerating agricultural remnants after harvest to expedite soil preparation for subsequent planting3. This practice, particularly from September to December, deteriorates air quality as winds transport smoke and pollutants, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3, to the National Capital Territory and other areas, resulting in hazardous smog6. Air pollution in Delhi intensifies throughout the winter, attributed to the Diwali celebrations and the incineration of agricultural waste, which is exacerbated by reduced temperatures and heightened heating requirements. Pollution is less during the monsoon; however, it remains considerable. Interest in the subject intensifies throughout winter, as seen by media coverage, public engagement, and political discourse7. Over the last decade, numerous studies have examined the temporal dynamics of air quality, emphasizing the influence of meteorological parameters, including wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), and wind direction (WD), on pollutant levels. The stubble-burning season presents distinct challenges due to the complex interplay of meteorological variables, agricultural practices, and urban pollutants. This requires the creation of sophisticated forecasting models, particularly designed for this timeframe. Nevertheless, most current research lacks models particularly designed for the stubble-burning season and frequently encounters issues with data scarcity and seasonality, resulting in overfitting in deep learning applications. Furthermore, these models often fail to account for the sudden, significant surges in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentrations that result from biomass burning in adjacent areas. They often rely on smooth seasonal patterns, overlook real-time fire activity, and fail to account for the intricate climatic dynamics\u2014such as temperature inversions and low wind speeds\u2014common during the post-monsoon period. Moreover, many fail to utilize the capabilities of transfer learning or sophisticated attention processes to elucidate intricate spatiotemporal correlations in air quality data.</p><p>To address these challenges, this research aims to develop a seasonal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 forecasting model for the stubble-burning period (September\u2013December) using a decade of historical air quality and meteorological data (2012\u20132022). A Transfer Learning-based LSTM with Multi-Head Attention (TL-LSTM-MHA) is introduced, pre-trained on historical (source) data and subsequently fine-tuned on recent (target) data to improve generalization. A hybrid feature selection approach (CorrXGBoost), integrating Pearson correlation with Gradient Boosting significance, determines the most pertinent predictors. This spatiotemporal paradigm allows precise forecasting of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 surges during stubble-burning events. This study provides policymakers with empirically derived forecasts, promoting innovation and sustainable practices that benefit both agricultural farmers and urban residents in the National Capital Region. The work efficiently addresses data shortages and improves model robustness in a highly seasonal situation through the application of transfer learning.</p><p>The explicit objectives consist of:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Seasonal air quality prediction</emphasis> Establish a dedicated system for precisely forecasting <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels through the pivotal stubble-burning season, marked by elevated pollutant levels and health hazards.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Temporal dynamics and feature enrichment</emphasis> Integrated lagged <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 readings, rolling statistics, as well as seasonal climate data, including wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), and wind direction (WD), to elucidate temporal and meteorological effects.

Conventional deterministic approaches are not flexible enough to adjust to changing circumstances and are predicated on assumptions8. Although statistical methods are more flexible, their ability to handle the non-linear character of real-world data is limited since they frequently make linear assumptions9.Significant scholarly inquiry undertaken by Ameer et al. investigated the efficacy of four distinct regression methodologies: Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, and Artificial Neural Network, which are employed to predict air quality indices10,11.</p><p>Big data analysis has been greatly enhanced by deep learning (DL), a complex machine learning subfield in several fields, including biological informatics, speech recognition, visual analytics, and remote sensing. By learning in-depth via several phases, DL excels at non-linear resolving issues, and its effectiveness becomes better as the dataset size grows. DL approaches have been effectively used to solve a variety of issues, such as voice analysis, motion modeling, picture classification, object recognition, weather forecasting, and natural language processing12. Given the volume of air pollution data, it makes sense. It works well to use DL models in conjunction with cutting-edge AI techniques to accurately depict and forecast air quality depending on weather and other variables13.</p><p>Hours to weeks are only a few of the short and long-term effects that air pollution may have on the ecosystem and human health. Consequently, while forecasting air quality, temporal delays must be considered. Nevertheless, a lot of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)14-based techniques have trouble establishing long-term relationships or successfully addressing the temporal delays of air pollution. Recurrent neural (RNNs)15, long short-term memory (LSTM) models16, 17, 18\u201319. LSTM incorporated into fully connected neural networks (LSTM-FC)20. Combination models, such as K-nearest neighbor with LSTM (KNN-LSTM), are sophisticated methods for deep learning that some researchers have used to model time series data to get around these restrictions.</p><p>Despite its severe pollutant spikes and related health hazards, air quality forecast techniques often lack real-time, season-specific modeling designed for high-pollution times, including stubble-burning season. Additionally, health hazards are rarely included in existing frameworks for thorough seasonal forecasts. In addition, air quality studies usually just look at whether or temporal aspects, ignoring an integrated strategy that uses metrics like FIRECOUNT for regional pollution evaluation, despite the progress achieved in the domain of feature selection, the prevailing methodologies continue to exhibit significant limitations.</p><p>Su et al.21 and Farhani22 concentrated their efforts on predicting fire risk, however, they failed to incorporate integrated with delayed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 measurements, rolling statistics, and seasonal climate data. Both the effect of climate change on seasonal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 fluctuation and the cumulative impact of burning crop residue and urban pollutants over long periods are still poorly understood. In collecting wider contextual linkages, the self-attention mechanism greatly improves series processing and gets beyond the drawbacks of conventional techniques that rely on brief windows for aggregating past material23. Its capacity to extract important information from input matrices is further improved by regularization terms. By facilitating the concurrent aggregation of many linear transformations, the multi-head self-attention system expands on these advantages and successfully captures complex trends and connections.</p><p>Utilizing this technique, air quality forecasting fills in the gaps in the computation of intricate temporal relationships and interactions that are frequently missed by conventional methods24. Hybrid frameworks such as LSTM combined with Multi-Head Attention for selecting important steps in data are still not completely utilized by sophisticated deep learning models. An important development in AI and deep learning is transfer learning (TL)25, which improves learning and forecasting effectiveness by enabling a pre-built model to transfer information from a source job to a similar target task26. This method enhances model accuracy and generalization and works especially well in situations with little training data. TL is helpful in a variety of fields, such as building usage, neurophysiological research, and environmental research, since it reuses existing information, unlike classical machine learning, which creates every prediction from the start. By being pre-trained modestly, it has demonstrated particular use in data-poor settings for air pollution forecasting, allowing for increased forecast accuracy. Prasanthrajan et al.27 illustrated that tree species exhibited considerable physiological diversity between polluted and unaffected areas within the same city, underscoring local and temporal disparities in environmental stress. This substantiates the justification for implementing transfer learning within a singular domain, wherein temporal variations can engender disparate learning contexts despite common geography.</p><p>The base manuscript investigates the application of Transfer Learning-oriented Hybrid Deep Learning methodologies for the prediction of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentrations, effectively addressing the challenge of data scarcity through the utilization of temporal attention mechanisms. This approach demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional models, achieving a reduction in RMSE of up to 38% on datasets from Beijing and Hengshui28.</p><p>This research expands upon this work by incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Multi-Head Attention (MHA), CorrXGBoost based feature selection, Seasonal climate indicators and FIRECOUNT-derived spatial cues to enhance feature representation and forecast accuracy, to improve both feature representation and forecast precision. Furthermore, despite the possibility of shorter training times and increased flexibility, transfer learning has not yet been widely used in air quality prediction due to difficulties in balancing adaptation and efficiency. Furthermore, a TL-LSTM-MHA model is implemented to augment forecasting precision, incorporating seasonal climate data, FIRECOUNT metrics, and the effects of pollutant accumulation. This theoretical framework significantly advances the forecasting of long-term air quality. It enhances predictive accuracy in sparse data regions through the optimization of feature selection, the application of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) for the identification of patterns, and the amalgamation of deep learning techniques with transfer learning methodologies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p>The materials and methods aspect of this research encompasses the following components: Study Area, Data Exploration and Preprocessing, and methods, which delineate the techniques, including the principles of Transfer Learning, the Multi-Head Attention mechanism, and the combined TL-LSTM-MHA modelling framework. Furthermore, it provides the requisite foundational information crucial for comprehending the proposed paradigm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>This research uses a dataset combining air pollution metrics, economic indicators, and field fire data to predict air pollution levels in New Delhi, focusing on the period from September to December between 2012 and 2021. Air pollution data was gathered from five stationary monitoring stations\u2014Anand Vihar, ITO, Mandir Marg, Shadipur, and R.K. Puram, which include 24-h averages of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and SO229. The chosen stations ensure representative spatial coverage across this distribution. This distribution ensures comprehensive coverage of industrial, residential, and high-traffic sectors, facilitating more thorough modeling. Meteorological data comprises RH, WS, WD, SR, BP, and AT, with WS exhibiting a notable negative association with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5. Data on field fires were sourced from NASA\u2019s VIIRS 375 m Active Fire Data, concentrating on Punjab and Haryana, with FIRECOUNT reflecting daily fire occurrences during the stubble-burning season30. While FIRECOUNT does not quantify fire intensity, it consistently indicates seasonal patterns. Economic statistics, GSDP, and HDI values for New Delhi were incorporated as yearly constants. All data were consolidated into five station-specific files for regression and forecasting. Table 1.

data was obtained from Agarwal, Arti (2022). Data for: The Economic Cost of Air Pollution Due to Stubble Burning: Evidence from Delhi Version 1. Mendeley Data, October 3, 2022. Available at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.17632/yxzxvxtvpr.1\">https://doi.org/10.17632/yxzxvxtvpr.1</url>. 31 This comprehensive dataset provides a strong foundation for studying the relationship between agricultural fires and guiding air quality policy. Table 1 explains the study\u2019s attribute features.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data exploration and preprocessing</emphasis></p><p>This section outlines the essential steps for refining the dataset to achieve effective modeling. It covers handling missing values, eliminating redundancies, analyzing the impacts of fire incidents, scaling with Temporal-Enhanced Feature Engineering (TEFE), testing and correcting stationarity, normalizing the data, and selecting features to improve model performance. The procedures for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature transformation are elaborated in Supplementary File S1 (S1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Missing values handling</emphasis></p><p>Addressing missing data is essential for preparing datasets for reliable analysis and modeling. This study began by analyzing the dataset to evaluate the extent of missing data across all 18 aspects, including both continuous and categorical variables. Many meteorological and pollution-related variables\u2014such as PM10, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, WD, RH, WS, AT, GSVA, and HDI\u2014showed varying levels of missing data, ranging from 3% to over 25%. Linear interpolation was applied to continuous time-series variables (e.g., <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, WS, RH, AT) to maintain temporal consistency in sequential data. For variables with little temporal dependence or moderate missingness (e.g., GSVA, HDI), mean imputation was used to minimize bias while preserving feature distribution. Categorical or directional variables, such as WD, were imputed using mode substitution to retain the most common value and preserve categorical integrity. Variables with substantial missing data\u2014such as BP (84%), SR (86%), and CONST (with 243 missing entries)\u2014were excluded due to insufficient coverage and their potential to harm model performance. After preprocessing, the dataset with imputed values was revalidated to confirm the absence of missing data across all remaining variables. This systematic approach ensured data integrity across both continuous and categorical variables, enabling the reliable use of data for rigorous temporal modeling and predictive analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Removal of redundant features</emphasis></p><p>Alongside addressing missing values, it was crucial to assess the significance of each characteristic for the predictive modeling process. At this stage, it was found that several characteristics exhibited slight variation, rendering them redundant and potentially detrimental to the model\u2019s efficiency. For example, economic variables such as GDP, GVA, GDP_CAP, and HDI had stable or nearly stable values throughout the dataset. These variables showed minimal variation, indicating they provided limited information for the model to differentiate between data points. The consistent values in these economic factors could have led to multicollinearity, where the model might overemphasize certain traits, resulting in unstable training and incorrect predictions. Additionally, these traits were less relevant forcasting air quality measures, such as PM10 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, which are more directly influenced by environmental and pollutant-related variables than by economic indicators. As a result, these economic factors were removed from the dataset. Removing unnecessary economic data helped focus the dataset on climatic and pollutant-related features, which have a more direct and dynamic relationship with air quality. Figure 1 shows (a) Before Removing Redundant Features and (b) After Removing Redundant Features. This step reduced the model\u2019s complexity, improving its efficiency and suitability for training.Fig. 1</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Prior removal of redundant features (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) After removal of redundant features.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of fire incidents on air pollution: A temporal analysis</emphasis></p><p>The visualization in Fig. 2, titled \u201cFIRECOUNT Trend with Time,\u201d shows the daily total of open field fires based on NASA\u2019s VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) data from 2012 to 2021. This data focuses on agricultural residue burning in Punjab and Haryana, South Asia, within latitudes 28.90 N to 340 N and longitudes 730 E to 770 E. The information highlights the peak crop residue burning period from September to December. The FIRECOUNT variable, derived from satellite fire detection systems such as MODIS and VIIRS, serves as a region-specific measure indicating biomass combustion events. This study is particularly relevant due to the widespread practice of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana during the post-monsoon season, which directly impacts <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels in Delhi. Each point on the plot represents the daily fire count during these months, revealing an annual pattern with notable fluctuations. Fire occurrence varies from 1\u20132 fires per day up to a maximum of 8000, emphasizing the severity of stubble burning in October and November. The trend lines in the graph depict changes in fire counts over the years, indicating seasonal patterns and possible shifts in agricultural practices or regulations. Although the FIRECOUNT variable does not directly measure fire intensity or size, it effectively illustrates trends due to its broad range and inclusion of both small and large fires. Gaps in the data indicate off-season periods or limitations in satellite detection.Fig. 2</p><p>The FIRECOUNT trend from 2012 to 2022 indicates seasonal peaks during post-monsoon stubble burning in Northwest India. Gaps indicate off-season intervals or sporadic constraints on satellite detection.</p><p>The scatter plot in Fig. 3 displays average patterns over time for five primary air pollutants\u2014<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and SO2\u2014measured at five stationary monitoring sites in New Delhi from 2012 to 2021. The pollutants were measured in specific units: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 and PM10, CO, and SO2. Seasonal trends are evident, particularly the rise in pollution from September to December, primarily due to stubble burning in nearby areas. This seasonal pattern is visible in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, and CO levels. Although NO2 and SO2 show periodic changes, their impact appears smaller. Missing historical data suggests gaps in records; however, the graph clearly shows the impact of human activities, such as industrial emissions, vehicle traffic, and agricultural residue burning, on air quality. These data highlight the seasonal and regional differences in air pollution in New Delhi, offering crucial insights for air quality management and policy development.Fig. 3</p><p>Average temporal trends of five major air pollutants (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2) across five fixed monitoring stations in New Delhi from 2012 to 2021.</p><p>Figure 4 shows the yearly patterns of fire counts and average <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels from 2012 to 2022, illustrating their temporal correlation with a dual-axis format. It excludes 2015 due to insufficient FIRECOUNT data. The visualization aids the study\u2019s objective of predicting air quality by emphasizing the temporal relationship between fire activity and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels throughout the post-monsoon period (September\u2013December). The blue dashed line and green dots denote average <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels, whilst the pink bars signify total annual fire counts. Significantly, 2014 saw the lowest <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels concurrent with reduced fire activity, whereas 2022 witnessed surges in both, highlighting their robust correlation. Although 2022 demonstrated a clear correlation between intense fire occurrences and elevated <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels, the connection is not entirely linear. From 2016 to 2020, elevated fire counts did not consistently correlate with increased pollution, indicating the impact of additional variables like meteorological conditions, emission regulations, and urban contributions. These findings underscore the necessity of including meteorological and emission factors in prediction models to more accurately represent the intricate dynamics of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 pollution. FIRECOUNT and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 data were aggregated annually to evaluate their annual correlation, yielding insights into the cumulative effect of biomass combustion on Delhi\u2019s air quality.Fig. 4</p><p>Year-wise trend displaying the link between average <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentration throughout the post-monsoon period (2012\u20132021, omitting 2015 due to missing data) and seasonal fire activity (FIRECOUNT).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Temporal -enhanced feature engineering (TEFE)</emphasis></p><p>The TEFE technique integrates historical pollutant data, rolling statistics, and temporal factors to elucidate temporal interdependence in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 dynamics. Lagged data (e.g., <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_1, lag_2, lag_3) enable the model to assimilate recent historical patterns, whereas the rolling mean and standard deviation over three-day intervals emphasize local variations. Calendar-based attributes, like day-of-week and month, maintain seasonality. An Autocorrelation Function (ACF) study was performed to confirm the incorporation of lagged features as shown in Fig. 5. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 demonstrates considerable autocorrelation up to lag 3, hence endorsing the use of short-term lag characteristics in the prediction model. Furthermore, to accurately depict cyclical atmospheric characteristics, Wind Direction (WD), a circular variable was transformed using sine and cosine functions: WD_sin = sin(radians (WD)) and WD_cos = cos(radians(WD)). This encoding maintains angular continuity between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, preventing distortion from linear representations. The original WD column was eliminated after transformation to save repetition. This method improves the model\u2019s capacity to comprehend directional wind patterns pertinent to pollution dispersion.Fig. 5</p><p>The autocorrelation of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 across 30 lags demonstrates significant initial correlations, validating the use of lag characteristics (e.g., lag_1 to lag_3) in the model. The shaded bands represent the 95% confidence interval.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stationarity testing and treatment</emphasis></p><p>Time series data on air pollution, particularly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 and related contaminants, often exhibit non-stationary traits due to seasonal patterns, trends, and external influences such as stubble burning. To verify this, we conducted Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests on key pollutant variables, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2. The results indicated that most series were non-stationary at a 95% confidence level, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p </emphasis>values exceeding the 0.05 threshold, confirming the presence of unit roots and inherent temporal drift. To address this non-stationarity, this study applied several temporal adjustments during the feature engineering process. Lag variables (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_3) and rolling statistics (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_rolling_mean, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_rolling_std) were added to the feature set. This helps stabilize trends and highlight small temporal patterns. Additionally, Minmax normalization was used to reduce scale-related differences among all time-dependent features. These preprocessing steps enhance the model\u2019s ability to learn stable representations, thereby improving both convergence and forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Final dataset preparation</emphasis></p><p>The final dataset included 17 selected characteristics that cover key factors influencing air pollution, such as pollutant levels (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2), biomass combustion (FIRECOUNT), meteorological variables (Wind Speed, Relative Humidity, Air Temperature), and temporal and historical trends. To forecast short-term <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 fluctuations, rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation) and lagged values (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_3) were used. Weekly and seasonal patterns were represented by the day of the week and the month. Wind Direction was encoded as WD_sin and WD_cos to effectively represent its circular nature without discontinuity.</p><p>Figure 6 shows the distributions of these features, highlighting different patterns: pollutant-related variables and FIRECOUNT have right-skewed distributions with occasional extremes, lagged and rolling <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 reveal temporal dependencies, while meteorological and temporal features display expected periodic or unimodal patterns. The dataset was cleaned, normalized using Min\u2013Max scaling, and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, providing a solid foundation for accurate <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 prediction.Fig. 6</p><p>Distribution of features.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scaling and normalization</emphasis></p><p>The dataset was scaled and normalized after removing unnecessary features to prepare it for predictive models. Because of different characteristics on various scales (e.g., PM10 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5), the five stages might range from 0 to over a hundred, while Wind Speed (WS) might range from 0 to 20. Therefore, scaling was necessary to prevent any single feature from dominating the learning process due to its size. Min\u2013max scaling was applied to the entire dataset, normalizing each feature to a range between 0 and 1. This normalization ensured that all features contributed equally to the model, allowing the predictive algorithm to process them efficiently. After scaling, the data was validated to confirm there were no abnormalities, and the scaled dataset was saved for further modeling tasks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feature selection</emphasis></p><p>A hybrid technique integrating Pearson correlation and XGBoost-based significance was employed to guarantee strong and pertinent input characteristics. The Pearson correlation finds variables with robust linear correlations to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, whereas XGBoost captures nonlinear dependencies and the cumulative influence of features. This complementary technique guarantees the retention of both directly correlated and significantly important nonlinearly contributing characteristics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Correlation between the features</emphasis></p><p>The Pearson correlation coefficient quantifies the strength and direction of linear associations between variables32. This study identifies characteristics that are significantly linked with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentrations for prospective model inclusion. The Pearson correlation study indicates that PM25_rolling_mean (0.93) exhibits the most robust positive association with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, highlighting its predictive efficacy. Lagged values <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_1 (0.87), lag_2 (0.75), and lag_3 (0.71) demonstrate robust temporal correlations, affirming the significance of historical patterns. The month (0.70) and PM10 (0.67) further substantiate seasonal and source-related impacts. Moderate to weak associations are noted for NO2 (0.52), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_rolling_std (0.49), and SO2 (0.48). Meteorological variables such as air temperature (0.64) and wind speed (0.54) have a negative correlation, underscoring their influence on pollution dispersion. Attributes like FIRECOUNT (0.37), WD_sin (\u20130.40), and WD_cos (0.27) demonstrate restricted linear impact, whereas RH (\u20130.15), CO (0.11), and day_of_week (0.06) reveal negligible correlation. Figure 7 depicts the correlation matrix of features with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5; however, some variables may influence outcomes through intricate non-linear interactions, necessitating their assessment using tree-based models like XGBoost.Fig. 7</p><p>Correlation matrix of features with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5.</p><p>Given a feature set F = {<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis>1,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis>2,\u2026,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis>n), the correlation of each feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis>i with the target variable <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> is defined as:1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XGBoost regressor for feature relevance scoring</emphasis></p><p>Feature selection is essential in air quality prediction as it diminishes the computational cost and improves model accuracy. This study employed the XGBoost Regressor to assess and rank feature significance in predicting <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentrations33. The model was developed on an extensive dataset comprising pollutants, meteorological variables, FIRECOUNT, and lagged values. XGBoost assesses feature importance by evaluating their contributions to data splits in decision trees through metrics including gain, frequency, and weight. Table 2 presents the hyperparameter setting of the XGBoost Regressor, and as depicted in Fig. 8, less informative features were systematically removed. The PM25_rolling_mean was identified as the most significant feature, possessing an essential score of 0.867, followed by PM25_rolling_std, PM25_lag_2, and PM10.

It speeds up model training, lowers computing costs, and tackles issues like a lack of labeled data.TL is especially helpful for sequential data, like air pollution time series, because patterns from one context may be transferred to another. It entails prior training with a large dataset and fine-tuning over a smaller, task-specific dataset. TL is useful for managing intricate univariate time series data in air quality prediction, reducing the requirement for large, labeled datasets and processing resources. It makes it possible to customize models pre-trained on large datasets to pollutants or geographical areas, providing shorter training times, better generalization, efficient management of data scarcity, and higher accuracy for prediction in applications such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 forecasting9.</p><p>In machine learning, along with deep learning, transfer learning is the process of applying information from one problem\u2019s solution to another that is similar but distinct37. Because the pre-trained model may use characteristics learned in the source domain, this method works especially well when the destination domain has less data. Let  indicate the source domain, where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis> represents the feature space and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P(X</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">)</emphasis> denotes the marginal probability distribution.

A set of gates is incorporated into the LSTM network, which is a modified RNN design, to control information flow. This method effectively identifies the gradient vanishing issue in RNNs39. By replacing traditionally hidden neurons with memory units that can store and retrieve information, the LSTM design enables the system to accurately reliance. The input gate, forget gate and output gate are the three kinds of gates that make up the memory block. The gates manage the flow of information into and out of the cell40,41,42. The following describes the main LSTM calculating equation. The input is denoted by Xt. Ct\u22121 and ht\u22121 are the parameters that the previous LSTM supplied. The input gate, forget gate and output gate are indicated by the parameters it, ft, and ot respectively. The internal construction of the LSTM is shown in Fig. 10.Fig. 10</p><p>Internal Structure of LSTM</p><p>In this research, initially, the source domain is used to train a pre-trained LSTM model that incorporates Multi-Head Attention (MHA). The LSTM layer processes sequences that identify temporal dependencies, and the results are computed as follows,45678</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multi-head attention mechanism</emphasis></p><p>The multi-head attention mechanism is a sophisticated method for scaling dot-product attention. It allows the model to learn numerous connections by using several description subspaces24,43. This is the way it works. Linear transformations are performed on the input variables Quary(Q), Key (K), and Value (V) for each model44. The modified parts are evaluated in parallel across attention heads, generating outcomes of dimensionality dv. The result is generated by concatenating the output from all h heads via the Concat function and applying an extra linear modification. This method enables the model to record more varied associations across multiple subspaces, boosting its capacity to handle data. Despite the use of several heads, the total computational complexity is comparable to a single-head attention layer whilst each head acts on a decreased dimensionality45,46. The calculations are outlined below:</p><p>Construct the scaled dot product score:9</p><p>Employ the softmax function to normalize the scores:101112where headi = Attention (Q WiQ, KWiK,V WiV) are trainable parameters.</p><p>This work uses 4 simultaneous attention heads (h = 4), each operating on an optimized dimensionality (dk = dv =  = 64). This split enhances the model\u2019s capacity to obtain broad and varied information while maintaining computational effectiveness, enabling multi-head attention47 that is cost-comparable to single-head attention. Figure 11 displays the structural design of the Multi-Head Attention Mechanism.Fig. 11</p><p>The structural design of the Multi-Head Attention Mechanism.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated TL-LSTM-MHA modelling framework</emphasis></p><p>The preceding sections outline the essential components Transfer Learning (TL), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multi-Head Attention (MHA)\u2014included in this study to develop a cohesive air quality prediction model. The suggested TL-LSTM-MHA structure integrates these components in a progressive manner. An initial LSTM-MHA model is trained on historical air quality data augmented with temporal and environmental variables. The LSTM layer captures sequential relationships in pollutant levels by processing data in temporal order, thereby preserving time-step alignment. As a result, the MHA layer enhances the model\u2019s ability to focus on important temporal steps and feature interactions by distributing attention across multiple heads.</p><p>The function of LSTM before the MHA is crucial: it encodes the input sequence into a temporally consistent representation, enabling MHA to work efficiently without needing explicit positional encoding. This naturally preserves the sequence order. While positional encoding is usually used in transformer systems, it was deemed unnecessary here because the LSTM already captured the sequential context. The number of attention heads in the MHA was set at four, balancing model complexity and performance. The choice of four was based on previous studies showing effective results in similar time-series tasks and computational efficiency. However, a thorough search for the optimal number of heads was not performed. Future work may include a detailed evaluation to further improve this design. Transfer learning uses pre-trained weights from a base model to initialize a new model. The early layers are frozen to retain previously learned representations, while the later layers are fine-tuned with domain-specific data. This combined approach allows the model to leverage existing patterns, adapt to the unique characteristics of Delhi\u2019s air quality, and deliver reliable, generalizable predictions.

Key features were identified through domain expertise and mutual information scores. After assessing the relevance of each feature, those deemed irrelevant or with minimal impact were removed from the dataset.</p><p>The model\u2019s evolution begins with establishing the Base Model, which combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Multi-Head Attention (MHA). Figure 12 shows the architecture diagram of the proposed system. The correlation criterion \u03c4 = 0.30 and the XGBoost importance threshold \u03b3 = 0.015 were experimentally determined to eliminate weak and less relevant features. Grid search studies including combinations of (\u03c4, \u03b3) (e.g., \u03c4 \u2208 [0.1, 0.5], \u03b3 \u2208 [0.005, 0.03]) validated that these thresholds attained near-optimal MAE, RMSE, and R2 on the target test set (refer to Fig. 16). A grid search method was used with fivefold cross-validation to find the best configuration of the TL-LSTM-MHA model. The hyperparameter search space was based on existing research and established techniques in time-series deep learning. The following parameters were tested: LSTM units [64, 100, 128], dropout rates [0.3, 0.4, 0.5], attention heads2,4,8, key dimensions for multi-head attention [32, 64], learning rates [1e\u22123, 5e\u22124, 1e\u22124], and batch sizes [16, 32, 64]. The input layer was optimally set up to receive reshaped data, making it ready for the LSTM layer, which analyzes temporal relationships using 100 units with ReLU activation. A Dropout layer with a rate of 0.4 is included to reduce overfitting. The MHA layer, consisting of 4 heads and a key dimension of 64, extracts essential features by focusing on different segments of the input sequence. The outputs from the LSTM and MHA layers are combined and then passed through a Dense layer with 64 units that refine the learned features, culminating in a final output layer using linear activation for regression. The model uses Mean Squared Error as the loss function; Table 5 delineates the conclusive model architecture, compilation parameters, training configuration, and evaluation metrics, all chosen according to the optimal hyperparameters determined via grid search, and Fig. 13 shows the comparison of training and validation losses over epochs. Figure 14 depicts the training and validation loss curves throughout pretraining. The foundational model was trained on the source domain (historical data), reaching convergence in approximately 30 to 40 epochs without overfitting. The fine-tuning phase, performed on the target domain (post-2021 data), used pretrained weights and achieved convergence in about 10 epochs with consistently low training and validation losses (Fig. 14). Early stopping (patience = 10) and learning rate reduction (factor = 0.5, patience = 5) were applied to prevent overfitting and speed up convergence.Table 5</p><p>Model\u2019s architecture, compilation, training, and evaluation metrics.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"320\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"304\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Hyperparameter</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Setting</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Model type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">LSTM + Multi-head attention</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LSTM units</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">100</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LSTM activation function</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ReLU</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dropout rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Input shape</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(1, num_features)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Multi-head attention</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4 heads, key dimension = 64</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Concatenation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">[LSTM_output, MHA_output]</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dense layer units</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">64</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Optimizer</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Nadam</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Learning rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.0005</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss function</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MSE</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Early stopping patience</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10 epochs</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Learning rate reduction patience</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5 epochs</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Learning rate reduction factor</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Minimum learning rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1e-6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Batch size</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">32</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Epochs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">100</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Validation split</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Pretraining domain</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Source (data before 2021)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Fine-tuning domain</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Target (data from 2021 onward)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Transfer learning layer freezing</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">First 3 layers</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Transfer learning optimizer</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Nadam</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>HyperparameterSettingModel typeLSTM + Multi-head attentionLSTM units100LSTM activation functionReLUDropout rate0.4Input shape(1, num_features)Multi-head attention4 heads, key dimension = 64Concatenation[LSTM_output, MHA_output]Dense layer units64OptimizerNadamLearning rate0.0005Loss functionMSEEarly stopping patience10 epochsLearning rate reduction patience5 epochsLearning rate reduction factor0.5Minimum learning rate1e-6Batch size32Epochs100Validation split0.2Pretraining domainSource (data before 2021)Fine-tuning domainTarget (data from 2021 onward)Transfer learning layer freezingFirst 3 layersTransfer learning optimizerNadamFig. 13</p><p>Comparison of training and validation losses over epochs.</p><p>Fig. 14</p><p>Depicts the training and validation loss curves throughout pretraining.</p><p>Figure 15 displays the training vs validation loss with different optimizers.

These metrics together assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in predicting <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels. To ensure thorough assessment and prevent overfitting to specific temporal intervals, tenfold cross-validation was employed. This method partitions the dataset into 10 equal segments, enabling the model to be sequentially trained on nine subsets while validating on the one remaining subset. By traversing all partitions, the model encounters varied temporal patterns, hence mitigating the likelihood of bias towards any specific time segment. This method enhances the generalizability of the results and ensures that the model\u2019s performance accurately reflects its genuine predictive ability across different time intervals. Table 5 outlines the model architecture, training, and evaluation results, while Fig. 16 shows the actual versus predicted <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 time series on the test set, highlighting the model\u2019s ability to capture temporal patterns.Fig. 16</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Depicts the temporal comparison of actual and predicted <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentrations.

The model\u2019s interpretability is demonstrated through the visualization of the multi-head attention mechanism, which highlights the importance of different input components by consolidating attention weights. Additionally, an analysis of the error distribution confirms that the TL-LSTM-MHA outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and more reliable predictions across various scenarios.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Performance of the proposed TL-LSTM-MHA model</emphasis></p><p>The efficacy of the suggested TL-LSTM-MHA model was thoroughly assessed on the designated test set, utilizing several evaluation metrics and diagnostic visualizations. The model achieved MAE of 4.38, RMSE of 5.80, and a high R2 of 0.9974, indicating exceptional predictive accuracy and robust concordance between observed and predicted <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentrations.

Figure 16(c) illustrates a scatter plot that corroborates this agreement, with predictions closely aligned along the optimal 1:1 line, indicating slight bias. The residuals displayed over time (Fig. 16(b)) and their distribution (Fig. 16(d)) show no identifiable temporal trends and resemble a normal distribution centered at zero, signifying homoscedasticity and unbiased errors.</p><p>These results underscore the model\u2019s durability and its capacity to adeptly acquire temporal and meteorological trends in air pollution dynamics, while ensuring trustworthy generalization to novel data. The integration of transfer learning and attention processes certainly enhanced its capacity to identify intricate relationships, surpassing conventional baselines and preserving forecast accuracy even under pollution surges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robustness via ten-fold cross-validation</emphasis></p><p>Due to the intrinsically non-stationary characteristics of air pollution data, especially during the stubble burning season shown in Fig. 3, the model\u2019s prediction accuracy was additionally confirmed using tenfold cross-validation. This method guarantees that the model did not overfit to a particular temporal slice or succumb to potential data leaks. The TL-LSTM-MHA model, as detailed in Fig. 17, attained an average R2 of 0.9932, MAE of 6.29, and RMSE of 8.31 across folds. Despite the model\u2019s strong R2, it indicates that the model generalizes effectively across periods and maintains robustness during seasonal fluctuations and sporadic pollution occurrences. These data confirm that the observed performance is not exceptionally flawless, but rather the outcome of stringent validation and meticulously designed temporal characteristics (e.g., delayed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5, rolling means, and FIRECOUNT integration).Fig. 17</p><p>Performance of the fold-wise TL-LSTM-MHA model during tenfold cross-validation.

Figure 18a illustrates a heatmap that depicts the cumulative attention allocated to each feature, with temporal variables such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_lag_1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5_rolling_mean, and PM10 receiving predominant focus. Figure 18b displays a bar chart that ranks the characteristics according to their overall attention contribution, underscoring the significance of historical emissions and rolling statistical indicators. This validates the model\u2019s inclination to emphasize temporally and chemically pertinent factors in air quality forecasting. This aggregated perspective is informative, although it conceals the internal variability among individual attention heads. To deal with this, researchers performed a head-wise study to examine the distribution of attention across the input characteristics by each head. The findings, depicted in Fig. 21, demonstrate that various attention heads develop specialization in certain feature groups.Fig. 18</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Attention weight distribution from a singular test instance.

Among these, TL-LSTM-MHA attains the most favorable outcomes (MAE: 4.80, RMSE: 5.38, R2: 0.9974), substantiating its efficacy in integrating LSTM and MHA within a transfer learning paradigm. In contrast, TL-BILSTM-MHA and TL-GRU-MHA exhibit somewhat diminished performance, presumably due to overfitting or their limited capacity to represent complex patterns. TL-LSTM-CNN-MHA exhibits the worst performance, suggesting that convolutional layers offer diminished advantages compared to attention mechanisms for this task. The comparison of predictions displayed in Table 9 corroborates these findings, indicating that TL-LSTM-MHA forecasts are most closely aligned with real <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 levels.

Consequently, these studies provide pertinent methodological and performance standards that assist in contextualizing the outcomes of the proposed TL-LSTM-MHA model.Table 11</p><p>Literature-level benchmarking of State-of-the-Art <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 prediction models.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_10\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Model</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Region</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Period</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Performance</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Highlights</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TL-LSTM-MH (proposed)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Delhi</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2012?2022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">MAE = 4.38, RMSE = 5.80, R2 = 0.9974</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">TL-MHA-CorrXGBoost feature selection</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">CNN-GRU-LSTM (2024)13</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Dezhou, China</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2014?2023</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">R2 = 0.9686</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Multi-model ensemble for monthly forecasts</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">HISTCP (Hybrid STL tailored models)51</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">China</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2018?2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">R2 ? 0.987</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">STL decomposition + model per component</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EEMD-LSTM-Malaysia study52</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Malaysia</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2019?2022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">R2 ? 0.965</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Empirical mode decomposition + LSTM</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>ModelRegionPeriodPerformanceHighlightsTL-LSTM-MH (proposed)Delhi2012\u20132022MAE = 4.38, RMSE = 5.80, R2 = 0.9974TL-MHA-CorrXGBoost feature selectionCNN-GRU-LSTM (2024)13Dezhou, China2014\u20132023R2 = 0.9686Multi-model ensemble for monthly forecastsHISTCP (Hybrid STL tailored models)51China2018\u20132021R2 \u2248 0.987STL decomposition + model per componentEEMD-LSTM-Malaysia study52Malaysia2019\u20132022R2 \u2248 0.965Empirical mode decomposition + LSTM</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion and future work</emphasis></p><p>The suggested model trained and evaluated using a decade of winter-season PM2.5 data from Delhi (2012\u20132022), the TL-LSTM-MHA model demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting PM2.5 concentrations during Delhi\u2019s winter season, achieving MAE of 4.38, an RMSE of 5.80, and R2 of 0.9972. Ten-fold cross-validation validated the model\u2019s resilience and applicability despite seasonal fluctuations. The use of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) allowed the model to concentrate on temporally meaningful patterns. At the same time, CorrXGBoost-based feature selection guaranteed the utilization of just the most pertinent predictors, therefore minimizing noise and enhancing learning efficiency. The weight analysis confirmed the model\u2019s capacity to prioritize significant historical and event-driven signals, including those associated with stubble-burning times. Ablation research has shown that the elimination of either MHA or feature selection markedly impaired performance. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistically supported these findings, affirming the significance of both components in the model design. The suggested model demonstrated superior accuracy when compared to benchmarked model HISTCP (R2 = 0.9605), CNN-GRU-LSTM (R \u2248 0.9686), and EEMD-LSTM (R2 \u2248 0.965), even in the presence of more severe pollution circumstances. Future endeavors will concentrate on enhancing the model for multi-step forecasting, facilitating early warning systems for extended pollution occurrences. Furthermore, automated hyperparameter optimization will be investigated to minimize manual tuning efforts. Cross-regional evaluation in other Indian cities and the use of model-agnostic interpretability strategies like SHAP and LIME would further augment the model\u2019s scalability and transparency.53</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>In summary, this study clarifies the effectiveness of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning framework enhanced by Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and transfer learning techniques for forecasting <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentrations. The synthesized attention weights yielded significant insights into the influence of both environmental and meteorological factors. Furthermore, in this study adeptly integrated fire count data, which markedly improved the accuracy of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 pollution level forecasts, as thoroughly analyzed and corroborated in our investigation. In this study, the transfer learning strategy further refined predictive capabilities, attaining superior outcomes compared to conventional modeling approaches. The TL-LSTM-MHA model has excellent accuracy, achieved by cross-validated, lag-aware modelling of seasonal data with a repetitive structure. Ten-fold validation affirmed the model\u2019s generalizability and mitigated overfitting, guaranteeing that the results are robust and reproducible. The findings underscore the model\u2019s proficiency in capturing intricate temporal dependencies inherent in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentration fluctuations. The successful mitigation of air pollution necessitates the implementation of clean energy solutions and the enhancement of public transportation systems. Sophisticated predictive models are instrumental in examining pollution trends, informing policymaking, and facilitating safer travel decisions. While this study demonstrates excellent performance in forecasting <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PM</emphasis>2.5 concentration in Delhi, this study exhibits superior predictive performance for Delhi; nevertheless, future endeavors should aim to expand this research across various geographies and timelines to assess the model\u2019s applicability in different pollution contexts.289</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors acknowledge the utilization of the dataset supplied by Agarwal, Arti (2022), \u201cData for: The Economic Cost of Air Pollution Due to Stubble Burning: Evidence from Delhi,\u201d Mendeley Data, V1, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.17632/yxzxvxtvpr.1\">https://doi.org/10.17632/yxzxvxtvpr.1</url>.

According to news reporting out of Hatfield, United Kingdom, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in critical applications such as environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and industrial automation has created significant security concerns, particularly due to the broadcasting nature of wireless communication.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Hertfordshire: \"The absence of physical-layer authentication mechanisms exposes these networks to threats like spoofing, compromising data authenticity. This paper introduces a multi-attribute physical layer authentication (PLA) scheme to enhance WSN security by using physical attributes such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI), battery level (BL), and altitude. The LoRaWAN join procedure, a key risk due to plain text transmission without encryption during initial communication, is addressed in this study. To evaluate the proposed approach, a partially synthesized dataset was developed. Real-world RSSI values were sourced from the LoRa at the Edge Dataset, while BL and altitude columns were added to simulate realistic sensor behavior in a forest fire detection scenario. Machine learning (ML) models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were compared with deep learning (DL) models, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results showed that RF achieved the highest accuracy among machine learning models, while MLP and CNN delivered competitive performance with higher resource demands.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Machine Learning and Deep Learning-Based Multi-Attribute Physical-Layer Authentication for Spoofing Detection in LoRaWAN.

Hundreds of miles north, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was battling a blaze in the Wharton State Forest. The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation starting at 8:20 p.m. Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte. </p><p>\"Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,\" the agency said in a social media post. A shelter had been established in Columbus, North Carolina. There were three active fires in Polk County, with one spanning 1.9 square miles (5 square kilometers) and another spread over 2.8 square miles (7.3 square kilometers) with no containment by Sunday afternoon. County spokesperson Kellie Cannon said one home was lost to the larger of the two fires. A third fire that had burned about 199 acres (81 hectares) with 50% containment had destroyed three homes. And earlier evacuation order associated with that fire had been lifted, Cannon said. The North Carolina Forest Service's online wildfire public viewer indicated active fires Sunday in Burke County and in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as emergency crews in Pickens County fought the Table Rock Fire in the Blue Ridge Mountains. \"The State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need,\" McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued Friday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission. Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>(New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, via AP) The California Branch wildfire burns in New Jersey's Wharton State Forest on Saturday, March 22, 2025.

According to news originating from Raszyn, Poland, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study presents the development and application of forest fuel models to predict fire behaviour in different forest habitats, focusing on biomass distribution, moisture variability and the calorific value of soil cover components.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Forest Research Institute: \"On analysing forest fire data from 2007 to 2013, we identified high-risk habitats, especially in younger stands and in stands dominated by Scots pine. The variability of moisture in the different soil cover components, including litter and deadwood, was statistically analysed; it revealed significant dependencies on litter moisture and rain-free intervals. These dependencies allowed the creation of equations to accurately predict fuel load and moisture content based on stand age, habitat type and environmental conditions. Using the calorific value measurements with an average calorific value of 18,920 kJ/kg for dry soil cover materials, fuel models were developed to estimate the potential intensity of fires. The models categorise the biomass into decayed, dead and live components and take into account key variables such as bulk density and moisture content that influence fire spread. Data-driven categorisation enables fire risk assessments at the compartment level, which increases accuracy compared to more comprehensive district-level assessments.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Applications of fuel models include mapping the spatial distribution of biomass by fuel type, creating fire hazard maps and optimising firefighting infrastructure. These models support planning and operations by enabling forest managers to visualise high-risk areas and predict fire behaviour based on real-time meteorological data. The models are a critical step towards a more effective firefighting system that provides fine-grained, actionable insights into fire risk at the local level.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Fuel models for forest soil cover plant.

According to news reporting from Flagstaff, Arizona, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and computational efficiency in artificial intelligence (AI) models by proposing a novel hybrid model that combines homomorphic encryption (HE) with AI to enhance security while maintaining learning accuracy. The novelty of our model lies in the introduction of a new matrix transformation technique that ensures compatibility with both HE algorithms and AI model weight matrices, significantly improving computational efficiency.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Science Foundation (NSF). <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from North Arizona University, \"Furthermore, we present a first-of-its-kind mathematical proof of convergence for integrating HE into AI models using the adaptive moment estimation optimization algorithm. The effectiveness and practicality of our approach for training on encrypted data are showcased through comprehensive evaluations of well-known datasets for air pollution forecasting and forest fire detection. These successful results demonstrate high model performance, with nearly 1 R-squared for air pollution forecasting and 99% accuracy for forest fire detection. Additionally, our approach achieves a reduction of up to 90% in data storage and a tenfold increase in speed compared to models that do not use the matrix transformation method.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Our primary contribution lies in enhancing the security, efficiency, and dependability of AI models, particularly when dealing with sensitive data.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Efficient Artificial Intelligence With Novel Matrix Transformations and Homomorphic Encryption.

Forest Service is reminding the public that a statewide ban on open burning remains in effect until further notice as most of the state is currently experiencing critical fire weather. A combination of strong winds, low relative humidity and warm temperatures are contributing to extreme fire behavior.</p><p>In addition to providing initial attack response for several large and active wildfires across multiple forest service districts, N.C. Forest Service personnel are responding to reports of non-escaped illegal fires while the statewide burn ban is in place. Using outdoor fire during a burn ban is prohibited by law and unnecessarily challenges response capabilities.</p><p>Significant fire activity across the state includes the following:</p><p>* The Black Cove, Deep Woods and Fish Hook fires continue burning in Polk County. The Black Cove Fire is 1,239 acres in size with no containment. The Deep Woods Fire is 1,102 acres in size with no containment. The Fish Hook Fire is 152 acres and 50% contained. Helene debris and rugged terrain are posing challenges for containment on all three fires.</p><p>* Other significant wildfires burning in Western North Carolina are the Old Hwy 16 #1 Fire in Wilkes County, the Iron Circle Fire in Burke County and the Caleb Lane Fire in Caldwell County. The Old Hwy 16 #1 Fire is about 200 acres in size and 50% contained. The Iron Circle Fire is about 160 acres in size and 50% contained. The Caleb Lane Fire is about 50 acres in size with no containment.</p><p>* N.C. Forest Service District 10 personnel are responding to the Goinstown Road Fire near the Stokes/Rockingham County line. The fire is about 50 acres in size, 0% contained.</p><p>* N.C. Forest Service personnel in Caswell County are responding to the Anderson Road Fire, about 20-30 acres in size and 50% contained.</p><p>* As of March 19, 1,040 wildfires have burned on state and private lands statewide since March 1. Ninety-nine percent of wildfires in North Carolina are human-caused which means almost all wildfires are avoidable.</p><p>* Burn Ban Notice: Effective 8 a.m. Friday, March 21, a ban on all open burning was issued statewide. All burning permits are canceled. No new permits are being issued.</p><p>The ban remains in effect until further notice. Read news release (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncagr.gov/news/press-releases/2025/03/20/burn-ban-issued-all-north-carolina-counties-due-hazardous-forest-fire-conditions\">https://www.ncagr.gov/news/press-releases/2025/03/20/burn-ban-issued-all-north-carolina-counties-due-hazardous-forest-fire-conditions</url>).</p><p>Drones and Wildfires: Flying a drone near or over a wildfire is illegal. Don't do it. Firefighting aircraft that respond to wildfires fly low in support of ground personnel. Drones can pose a serious threat to pilot and public safety. A drone that disrupts air operations also puts firefighters, residents and property at risk of loss to wildfire.</p><p>To check wildfire activity across the state, use the North Carolina Wildfire Public Viewer at <url normalizedValue=\"https://ncfspublic.firesponse.com/\">https://ncfspublic.firesponse.com/</url>.</p><p>Subscribe to receive updates from the N.C.

With the rapid development of computer vision, tunnel intelligent fire detection has received extensive attention from academia and industry. In this study, a lightweight YOLO-v5 tunnel cable fire recognition algorithm with multiscale features is proposed. By replacing the YOLO-v5 backbone network, Darknet53, with Mobilenetv3-small and integrating the SimAM attention mechanism, the lightweight and detection speed of the network was improved. Second, under the premise of retaining the feature fusion method of YOLOv5 splicing feature maps by channel, a Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) was constructed and the GIou_Loss function was introduced to enhance the network\u2019s target recognition precision. By designing tunnel cable fire experiments under different wind conditions to establish a image standard database, the accuracies and feasibilities of the model are verified. The training results show that the network\u2019s mean Average Precision (mAP 99%) improved by 0.4% and the FPS (179) improved by 46.7% compared to YOLOv5. The approach can meet the needs of tunnel cable fire detection on the precision and the speed. This method provides strong scientific and technological support for the improvement of tunnel Linear fire detection, facilitate the emergency management and therefore significantly contribute to loss prevention.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Driven by urbanization and gradual expansion of the urban population, the number and scale of urban traffic tunnels are expanding1, 2\u20133. However, tunnel structures are characterized by long, narrow, cylindrical, and confined spaces, and traditional tunnel fire detection faces challenges such as slow response times, high false alarm rates, and poor timeliness. Once a fire occurs, the evacuation of people and fire rescue become more difficult, resulting in a large number of casualties and economic losses, as well as a serious negative impact on society4, 5\u20136.</p><p>Image-based fire detection technology has the advantages of being non-contact, responsive, and easy to integrate with existing security monitoring systems. Therefore, it has received particular attention in the field of fire detection. Traditional image recognition7, 8\u20139 is limited to the overall, static visual characteristics of the flame. Within the monitoring distance, smoke, ambient temperature and humidity, and the emissivity of the object\u2019s surface will affect fire detection, and the false alarm rate is high. Moreover, extracting the flame features takes much effort to eliminate the interference targets, so traditional image fire recognition cannot meet the requirements of real-time fire detection.</p><p>In recent years, image-based detection techniques based on deep learning with strong expressive power and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been rapidly developed for fire recognition10, 11, 12, 13, 14\u201315. Aslan et al.16 proposed a vision-based real-time flame detection method using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (DCGANs), which do not require large amounts of labeled data and consider temporal information. The DCGAN with spatiotemporal flame evolution was trained in two phases and could efficiently detect flames with a very low false alarm rate. Seydi et al.17 designed Fire-Net to detect active fires and burning biomass in Landsat-8 imagery. The framework fuses optical and thermal modalities in images to improve the expressiveness of the model. It employs techniques such as residual and separable convolutional blocks to extract deep features from low-quality datasets. Based on the effectiveness requirements of fire warnings, acomplex network structure causes network training and recognition time overheads. Poor timeliness is a bottleneck that restricts the application of deep learning network recognition to fire images.</p><p>To solve the above problems, Iandola et al.18 adopted 1 \u00d7 1 convolution instead of 3 \u00d7 3 convolution to reduce the number of feature graphs at each layer and achieve a significant reduction in network model parameters. R Girshick et al.19 redesigned the network in view of cardinal number and increased paths number of data flow in the network, this method can improve the detection accuracy of the model without increasing the number of parameters and the amount of computation. Although the proposed algorithm can reduce the complexity of the model to a certain extent, it does not take into account the problems such as the large number of parameters and the loss of target information caused by downsampling, which leads to the decrease of the accuracy of the model.</p><p>With the continuous development of computer resources, target recognition networks in deep learning are two-stage detection models [20,21]represented by the R-CNN (Region based Convolutional Neural Network) series and single-stage detection models represented by the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series and SSD (Single Shot Multi box Detector)22,23 which have achieved excellent performance in recognition accuracy and speed.R-CNN and SSD can be used to solve the problem of fire identification in images, but the disadvantage is that these networks can not extract the edge information of the object.</p><p>YOLO24, 25, 26\u201327 with Faster recognition is a mature development that has attracted researchers to explore its potential in fire detection. Deep learning techniques with high precision and efficiency are being rapidly developed for target detection. To improve the performance of detection algorithms, the YOLO series algorithms have been developed to YOLOv8. Although the YOLO series algorithms have developed rapidly, their subsequent algorithms are all improved based on YOLOv5. Compared to YOLOv5, YOLOv8 achieves higher detection accuracy for small targets. However, due to its deeper network structure, the model has a significantly larger number of parameters and requires more computations. As a result, it cannot be deployed on edge devices without GPUs. In the application of target recognition for fire detection, Yar et al.28 used an improved Yolo-v5 model forest for fire detection in smart cities, which is robust to both small and large fires. Niu et al.29 proposed a segmentation model (FF DSM) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) infrared images. Yar et al.30 proposed an improved YOLOv5 architecture using smaller convolutional kernels to replace larger kernels and achieved lightweight fire detection in building fires and indoor electrics. Phan et al.31 proposed an FFS-YOLO-based early fire and smoke detection model for factory fires. The model introduced a SimAM attention mechanism module to highlight fire target features in a shallow network and improve the ability to recognize plant fires. Huang et al.32 proposed a combined intelligent detection and prediction method for tunnel fires with different inclinations, using a Regional Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) for fire feature extraction and a Residual Network (ResNet) for fire prediction. Currently, deep learning technology is not widely applied in tunnel fire detection, and most studies focus on fire recognition of ignition source rather than line source.</p><p>To solve the above problems, in this study, a lightweight YOLO-v5 fire recognition algorithm with multiscale features for tunnel cable fires is proposed. A tunnel cable fire image database was established experimentally, and the original backbone network was replaced by a fusion of a lightweight network and an attention mechanism to improve the detection speed of fire recognition. Simultaneously, the required computational resources are effectively reduced, achieving the dual goals of efficient performance and resource optimization so that it can operate efficiently network\u2019s accuracy in target recognition. Ablation experiments verified the accuracy and feasibility of the model, and scientific and reliable technical support was provided for tunnel cable fire warning and prevention.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Establishment of tunnel cable fire data set</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Design of experiments</emphasis></p><p>The tunnel model is designed on a scale of 1:20, with openings at both ends and dimensions of 3 m \u00d70.26 m \u00d70.26 m (L\u00d7W\u00d7H). The interior of the box was composed of an asbestos board with specific thermal insulation properties, and fireproof glass was installed on the side as an observation window, as shown in Fig. 1. A cable bridge (shown in Fig. 2) with a length of 3 m and a width of 0.2 m is placed inside the tunnel. It is divided into two layers, with the lower and upper layers 0.03 m and 0.13 m from the bottom, respectively.</p><p>In this experiment, the experimental fire source is the burning pine and the fuel is diesel oil. The ignition source is located 1 m away from the air inlet to allow observation of the combustion process of the cable. To improve ventilation, an axial fan (SFG 3 \u2212 2) is connected with a ventilation pipe with a length of 1 m. In addition, high-speed photography (Sony ILCE-5100 L APS-C) is set 1 m in front of the tunnel model, which is used to record the flame spread speed, flame height, and flame spread trace of cable combustion in the tunnel. According to the national standard JB/T8735.2-2016, the experimental materials are flame-retardant cables (type3 \u00d7 2.5) with a diameter of 11 mm, whose sheath is ethylene propylene diene rubber-insulated. Single and double cables with lengths 1 m are selected and built in the bridge frame. Once the cable is ignited, the fire source will be removed. By changing wind speed, the flame structure was recorded by the high-speed photography.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Experimental equipment (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Positive (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) Side (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) Back.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Tunnel experiment platform.</p><p>To ensure the general practicability of the proposed network model for identifying cable fires in tunnels, experiments with different cable layers under different wind speeds were designed to obtain the tunnel cable fire image data.

During training, four datasets were added to the original dataset via scaling, cropping, rotating, and splicing into a single dataset using the mosaic data enhancement method. The dataset contained nearly 1800 images, randomly divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio, and labeled as flames. Typical tunnel cable fire images were selected as shown in Fig. 3.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Experimental data set.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data processing</emphasis></p><p>In this study, images of the tunnel cable fire experiments in the early and spreading stages of a fire were selected as data samples. The width and height of the flames in the spreading stage were measured using the grey scale threshold method, which resulted in trends in the width and height of the tunnel cable fire over time, as shown in Fig. 4.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Measurement of flame height by grayscale threshold method.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Linear flame height of fitting plot for single and double-layer cables(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Linear fitting of single-layer cable height for wind speed 0 m/s.

As shown in Fig. 5(a\u2212c), the flame height remained constant during the flame-spreading process, regardless of whether the flame was a single- or double-layer cable. It can be seen the flame spread with a horizontal linear tendency (Fig. 6).</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Plot of single-layer and double-layer cable width variations(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Width variation diagram of a single-layer cable at wind speed of 0 m/s.

Figure 6 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>)\u2013(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) show Plot of single-layer and double-layer cable width variations. It can be shown that the flame width of the windless single-cable and double-layer cables with wind speed 2.7 m/s increased until 60 s and remains unchanged when the fire developed to a particular stage, demonstrating that combustion get into a stable stage. While the flame width of single-layer cable with wind speed 2.7 m/s keeps decreasing until the fire is extinguished, demonstrating that excessively high wind speed inhibits combustion. As a result, the variabilities of flame are mainly concentrated in horizontal linear Varieties.</p><p>According to the translatability formula:</p><p>Given an original signal , Define a panning signal , Satisfied:1.</p><p>formula .Introducing a new variable: .was translated relative to . It was shown that the tunnel cable fire image had a highly invariant translationally linear spreading property.</p><p>YOLO exhibits stretching and translation invariance. The primary method involves dividing the image into S \u00d7 S grids. Each grid is responsible for detecting the target within the grid. Thus, regardless of how the position of the target changes in the image, it can be detected using the corresponding grid. When the high-speed camera undergoes movement, it is guaranteed that the model can maintain stability and that the recognition algorithm remains effective. It is most suitable for linear fire images of tunnels with telescoping and translational characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the YOLO algorithm is used to identify tunnel cable fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Method</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Work process</emphasis></p><p>Figure 7 shows the entire work process, which is divided into three parts. The first part is to obtain real-time fire images from a reasonably designed fire experiment and then provide a dataset for YOLO. The second part is the process of suppling these real-time image data to improved YOLO frame by frame for training. The final part, through the comparison between the improved network and other networks, the effect of various improvements in YOLOv5 with an adjusted structure on the tunnel fire detection performance is verified.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>The work process of data extraction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Network structure design</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Improved YOLOv5 network framework</emphasis></p><p>YOLOv5 is a single-stage target-detection algorithm that divides an input image into N\u00d7N networks. During training, each network generated three different prediction frames to match the target frames and complete detection. The entire framework needs to be improved to improve the speed and prediction precision of the network training.</p><p>In this study, a lightweight multiscale feature YOLO-v5 algorithm for tunnel cable fire recognition is proposed. By adjusting the yolov5 network structure of the target detection model, the model was mainly composed of a Backbone, Neck, and Head, as shown in Fig. 8. The Backbone network adopts a mobilenetv3-small feature extraction network for initial feature extraction and introduces the SimAM mechanism to realize efficient feature enhancement. Neck adopts a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN), which generates a multiscale feature pyramid by fusion in both the top-down and bottom-up directions to improve the module\u2019s information fusion capability and detection performance. Finally, the Head uses GIoU_Loss as the loss function of the bounding box to detect the target and provide an early warning of a tunnel cable fire.</p><p>Fig. 8</p><p>Network structure of YOLO v5 with restructured structure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Backbone network structure design</emphasis></p><p>In this study, the YOLOv5 Backbone was improved to Mobilenetv3 (shown in Fig. 9) to achieve a lightweight network. First, to ensure that the input size of the network was the same, a set of fire images was intercepted from the fire experiment video with 1280 \u00d7 720 resolution, which was cropped and converted into a 3D feature matrix of 3 \u00d7 640 \u00d7 640. The input images are augmented with mosaic data to obtain a rich dataset. Feature extraction uses the Mobilenetv3-small lightweight network, which contains 11 Inverted Residual blocks (shown in Fig. 9), to balance lightweight feature extraction and module hardware perceptibility. The final output is a 3D matrix (96 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20) with more advanced features. However, the output per feature map (96 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20) has a very large perceptual field, which tends to ignore small object recognition (e.g., small fires). Therefore, a reference-free SimAM attention mechanism is employed at the end of the backbone network to improve the model\u2019s recognition of small objects and its applicability to lightweight devices.</p><p>Fig. 9</p><p>Inversed residual block.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Neck network design</emphasis></p><p>To fuse the extracted features better, the improved model uses a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN), as shown in Fig. 10. This method enhances the representation ability of the feature pyramid by introducing two new reverse pathways (bottom-up P3 and top-downpathways P7) and using multiple convolutional layers at each level. While each reverse path uses the technology of skip connection, which can help the BiFPN model better retain information and avoid information loss. It performs feature fusion at different scales from both top-down and bottom-up directions to generate a multiscale feature pyramid and improve the feature fusion capability of the model.</p><p>Fig. 10</p><p>BiFPN network structure.</p><p>The weighted feature fusion mechanism is calculated using Eq.

The value of Iou was calculated using Eq. (4). To obtain an accurate prediction frame, the head of our model uses GIoU as the loss function of the prediction frame to solve the problem in which the YOLOv5 detection frame and the actual frame cannot overlap.</p><p>When there is no overlap, or when the intersection and concurrency ratios of the predicted and actual frames are the same, it is impossible to determine which is more accurate. Therefore, GIoU_Loss introduces a minimum closed shape C (Fig. 11b) to obtain a more accurate prediction box. GIoU_Loss is calculated using Eq.

In general, the mAP value is calculated when IoU = 0.5, that is, mAP_0.5. Where IoU is the intersection ratio, and mAP_0.5 indicates that the average precision of all images of each class in the computational data is calculated when the intersection IoU is 0.5.

Furthermore, the training data adopts image flipping and color transformation for data augmentation to avoid the problem of sample imbalance. In this study, a trained network model was used to detect cable fires in tunnels, and the performance of the cable fire detection in different periods, wind speeds, and layers was tested.</p><p>Fig. 12</p><p>Waveform Diagram of Model Training Results (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>)Loss value curves.

Based on the data in the table, the various evaluation indicators of the model on the test set were calculated. The fire Mean Average Precision rate, recall rate and Accuracy Rate index were 99.0%, 96.40% and 99.5% respectively.

It can be seen the correlation coefficient of the improved YOLOv5 network on the test set has increased from 0.913 to 0.937 respectively. It indicates that the improved model features have a stronger linear correlation with the real fire characteristics, and the improved Yolov5 network has achieved significant optimization in feature expression and task adaptability. This is because the structure (MobileNetv3 + SimAM) enhances the discriminability of fire characteristics, and cross-layer connections of BiFPN reduce information loss, and the feature map contains more comprehensive multi-scale fire information, thereby improving the performance of the model.</p><p>Fig. 13</p><p>Detection diagram of the model.</p><p>The results are presented in Fig. 13. It can be observed from the real-world test results that the detection accuracies of the single-layer cable fires were all above 85%. The detection accuracy of single-layer cable fires under windless conditions was more significant than that under windless conditions, reaching more than 90%. This indicates that wind speed reduced the identification precision of the cables. This is mainly because single-layer cable fires are more concentrated and stable under windless conditions, which makes it easier for the model to capture fire features. In contrast, the recognition accuracy of the double-layer cables was greater than that of the single-layer cables at a wind speed of 2.7 m/s. This indicates that the cable structure of the double layer is more complex than that of the single layer, with more flame features and details, which makes the model identification more accurate. However, the real-world fire test results for single- and double-layer cables satisfy the requirements of tunnel fire detection.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparative results</emphasis></p><p>To verify the effect of various improvements in YOLOv5 with an adjusted structure on the tunnel fire detection performance, the original algorithm was added to each module separately. Experiments were conducted separately using the same dataset to obtain the corresponding evaluation indices, and the results were analyzed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of other SOTA methods</emphasis></p><p>To understand the comparison of the performance of the improved model with other SOTA networks in tunnel fires, representative networks were selected for comparison, namely Faster-RCNN, SSD, DETR and Yolov8 network models. Experiments were conducted using the experimental tunnel cable fire dataset to obtain the training results of each model as shown in Table 3.</p><p>It can be seen from Table 3 that the mAP, Recall, and FPS of improved Yolov5 is significantly higher than that of most other methods. Although the mAP of YOLOv8 is higher than that of the improved YOLOv5 network, its FPS is much lower.This is because the four innovations of lightweight backbone network, dynamic attention enhancement, geometric perception loss function and efficient multi-scale fusion have achieved a balance between accuracy and speed. Especially in tunnel scenes, various indicators (mAP, recall and FPS) are significantly superior to other solutions by the robust processing of small targets, which performs slightly better than Faster-RCNN, SSD and DETR algorithm in mAP.</p><p>Table 3</p><p>Comparison with SOTA network models.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Model</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">mAP50(%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Recall(%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Parameters(M)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">FLOPs(G)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">FPS</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Improved YOLOv5</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">98.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.29</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2.1</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">179</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Faster-RCNN</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">96.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">97.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">137.1</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">370.2</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">11.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">SSD</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">96.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">93.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">26.3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">62.7</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">45.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DETR</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">97.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">97.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">36.8</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">114.2</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">11.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Yolov8</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">98.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">11.1</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">28.6</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">74</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of different models</emphasis></p><p>To further verify the detection performance of the improved network, five groups were selected for the experiments: YOLOv5 structure, YOLOv5 + Mobilenetv3, YOLOv5 + Mobilenetv3 + SimAM, YOLOv5 + Mobilenetv3 + SimAM + BiFPN, and YOLOv5 + Mobilenetv3 + SimAM + BiFPN + GIoU_Loss. Through the comparison between the improved network and other networks, the effect of various improvements in YOLOv5 with an adjusted structure on the tunnel fire detection performance is verified.</p><p>Fig. 14</p><p>Bar chart of model performance comparison.</p><p>As can be seen in Fig. 14, in terms of detection speed and accuracy, compared to Yolov5, the FPS of the network increases from 122 to 188.2 after using the backbone network MobileNetv3-small, which is an improvement of 54.3%, but the accuracy decreases. On the other hand, the introduction of the SimAM attention mechanism supplements the loss of accuracy due to the lightweight network structure to a certain extent, but reduces the network\u2019s speed. Introducing a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) improved the precision by 0.1%, and the detection precision reached 99%. By introducing the YOLOv5 network with a loss function (GIoU_Loss), the FPS increased by 5.9% with guaranteed accuracy. The inference speed of the restructured YOLOv5 network reached 179 FPS, which is a 46.7% improvement over YOLOv5. The mAP was improved by 0.4(%), but the recall was only reduced by 0.4(%). The adjusted structure of YOLOv5 has a breakneck inference speed and high detection accuracy for tunnel cable fire detection while meeting the requirement of a low false detection rate, thereby realizing a good balance between performance and efficiency.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of various attention mechanisms</emphasis></p><p>To increase the effectiveness of recognizing tunnel cable fires in small tunnels, the improved target detection algorithm (YOLOv5-MobileNetv3 + SimAM) in this study was compared with the target recognition results of the different attention mechanisms SE, Convolutional Block Attention Module(CBAM), and CA. As shown in Fig. 15, the mAP, Recall, and FPS of the SimAM mechanism were 98.9%, 96.8%, and 172.4, respectively. In terms of inference speed, compared to coordinate attention (CA), squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) mechanisms have been substantially improved. This shows that the SimAM attention mechanism can improve the accuracy and has a small number of parameters and a small amount of computation.</p><p>Fig. 15</p><p>Comparison of Attention Mechanism Modules.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of different loss functions</emphasis></p><p>The bounding box regression loss function GIoU was introduced into YOLOv5 of the adjusted structure for framing tunnel cable fires. As shown in Fig. 16, the mAP_0.5 and FPS of the bounding box regression GIoU loss module were much higher than those of the IoU, CIoU, and DIoU bounding box regression loss modules, and the recall was slightly lower. The mAP_0.5, Recall, and FPS were 99%, 96.4%, and 179, respectively. Therefore, the predictive performance of the model can be improved by the GIoU bounding box regression loss module, especially with regard to the inference speed.</p><p>Fig. 16</p><p>Comparison of the Bounding Box Regression Loss Modules.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of optimizers</emphasis></p><p>Two sets of comparative experiments were designed. The experimental results of our model were compared using the SGD and Adam optimization algorithms, as shown in Fig. 17.</p><p>Fig. 17</p><p>Comparison between SGD optimization algorithm and Adam optimization algorithm.</p><p>As shown in Fig. 17 that the model\u2019s mAP_0.5, Recall, and FPS of the model were higher when the Adam optimization algorithm was used than when the SGD optimization algorithm was used. Therefore, the adjusted YOLOv5 model finally adopted the Adam optimization algorithm, with a MAP of up to 99%, recall of up to 96.4%, and FPS of up to 179. The reasoning speed is extremely high, and the false detection rate is low, which meets the requirements of tunnel fire detection accuracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recognition of single and double-layer cable fires with different wind speeds</emphasis></p><p>In the training phase of the network model proposed in this study, Fig. 18 shows the convergence process of Precision, Recall, and mAP_0.5 during the training process of the tunnel fire detection model for windless single-layer cables, single- and double-layer cable fire data with a wind speed of 2.7 m/s, and all cable fire datasets. The number of training rounds was 300, which reflects the rapid convergence of the model.</p><p>Figure 18 shows the convergence process graphs of the recognition precision, recall, and mAP for the single- and double-layer cables under different wind speeds, which reached a stably high value after 200 epochs. As shown in Fig. 18(a), the highest recognition precision of 99.1% is achieved for cables under no-wind conditions. At a wind speed of 2.7 m/s, the recognition accuracies of the single- and double-layer cables were lower than those of the wind-free condition, which were 97.8% and 98.2%, respectively. This is mainly due to the fact that the identification of tunnel cable fires is affected by the complexity of the scene, and the more complex the environment, the lower the accuracy. However, the accuracy of the single- and double-layer tunnel fires reached 97.2%, which meets the requirements for tunnel fire detection.</p><p>Figure 18(b) shows that the highest recall rate of 99.2% was observed for cables under windless conditions. With a wind speed of 2.7 m/s, the recall rate of the double-layer cable was lower than that of the single-layer cable by 98% and 95.4%. This is mainly because the lower cable in the double-layer cable is blocked by the upper cable, which causes the flame to be blocked at certain angles, thereby affecting the recall rate of flame detection in the double-layer cable. However, the recall rate of the single- and double-layer tunnel fires was 96.4%, which meets the requirements for tunnel fire detection.</p><p>Figure 18(c) shows that the mAP of the cable under windless conditions is the highest at 99.5%. At a wind speed of 2.7 m/s, the mAP of the single- and double-layer cables was lower than that of the wind-free condition by 98.7% and 98.4%, respectively. This is mainly because the generalization ability of the model in wind conditions cannot adapt well to new conditions. Secondly, wind affects the ambient light intensity and brightness around the flame, which affects the quality of the flame image and makes it challenging to capture the contours and features of the flame, thereby decreasing the mAP value. At a wind speed of 2.7 m/s, the mAP of double-layer cables was lower than that of single-layer cables, which was mainly affected by the structural complexity and shading effect. However, the mAP of the single- and double-layer tunnel fires reached 99%, which satisfied the requirements for tunnel fire detection.</p><p>Fig. 18</p><p>Convergence process of evaluation indexes for single and double-layer cable(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Convergence process graph of precision for single- and double-layer cables.

(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) Convergence process graph of mAP for single- and double-layer cable.</p><p>Figure 19 shows the mapping relationship between the fire recognition precision and recall during training. The larger the area enclosed by the PR on the X- and Y-axes, the higher the detection performance of the network model. Notably, the recall of linear tunnel cable fires maintained the accuracy of this network model above 0.95, even when it was higher than 0.9. This indicates that effective control of false alarms is maintained when performing linear tunnel fire identification, thus ensuring sufficient response time in an emergency.</p><p>Fig. 19</p><p>PR curve diagram for single and double-layer cable.</p><p>To test the robustness of the single- and double-layer cable fire recognition, some interference term images were added. Additional flame information can be included in a single image by splicing several different images. Fire detection was performed using this model and the results are shown in Fig. 20.</p><p>As shown in Fig. 20, after the dataset was scaled, cropped, rotated, and spliced, the network properly recognized the fire. Therefore, the model was adapted to complex scenarios and variations. Mosaic data augmentation not only improves the robustness of the model but also reduces the occurrence of overfitting.</p><p>Fig. 20</p><p>Fire disturbance identification(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Identification of fire disturbances in single-layer cables at wind speed of 0 m/s.

The main conclusions are summarized as follows:</p><p>Experiments on tunnel cable fires under different wind speed and different quantities were conducted, and a high-definition fire image standard database for the basic research of tunnel cable fire detection were established.</p><p>By replacing the YOLO-v5 Backbone network with Mobilenetv3-small, the SimAM attention mechanism was fused to realize a lightweight network to improve the detection speed of the network. Second, under the premise of retaining the feature fusion method of YOLOv5 and splicing the feature maps by channel, a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) is constructed, along with the GIoU_Loss loss function, which in turn enhances the network\u2019s target recognition accuracy. The model evaluation metric obtained on the self-constructed tunnel cable dataset compared to the mAP was 99 (%), which was 0.4 (%) higher than that of YOLOv5. The mean FPS score was 179, which is 46.7% higher. Recall was 96.4 (%), only 0.4 (%) lower than that of YOLOv5.</p><p>A comparison of the improved algorithm between single- and double-layer tunnel cables with different wind speeds showed that the windless single-layer cable had the highest recognition mAP of 99.5% and a recall of 99.2%. At a wind speed of 2.7 m/s, the single- and double-layer cables were lower than the mAP of the windless condition by 98.7% and 98.4%, respectively. The recall rates were also lower than 98% and 95.4% for the windless conditions, respectively.</p><p>The proposed approach is developed for practical application in high-fire-risk industries, where electrical cables is the leading cause of line fires. Its industrial deployment will help detect fire at the very early stage, facilitate the emergency management and therefore significantly contribute to loss prevention.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was supported by the Basic Scientific Research Projects of Liaoning Province (LJ 212510148014) and the Basic Scientific Research Projectsof Liaoning Province (LJKMZ20220747).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Liu, LBC.

The mountains, the red rocks and the lively outdoor culture felt like the perfect place to build my future. I've now been a Utah resident for four years and I have found many reasons to love Utah, but I've also seen firsthand how climate change is threatening the very landscapes that drew me here in the first place. It's changing the way I think about my future, the choices I make and whether Utah will be a place where I can stay long-term. </p><p>Utah is getting hotter, fast. Between 1970 and 2023, fall temperatures in Utah's Weber and Davis counties rose by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2024/09/09/utah-fall-temperatures-rising-fastest-us\">4.5\u00b0F</url>, with nearly all counties experiencing at least a 3\u00b0F increase. Salt Lake City recorded its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2024/10/24/salt-lake-october-record-temperatures-utah\">hottest October on record</url> in 2024, averaging 66.2\u00b0F - almost 10 degrees above normal. The heat of the summer is uncomfortable and long for residents, but the real cost is the lengthy forest fire season that increases respiratory issues for people like me who love spending time outdoors. Not only do the grey skies prevent me from spending time outside, but the dreary scenery is also a heavy mental reminder that our world is drastically changing. </p><p>The Great Salt Lake is a defining feature of Utah's ecosystem and has experienced significant fluctuations in its surface area. In 1986, the lake covered approximately 2,300 square miles, but by July 2022, it had shrunk to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/state-news-release/great-salt-lake-level-falls-below-historic-low-measured-october-2021\">historic low elevation</url>. This isn't just an environmental crisis - it's a public health risk. As the lakebed dries up, it releases toxic dust into the air, increasing risks of respiratory diseases. </p><p>History has shown us how important the Great Salt Lake is, and my fear is that we are denying the facts and selfishly using our resources. If Utah can't manage its water resources effectively, I have to ask myself: is this a place where I can build a long-term future? </p><p>It is hard to ignore how daily life has been affected. Since 1970, the demand for cooling in Salt Lake City schools has surged by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2024/08/20/cooling-demand-schools-summer-temperatures-climate-change\">55%</url>. Schools are having to spend more on air conditioning, and students are struggling to focus in overheated classrooms. As Utah grows, so does the strain on infrastructure - not just in education, but in housing, energy and transportation. </p><p>Young people are incredibly aware of this issue, and we're fighting back. In 2022, a group of youth activists filed a lawsuit against the state, arguing that its push for fossil fuel development <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/utah-top-court-skeptical-reviving-youth-led-climate-change-case-2024-09-04/\">violates their right to a healthy environment</url>. This case highlights a larger truth: my generation isn't waiting for politicians to take action. We're demanding it. </p><p>When I first moved to Utah, I imagined it as my forever home. But climate change is forcing me to reconsider. Do I stay and fight for policies that will protect the environment I love, or do I eventually leave for a place with fewer climate risks? These are the kinds of questions young Utahns like me are grappling with, not decades from now, but today. </p><h>A call to action </h><p>Utah's leaders need to face reality. We need policies that prioritize sustainable water management, renewable energy investments and stricter environmental protections. This isn't about politics - it's about making sure Utah remains a livable, thriving place for future generations. </p><p>I moved here because I believed in Utah's future. Now, I'm doing everything I can to make sure it still has one. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-httpswwwdeseretcomopinion20250330climatechangeaffectsfutureyoungutahns</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FFP-HTT3-S8XR-N3W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Deseret News Publishing Co.

Protection and management of forest and wildlife is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/Union Territory Administrations.The State Governments /UT Administrations take appropriate actions to protect forests and wildliferesources under the provisions made under these Acts/ Rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As per the existing provisions of Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980, State Governments and Union Territory Administrations are required to ensure that, least number of trees are felled for developmental projects whilst prescribing necessary compensatory plantation as per the cases to address environmental concerns.</p><p>The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has formulated a National Action Plan on Forest Fire-2018, which provides comprehensive measures to prevent forest fires, to improve the resilience of the forests against fire hazards, besides prescribing measures such as capacity building of communities in prevention and control of forest fire.</p><p>The Ministry has issued advisories to all States/UTs for better management of situations arising out of human-animal conflicts. The advisories recommend various measures that may be adopted by States / UTs to prevent and manage such conflicts. These include coordinated interdepartmental action, identification of conflict hot spots, and adherence to Standard Operating Procedures, establishment of rapid response teams, provision of adequate funds for payment of ex-gratia relief to affected persons in case of human death and injury, etc,.</p><p>In consonance with the National Forest Policy 1988, emphasizing the local community based approach, the concept of Joint Forest Management was launched and Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) were formed in States/UTs. Local Communities are involved through Joint Forest Management Committees in the management of forests and in various forestry activities. Further, for the management of the Protected Areas, Eco Development Committees (EDCs) are also formed to ensure people participation in wildlife protection and conservation.</p><p>The Ministry supports the targeted efforts of the States/ UTs in the conservation and protection of forests and wildlife, through its ongoing Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) such as Forest Fire Prevention and Management, Green India Mission, Nagar Van Yojana, Development of Wildlife Habitat (DWH), Project Elephant and Tiger, as well as through the CAMPA funds, Scheme on Mangrove initiative forShoreline Habitats and Tangible Incomes (MISHTI),etc,. The Ministry sanctions the scheme-specific activities through the Annual Plan of Operations submitted by States/ UTs for the respective financial years.</p><p>The Ministry has released Indian Forest Management Standard as a part of National Working Plan Code 2023. This standard is a basis for monitoring of sustainable forest management in terms of a broad framework comprising criteria, indicators and verifiers which provides the platform for Indian Forest and Wood Certification Scheme to address the challenges of small scale timber producers.</p><p>The Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry has been carrying out the assessment of forest cover of the country, biennially since 1987, and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per latest ISFR 2021, the total forest cover of the country is 7,13,789 square kilometres which is 21.71% of the geographical areaof the country. The trend for the last three ISFRs shows an increase in forest cover of the country. The forest cover increased by 1,540 square kilometres between ISFR 2019 and ISFR 2021 assessment reports.</p><p>The Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam campaign launched by the Honble Prime Minister on 5th June, 2024 draws a parallel between the nurturing of nature by Mother Earth, and the nurturing of human lives by our mothers. It aims to underline this relation by voluntary planting of trees as a mark of love, respect and honour for mothers and by pledging to protect trees and mother earth by all citizens.</p><p>This information was given by Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri Kirti Vardhan Singh in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126885007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DP5-9883-S00V-62CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 19, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 The New Orleans Pelicans are doubling down on injury-plagued, sixth-year pro Zion Williamson, hoping he can be a more reliable and productive centerpiece in the years to come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If that wasn't clear when the Pelicans (12-41) chose to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/pelicans-raptors-trade-b668d5fa1441036128a612b94085f5f0\">trade high-scoring wing Brandon Ingram to Toronto</url> \u2014 and keep Williamson \u2014 before last week's NBA trade deadline, Pelicans basketball operations chief David Griffin left no doubt about it in his first meeting with reporters since the move on Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf you take just his body of work this year, what he\u2019s done for us when he\u2019s been healthy, he\u2019s taking steps every day and he\u2019s grown by leaps and bounds, both on the court and off,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThe player he is now is better than he\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p><p>The potential for Williamson's rare combination of raw athletic ability, explosiveness and size (listed at 6-foot-6, 284 pounds) to translate in the NBA has been evident since his first few games on the court back in late January 2020 \u2014 after the first of what has become several long injury absences.</p><p>This season, Williamson has averaged 23.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists in 17 games. He's also missed 36 games, primarily because of a hamstring injury.</p><p>Key questions surrounding Williamson \u2014 who is under contract for three more seasons \u2014 have centered on his health, maturity and even his commitment to his profession. At times, he has struggled with his weight and conditioning. During the 2023 offseason, there were <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-pelicans-zion-williamson-7084fe9b918682f58e25d62efba7db43\">unsavory and very public social media posts by a spurned romantic partner.</url> This season, he was suspended one game for being late for a team flight.</p><p>Along the way, Williamson, who is slated to suit up against Sacramento on Wednesday night, has missed 243 of 444 regular-season games since being <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/pelicans-open-zion-williamson-era-on-draft-night-0e113822460941468fdf6ee2d27ec9e0\">drafted first overall out of Duke in 2019</url>.</p><p>\u201cZion has dealt with a great number of challenges, some of which were sort of his own doing, quite frankly,\" Griffin said. \u201cAnd he would tell you that.\u201d</p><p>But Griffin expressed confidence that the Williamson of the present and near future \u2014 in terms of maturity, reliability and availability \u2014 won't resemble the seemingly star-crossed player he has been for most of the past six seasons.</p><p>\u201cPeople mature at different rates in the league, and sometimes that maturity looks like a brushfire and sometimes it looks like a forest fire,\" Griffin said. \"I think he\u2019s reaching forest-fire status now \u2014 and that\u2019s exciting.</p><p>\u201cFrom a leadership perspective,\u201d Griffin added, Williamson is \u201cdoing things he\u2019s never done before, and he\u2019s much more vocal than he\u2019s ever been. ... He\u2019s embracing the opportunity he has to seize this team.\"</p><p>Griffin also defended the Pelicans' medical team in the face of an unprecedented rash of injuries that have kept all five starters out for extended periods.</p><p>\"These things that happened in most cases were completely flukish and unavoidable,\u201d Griffin said.</p><p>Ingram (ankle) played in just 18 of 51 games before he was traded.</p><p>Top defensive player Herb Jones (shoulder) has played in just 20 games this season and Griffin said Tuesday he'll probably be \u201cshut down for the season here soon.\"</p><p>Dejounte Murray, a top offseason acquisition, missed several weeks after breaking his hand in his first game with New Orleans. After he returned, he played just 30 more games before an Achilles tear ended his season.</p><p>CJ McCollum, who missed 14 games early this season because of an adductor injury, has looked like a relative pillar of health.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost an unimaginable cascade effect of things that have happened to us this year,\u201d Griffin said, noting that the Pelicans have had 29 different starting lineups.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get better just in terms of our ability to build a more available roster,\" Griffin said. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve failed at to this point.\u201d</p><p>Griffin said the Pelicans harbored high hopes for Williamson and Ingram as a tandem. But Griffin noted that they played just 34% of their games as Pelicans together during the past five-plus seasons \u2014 an untenable trend for the two highest-paid players on the team.</p><p>\"We reached a point where financially we weren\u2019t going to be able to keep the group together as we were constructed,\u201d Griffin said.</p><p>The Ingram trade brought the Pelicans two established veterans in Bruce Brown and Kelly Olynyk, who will be relied upon to help New Orleans' relatively young roster mature professionally.</p><p>While Brown's contract is expiring and Olynyk has one more season left on his, Griffin said, \u201cThis is not viewed as a short-term situation with either player in our minds.</p><p>\"We hope, as the season unfolds, they grow to feel the same about us,\u201d Griffin said.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NBA: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\">https://apnews.com/hub/NBA</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-4cd8c026cd363d478dfc1305f6bf749b20250212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F3S-NJ23-RS4M-13SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><timeReceived>12:16 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Nanning, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires represent a critical global threat to both humans and ecosystems. This study examines the intensity and impacts of Chilgoza (Pinus gerardiana) Pine Forest fires by using advanced remote sensing techniques comprising Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) analyses based on Landsat 9 datasets. The study highlights the severe effect of these fires, resulting in noteworthy losses of livestock and private properties and widespread damage to 10,156.53 acres of the Chilgoza Pine Forest.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Universiti Putra Malaysia; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Nanning Normal University: \"A comprehensive variable correlation analysis is conducted to gain deeper insights into the influencing factors causing forest fires. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient was used to assess the association between burnt and unburnt areas and various independent factors. The analysis reveals compelling evidence of significant correlations with forest fire prevalence. This study found moderate negative (-0.532, p &lt; 0.05) and positive (0.513, p &lt; 0.05) correlations with elevation and Land Surface Temperature (LST), respectively, and a weak positive correlation (0.252, p &lt; 0.05) with a Wind Speed (V). To predict forest fire susceptibility and better understand the contributing factors, three machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and logistic regression, are applied to assess variable importance scores. Among the considered factors, LST is the most critical variable, with consistently high variable importance scores (100 %, 96 %, and 59 %) across all three models. Wind Speed (V) also proved influential in all models, with variable importance scores of 78 %, 83 %, and 61 % for RF, XGBoost, and logistic regression, respectively. Moreover, elevation significantly influences the frequency of forest fires, as evidenced by variable importance scores ranging from 26 % to 100 %. Comparatively, the Random Forest model outperforms XGBoost and Logistic Regression in predicting forest fire vulnerability. During the training stage, the Random Forest (RF) model achieves an impressive classification accuracy of 99.1 %, followed by XGBoost with 94.5 % and Logistic Regression with 85.6 %. On evaluation with the validation dataset, the accuracies remain promising, with RF at 96.4 %, XGBoost at 91.1 %, and Logistic Regression at 84.6 %. Based on the Random Forest model, the identified high-risk sites offer valuable insights for proactive fire management and prevention strategies.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This study provides a robust predictive model and a comprehensive understanding of forest fire severity and impacts. Future research should consider climate change scenarios and account for human activities to enhance fire behavior predictions and risk assessment models.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessing Chilgoza Pine (Pinus gerardiana) forest fire severity: Remote sensing analysis, correlations, and predictive modeling for enhanced management strategies.

According to news reporting out of Xuzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"With the development of image processing technology and video analysis technology, forest fire monitoring technology based on video recognition is more and more important in the field of forest fire prevention and control.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from China University of Mining and Technology: \"The objects currently applied to forest fire video image monitoring system monitoring are mainly flames and smoke. This paper proposes a forest fire risk monitoring and early warning algorithm, which integrates a deep learning model, infrared monitoring and early warning, and forest fire weather index. The algorithm first obtains the current visible image and infrared image of the same forest area, utilizing a smoke detection model based on deep learning to detect smoke in the visible image, and obtains the confidence level of the occurrence of fire in said visible image. Then, it determines whether the local temperature value of said infrared image exceeds a preset warning value, and obtains a judgment result based on the infrared image. It calculates again a current FWI based on environmental data, and determines a current fire danger level based on the current FWI. Finally, it determines whether or not to carry out a fire warning based on said fire danger level, said confidence level of the occurrence of fire in said visible image, and said judgment result based on the infrared image.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The experimental results show that the accuracy of the algorithm in this paper reaches 94.12%, precision is 96.1%, recall is 93.67, and F1-score is 94.87. The algorithm in this paper can improve the accuracy of smoke identification at the early stage of forest fire danger occurrence, especially by excluding the interference caused by clouds, fog, dust, and so on, thus improving the fire danger warning accuracy.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Deep Learning-Based Forest Fire Risk Research on Monitoring and Early Warning Algorithms.

Trevor, thank you so much for that. We're going to go to our chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce with the latest on how President Trump is reacting to the fallout from his new tariffs and the emerging trade war. Good morning, Mary. And, Mary, the President insisting everything is going, quote, \"Very well.\" Despite the market meltdown, yeah.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRAPHICS: PRESIDENT TRUMP REACTS TO TARIFF FALLOUT</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Yeah, Michael, good morning. The President is really trying to take this all in stride. He is equating the economy to a sick patient that is now healing and arguing that his tariffs are the cure.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) This morning, with the markets plunging and America's allies reeling, President Trump undeterred, defending his tariffs, arguing this is all going according to plan.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (UNITED STATES)</p><p>I think it's going very well. It was an operation, like when a patient gets operated on, and it's a big thing.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) The President, who previously admitted tariffs could cause some short term economic pain, now painting only a rosy picture.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (UNITED STATES)</p><p>The markets are gonna boom. The stock is gonna boom. country's gonna boom.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) But Wall Street firmly condemning Trump's efforts to reshape the global economy. Markets tumbling. Trump is touting trillions of dollars in new investments in the US, as he promises his tariffs will spark a renaissance in American manufacturing. But even he now admits that could take years.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (UNITED STATES)</p><p>They could build them fast, but it's a very big mess. So I always said it would take a year and a half to two years.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) The President making no mention of what happens in the interim. Economists warning American businesses will pay more to build products here than overseas, costs that will be passed on to consumers. The President's top aides out in force, brushing off concerns about sky rocketing prices, urging Americans to have faith in the President.</p><p>HOWARD LUTNICK (SECRETARY OF COMMERCE)</p><p>You gotta trust Donald Trump and the White House. That's why they put him there. Let him fix it.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) Democrats blasting the President's aggressive across the board approach. Trump even tariffing islands off the coast of Antarctica that don't produce anything, one that's mainly inhabited by penguins.</p><p>SEN CHARLES SCHUMER (DEM) (NEW YORK/MINORITY LEADER)</p><p>Donald Trump has single handedly created a financial forest fire.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) Our closest allies are sounding the alarm. French President Emmanuel Macron saying, \"Americans, be that businesses or the people, will come out of this weaker and poorer.\" And Canada, our ally to the north, now sounding more like an adversary.</p><p>MARK CARNEY (PRIME MINISTER CANADA)</p><p>While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality. We must respond with both purpose and force.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Now, the President says he is open to negotiating with countries if they offer something, in his words that's, quote, \"Phenomenal.\" But this morning this trade war is only escalating. As you just heard, China now responding with a 34% additional tariff on all imported US products, Michael.</p><p>GRAPHICS: NEW JOBS REPORT OUT THIS MORNING</p><p>MICHAEL STRAHAN (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) And, Mary, we know there's a jobs report coming out this morning.</p><p>MARY BRUCE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) There certainly is.

According to news originating from Istanbul, Turkey, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study investigates the air pollution dynamics of the Antalya Manavgat forest fires in Turkey, using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem v4.4.2) and Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN v2.5) boundary fire emission data for the period between 28 July 2021 and 6 August 2021. It focuses on the synoptic and microscale atmospheric conditions during the fire event.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Istanbul Technical University, \"The research also delves into the micrometeorological factors, particularly examining the Foehn effect's influence in intensifying the initial fire conditions through 3D trajectory modeling and surface chart analysis. The study assesses the performance of the WRF-Chem model in predicting aerosol optical depth (AOD), particulate matter (PM), and various meteorological variables. This assessment utilized diverse re-sampled and interpolated satellite products, including MODIS MAIAC and Sentinel-5P NRTI AER AI. The Manavgat air quality and meteorological station, situated near the fire, proved highly effective in modeling atmospheric parameters, with strong correlations in AOD (0.93), AAI (0.81), and ground-level PM (0.82), indicating accurate predictions of particulate pollution levels. The station was also ranked as the second most accurate in modeling overall meteorological conditions. The complex meteorological conditions led to significant discrepancies between ground-measured PM and AOD. The study attempts to elucidate these differences using 3D plume modeling and cross-sectional analysis. Notably, a low-pressure system was identified as a key factor in the vertical expansion of the fire plume, enabling it to reach heights of up to six kilometers above sea level (ASL).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Lastly, satellite imagery from August 6 and 7, 2021, reveals persistent aerosol levels in eastern Antalya, driven by atmospheric transport of smoke and particulate matter from local and distant fires, including remnants from the extinguished Manavgat forest fire, as well as fires in Mugla and Greece, carried by cyclonic atmospheric movements over the gulf of Antalya.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Understanding air pollution dynamics of Antalya Manavgat forest fires: a WRF-Chem analysis.

Officials have said numerous prolonged rain storms are needed in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/northeast-wildfires-new-york-jersey-california-bbf0ea8cdf56c6facaf7779c118a29d7\">parts of New England</url> as well as New Jersey and New York, which are the driest in between 120 to 150 years.</p><p>And on the West Coast, weeks of dry conditions that raised wildfire risks were erased by a powerful storm known as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-oregon-washington-storm-power-outages-aadbd4863dd989189d31c1c2187b5025\">bomb cyclone</url> that battered Washington, Oregon and Northern California with strong winds and heavy rain. Northwest of Los Angeles, crews were still mopping up a major blaze burning for two weeks that destroyed 240 structures. The Mountain Fire, which erupted Nov. 6 in Ventura County, was about 98% contained on Wednesday.</p><p>Police in Evesham Township said Wednesday they have arrested a 14-year-old from Marlton in connection with an Oct. 30 wildfire that burned about 52 acres (21 hectares). On Nov. 7, they charged another youth, also from Marlton, with setting that same fire. The latest arrest was made Tuesday and announced on Wednesday. Both are charged with aggravated arson, and causing or risking widespread injury or damage.</p><p>Both have been taken to a juvenile detention center as detectives investigate whether they might have been responsible for a second wildfire in Evesham a week later that burned a larger area, about 375 acres (152 hectares).</p><p>A storm moving into the New Jersey-New York area Wednesday was expected to bring what New York officials called \u201csignificant\u201d rainfall to the area of the Jennings Creek wildfire, which has burned more than 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) and was 90% contained as of Wednesday morning.</p><p>\u201cWith rain on the way to help alleviate some strain from the fires and the drought, we encourage New Yorkers to conserve their water usage and not to burn fires outdoors,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement. \"We thank our first responders and firefighters for their bravery, and know that without them, this fire would be much worse.\u201d</p><p>She said helicopters have conducted more than 550 water drops onto the blaze since Nov. 11, totaling over 500,000 gallons (1.89 million liters). That's enough to fill most of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.</p><p>While the rain will undoubtedly help fire crews douse the fire, which is burning in several hard-to-reach areas of rugged terrain, the rain could bring its own challenges.</p><p>\u201cSoil within the burned area will become unstable and erosive as it becomes more saturated,\u201d the New York Department of Environmental Conservation said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cResidents may see burned and decomposing trees fall within the fire area. A combination of mud and burned debris may run off into local waterways causing discoloration.\u201d</p><p>Two other small wildfires in New Jersey were declared fully contained Wednesday morning. They were burning in Hainesport in Burlington County, and in Pine Park in Lakewood in Ocean County. Hochul said there are currently five other smaller wildfires burning in New York.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on X at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC\">www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-8432b42c50f7d40ba33de45ad00fd1a320241120</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFY-RM91-JC5B-G3WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><timeReceived>6:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 20, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Chongqing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study investigates the dynamic deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using edge computing in a forest fire scenario.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications: \"We consider the dynamically changing characteristics of forest fires and the corresponding varying resource requirements. Based on this, this paper models a two-timescale UAV dynamic deployment scheme by considering the dynamic changes in the number and position of UAVs. In the slow timescale, we use a gate recurrent unit (GRU) to predict the number of future users and determine the number of UAVs based on the resource requirements. UAVs with low energy are replaced accordingly. In the fast timescale, a deep-reinforcement-learning-based UAV position deployment algorithm is designed to enable the low-latency processing of computational tasks by adjusting the UAV positions in real time to meet the ground devices' computational demands.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better prediction accuracy. The number and position of UAVs can be adapted to resource demand changes and reduce task execution delays.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Dynamic UAV Deployment Scheme Based on Edge Computing for Forest Fire Scenarios.

According to Greenville County Emergency Management, multiple agencies were attempting to put out large fires in the Persimmon Ridge area. The fires started Saturday and coincided with a fire in Table Rock State Park.</p><p>The National Guard said it was continuing helicopter water drops to combat the blazes.</p><p>In North Carolina, firefighters converged on rural Polk County to battle at least three fires that have scorched over 7 square miles. The Black Cove Fire had burned less than 4 square miles, but it was less than 2 miles from the town of Saluda, remained 0% contained and had spread into Henderson County.</p><p>As of Monday night, the fires had prompted nearly 200 mandatory evacuation orders and the activation of more than 260 personnel.</p><p>North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein expressed gratitude to emergency responders on social media: \"Thank you for doing everything to keep folks safe.\"</p><p>The same region is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has deemed \"the most devastating natural disaster in western North Carolina's history.\"</p><p>The events are interconnected.</p><p>First, firefighting efforts have been hindered by the debris that remains in forests and the need to rely on temporary gravel roads to reach remote locations in steep terrain where the hurricane destroyed the previous routes, Blue Ridge Public Radio reported. More broadly, Helene's deluge in September resulted in widespread flooding and landslides   followed by a severe drought during a warm winter and early spring, drying out vegetation.</p><p>Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist and climate change expert at AccuWeather, said the hurricane left behind debris that became kindling. In addition, he said, the chances of a damaging blaze have been enhanced by stronger winds than usual and a large number of insects surviving the mild winter and harming trees.</p><p>\"You add all those factors together, it set us up for high fire risk in areas where you don't usually think of big fires,\" Anderson said. \"You usually think about the West. But the table was certainly set for fires, at least for this particular year.\"</p><p>Anderson noted that springs have been getting warmer in the central and southern Appalachian regions over the last 30-plus years, making for an earlier start to the fire season as greenery dries out and whatever snow is on the ground melts faster.</p><p>The same thing is taking place in the Northeast, where lack of foliage cover early in the spring allows much of the ground's moisture to evaporate in the extended sunlight. Extreme drought last fall set the conditions for the Jennings Creek Fire, which burned more than 5,300 acres along the New York/New Jersey border.</p><p>There's not enough long-term data to make an accurate prediction of whether such an anomaly will be common in the future, said Anderson, but it appears to be heading that way.</p><p>Contributing: Terry Benjamin II, Greenville News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Smoke rises from a mountain ridge near storm debris at the Black Cove wildfire on Monday near Saluda, NC.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Sean Rayford/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-usa3089948219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDT-GD43-S63R-00RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 26, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NATIONAL OCEANIC &amp;

(TSX:AGI; NYSE:AGI) (\u201cAlamos\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today reported its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.</p><p>\u201cProduction increased 10% from the first quarter, meeting our quarterly guidance, while all-in sustaining costs decreased 18%, reflecting stronger performances across all of our operations. This contributed to record cash flow from operations and a substantial increase in free cash flow to $85 million while continuing to reinvest in growth. We expect further production growth into the second half of the year driven by a combination of higher grades and milling rates, and remain on track to achieve full year production guidance. Given external factors related to our higher share price and gold price, as well as the slower start to the year at Magino and Young-Davidson, we have increased our annual cost guidance. This is not reflective of our long-term outlook with costs expected to continue to improve into the second half of the year, and a more substantial decrease expected over the next several years,\u201d said John A. McCluskey, President and Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>\u201cA key contributor to this improvement will be the Island Gold District where we successfully completed the transition to processing Island Gold ore through the larger and more productive Magino mill mid-July. As outlined in the Base Case Life of Mine plan issued last month, the Island Gold District will be a driver of our growing production and declining costs over the next several years. We also believe there is further upside to come. Through a larger expansion of the district, we see excellent potential to grow our consolidated production to approximately one million ounces per year, underpinning one of the strongest growth profiles in the sector,\u201d Mr. McCluskey added.</p><p>Second Quarter 2025 Operational and Financial Highlights</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Produced 137,200 ounces of gold, consistent with quarterly guidance and a 10% increase from the first quarter of 2025 reflecting stronger performances from all three operations.

Individual mine-site all-in sustaining costs do not include an allocation of corporate and administrative expense, and corporate share-based compensation expenses. (3)\u00a0\u00a0Cost of sales includes mining and processing costs, royalties, and amortization expense, and sliver by-product credits, and is calculated based on the mid-point of total cash costs guidance. (4)\u00a0\u00a0Previous guidance was issued on January 13, 2025. Cost guidance was revised on July 30, 2025. Production and capital guidance remain unchanged.</p><p>The Company\u2019s objective is to operate a sustainable business model that supports growing returns to all stakeholders over the long-term, through growing production, expanding margins, and increasing profitability. This includes a balanced approach to capital allocation focused on generating strong ongoing free cash flow while re-investing in high-return internal growth opportunities, and supporting higher returns to shareholders.</p><p>During the second quarter, the Company continued to execute on this strategy across a number of fronts. Production increased 10% to 137,200 ounces, while AISC decreased 18% from the first quarter, reflecting stronger performances from all three operations. Through higher production, lower costs and the higher realized gold price, the Company generated record quarterly revenues, cash flow from operations, and a substantial increase in free cash flow to $84.6 million while continuing to reinvest in high-return growth.</p><p>A further increase in production is expected in the third quarter to between 145,000 and 155,000 ounces, with total cash costs expected to decrease 5% and a slight decrease in AISC from the second quarter, reflecting the timing of sustaining capital. This is expected to be driven by higher milling rates at Young-Davidson, and the Island Gold District, and the recovery of higher-grade ore stacked in the latter part of the second quarter at La Yaqui Grande. Milling rates within the Magino mill continue to improve following the installation of the redesigned liner and bolt configuration within the SAG mill. Reflecting the improved milling rates, the Island Gold mill was shut down mid-July with higher-grade underground ore now being processed within the larger and more productive Magino mill.</p><p>A more significant increase in production and decrease in costs is expected in the fourth quarter driven by higher underground mining rates at Island Gold, as well as higher grades at Young-Davidson and La Yaqui Grande. Given the strong growth expected into the second half of the year, the Company remains on track to achieve full year production guidance.</p><p>Reflecting the higher than budgeted share-based compensation expense through the first half of the year, higher royalty expenses, and slower start to the year at Magino and Young-Davidson, the Company has increased its 2025 cost guidance. Full year total cash costs are now expected to be between $975 and $1,025 per ounce, and AISC between $1,400 and $1,450 per ounce. This represents a 12% increase in AISC guidance with approximately 40% of the increase attributable to external factors. This included the revaluation of previously issued share-based compensation given the significant increase in the share price during the first quarter, and higher royalty expenses reflecting the higher gold price.</p><p>Consistent with the updated cost guidance, the Company expects a substantial decrease in costs into the second half of the year, driven by significant production growth. This strong trend of growing production and declining costs is expected to continue over the next several years driven by low-cost growth from the Company's pipeline of high-return development projects.</p><p>The Phase 3+ Expansion at Island Gold is expected to be a significant driver of near term production growth and further decrease in costs in 2026. As outlined in the Base Case LOM Plan for the Island Gold District, the expansion is expected to transform the operation into one of the largest, lowest-cost, and most profitable gold mines in Canada with significant upside potential. The shaft sink has advanced to a depth of 1,265 m, 92% of its ultimate planned depth. The mill expansion, paste plant and powerline project are all advancing well with the overall expansion expected to be completed in the second half of 2026.</p><p>Post completion of the Phase 3+ Expansion, production from the Island Gold District is expected to increase to average 411,000 ounces per year at mine-site AISC of $915 per ounce over the initial 12 years (refer to the press release dated June 23, 2025 for more details). This is expected to drive consolidated production to a range of 680,000 to 730,000 ounces in 2027, a 17% increase from the mid-point of 2025 guidance, at 18% lower AISC. A further increase in production and decrease in costs is expected with the startup of production from Lynn Lake. With average annual production of 176,000 ounces over its first 10 years at first quartile mine-site AISC, Lynn Lake is expected to increase consolidated production to approximately 900,000 ounces per year.\u00a0</p><p>Given ongoing wildfires that continue to impact communities across northern Manitoba, the ramp up of construction activities on the Lynn Lake project has been temporarily paused. Assuming the resumption of construction activities during the third quarter of 2025, the Company expects the completion of the Lynn Lake project in the second half of 2028. This represents an approximate six-month delay from the previous schedule given the loss of the majority of the summer construction season.</p><p>Longer-term, there is excellent potential to increase consolidated production to approximately one million ounces per year through a further expansion of the Island Gold District. The Expansion Study for the Island Gold District remains on track to be released in the fourth quarter of 2025 and is expected to demonstrate the significant upside potential to the Base Case LOM Plan. The Expansion Study is expected to include a larger Mineral Reserve, through ongoing Mineral Resource conversion, and will evaluate a potential expansion of the mill to between 18,000 and 20,000 tpd, supporting higher underground mining rates from Island Gold, and open pit mining and processing rates from Magino.</p><p>Capital spending in 2025 will be focused on the ramp up of construction activities at Lynn Lake and PDA, as well as the final full year of spending on the Phase 3+ Expansion. Capital spending is expected to increase modestly into 2026 with lower capital at the Island Gold District offset by the ramp up in spending on Lynn Lake and PDA. In 2027, capital spending is expected to decrease relative to 2026 driven by significantly lower capital at the Island Gold District, and the completion of construction of PDA. A further decrease in capital is expected after the completion of construction of Lynn Lake.</p><p>The global exploration budget for 2025 is $72 million, a 16% increase from $62 million spent in 2024, and the largest in the Company's history reflecting broad based exploration success across its assets. The Company continues to demonstrate its long-term track record of value creation through exploration with 2024 year-end Global Mineral Reserves (as updated in June 2025) increasing 50% to 16.0 million ounces (312 mt grading 1.59 g/t Au) compared to the end of 2023. This reflected an initial Mineral Reserve at Burnt Timber and Linkwood, ongoing exploration success and Mineral Resource conversion at Island Gold, as well as the addition of Magino. Mineral Reserves have now increased for six consecutive years for a cumulative increase of 65% over that time frame.</p><p>The Company remains well positioned to fund its high-return growth projects internally with strong ongoing free cash flow, $344.9 million of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of 2025, and $844.9 million of total liquidity. At current gold prices, the Company expects to continue generating strong free cash flow while funding its growth projects, with significant increases following the completion of the Phase 3+ Expansion in 2026, PDA in 2027, and Lynn Lake in 2028.</p><p>Second Quarter 2025 Results</p><p>Island Gold District Financial and Operational Review</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\"

Production also increased 9% from the first quarter of 2025 driven by higher milling rates within both the Island Gold and Magino mills. Production is expected to increase through the remainder of the year reflecting higher mining and processing rates.</p><p>Island Gold Operational Review</p><p>Underground mining rates averaged 1,244 tpd in the second quarter, a 19% increase over the prior year period and consistent with guidance. Grades mined averaged 11.48 g/t Au, consistent with annual guidance and 19% lower than in the prior year period.</p><p>Mill throughput averaged 1,305 tpd and mill recoveries averaged 98% during the second quarter, also consistent with annual guidance. With higher grade underground ore now being processed within the larger and more productive Magino mill as of mid-July, the Island Gold mill will be transitioned to care and maintenance in the third quarter and gold in circuit inventory will be drawn down.</p><p>Magino Operational Review</p><p>Total mining rates averaged 56,532 tpd during the second quarter, including 13,748 tpd of ore, up 13% and 16% respectively, from the first quarter.\u00a0 Mining rates of ore were slightly below annual guidance with the focus on waste stripping during the month of June. Mining rates are expected to increase in the second half of the year to be consistent with annual guidance of 14,800 tpd of ore.</p><p>Milling rates continued to improve in the second quarter with throughput increasing 16% from the first quarter to average 8,411 tpd in the Magino mill. Grades processed during the second quarter of 0.94 g/t Au were up 9% from the first quarter and consistent with annual guidance.</p><p>Milling rates have continued to increase into the third quarter following additional planned improvements. This included the installation of a redesigned liner and bolt configuration within the SAG mill which was completed during the second week of July. Following the liner change, milling rates increased to average approximately 9,500 tpd through the second half of July. Milling rates are expected to continue increasing to targeted rates of 11,200 tpd during the third quarter.</p><p>Since the introduction of higher grade underground ore within the Magino mill in mid July, recoveries of the blended ore have been consistent with expectations.</p><p>Island Gold District Financial Review</p><p>Revenues of $210.8 million in the second quarter were 126% higher than the prior year period, driven by higher realized gold prices and an increase in ounces sold given the acquisition of Magino in July 2024. Similarly, revenues of $362.8 million during the first half of the year were 121% higher than the prior year period.</p><p>Cost of sales of $88.3 million in the second quarter and $167.8 million for the first half of the year were 188% and 162% higher than the comparative periods, respectively, due to the increase in ounces sold. On a per ounce basis, cost of sales were 79% and 65% higher in the second quarter and first half of the year, respectively, as compared to the prior year comparative periods, due to the inclusion of relatively higher cost ounces from Magino in 2025.</p><p>Total cash costs were $1,008 per ounce and mine-site AISC were $1,410 per ounce in the second quarter, slightly lower than the first quarter. This was driven by higher processing rates and grades at Magino, partially off-set by the higher contribution of Magino ounces to Island Gold District production. For the first half of the year, total cash costs of $1,035 per ounce and mine-site AISC of $1,427 per ounce were above the annual guidance range, driven by lower mill throughput at Magino. Given higher costs at Magino in the first half of the year, mine-site AISC guidance for the full year has been increased to between $1,225 and $1,275 per ounce. Costs are expected to trend lower through the remainder of the year reflecting higher milling rates within the Magino mill and increasing underground mining rates at Island Gold, both driving lower unit operating costs for the district.</p><p>Total capital expenditures were $74.4 million in the second quarter, including $45.2 million of growth capital and $5.1 million of capitalized exploration. Growth capital spending remained primarily focused on the Phase 3+ Expansion, including shaft site infrastructure, paste plant, and shaft sinking. The shaft sink advanced to a depth of 1,265 m at the end of the second quarter, 92% of its ultimate planned depth. The shaft sink is scheduled to be completed late 2025, with initial production from the shaft infrastructure expected in the second half of 2026. Additionally, bulk earthworks were completed for the expansion of the Magino mill to 12,400 tpd. The expansion of the Magino mill is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026, to coincide with the completion of the Phase 3+ Expansion at Island Gold.</p><p>Mine-site free cash flow was $52.3 million in the second quarter and $71.2 million in the first half of the year, net of the significant capital investment related to the Phase 3+ Expansion and exploration. At current gold prices, the Island Gold District is expected to continue self-funding the Phase 3+ Expansion and a robust exploration program, with significant free cash flow growth expected in 2026 onwards following the completion of the expansion.</p><p>Young-Davidson Financial and Operational Review</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec

(4)\u00a0\u00a0Grams per tonne of gold.</p><p>Operational review</p><p>Young-Davidson produced 38,700 ounces of gold in the second quarter, 9% higher than the first quarter reflecting higher mining rates and slightly higher grades processed. Relative to the prior year period, production decreased 12% due to lower mining rates and grades.</p><p>Mining rates averaged 7,190 tpd in the second quarter, a 6% improvement over the first quarter but below the annual guidance of 8,000 tpd, and a 9% decrease compared to the prior year period. Higher than average snowfall and precipitation led to a significantly higher than normal spring melt resulting in increased inflow of ground water into the underground mine. This impacted the ability to skip ore to surface, resulting in nearly a week of unplanned downtime to the shaft in May. Additionally, mining rates were impacted by power outages caused by storms in the region. Mining rates are expected to improve in the third quarter following the completion of a planned five-day shutdown for rope changes within the Northgate shaft in July. Mining rates are expected to further improve to targeted levels of 8,000 tpd in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Milling rates averaged 7,026 tpd in the second quarter, below the annual guidance of 8,000 tpd and a 12% decrease compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower underground mining rates. Milling rates were slightly below mining rates within the second quarter due to a regional weather related power outage late in the quarter.</p><p>Processed grades averaged 2.05 g/t Au in the second quarter, 6% lower than the prior year period and consistent with the low-end of full year guidance. Grades mined are expected to average similar levels in the third quarter of 2025 and increase towards the upper end of full year guidance in the fourth quarter. Combined with higher mining and processing rates, this is expected to drive stronger production through the remainder of the year. Mill recoveries averaged 91% for the second quarter, in-line with annual guidance.</p><p>Financial Review</p><p>Revenues increased to $126.1 million in the second quarter, 19% higher than the prior year period, driven by higher realized gold prices, partially offset by lower ounces sold. For the first half of the year, revenues of $227.3 million were 20% higher than the prior year, driven by the same factors as with the second quarter.</p><p>Cost of sales of $65.2 million in the second quarter were 2% lower than the prior year period, reflecting lower tonnes processed and ounces sold, partially offset by ongoing labour inflation. Cost of sales of $130.3 million for the first half of the year were 1% lower than the comparative period, driven by the same factors as with the second quarter.</p><p>Total cash costs of $1,233 per ounce and mine-site AISC of $1,575 per ounce in the second quarter were higher than the prior year period, primarily due to higher unit costs, given the lower mining and processing rates, as well as lower grades processed. Total cash costs of $1,289 per ounce and mine-site AISC of $1,614 per ounce for the first half of year were higher than the comparative period, driven by the same factors as the second quarter. As a result of higher unit costs incurred in the first half of the year, mine-site AISC guidance for the full year has been increased to between $1,550 and $1,600 per ounce. Costs are expected to decrease through the remainder of the year reflecting higher mining rates and grades.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the second quarter totaled $21.4 million, including $12.9 million of sustaining capital and $5.6 million of growth capital. Additionally, $2.9 million was invested in capitalized exploration during the quarter. Capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized exploration, totaled $40.2 million for the first half of 2025.</p><p>Young-Davidson continues to generate strong ongoing mine-site free cash flow, including a record $58.7 million in the second quarter and $97.9 million for the first half of the year. The operation is well-positioned to generate record free cash flow in 2025 and strong ongoing free cash flow over the long-term at current gold prices.</p><p>Mulatos District Financial and Operational

Production totaled 34,100 ounces in the second quarter, a 12% improvement over the first quarter reflecting higher grades stacked. Production in the second quarter was 36% lower than the prior year period due to the timing of recovery of ounces stacked at La Yaqui Grande, as well as a lower contribution from residual leaching of the Mulatos leach pad. The operation is expected to benefit from the recovery of higher grades stacked during the second quarter through the remainder of the year contributing to higher production in the second half of the year.\u00a0</p><p>La Yaqui Grande produced 26,100 ounces in the second quarter, 38% lower than the prior year period. Grades stacked averaged 1.54 g/t Au for the second quarter, near the upper end of annual guidance, and up sharply from the first quarter with the operation benefiting from positive grade reconciliation. Grades stacked are expected to remain at similar levels the remainder of the year.</p><p>Stacking rates averaged 11,200 tpd in the second quarter, exceeding annual guidance but are expected to average 10,500 tpd in the third quarter with the onset of the rainy season. Contained ounces stacked increased to 50,280 ounces, driven by significant increase in grades in the quarter. The recovery rate of 52% in the second quarter was below the annual guidance range reflecting timing of recovery of ounces stacked during the quarter. Given the higher grades stacked later in the quarter, and increased leach pad height, the recovery of a significant portion of ounces stacked in the quarter will be realized in the third and fourth quarters.</p><p>Mulatos commenced residual leaching in December 2023 and produced 8,000 ounces in the second quarter, in-line with expectations. The operation is expected to benefit from ongoing gold production at decreasing rates through the remainder of 2025.</p><p>Mulatos District Financial Review</p><p>Revenues of $110.6 million in the second quarter were 17% lower than the prior year period, reflecting lower ounces sold, partially offset by higher realized gold prices. For the first half of the year, revenues of $194.6 million were 24% lower than the prior year, driven by the same factors.</p><p>Cost of sales decreased to $47.2 million in the second quarter, 37% lower than the prior year period, driven by lower ounces sold. For the first half of the year, cost of sales were $97.8 million or 35% lower than the prior year period, also driven by lower ounces sold.</p><p>Total cash costs of $1,017 per ounce and mine-site AISC of $1,084 per ounce in the second quarter were lower than the first quarter reflecting higher grades stacked. Both costs were higher than the prior year period, primarily due to a lower contribution of ounces from La Yaqui Grande to Mulatos District production. For the first half of the year, total cash costs of $1,129 per ounce and mine-site AISC of $1,205 per ounce were both above annual guidance but are expected to decrease through the remainder of the year bringing full year costs in line with guidance.</p><p>Capital expenditures totaled $3.7 million in the second quarter, including $0.5 million of sustaining capital and $1.8 million of capitalized exploration. Growth capital spending of $1.4 million was primarily related to procurement activities and detailed engineering for PDA. Spending on PDA is expected to increase significantly in the second half of the year with the commencement of underground development and placement of long-lead time orders for the mill.</p><p>The Mulatos District generated mine-site free cash flow of $55.2 million in the second quarter and $55.8 million for the first half of the year, lower than the comparative periods reflecting lower gold sales and higher cash taxes. The free cash flow generated was net of $15.4 million of cash tax payments in the second quarter, and $63.7 million in the first half of the year, primarily related to 2024 income and mining taxes payable, and 2025 income tax installments. The Company expects cash tax payments of between $15 and $20 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, related to the 2025 tax year. At current gold prices, the Mulatos District is expected to generate stronger mine-site free cash flow in the second half of the year, reflecting higher production and lower costs.</p><p>Second Quarter 2025 Development Activities</p><p>Island Gold (Ontario, Canada)</p><p>Phase 3+ Expansion </p><p>In 2022, the Company announced the Phase 3+ Expansion at Island Gold to 2,400 tpd from the current rate of 1,200 tpd, which includes various infrastructure investments. These include the installation of a shaft, paste plant, as well as accelerated development to support the higher mining rates. Following the completion of the expansion in 2026, the operation will transition from trucking ore and waste up the ramp to skipping ore and waste to surface through the new shaft infrastructure, driving production higher and costs significantly lower.</p><p>On June 23, 2025, the Company announced the Base Case LOM Plan with the total growth capital estimate for the Phase 3+ Expansion revised to $835 million. This represents a 10% increase from the original growth capital estimate prepared in 2022. The recent increase reflects ongoing labour inflation, as well as the use of a contractor to support off shaft development, and construction activities related to the ore and waste handling system. As at June 30, 2025, 79% of the total initial capital has been spent and committed on the Phase 3+ Expansion.</p><p>In addition, the Company is evaluating the addition of a pebble crusher and auxiliary mill to the Magino mill to support the expansion to 12,400 tpd. This would represent a potential scope change at an additional cost of approximately $40 million. These component changes will be re-evaluated over the next several months to assess if they will be required as part of a potential larger expansion of up to 20,000 tpd. This evaluation process is ongoing and the Expansion Study is expected to be released before the end of 2025.</p><p>During the second quarter of 2025, the Company spent $39.8 million on the Phase 3+ Expansion and capital development.

With the approval of the Closure Plan in January 2025, the required permitting and pre-construction conditions have been met allowing for the start of construction on the Lynn Lake project. During the first quarter of 2025, the Company also signed an Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IBA\") with Mathias Colomb Cree Nation (\"MCCN\"). The Company now has IBAs in place with both of the First Nation communities proximate to the Lynn Lake project.</p><p>Given ongoing wildfires that continue to impact communities across northern Manitoba, the ramp up of construction activities on the Lynn Lake project has been temporarily paused. Assuming the resumption of construction activities during the third quarter of 2025, the Company expects the completion of the Lynn Lake project in the second half of 2028. This represents an approximate six-month delay from the previous schedule given the loss of the majority of the summer construction season. With average annual production of 176,000 ounces over its first ten years at first quartile mine-site AISC, Lynn Lake is expected to increase consolidated production to approximately 900,000 ounces per year.</p><p>Growth capital spending at Lynn Lake was initially estimated to be between $100 million and $120 million in 2025, but may vary depending on the timing of the restart of construction activities. Construction activities and capital spending are expected to increase in 2026 and 2027 with first gold production expected in the second half of 2028. Total initial growth capital for Lynn Lake was estimated to be $632 million in the 2023 Feasibility Study (\"2023 Study\"), based on input costs as of the fourth quarter of 2022. As detailed in the three year guidance press release issued in January 2025, initial capital for Lynn Lake is expected to increase by approximately 10% given ongoing industry-wide labour and materials inflation, which has averaged close to 5% per year since the end of 2022. The Company is also evaluating the impact on initial capital caused by the forest fire related delays, and any updates to the initial capital estimate will be provided following the resumption of construction activities.</p><p>On February 13, 2025, the Company reported positive results of an internal economic study completed on its Burnt Timber and Linkwood satellite deposits located in proximity to the Lynn Lake project. The 2023 Study for Lynn Lake was based only on the Gordon and MacLellan deposits which are to be mined over the first 11 years, with the processing of lower grade stockpiled ore for the remainder of the 17-year mine life. The Burnt Timber and Linkwood deposits are expected to provide a source of additional mill feed to the Lynn Lake project starting in year 12, deferring the lower grade stockpiles until later in the mine plan. This is expected to extend the mine life of the combined Lynn Lake project to 27 years, increase longer term production rates, and enhance its economics as a low-capital, high-return satellite project.</p><p>The two deposits are expected to produce an average of 83,000 ounces of gold per year over a 10 year mine life. By leveraging mining equipment and planned processing infrastructure at Lynn Lake, the project is expected to be developed for low initial capital of $67 million. This is expected to contribute to high returns for the Burnt Timber and Linkwood satellite deposits,\u00a0 with an after-tax internal rate of return (\"IRR\") of 54%, and after-tax NPV (5%) of $177 million at a base case gold price assumption of $2,200 per ounce and CAD/USD foreign exchange rate of $0.75:1. At a gold price of $2,800 per ounce and CAD/USD foreign exchange rate of $0.70:1, returns increase to an after-tax IRR of 83% and after-tax NPV (5%) of $292 million.</p><p>Development spending (excluding exploration) was $18.8\u00a0million in the second quarter of 2025, primarily on temporary camp installation, site facilities, tree clearing and process design engineering.</p><p>PDA (Sonora, Mexico)</p><p>On September 4, 2024, the Company reported the results of the development plan for the PDA project located within the Mulatos District. PDA is a higher-grade underground deposit adjacent to the Mulatos open pit and will benefit from the use of existing crushing infrastructure from Cerro Pelon, supporting lower initial capital and project execution risk.</p><p>On January 29, 2025, the Company announced it has been granted approval of an amendment to its existing environmental impact assessment (Manifestaci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental) by Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, allowing for the start of construction on the PDA project. Construction activities on PDA are expected to begin ramping up in the third quarter of 2025. Capital spending on PDA is expected to total $37 to $40 million in 2025 to advance underground development and procurement of mill long lead time items. The remainder of the total initial capital estimate of $165 million will be spent in 2026 and 2027 with first production anticipated mid-2027.</p><p>As outlined in the 2024 development plan, PDA is expected to produce an average of 127,000 ounces per year over the first four years and 104,000 ounces over the current mine life (based on Mineral Reserves as at December 31, 2023). Total cash costs are expected to average $921 per ounce and mine-site AISC $1,003 per ounce, consistent with the Company\u2019s overall low cost structure.</p><p>Reflecting the low cost structure and low initial capital, PDA is expected to be a high-return project with significant exploration upside. PDA has an estimated after-tax IRR of 46% and after-tax NPV (5%) of $269 million using base case gold price assumption of $1,950 per ounce and a MXN/USD foreign exchange rate of 18:1. Using a $2,500 per ounce gold price, PDA's after-tax IRR increases to 73%, and after-tax NPV (5%) increases to $492 million.</p><p>Development spending (excluding exploration) was $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2025, primarily focused on procurement activities and detailed engineering. Spending on PDA is expected to increase in second half of the year with underground development commencing.</p><p>Kirazl\u0131 (\u00c7anakkale, T\u00fcrkiye) </p><p>On October 14, 2019, the Company suspended all construction activities on its Kirazl\u0131 project following the Turkish government's failure to grant a routine renewal of the Company\u2019s mining licenses, despite the Company having met all legal and regulatory requirements for their renewal. In October 2020, the Turkish government refused the renewal of the Company\u2019s Forestry Permit. The Company had been granted approval of all permits required to construct Kirazl\u0131 including the Environmental Impact Assessment approval, Forestry Permit, and GSM (Business Opening and Operation) permit, and certain key permits for the nearby A\u011f\u0131 Da\u011f\u0131 and \u00c7amyurt Gold Mines. These permits were granted by the Turkish government after the project earned the support of the local communities and passed an extensive multi-year environmental review and community consultation process.</p><p>On April 20, 2021, the Company announced that its Netherlands wholly-owned subsidiaries Alamos Gold Holdings Co\u00f6peratief U.A, and Alamos Gold Holdings B.V. (\u201cSubsidiaries\u201d) would be filing an investment treaty claim against the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye for expropriation and unfair and inequitable treatment. The claim was filed under the Netherlands-T\u00fcrkiye Bilateral Investment Treaty (\u201cTreaty\u201d). Alamos Gold Holdings Co\u00f6peratief U.A. and Alamos Gold Holdings B.V. had their claim against the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye registered on June 7, 2021 with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (World Bank Group).</p><p>Bilateral investment treaties are agreements between countries to assist with the protection of investments. The Treaty establishes legal protections for investment between T\u00fcrkiye and the Netherlands. The Subsidiaries directly own and control the Company\u2019s Turkish assets. The Subsidiaries invoking their rights pursuant to the Treaty does not mean that they relinquish their rights to the Turkish project, or otherwise cease the Turkish operations. The Company will continue to work towards a constructive resolution with the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye.</p><p>The Company incurred $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2025 related to ongoing care and maintenance and arbitration costs to progress the Treaty claim, which were expensed.</p><p>Second Quarter 2025 Exploration Activities</p><p>Island Gold District (Ontario, Canada)</p><p>A total of $27 million is budgeted for exploration at the Island Gold District in 2025, up from $20 million spent in 2024. The exploration program will build on the success from 2024, with high-grade gold mineralization extended across the Island Gold deposit, as well as within multiple structures of the hanging wall and footwall.</p><p>As announced on June 23, 2025, Mineral Reserves at Island Gold underground increased 138% to 4.1 million ounces with grades increasing 5% to 10.85 g/t Au (11.8 mt) driven by Mineral Resource conversion. This marked the 12th consecutive year of Mineral Reserve growth. An updated classification methodology was adopted based on definition drilling, extensive historical and current production data, reconciliation, and underground mapping, which demonstrates that Indicated Mineral Resource continuity can be reliably established with an average drill spacing of 40 metres, versus 25 metres previously. This contributed to the conversion of a portion of the large Inferred Mineral Resource to Measured &amp; Indicated Mineral Resources, which was subsequently converted to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>Reflecting the conversion to Mineral Reserves, Inferred Mineral Resources decreased 64% to 1.3 million ounces with grades increasing 16% to 16.88 g/t Au (2.4 mt). Consistent with the increase in Mineral Reserve grades, a key driver of the increase in Mineral Resource grades has been significantly higher-grade additions in the lower portions of Island East and Island Main. With the deposit open laterally and at depth, and some of the best intercepts ever drilled at Island Gold located within the lower portion of Island East, there is excellent potential for further growth in Mineral Reserves and Resources. The discovery cost of the high-grade Mineral Resource additions averaged an attractive $13 per ounce in 2024, and $13 per ounce over the past five years.\u00a0</p><p>A total of 41,500 m of underground drilling is planned in 2025 with a focus on defining new Mineral Reserves and Resources in proximity to existing production horizons and infrastructure. This includes drilling across the strike extent of the main Island Gold deposit (E1E and C-Zones), as well as within a growing number of newly defined hanging-wall and footwall zones.</p><p>Additionally, 18,000 m of surface exploration drilling has been budgeted targeting the area between the Island Gold and Magino deposits, as well as the down-plunge extension of the Island Gold deposit, below a depth of 1,500 m. Included within sustaining capital, 30,800 m of underground delineation drilling is planned and focused on the ongoing conversion of the large Mineral Resource base to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>Magino\u2019s exploration program has been incorporated into the broader Island Gold District budget which totals $27 million. The focus in 2025 will be expanding mineralization to the east of the pit, which was previously constrained by the border with Island Gold prior to the acquisition. Included within 2025 sustaining capital guidance is 18,000 m of surface delineation drilling planned at Magino. The focus of the delineation drilling is the conversion of the large Mineral Resource base to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>The regional exploration program at the Island Gold District includes 10,000 m of surface drilling, consistent with the 2024 program. The focus will be following up on high-grade mineralization intersected at the Cline-Pick and Edwards deposits located approximately seven km northeast of the Island Gold mine. Drilling will also be completed at the Island Gold North Shear target, and to the east and along strike from the Island Gold mine to test the extension of the E1E-zone.</p><p>During the second quarter, 12,635 m of underground exploration drilling was completed in 53 holes, and 1,893 m of surface drilling was completed in one hole at Island Gold. Additionally, 11,173 m of underground delineation drilling was completed in 40 holes, focused on in-fill drilling to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves. A surface delineation program also commenced during the quarter, targeting Mineral Resource-to-Reserve conversion in the lower portion of Island East. To support this effort, 4,713 m were drilled in two holes. Furthermore, a total of 93 meters of underground exploration drift development was completed during the second quarter.</p><p>At Magino, 12,008 m of surface drilling was completed in 23 holes during the second quarter, focused on in-fill drilling to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves.</p><p>The regional exploration drilling program continued during the second quarter, with 4,273 m completed in 15 holes targeting mineralization at the past-producing Cline-Pick and Edwards mines.</p><p>As detailed in the June 2025 exploration update, the program continues to have broad based success with drilling extending high-grade gold mineralization across the Island Gold Deposit, as well as within several hanging wall and footwall structures, highlighting the significant near-mine upside potential. Additionally, the regional exploration program has been successful in intersecting high-grade gold mineralization at the past-producing Cline-Pick and Edwards mines highlighting longer-term opportunities for further growth.</p><p>Total exploration expenditures during the second quarter of 2025 were $6.8 million, of which $5.1 million was capitalized. In the first half of the year, the Company incurred exploration expenditures of $11.8 million, of which $9.0 million was capitalized.</p><p>Young-Davidson (Ontario, Canada) </p><p>A total of $11 million is budgeted for exploration at Young-Davidson in 2025, an increase from $9 million spent in 2024. This includes 25,600 m of underground exploration drilling focused on extending mineralization in the syenite, and continuing to evaluate and expand on the newly defined hanging wall zones.</p><p>To support the program, 500 m of underground exploration development is planned, including 400 m to establish a hanging wall exploration drift to the south, from the 9620 level. As of June 30, 2025,\u00a0 300 m had been completed in the hanging wall drift and is expected to be completed in the third quarter. This will allow for drill platforms with more optimal locations and orientations to test the higher grade mineralization discovered in the hanging wall.</p><p>The regional program includes 6,000 m of drilling focused on evaluating the Otisse NE target, located approximately three km northeast of Young-Davidson. A comprehensive data compilation project will also commence in 2025 for the Wydee and Matachewan projects, which were acquired in the third quarter of 2024, and located to the west and east of Young-Davidson, respectively.</p><p>During the second quarter, two underground exploration drills completed 5,009 m in nine holes from the 9440 and 9500 levels. Drilling is targeting syenite-hosted mineralization as well as continuing to test mineralization in the hanging wall sediments and mafic-ultramafic stratigraphy.</p><p>Total exploration expenditures during the second quarter of 2025 were $3.8 million, of which $2.9 million was capitalized. In the first half of 2025, the Company incurred exploration expenditures of $6.8 million, of which $4.9 million was capitalized.</p><p>Mulatos District (Sonora, Mexico)</p><p>A total of $19 million is budgeted at Mulatos for exploration in 2025, down slightly from $21 million spent in 2024. The near-mine and regional drilling program is expected to total 45,000 m. This includes 15,000 m of surface exploration drilling at the GAP-Victor and PDA Extension targets at PDA, and 20,000 m planned at Cerro Pelon. The regional exploration program includes 10,000 m of drilling focused on advanced and greenfield targets within the Mulatos District.</p><p>Ongoing exploration success at PDA in 2024 drove a 9% increase in Mineral Reserves to 1.1 million ounces, with grades largely unchanged at 5.45 g/t Au. PDA is a higher-grade underground deposit located adjacent to the main Mulatos pit. The results of a positive internal economic study were announced in September 2024 and highlighted an attractive, low-cost, high-return project. With the amendment to the environmental permit received earlier this year, construction activities are expected to begin ramping up towards the middle of the year with first production anticipated mid-2027.</p><p>The planned addition of a mill to process higher-grade sulphides has created new opportunities for growth within the Mulatos District. This includes Cerro Pelon, where drilling in 2024 followed up on wide high-grade underground oxide and sulphide intersections previously drilled below the pit. The 2024 program was successful in defining an initial Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource at Cerro Pelon totaling 104,000 ounces, grading 4.49 g/t Au. Cerro Pelon remains open in multiple directions and will be a focus of the 2025 exploration program as a significant opportunity for further growth. As the deposit is located within trucking distance of the planned PDA mill, this represents upside to the PDA project.</p><p>During the second quarter, exploration activities continued at PDA and the near-mine area with 7,791 m of drilling completed in 27 holes. The focus was on infill drilling the GAP-Victor portion as well as the eastern extent of the PDA zone.</p><p>Drilling continued at Cerro Pelon with the focus on evaluating the high-grade sulphide potential to the north of the historical open pit. A total of 6,744 m in 24 holes were completed in the second quarter. Additionally, 6,273 m was drilled in 23 holes, testing greenfield targets across the property.</p><p>Total exploration expenditures during the second quarter of 2025 were $6.0 million, of which $1.8 million was capitalized. In the first half of the year, exploration expenditures totaled $9.0 million, of which $2.5 million was capitalized.</p><p>Lynn Lake (Manitoba, Canada)</p><p>A total of $4 million is budgeted for exploration at the Lynn Lake project in 2025, down from $7 million spent in 2024, with the focus shifting to the ramp up of construction activities. The exploration program includes 7,000 m of drilling focused on expanding Mineral Resources at the Burnt Timber and Linkwood deposits. The Company will also continue prioritizing a pipeline of prospective exploration targets within the 58,000-ha Lynn Lake Property.</p><p>As reported on February 18, 2025, total Mineral Reserves for the Lynn Lake District increased 42% to 3.3 million ounces, with grades decreasing 15% to 1.29 g/t Au. This was driven by the successful conversion of Mineral Resources to Reserves at Burnt Timber and Linkwood in 2024 resulting in an initial Mineral Reserve of 0.9 million ounces grading 0.95 g/t Au.</p><p>Burnt Timber and Linkwood are satellite deposits to the Lynn Lake project and are expected to provide additional mill feed. An internal economic study on Burnt Timber and Linkwood was released on February 13, 2025, outlining an attractive, low capital, high-return project. Burnt Timber and Linkwood are expected to extend the mine life of the Lynn Lake project, increase longer term rates of production, and enhance the overall economics. The combined mine life of the Lynn Lake project is expected to increase to 27 years, up from the 17 years outlined in the 2023 Study.</p><p>The 2025 surface exploration program was completed in the first quarter. The focus was on Mineral Resource expansion drilling at both Burnt Timber and Linkwood, with 7,268 m completed in 41 holes.</p><p>Exploration spending totaled $0.7 million in the second quarter and $2.6 million for the first half of the year, all of which was capitalized.</p><p>Qiqavik (Quebec, Canada)</p><p>A total of $7 million has been budgeted for exploration at the Qiqavik project in 2025, up from $4 million spent in 2024. The project was acquired in April 2024 through the acquisition of Orford Mining Corporation.</p><p>Qiqavik is a camp-scale property covering 60,400 ha in the Cape Smith Greenstone Belt in Nunavik, Quebec. The Qiqavik project covers 50 km of strike covering prospective gold hosting environments and several major crustal-scale structures such as the Qiqavik break and the Bergeron fault. Early-stage exploration completed to date indicates that high-grade gold occurrences are controlled by structural splays off the Qiqavik break.</p><p>The 2025 exploration program will focus on drilling prospective targets identified in 2024 through detailed geological mapping, prospecting, till sampling, and a high-resolution Lidar survey with photo imagery. A total of 7,000 m of helicopter supported surface drilling is planned with two rigs and focused on testing the highest priority target areas. The program will also focus on advancing other targets across the belt with ongoing geological mapping, drone magnetics, prospecting, and additional till sampling.</p><p>Exploration activities in the second quarter were focused on continued data interpretation to support targeting ahead of the summer drill program.\u00a0 At the end of the second quarter, the camp had been set up and drills were mobilized to site for the start of the summer drill program.</p><p>Exploration spending totaled $1.4 million in the second quarter and $1.7 million for first half of the year all of which was expensed.</p><p>Review of Second Quarter Financial Results</p><p>During the second quarter of 2025, the Company sold 135,027 ounces of gold for record operating revenues of $438.2 million, representing a 32% increase from the prior year period. The increase was due to higher realized gold prices and the inclusion of ounces at Magino given its acquisition in July 2024, partially offset by lower sales volumes at La Yaqui Grande due to timing of ounces recovered on the leach pad, and at Young-Davidson where higher-than-normal water levels impacted the mining rates.</p><p>The average realized gold price in the second quarter was $3,223 per ounce, 38% higher than the prior year period. This was $57 per ounce less the London PM Fix price for the quarter, reflecting the delivery of the 12,346 ounces into the gold prepayment facility entered into in July 2024 based on the prepaid price of $2,524 per ounce.</p><p>Cost of sales (which includes mining and processing costs, royalties, and amortization expense) were $200.7 million in the second quarter, 16% higher than the prior year period, primarily due to the inclusion of higher cost ounces from Magino. Excluding costs incurred at Magino, cost of sales were $149.9 million which was 13% lower than the prior year period, driven by the lower sales volumes at the Mulatos District and Young-Davidson. Key drivers of changes to cost of sales as compared to the prior year period were as follows:</p><p>Mining and processing costs were $140.4 million, 20% higher than the prior year period, primarily due to the inclusion of Magino. Excluding costs incurred at Magino, mining and processing costs were $105.1 million, 10% lower than the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by lower ounces sold at Mulatos and Young-Davidson.</p><p>Total cash costs of $1,075 per ounce and AISC of $1,475 per ounce were above the prior year period driven by the higher costs per ounce at Young-Davidson, due to lower grades and mining rates, the inclusion of higher cost ounces at Magino, and higher share-based compensation and royalty expense.</p><p>Royalty expense was $7.6 million in the second quarter, higher than the prior year period of $3.0 million, due to the higher average realized gold price, and inclusion of royalties incurred at Magino.</p><p>Amortization of $52.7 million in the second quarter was consistent with the prior year period. On a per ounce basis, amortization of $390 per ounce was higher than the prior year period, reflecting the inclusion of Magino which has a higher amortization base.</p><p>The Company recognized earnings from operations of $216.2 million in the second quarter, 56% higher than the prior year period, driven by the higher gold price.</p><p>As at June\u00a030, 2025, the Company held forward contracts that were acquired as part of the acquisition of Argonaut. These legacy contracts, totaling 100,000 ounces in 2026 and 50,000 ounces in 2027, have an average forward price of $1,821 per ounce, and mature monthly throughout 2026 and 2027. The Company recognized unrealized losses of $25.8 million on the forward contracts inherited from Argonaut driven by the movement in gold price in the second quarter. The Company recognized unrealized losses of $0.4 million on gold option contracts in the prior year period.</p><p>The Company reported net earnings of $159.4 million in the second quarter, compared to $70.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings(1) were $144.1 million, or $0.34 per share, which included an adjustment for unrealized losses on the legacy Argonaut commodity hedge derivatives, net of tax of $17.1 million. In addition, adjusted earnings reflect net unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded within deferred taxes and foreign exchange losses totaling $34.3 million and other adjustments of $1.9 million.</p><p>(1) Refer to the \u201cNon-GAAP Measures and Additional GAAP Measures\u201d section of this press release and associated MD&amp;A for a description and calculation of these measures.</p><p>Associated Documents</p><p>This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended June 30, 2025 and associated Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&amp;A\u201d), which are available from the Company's website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.alamosgold.com\">www.alamosgold.com</url>, in the \"Investors\" section under \"Reports and Financials\", and on SEDAR+ (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url>) and EDGAR (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>).</p><p>Reminder of Second Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call</p><p>The Company's senior management will host a conference call on Thursday, July 31, 2025 at 10:00 am ET to discuss the second quarter 2025 results.

Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information.</p><p>Risk factors that may affect Alamos\u2019 ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to: changes to current estimates of mineral reserves and resources; changes to production estimates (which assume accuracy of projected ore grade, mining rates, recovery timing and recovery rate estimates which may be impacted by unscheduled maintenance, weather issues, labour and contractor availability and other operating or technical difficulties); operations may be exposed to illnesses, diseases, epidemics and pandemics, the impact of any illness, disease, epidemic or pandemic on the broader market and the trading price of the Company's shares; provincial and federal orders or mandates (including with respect to mining operations generally or auxiliary businesses or services required for the Company\u2019s operations) in Canada, Mexico, the United States and T\u00fcrkiye; the duration of any regulatory responses to any illness, disease, epidemic or pandemic; government and the Company\u2019s attempts to reduce the spread of any illness, disease, epidemic or pandemic which may affect many aspects of the Company's operations including the ability to transport personnel to and from site, contractor and supply availability and the ability to sell or deliver gold dor\u00e9 bars; fluctuations in the price of gold or certain other commodities such as, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity; changes in foreign exchange rates (particularly CAD, MXN, USD and Turkish lira); the impact of inflation and any tariffs, trade barriers and/or regulatory costs; changes in the Company's credit rating; any decision to declare a quarterly dividend; employee and community relations; litigation and administrative proceedings (including but not limited to the investment treaty claim announced on April 20, 2021 against the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye by the Subsidiaries) and any resulting court or arbitral decision(s); disruptions affecting operations; availability of and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labour; delays with the Phase 3+ Expansion project at the Island Gold mine, construction of the 115kV powerline, construction of the Lynn Lake Project, construction of the PDA project, and/or the development or updating of mine plans; changes with respect to the intended method of accessing and mining the deposit at PDA and changes related to the intended method of processing any ore from the deposit of PDA; risks associated with the start-up of new mines; the risk that the Company\u2019s mines may not perform as planned; the risk that the closing conditions for the completion of the sale of Quartz Mountain may not be met; uncertainty with the Company\u2019s ability to secure additional capital to execute its business plans; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses and permits, including the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations and/or approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities for the Company\u2019s development stage and operating assets; labour and contractor availability (and being able to secure the same on favourable terms); contests over title to properties; expropriation or nationalization of property; inherent risks and hazards associated with mining and mineral processing including environmental hazards, industrial hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures and cave-ins; changes in national and local government legislation, controls or regulations in Canada, Mexico, T\u00fcrkiye, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company does or may carry on business in the future; increased costs and risks related to the potential impact of climate change; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; risk of loss due to sabotage, protests and other civil disturbances; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; risks arising from holding derivative instruments; and business opportunities that may be pursued by the Company. The litigation against the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye, described above, results from the actions of the Turkish government in respect of the Company\u2019s projects in the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye. Such litigation is a mitigation effort and may not be effective or successful. If unsuccessful, the Company\u2019s projects in T\u00fcrkiye may be subject to resource nationalism and further expropriation; the Company may lose any remaining value of its assets and gold mining projects in T\u00fcrkiye and its ability to operate in T\u00fcrkiye. Even if the litigation is successful, there is no certainty as to the quantum of any damages award or recovery of all, or any, legal costs. Any resumption of activities in T\u00fcrkiye by the Company, or even retaining control of its assets and gold mining projects in T\u00fcrkiye can only result from agreement with the Turkish government. The investment treaty claim described in this press release may have an impact on foreign direct investment in the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye which may result in changes to the Turkish economy, including but not limited to high rates of inflation and fluctuation of the Turkish Lira which may also affect the Company\u2019s relationship with the Turkish government, the Company\u2019s ability to effectively operate in T\u00fcrkiye, and which may have a negative effect on overall anticipated project values.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Additional risk factors and details with respect to risk factors that may affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this release are set out in the Company's latest 40-F/Annual Information Form under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, which is available on the SEDAR+ website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url> or on EDGAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.

NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators, which established standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Mining disclosure in the United States was previously required to comply with SEC Industry Guide 7 (\u201cSEC Industry Guide 7\u201d) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The SEC has adopted final rules, to replace SEC Industry Guide 7 with new mining disclosure rules under sub-part 1300 of Regulation S-K of the U.S. Securities Act (\u201cRegulation S-K 1300\u201d) which became mandatory for U.S. reporting companies beginning with the first fiscal year commencing on or after January 1, 2021. Under Regulation S-K 1300, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \u201cMeasured Mineral Resources\u201d, \u201cIndicated Mineral Resources\u201d and \u201cInferred Mineral Resources\u201d. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \u201cProven Mineral Reserves\u201d and \u201cProbable Mineral Reserves\u201d to be substantially similar to international standards.</p><p>Investors are cautioned that while the above terms are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under Regulation S-K 1300 and the CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \u201cproven mineral reserves\u201d, \u201cprobable mineral reserves\u201d, \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates under the standards adopted under Regulation S-K 1300. U.S. investors are also cautioned that while the SEC recognizes \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d under Regulation S-K 1300, investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater degree of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable.</p><p>International Financial Reporting Standards: The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared by management in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB (note 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024). These accounting principles differ in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company\u2019s reporting currency is the United States dollar unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Non-GAAP Measures and Additional GAAP Measures</p><p>The Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement its condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, which are presented in accordance with IFRS, including the following:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital and taxes paid;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>company-wide free cash flow;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>total mine-site free cash flow;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>mine-site free cash flow;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>total cash costs per ounce of gold sold;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>AISC per ounce of gold sold;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Mine-site AISC per ounce of gold sold;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>sustaining and non-sustaining capital expenditures; and</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\")</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management's determination of the components of non-GAAP and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions, a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable. Any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable.</p><p>Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings per Share</p><p>\u201cAdjusted net earnings\u201d and \u201cadjusted earnings per share\u201d are non-GAAP financial measures with no standard meaning under IFRS which exclude the following from net earnings:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Foreign exchange gains or losses</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Items included in other loss</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Unrealized gain or loss on commodity derivatives</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Certain non-recurring items</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Foreign exchange gain or loss recorded in deferred tax expense</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The income and mining tax impact of items included in other loss</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The Company uses adjusted net earnings for its own internal purposes. Management\u2019s internal budgets and forecasts and public guidance do not reflect the items which have been excluded from the determination of adjusted net earnings. Consequently, the presentation of adjusted net earnings enables shareholders to better understand the underlying operating performance of the core mining business through the eyes of management. Management periodically evaluates the components of adjusted net earnings based on an internal assessment of performance measures that are useful for evaluating the operating performance of our business and a review of the non-GAAP measures used by mining industry analysts and other mining companies.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

It can also cause headaches and bronchitis. </p><p>Experts say <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/08/wildfire-smoke-safety-tips/77542161007/\">limiting time outdoors when air is smoky</url> is the best way to keep yourself safe. Avoid physical exertion, including indoors. While inside, keep windows and doors shut. Leave off any air conditioning or fan systems that pull air from outside, and use air filters or air purifiers. If you can\u2019t buy a commercial portable air filter, you can create your own. One example is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://engineering.ucdavis.edu/news/science-action-how-build-corsi-rosenthal-box\">Corsi-Rosenthal box</url> made from simple materials of an air filter, box fan and duct tape.</p><p>If you must go outside, you should wear a high-quality, well-fitting N95 or P100 respirator mask to protect yourself. Keep your trips outside short. </p><p>You should also watch out for your pets when air quality is bad because they can't wear a respirator mask to protect themselves, but still may need to go outside. Keep their bathroom trips outside short, and watch out for signs of distress such as red or watery eyes and nose, coughing or gagging and increased respiratory rate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Contributing: Thao Nguyen and Michael Loria, USA TODAY;

As part of that plan, a new online information portal is designed to help the public understand and reduce fire risk, Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette announced today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following a very active wildfire year in 2023, the Forest Fire Service is introducing the New Jersey Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (NJWRAP), which compiles data and resources to assist residents, community leaders and fire professionals in taking actions to mitigate the threat of wildfire risk. Data in the new portal will also assist the Forest Fire Service to identify areas where prescribed burning may help mitigate wildfire risk.</p><p>Prescribed fire not only fosters resilience and diversity in the landscape, but also helps to safeguard our communities, Commissioner LaTourette said. By executing planned prescribed fires throughout New Jerseys wooded areas, we are limiting the risk of a catastrophic release of carbon during a wildfire.</p><p>Locations where prescribed burns are taking place can be viewed on the Prescribed Fire Notifications map at njwildfire.org. Additionally, daily notifications are posted on the DEP Forest Fire Services Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) accounts. Text or email notifications of prescribed burns are also available by signing up via this link.</p><p>In 2024, the Forest Fire Service intends to treat 25,000 acres of forests, grasslands and marsh with prescribed fire. Meeting the targeted acreage will depend on favorable weather conditions from October through April, when most prescribed burning takes place in New Jersey.</p><p>Coming off an abnormally active fire year in 2023, with 1,194 wildfires burning in excess of 18,000 acres, makes the need for prescribed fire more important than ever.</p><p>In 2023 we saw the busiest wildfire year in over 20 years with 14 major wildfires burning across New Jersey threatening over 200 homes, forcing evacuations and closing roads, said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests and Historic Sites. The Forest Fire Service is ever vigilant in their efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires, especially through the use of prescribed burning.</p><p>About Prescribed Burning</p><p>Prescribed burning is the practice of setting fires in forests or grasslands under well-defined and strategically planned conditions to achieve land management objectives. In addition to reducing the presence of wildland fire fuels, prescribed burning improves habitat for plants and animals, reduces the presence of damaging insects and ticks, and recycles nutrients into the soil.</p><p>Most of the Forest Fire Services burns in 2024 will occur on state-owned property such as state forests, parks and wildlife management areas, but the Forest Fire Service also assists private landowners, nonprofit organizations, as well as county and municipal governments to meet their management objectives through prescribed burning. Landowners interested in the Forest Fire Services assistance in conducting a prescribed burn on their property may contact their local Forest Fire Service office.</p><p>Last year, the Forest Fire Service completed prescribed burns on 21,407 acres -- 14,004 acres of state-owned lands and 7,403 acres of privately owned property.</p><p>Several climatological and environmental conditions, all of which influence a fires intensity and severity, are considered when conducting prescribed burns to accomplish various resource and ecological objectives, such as reducing hazard fuels and managing habitats. The Forest Fire Service and DEPs Air Quality Regulation and Planning office work together to assess current and predicted air quality to determine the best days to conduct prescribed burning, to minimize air quality impacts. Other factors considered include the density and arrangement of the vegetation being burned. Current air quality information can be found here.</p><p>While most prescribed burning takes place during the spring, a prescribed burn may be implemented in the summer or fall depending on the management objective for a particular area. The Prescribed Burn Act authorized the Forest Fire Service to use prescribed burning as a tool to meet a wider range of management objectives designed to improve forest health and conditions for plants and animals. For example, prescribed burning can be effective in managing the spread of nonnative invasive species or managing grasslands for threatened or endangered bird species.</p><p>Most prescribed burning takes place throughout the New Jersey Pinelands, an ecosystem which needs fire to thrive. Pitch pine, the dominant species of pine in New Jersey, have serotinous cones, which means they remain closed until exposed to high heat from fire, at which point they release their seeds. Additionally, pitch pine trees can sprout new growth from their roots or stump, allowing them to quickly recover and colonize a burned area.</p><p>Motorists are reminded to use caution when approaching areas where prescribed burns are taking place, pay attention to reduced speed limits and be alert to the presence of Forest Fire Service vehicles, equipment and personnel that may be working alongside roadways.</p><p>New Jerseyans are reminded that peak wildfire season often directly follows prescribed burn season. When in doubt about the source of smoke or whether a fire is part of a prescribed burning operation, call 1-877-WARN-DEP (1-877-927-6337) or 911.</p><p>About the Portal</p><p>Residents, community leaders and fire professionals may use NJWRAP to access resources regarding wildfire threats to homes and business and find out how to mitigate risk.</p><p>The concept of wildfire hazard and risk information provided in NJWRAP are not new, but the innovative tools in the portal are more advanced, precise and easier to navigate than what was previously available. Data and preparedness resources presented in the portal were developed by the nations wildfire experts with Forest Fire Service personnel providing practical and local information.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service will update the portals tools and data based on user need and on-the-ground changes to the landscape. NJWRAP was made possible through partnerships with the U.S. Forest Service.</p><p>The Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal is a powerful tool for residents, community leaders and fire professionals to learn about risk from wildfire, and the steps they can take to protect family and community, said Greg McLaughlin, Administrator for Forests and Natural Lands. Nearly a quarter of all homes in New Jersey are built in an area known as the wildland-urban interface, also known as the area where development is intertwined with forested land.</p><p>In addition to the portal, the Forest Fire Service has several other useful tools on its website to keep New Jersey residents informed, including the Fire Danger Dashboard and the Prescribed Fire Notifications Map.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126410717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BF7-XH91-DYTH-G1W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1192\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 27, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from Barcelona, Spain, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires cause every year damages to biodiversity, atmosphere, and economy activities. Forest fire simulation have improved significantly, but input data describing fire scenarios are subject to high levels of uncertainty.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacin, Catalan government. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Autonomous University Barcelona, \"In this work the two -stage prediction scheme is used to adjust unknown parameters. This scheme relies on an input data calibration phase, which is carried over following a genetic algorithm strategy. The calibrated inputs are then pipelined into the actual prediction phase. This two -stage prediction scheme is leveraged by the cloud computing paradigm, which enables high level of parallelism on demand, elasticity, scalability and low-cost. In this paper, all the models designed to properly allocate cloud resources to the two -stage scheme in a performance -efficient and cost-effective way are described.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This Cloud -based Urgent Computing ( CuCo ) architecture has been tested using, as study case, an extreme wildland fire that took place in California in 2018 (Camp Fire).\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Cloud-based Urgent Computing for Forest Fire Spread Prediction.

The funds are received by the County annually from the federal government as Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT). Similar to many other local governments in the U.S. that have non-taxable federal lands within their boundaries, Douglas County receives PILT funds to help offset losses in local property taxes spent on the utilization of County services on our non-taxable federal lands.</p><p>48% of Douglas County is open space and just over 140,000 acres of that open space is within the Pike National Forest. PILT funds help rural fire districts protect those lands as they respond to emergency calls in the national forest.</p><p>Fire districts report they will use the money in 2025 to update wildland fire fighting and personal protection equipment.</p><p>The PILT funds were distributed to the six agencies based on the number of calls they made during the year, at an average of $662 per call.</p><p>Awards were as follows:</p><p>* Mountain Communities Volunteer Fire Protection District: $34,430.33 (52 calls)</p><p>* West Douglas Fire Protection District: $21,852.33 (33 calls)</p><p>* North Fork Fire Protection District: $24,500.33 (37 calls)</p><p>* Jackson 105 Fire Protection District: $10,598.33 (16 calls)</p><p>* Larkspur Fire Protection District: $6,626.34 (10 calls)</p><p>* West Metro Fire: $1,992.34 (3 calls)</p><p>Beginning in 2002, Douglas County has designated a portion of its PILT money each year to provide supplemental funding for fire protection districts responding in the Pike National Forest.</p><p>Wildfire mitigation and risk (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.douglas.co.us/land/wildfire-mitigation/\">https://www.douglas.co.us/land/wildfire-mitigation/</url>) reduction require everyone in our community to participate.

This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, the breaking news on Capitol Hill this hour, a marathon is now about to get underway in the Senate on President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill. It's really the last obstacle that the Senate -- that Senate Republicans must overcome to get to a final yes or no vote on that massive bill. Trump wants it on his desk by July 4th, but there is a long road still ahead before then.</p><p>This weekend, two Republican senators voted against advancing the bill to this point, Rand Paul and Thom Tillis. For Senator Tillis, that also meant a wrap on his Senate career. After the president threatened to meet with primary challengers against him, for, he says, standing in the way, Tillis said he won't run for re-election next year. The senator has maintained all along his concerns of how the deep Medicaid cuts in the bill would impact his constituents in North Carolina. Also adding to the uncertainty of the moment now, the Congressional Budget Office, the non-partisan scorekeeper on The Hill, it is now weighing in on this bill, saying that the Senate version would result in nearly 12 million more people becoming uninsured and saying that this bill is even more expensive and will increase the deficit even more than the House version.</p><p>CNN's Arlette Saenz is on Capitol Hill for us this morning, watching it all as it's all about to get underway.</p><p>What are we about to see?</p><p>ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, senators have started to trickle in as the senate is about to come back into session. We expect, in just a short while, they will kick off the so-called vote- a-rama. This is a process that will allow senators to introduce amendments to President Trump's big agenda bill.</p><p>Now, it comes after a weekend of dealmaking and cajoling to try to get GOP senators on board. There will be a number of amendments introduced by Democrats who have railed against this bill, but there are also some key amendments that will be proposed by Republican senators. One of those includes an amendment from Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who is proposing reducing the federal matching rate for states that expanded Medicaid under President Obama. Senator Susan Collins is another senator to watch as she will be introducing some amendments. And then there will be a lot of attention also on Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. They -- the Senate leaders have introduced two provisions that would have aided Alaska and Hawaii in hope of getting her on board with this bill. But the Senate parliamentarian said that those cannot move forward.</p><p>So, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done here in the Senate if they want to get this bill across the finish line. They can only afford to lose three Republican votes. And there were importantly two no votes on that critical procedural vote over the weekend. And then anything that changes here in the Senate still has to go back to the House, where some conservatives have expressed concerns about there not being enough to cut -- to offset spending, and also when it relates to Medicaid cuts that are being made in this bill.</p><p>So, there's still a lot that needs to be ironed out as they are hoping to get the president's bill across the finish line.</p><p>BOLDUAN: And another senator that everyone is sure to be keeping a close eye on today would be Senator Thom Tillis after the announcement -- after the -- we've described the back and forth with President Trump, his very important big announcement last night, and then his very fiery speech on the Senate floor explaining it all. What more are you hearing about -- what's next for him and what more are you hearing?</p><p>SAENZ: Yes, well, Senator Thom Tillis was one of two Republicans to vote against that key procedural vote. And last night he went to the Senate floor and really had an incredibly fiery speech criticizing this bill. He said that -- he told reporters after that he respects President Trump, but he thinks that this bill is a mistake for Republicans.</p><p>[09:05:05]</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NANCY CORDES: What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAENZ: So, Tillis' announcement that he will not seek re-election just highlights some of the political pressure points the senator feeling around this bill as President Trump is hoping to keep that GOP caucus on board with his plan.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Absolutely. Arlette, thank you so much. Arlette there as it's just about to start getting underway.</p><p>Sara.</p><p>SIDNER: The pressure is on as the Senate moves towards a final vote expected today.</p><p>President Trump is viewing what unfolds on Capitol Hill as a loyalty test. Republican senator, as you heard, Tom Tillis basically setting fire to that test, slamming the GOP's plans for drastic Medicaid cuts last night.</p><p>Tillis, of course, you heard it there, retiring after Trump threatened to primary him.</p><p>CNN's Betsy Klein joining us now from the White House.</p><p>Curious to know how Donald Trump is responding to this, with Tillis saying, all right, I am not going to run anymore.</p><p>BETSY KLEIN, CNN SENIOR REPORTER AND WRITER: Well, Sara, President Trump really views this bill as key to unlocking his agenda, and the White House views this as absolutely mission critical to get this done while Republicans control both the House and the Senate. So, the president here setting up that key loyalty test. The White House says that voting no is, quote, \"an ultimate betrayal.\"</p><p>So the president, for all of those reasons, spent a rare weekend here in Washington negotiating on the golf course, working the phones in the Oval Office late during that vote on saturday night. And he also went after those two Republican senators who voted against that key procedural vote, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, as well as Rand Paul of Kentucky. But the reality is that this bill is so sprawling, it has provisions on border security, ending green energy subsidies. It raises the debt ceiling. It reimagines Medicaid policy and extends tax cuts. So, there are some serious and diverse concerns from within the Republican Party. And we're going to watch that play out in the coming hours on the Senate floor.</p><p>The president appearing to acknowledge those concerns last night. He said, quote, \"for all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, remember, you still have to get re-elected. Don't go too crazy. We will make it all up times ten with growth more than ever before.\" And Democrats, for their part, starting to coalesce the message that this will lower taxes for wealthy people and hurt working class Americans. All of this setting up a key test for the 2026 midterm elections.</p><p>Sara.</p><p>SIDNER: Yes. And there's a lot in there. It's more than 900 pages.</p><p>Betsy Klein, thank you. We will see what happens.</p><p>John.</p><p>BERMAN: With us now is Congressman Richie Torres, a Democrat from New York who serves on the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Congressman, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>The Senate version of this bill, which was read out loud and you've now had a chance to go through it, if it becomes law, what would it mean for people in the Bronx?</p><p>REP. RICHIE TORRES (D-NY): Well, the so-called big, beautiful bill is a broken promise that represents a betrayal of working people. It's -- it's a catastrophe, not only for the Bronx, but for the whole country. It would cause 12 million people to lose their health care. It would slash Medicaid and children's health care by $1 trillion. The largest health care cut in American history. It would slash SNAP by $267 billion, the largest food assistance cut in history. It would add trillions of dollars to the national debt. It would raise electricity costs by an average of 7 percent for residents by an average of 10 percent for businesses with increases as high as 30 percent in the hardest hit states.</p><p>And no district would be more affected than mine because my district has the highest rate of Medicaid enrollment in the country, 67 percent. More than 70 percent of children, more than 80 percent of nursing home residents, more than 90 percent of baby deliveries are covered by Medicaid. And so this legislation represents an unprecedented assault on working people, all to finance tax cuts for the top 1 percent. I represent constituents who, after paying all their bills, live on $20 a day. And Republicans are going to cut health care and food for those living on $20 a day in order to pay for a tax cut for Elon Musk, who has a net worth of $400 billion. I cannot think of a greater betrayal of working people than this so-called big, beautiful bill. BERMAN: You, online, have been writing about the cuts or the removal of incentives for solar and renewable energy sources, and also some incentives being in place for coal. What's your issue here?</p><p>[09:10:01]</p><p>TORRES: Look, the Republican reconciliation bill is going to restrict the supply of electricity available to American households and businesses. In order to grow the American economy, we have to grow the electric grid. And the best and cheapest and fastest way to grow the electric grid is solar energy. In 2024, 90 percent of new electricity generation in the United States was clean energy. Sixty percent of it is solar. And Republicans are proposing to defund solar and battery storage and wind, which are the leading sources of new electricity generation in the United States. It is an act of strategic self- sabotage that will only benefit foreign adversaries, like the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>BERMAN: There has been a primary in the race for mayor of New York City, and Zohran Mamdani is the apparent Democratic nominee for mayor. He has been asked whether or not he repudiates the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\" Yesterday, with Kristen Welker, she asked him repeatedly if he would condemn the phrase. This was his final answer. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS: Why not just condemn it?</p><p>ZOHRAN MAMDANI, DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE OR NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: My concern is, to start to walk down the line of language and making clear what language I believe is permissible or impermissible takes me into a place similar to that of the president, who is looking to do those very kinds of things, putting people in jail for writing an op-ed, putting them in jail for protesting. Ultimately, it's not language that I use, it's language I understand there are concerns about. And what I will do is showcase my vision for the city through my words and my actions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: He says it's not language he uses, but he did not specifically condemn it. What did you think of that answer?</p><p>TORRES: I -- I strongly disagree. No one's advocating for imprisonment. I mean, every elected official has an obligation to condemn hatred, whether its anti-Semitism or islamophobia. You know, the second intifada refers to a wave of terror attacks, suicide bombings and slashings and stabbings that left more than a thousand Israelis and Jews dead. And so, when one uses the word \"intifada,\" it causes profound pain and trauma to the Jewish community. It is deeply offensive. Every elected official, without exception, should condemn it.</p><p>BERMAN: In the primary you were supportive of former Governor Andrew Cuomo. He is going to stay, he says for now, on the ballot in November. Do you still support his candidacy for mayor?</p><p>TORRES: My -- my endorsement of the governor only applies to the Democratic primary, which is over. So, the voters of the Democratic primary have spoken. And so, my focus is on governing.</p><p>BERMAN: I just missed what you said there at the end. Do you support the nominees, Zohran Mamdani, in his race for mayor now?</p><p>TORRES: I have not endorsed the assemblyman. We spoke on Sunday. We had a mutually respectful conversation. We have profound differences of opinion. There was no discussion of an endorsement, but there was a discussion of a commitment to continuing the dialog.</p><p>BERMAN: So you're not ruling it out?</p><p>TORRES: I think we have profound differences of opinion. But again, you know, if he becomes mayor, and he's likely to become mayor, the mayor needs the New York City congressional delegation, the New York City congressional delegation needs the mayor. And so, it's in the interest of both sides to have a working relationship, to figure out how to coexist. So, I'm thinking about governing, not the election.</p><p>BERMAN: Understood.</p><p>Congressman Richie Torres, from the Bronx, appreciate your time.</p><p>Kate.</p><p>BOLDUAN: A deadly ambush on firefighters responding to a mountainside brush fire. Investigators are now trying to figure out why a man lured them in and then started shooting.</p><p>And the fate and future of disgraced music mogul Sean Combs is about to be in the hands of a jury.

Investigators say the suspect deliberately set a brush fire to lure them in, then started shooting as soon as they arrived. The suspect was found dead more than six hours later. Investigators located his body, they say, by tracing his cell phone signal.</p><p>CNN's Julia Vargas Jones is live in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, with the latest.</p><p>What are you hearing this morning, Julia?</p><p>JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, as this community is waking up, it is waking up to grief and trying to figure out why this happened. Why here? Why to these firefighters?</p><p>Now it's all made worse by what we are hearing from the dispatch audio of those last few moments and -- and the harrowing sounds that came from those calls.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got two unresponsive battalion chiefs, gunshot wounds, multiple gunshot wounds. Two Coeur d'Alene firefighters are down. We need law enforcement to get up here. We can possibly get two -- the two wounded out. I'm pinned down behind battalion one's rig. It's clear to me that this fire was intentionally to draw us in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:20:03]</p><p>JONES: And, John, today, investigators are heading back into that mountain, which is just to my right here. And we can smell that fire still burning on the side of the mountain. They said that they had to remove the body of the shooter quite quickly from that side of the mountain because of the fire threat. And today they're heading back in there. And what they're looking for is a clue to have a better sense of what was going on, how he had prepared and what else they could find where he was hiding.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes, it was a terrifying crime, obviously. Searching for so many answers there now, obviously, in the wake of what happened.</p><p>Julia Vargas Jones for us in Coeur d'Alene in Idaho, thank you very much for that.</p><p>The jury in the Sean Combs trial is about to get the case after seven weeks of testimony. What to expect in court today.</p><p>And a new app warns users when ICE agents are nearby. The developer says it's not about protest, its about protection.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:25:36]</p><p>All right, so we're learning that court is now back in session in the Sean Combs sex trafficking and racketeering case. Twelve New Yorkers, eight women, four men are currently receiving instructions from the judge. Prosecutors laid out their closing arguments over almost five hours, going over six weeks of testimony and, of course, that disturbing video of Combs' beating his then girlfriend. And the defense, for its part, accused prosecutors of going after Combs only because of his lifestyle.</p><p>Joining me now, trial attorney Kelly Hyman. Let's first start here. So, the judge is preparing right now to read instructions to the jury, which is expected to take at least an hour, if not longer. How significant are these instructions that the judge will now be telling the jury that they must follow in this case?</p><p>KELLY HYMAN, TRIAL ATTORNEY: They are key because the jury instructions are a roadmap to the jurors when they go and deliberate. And what I mean by roadmap is, it lays out each one of the charges, racketeering, transportation across state lines to engage in prostitution, sex trafficking. And each one of the elements as well.</p><p>Also, the judge lets the jury know that ultimately they are the trier of facts. And what that means is, they can weigh the credibility of the witnesses, because that's going to be key for the sex trafficking charge.</p><p>SIDNER: I do want to ask you how you saw both the prosecution and the defense, how they did in -- in sort of doing their closing arguments, but also laying out their case to this jury. What did you see on both sides of this?</p><p>HYMAN: A tale of two different stories. From the prosecution standpoint, they told a story of Diddy as someone who used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted. And from the defense standpoint, their position was, this case was about love. This case was about jealousy. This case was about infidelity. And this case was about money.</p><p>Ultimately, it's going to be up to the jury to determine whether or not which side that they believe. But it's interesting, in New York, that 95 percent of cases that go to trial in the Southern District of New York come back with a guilty verdict.</p><p>SIDNER: That's a really interesting number. This has been a very long and -- and sometimes complex case. Lots and lots of testimony. Even testimony to deal with the finances of all of this.</p><p>Was there any testimony to you that really stood out that the prosecution did well, because the defense did not put on any witnesses. This was all about their cross-examination.</p><p>HYMAN: And they don't have to put on any witnesses because the prosecution has the burden of proof, and they have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. But from the prosecution standpoint, Cassie Ventura, Diddy's ex-girlfriend, was their star witness. If the jury believe her, then they will ultimately determine that he is guilty of sex trafficking of her.</p><p>SIDNER: You said that, you know, the defense, rightly so, does not have to put on a case. This really is -- the burden is on the prosecution. Was it any surprise to you that Sean Combs did not take the stand, that they did not bring in any other witnesses, but used only cross-examination, really to -- to tell the story from their perspective?</p><p>HYMAN: An attorney can advise his client whether or not to take the witness stand. And ultimately it's Diddy's decision. But it was a very smart decision from the defense standpoint because here's why. Once Diddy takes the witness stand and testifies, that opens the door for the prosecution now to come in and cross-examine him and ask him all types of questions. And that opens the door to a lot of things.</p><p>SIDNER: There's been a lot of talk about this case and the racketeering part of this case. Racketeering conspiracy. Is that a very difficult charge to -- to -- to get a conviction on? A lot of prosecutors, I think, have struggled with this charge in.</p><p>HYMAN: In regards to all the charges, the sex trafficking, the transportation across state lines and the RICO, the RICO is the hardest charge for the prosecution, but also the strongest penalty because, if convicted, he can go to life in prison for the RICO charge.</p><p>[09:30:02]</p><p>SIDNER: What -- what makes it so difficult? I mean, obviously, when you hear RICO, you usually think there are more people involved and more defendants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2025063005CNV19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNNEC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G59-FV73-RS4G-S03Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3425\"/><timeReceived>09:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Cable News Network, Inc.

Andy Kim (D-NJ) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON, D.C. - Senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Tim Sheehy (R-MT) introduced the bipartisan Wildfire Response and Preparedness (WRAP) Act to establish a 30-minute national standard response time to any wildfire occurring on federal land administered by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior.</p><p>\"As New Jerseyans and people across our country experience worsening devastation from wildfires due to climate change, a more aggressive response time can be a lifesaving tool for them and our first responders,\" said Senator Kim. \"With this bill, we are able to expand on the success of standards for structure fires and put our best foot forward in protecting communities from the threat of wildfires.\"</p><p>\"Establishing an aggressive national wildfire standard response time, just like we have for structure fires, is an America First, commonsense way to protect our nation and our people. The WRAP Act will help our brave firefighters put out wildfires while they are small and dramatically reduce catastrophic wildfire damage. This bill will save lives and prevent hundreds of billions of dollars in future property damage,\" said Senator Sheehy.</p><p>In 2024 alone over 64,800 wildfires occurred across the country, burning nearly 9 million acres. That's up from 56,500 fires in 2023 that burned 3 million acres. New Jersey's Forest Fire Service reported that in 2024 they responded to over 1,400 wildfires burning in excess of 11,000 acres across the Garden State. These fires threaten the state's woodlands and nearby homes.</p><p>Currently, the National Fire Protection Association sets the standard for structure fire response at five minutes and 20 seconds, which reduced civilian deaths by 70 percent, but there is no similar standard for wildfire suppression, letting wildfires burn for days without suppression and increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfire. To fix this and protect lives and property, the bipartisan WRAP Act would require the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to establish a national standard response time of no more than 30 minutes to the extent practical to a wildland fire occurring on federal land that they administer.</p><p>Senator Kim is a member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP); the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and the Special Committee on Aging. Before being elected to the U.S. Senate, Kim represented New Jersey's Third Congressional District in the U.S. House and was a career public servant working in national security and diplomacy at the White House, State Department, and Pentagon.
