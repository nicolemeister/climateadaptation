Flames were being held at bay 9 miles from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, and weary firefighters had a reprieve around Kelowna in British Columbia. But the firefighters were nowhere close to declaring victory, especially with drier and windier weather forecast for the coming days. \"We're by no means out of the woods yet,\" Mike Westwick, wildfire information officer for Yellowknife, told The Associated Press. </p><p>\"We still have a serious situation. It's not safe to return.\" The fires near Kelowna, about 90 miles north of the U.S. border, are among more than 380 blazes across the province, with 150 burning out of control, according to The Canadian Press. Another 236 fires are burning in the Northwest Territories. At a Saturday evening news conference, Shane Thompson, the province's minister of environment and climate change, said the fires near Yellowknife had not grown very much in the past few days thanks to breaks in the weather. \"But I want to be clear, a little bit of rain doesn't mean it's safe to come back home,\" he said. Others warned that incoming hot weather would make the battle more challenging. Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty encouraged residents to stay away from the town to ensure their safety and help with firefighting efforts. She assured people that patrols were monitoring the streets and homes to protect against looting. \"This fire's taking a nap. Its going to wake up and we still got a serious situation to handle here,\" Westwick said. Yellowknife has been a virtual ghost town since a majority of the city's 20,000 residents started to flee following an evacuation order issued Wednesday evening, officials said. Long caravans of cars choked the main highway for days and those who couldn't take to the road lined up for emergency flights out of the city. The last 39 hospital patients were flown out Friday night on a Canadian Forces plane, officials said. On Saturday, officials said the escape route out of Yellowknife was safe, for the time being. About 2,600 people remained, including emergency teams, firefighters, utility workers and police officers, along with some residents who refused to leave. Charlotte Morritt was among those who left Thursday, reaching that decision because of the unbearable smoke that she feared would be unhealthy for her 4-month-old son. Morritt, a journalist with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, and her son took an evacuation flight some 1,500 kilometers (950 miles) west to safety in Whitehorse, Yukon, while her partner stayed behind to monitor their property and help create firebreaks and fight fires. \"We knew it was only a matter of time,\" said Morritt, who had been following media updates and satellite images of the approaching wildfires. Air tankers dropped water and fire retardant to keep the flames from Yellowknife. A 10-kilometer (6-mile) fire line was dug, and firefighters deployed 20 kilometers (12 miles) of hose and a plethora of pumps. Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. All of British Columbia was under a state of emergency Saturday. About 35,000 people have been ordered to evacuate wildfire zones across the province and an additional 30,000 people were under an evacuation alert, meaning they should be prepared to leave, Premier David Eby announced. Eby told reporters Saturday that the situation was \"grim\" and warned that the \"situation changes very quickly.\" He said he was restricting nonessential travel to fire-affected areas to free up accommodations such as hotels, motels and campgrounds for displaced residents and firefighters. Ian Stewart and his wife made the \"anxiety producing\" decision Friday to evacuate Kelowna with their 4-year-old border collie and drive 335 kilometers (210 miles) to the British Columbia town of Clearwater. \"The smoke was really oppressive and there were big chunks of ash falling everywhere,\" he said Saturday. They packed a couple of suitcases, passports, laptop computers and dog food, and drove in bumper-to-bumper traffic to escape. A shift in the wind carried smoke and haze from British Columbia into the Seattle area on Saturday, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The Puget Sound region was just recovering from record heat, and air quality could reach unhealthy levels Saturday night through Monday, Guy said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met Friday with some of the Yellowknife evacuees who traveled south to Edmonton, Alberta, on Saturday shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: \"We've got your back.\" Trudeau praised firefighters, police, military personnel, the Red Cross and others who responded to the fires and other natural disasters this summer. \"Terrible loss, increased extreme weather events. And all through it, we've seen Canadians step up,\" he told reporters in Edmonton. Sharp reported from Portland, Maine.

But the firefighters were nowhere close to declaring victory, especially with drier and windier weather forecast for the coming days.</p><p>\"We\u2019re by no means out of the woods yet,\u201d Mike Westwick, wildfire information officer for Yellowknife, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe still have a serious situation. It\u2019s not safe to return.\u201d</p><p>The fires near Kelowna, about 90 miles (150 kilometers) north of the U.S. border, are among more than 380 blazes across the province, with 150 burning out of control, according to the Canadian Press. Another 236 fires are burning in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>At a Saturday evening news conference, Shane Thompson, the province's minister of environment and climate change, said the fires near Yellowknife had not grown very much in the past few days thanks to breaks in the weather.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to be clear, a little bit of rain doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe to come back home,\u201d he said. Others warned that incoming hot weather would make the battle more challenging.</p><p>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty encouraged residents to stay away from the town to ensure their safety and help with firefighting efforts. She assured people that patrols were monitoring the streets and homes to protect against looting.</p><p>\u201cThis fire\u2019s taking a nap. Its going to wake up and we still got a serious situation to handle here,\u201d Westwick said.</p><p>Yellowknife has been a virtual ghost town since a majority of the city\u2019s 20,000 residents started to flee following an evacuation order issued Wednesday evening, officials said. Long caravans of cars choked the main highway for days and those who couldn't take to the road lined up for emergency flights out of the city. The last 39 hospital patients were flown out Friday night on a Canadian Forces plane, officials said.</p><p>On Saturday, officials said the escape route out of Yellowknife was safe, for the time being. About 2,600 people remained, including emergency teams, firefighters, utility workers and police officers, along with some residents who refused to leave.</p><p>Charlotte Morritt was among those who left Thursday, reaching that decision because of the unbearable smoke that she feared would be unhealthy for her 4-month-old son.</p><p>Morritt, a journalist with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, and her son took an evacuation flight some 1,500 kilometers (950 miles) west to safety in Whitehorse, Yukon, while her partner stayed behind to monitor their property and help create firebreaks and fight fires.</p><p>\u201cWe knew it was only a matter of time,\u201d said Morritt, who had been following media updates and satellite images of the approaching wildfires.</p><p>Air tankers dropped water and fire retardant to keep the flames from Yellowknife.

But the firefighters were nowhere close to declaring victory, especially with drier and windier weather forecast for the coming days.</p><p>\"We\u2019re by no means out of the woods yet,\u201d Mike Westwick, wildfire information officer for Yellowknife, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe still have a serious situation. It\u2019s not safe to return.\u201d</p><p>The fires near Kelowna, about 90 miles (150 kilometers) north of the U.S. border, are among more than 380 blazes across the province, with 150 burning out of control, according to the Canadian Press. Another 236 fires are burning in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>At a Saturday evening news conference, Shane Thompson, the province's minister of environment and climate change, said the fires near Yellowknife had not grown very much in the past few days thanks to breaks in the weather.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to be clear, a little bit of rain doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe to come back home,\u201d he said. Others warned that incoming hot weather would make the battle more challenging.</p><p>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty encouraged residents to stay away from the town to ensure their safety and help with firefighting efforts. She assured people that patrols were monitoring the streets and homes to protect against looting.</p><p>\u201cThis fire\u2019s taking a nap. Its going to wake up and we still got a serious situation to handle here,\u201d Westwick said.</p><p>Yellowknife has been a virtual ghost town since a majority of the city\u2019s 20,000 residents started to flee following an evacuation order issued Wednesday evening, officials said. Long caravans of cars choked the main highway for days and those who couldn't take to the road lined up for emergency flights out of the city. The last 39 hospital patients were flown out Friday night on a Canadian Forces plane, officials said.</p><p>On Saturday, officials said the escape route out of Yellowknife was safe, for the time being. About 2,600 people remained, including emergency teams, firefighters, utility workers and police officers, along with some residents who refused to leave.</p><p>Charlotte Morritt was among those who left Thursday, reaching that decision because of the unbearable smoke that she feared would be unhealthy for her 4-month-old son.</p><p>Morritt, a journalist with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, and her son took an evacuation flight some 1,500 kilometers (950 miles) west to safety in Whitehorse, Yukon, while her partner stayed behind to monitor their property and help create firebreaks and fight fires.</p><p>\u201cWe knew it was only a matter of time,\u201d said Morritt, who had been following media updates and satellite images of the approaching wildfires.</p><p>Air tankers dropped water and fire retardant to keep the flames from Yellowknife. A 10-kilometer (6-mile) fire line was dug, and firefighters deployed 20 kilometers (12 miles) of hose and a plethora of pumps.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url></p><p>All of British Columbia was under a state of emergency Saturday. About 35,000 people have been ordered to evacuate wildfire zones across the province and an additional 30,000 people were under an evacuation alert, meaning they should be prepared to leave, Premier David Eby announced.</p><p>Eby told reporters Saturday that the situation was \u201cgrim\u201d and warned that the \u201csituation changes very quickly.\u201d</p><p>He said he was restricting non-essential travel to fire-affected areas to free up accommodations such as hotels, motels and campgrounds for displaced residents and firefighters.</p><p>Ian Stewart and his wife made the \u201canxiety producing\u201d decision Friday to evacuate Kelowna with their 4-year-old border collie and drive 335 kilometers (210 miles) to the British Columbia town of Clearwater.</p><p>\u201cThe smoke was really oppressive and there were big chunks of ash falling everywhere,\u201d he said Saturday. They packed a couple of suitcases, passports, laptop computers and dog food, and drove in bumper-to-bumper traffic to escape.</p><p>A shift in the wind carried smoke and haze from British Columbia into the Seattle area on Saturday, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The Puget Sound region was just recovering from record heat, and air air quality could reach unhealthy levels Saturday night through Monday, Guy said.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met Friday with some of the Yellowknife evacuees who traveled south to Edmonton, Alberta, on Saturday shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>Trudeau praised firefighters, police, military personnel, the Red Cross and others who responded to the fires and other natural disasters this summer.</p><p>\u201cTerrible loss, increased extreme weather events.

Meanwhile, a network of fire guards, sprinklers and water cannons was established to try to protect the city from the fire.</p><p>\"We've still got some really difficult days ahead. There's no denying that,\" Fire information officer Mike Westwick said.</p><p>Westwick told The Associated Press by phone Friday evening that the fire did not advance Friday and was still 9 miles northwest of the the city, partly because cooler temperatures created less fire activity and cleared some smoke, allowing air tankers to safely fly and drop fire retardant.</p><p>Even so, \"we've got the wrong kind of wind\" in the forecast - gusty and from the west and northwest - and no rain, he warned.</p><p>Gas stations that still had fuel were open Friday morning, though the city was virtually empty, with one grocery store, a pharmacy and a bar still open.</p><p>\"It's kind of like having a pint at the end of the world,\" said Kieron Testart, who went door-to-door in the nearby First Nation communities of Dettah and NDilo to check on people.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP)  </p><p><br/>VANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Firefighters kept wildfires at bay near the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories as well as a threatened city in British Columbia, though no one claimed victory as forecasters warned that drier and windier weather was coming. <br/>For Saturday at least, the weather was milder, providing some help for fire teams battling to contain the flames of Canada's worst fire season on record that destroyed structures, fouled the air with thick smoke and prompted evacuation orders for tens of thousands of residents. <br/>Officials said a huge wildfire again had been kept from advancing closer than 15 kilometers (9 miles) to Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories that was left virtually empty when nearly all of its 20,000 residents fled for safety. <br/>'We're by no means out of the woods yet,' Mike Westwick, wildfire information officer for the city, told The Associated Press. 'We still have a serious situation. It's not safe to return.' <br/>To the south, in British Columbia, raging flames were also kept away from Kelowna, a city of some 150,000 people about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of the United States border. <br/>The Kelowna fire is among more than 380 blazes across the province, with 150 burning out of control. The blaze near Yellowknife is one of 237 wildfires burning in the Northwest Territories. <br/>At a Saturday evening news conference, Shane Thompson, the minister of environment and climate change for the Northwest Territories, said the fires near Yellowknife had not grown very much in the past few days thanks to breaks in the weather. <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>'But I want to be clear, a little bit of rain doesn't mean it's safe to come back home,' he said. Others warned that incoming hot weather would make the battle more challenging. <br/>The McDougall Creek wildfire burns on the mountainside above a home in West Kelowna, B.C., on Friday, Aug. 18, 2023.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP)  <br/>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty encouraged residents to stay away to ensure their safety and help with firefighting efforts. She assured people that patrols were monitoring streets and homes to protect against looting. <br/>The city has become a virtual ghost town since residents fled following an evacuation order issued Wednesday evening. Long caravans of cars choked the main highway and people lined up for emergency flights to escape the blaze. The last 39 hospital patients were flown out Friday night on a Canadian Forces plane, officials said. <br/>On Saturday, officials said the escape route out of Yellowknife was safe, for the time being. About 2,600 people remained in town, including emergency teams, firefighters, utility workers and police officers, along with some residents who refused to leave. <br/>Charlotte Morritt was among those who left Thursday, reaching that decision because of the unbearable smoke that she feared would be unhealthy for her 4-month-old son. <br/>Morritt, a journalist with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, and her son took an evacuation flight some 1,500 kilometers (950 miles) west to safety in Whitehorse, Yukon, while her partner stayed behind to monitor their property and help create firebreaks and fight fires. <br/>'We knew it was only a matter of time,' said Morritt, who had been following media updates and satellite images of the approaching wildfires. <br/>Air tankers dropped water and fire retardant to keep the flames from Yellowknife. A 10-kilometer (6-mile) fire line was dug, and firefighters deployed 20 kilometers (12 miles) of hose and a plethora of pumps. <br/>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. <br/>All of British Columbia was under a state of emergency Saturday. About 35,000 people had been ordered to evacuate wildfire zones across the province and an additional 30,000 people were under an evacuation alert, meaning they should be prepared to leave, Premier David Eby announced. <br/>Eby told reporters Saturday that the situation was 'grim' and warned that the 'situation changes very quickly.' <br/>He said he was restricting non-essential travel to fire-affected areas to free up accommodations such as hotels, motels and campgrounds for displaced residents and firefighters. <br/>Ian Stewart and his wife made the 'anxiety-producing' decision Friday to evacuate Kelowna with their 4-year-old border collie and drive 335 kilometers (210 miles) to the British Columbia town of Clearwater. <br/>'The smoke was really oppressive and there were big chunks of ash falling everywhere,' he said Saturday. They packed a couple of suitcases, passports, laptop computers and dog food, and drove in bumper-to-bumper traffic to escape. <br/>A shift in the wind carried smoke and haze from British Columbia into the Seattle area on Saturday, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The Puget Sound region was just recovering from record heat, and air quality could reach unhealthy levels Saturday night through Monday, Guy said. <br/>___ <br/>Sharp reported from Portland, Maine, and Bellisle reported from Seattle. Associated Press journalist Andrea Thomas in Chicago contributed to this report. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.adn.com/nation-world/2023/08/20/firefighters-curb-blazes-threatening-2-cities-in-western-canada-but-are-not-out-of-the-woods-yet/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AKDP122734169254662227825876100073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AKDP-122734</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6909-GMN1-JCMN-Y3MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><timeReceived>3:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The trick is not to have too many false alarms because the cameras are so sensitive.\"</p><p>Wildfires result in loss of life, property and crops, as well as billions in economic costs to prevent, mitigate and suppress the damage. Yet they are notoriously difficult to rapidly detect and accurately locate at the time of ignition, when counter measures are most effective.</p><p>Combining programmable high-definition cameras and image processing software, the computerised ForestWatch\u00ae system uses a mathematical algorithm to analyse imagery of the landscape, automatically detecting changes that may be the first whiffs of smoke.<br/>When the system identifies a smoke, it alerts the human operator at a control centre.</p><p>EVS has deployed 340 camera systems so far around the world, mainly in South Africa and North America, with trials underway in Australia, Chile, China, Indonesia, Greece and Spain. These have substantially reduced commercial forest wildfire losses.</p><p>Satellite burn-scar data demonstrates that in South African regions where ForestWatch\u00ae was deployed, approximately 120,000 hectares of forest have been saved between 2014-2021. This equates to a total commercial saving of approximately \u00a31 billion in South Africa alone from 2014 to 2020.</p><p>This equates to a total commercial saving of approximately \u00a31 billion and CO2 reduction of 27 million tonnes, valued at \u00a31.2 billion, in South Africa alone in the period 2014 to 2020.</p><p>EVS USA has deployed 137 ForestWatch\u00ae systems in North America, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, California and Oregon. In North America, it is estimated that ForestWatch\u00ae systems have saved \u00a31.6 billion in timber in timber and 38 million tonnes of CO2, valued at \u00a31.9 billion in the period 2014 to 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-114454198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67TM-G3F1-JDJN-60G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"505\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 20, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001544</classCode><className>SECURITY &amp;

Democrat Rep. Tim Hernndez was appointed to the seat and is now seeking his first elected term. Serena Gonzales Gutierrez, a Democrat, won the seat in 2022 with 83% of the vote. </p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>ESPENOZA: First, I will work with the community to address issues and barriers they have encountered in dealing with existing legislation and or legislators. I will reach out to colleagues to develop a strong working relationship and I will provide an open door to encourage input from any group or individual affected by legislation being considered while I serve in office.</p><p>Second, I will propose legislation and evaluate legislation with my legal background to minimize litigation. My experience is an asset I will share to develop sound workable policy for Colorado. For me that policy will always be evaluated by taking into consideration not only the desired outcome, but the longer-term unintended consequences the policy is advancing.</p><p>Finally, my first bill is discussed below, and the second bill I hope to bring will address gun safety. I would like to provide an incentive for safe gun storage in the form of a tax credit for those who purchase a gun safe.</p><p>HERNNDEZ: My top priority is ensuring we continue to preserve fully funded public education, like we did this year for the first time in over a decade. As a teacher, I shouldn't have to rely on GoFundMes or out-of-pocket expenses to support my students. Fully funding education is an essential investment in our children\u2014 our communities depend on their growth and success. In addition to fully funded education I seek to address our housing affordability crisis by expanding tenant protections and rights, as well as, addressing gun violence in our state by passing an assault weapons ban.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>ESPENOZA: Having spent hundreds of hours talking to voters in House District 4, their greatest concerns center around: 1) the lack of affordable housing and a rapid rise in property taxes; 2) healthcare including reproductive freedom and mental health; and 3) gun safety. Regarding housing, a recurring theme is the property tax impact on fixed income seniors. Many seniors I spoke with no longer have mortgage payments with escrow accounts for their property taxes. For these individuals, taxes must be paid all at once or in two payments. With only a month notice on the actual tax that is levied for the year, payment is very difficult. I believe the burden could be mitigated by giving homeowners additional options. To assist these constituents, I would explore legislation that would spread payments over a longer time than the current options.</p><p>HERNNDEZ: When talking to community members people are always bringing up housing cost, cost of living, and fully funded schools for their children. These issues are the same issues I have as a teacher living in the Northside. I pay 60% of my income in rent just to live in the community I grew up in. I've watched my neighbors be forced out of their homes by skyrocketing costs of living. I wince at the grocery bill each time I go to the store, and I'm underpaid for the vital work I do educating the next generation. I've seen firsthand the broken state our public schools are in, and I've given up on believing I'll ever own a home. This struggle is real to me and my community and I am committed to addressing these concerns in collaboration with community stakeholders. To tackle housing, I will advocate for increased affordable housing development to make housing more accessible and strengthen tenant protections. On the issue of cost of living, I will push for policies that alleviate financial pressures on households. This includes advocating for a higher minimum wage, advancing the rights of everyone to be able to collectively bargain in their workplace, and expanding access to affordable healthcare and childcare services. </p><p>For ensuring our schools are fully funded, I could not be more dedicated to ensuring we have well paid teachers, fully funded schools, and learning conditions students can thrive in. I will advocate for increasing state funding for public education and to completely eliminate the Budget Stabilization factor, allowing schools to to reduce class sizes, improve teacher salaries, and enhance educational resources. I will also champion equitable funding models that address disparities in school funding and ensure every student receives a quality education with a funding formula based around student need, not neighborhood means.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>ESPENOZA: As noted above, housing is the number one concern raised by voters at the doors. To address the root causes, we must change land use laws, expand public/private partnerships, and incentivize the building of safe, affordable housing. We must invest in proven programs that support renters and minimize displacement; repurpose abandoned or misused buildings; and stabilize taxes to keep those on fixed incomes from being pushed into homelessness.</p><p>HERNNDEZ: The state has a role in empowering municipalities to make effective choice about land use and the development of housing. Thus, while we at the State Legislature are working to ensure municipalities have choices like municipal first right of refusal, we should also be working to expand inclusionary zoning, rent-to-own affordable units, eliminating occupancy limits, and allowing property owners to develop ADUs on their property. While increasing the housing stock is important, I also see that in order to keep communities together, we must do it lock-step with anti-gentrification and anti-displacement measures like rent control, for cause eviction, etc. The state should also play a direct role as a statewide social housing developer or empower and fund municipalities seeking to become social housing developers tasked with building high-quality, low-rent, union-labor, publicly-owned housing. If we want to close the racial and economic access gaps we see in our communities, especially in housing, then we must treat housing as a human right.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>ESPENOZA: The state's role in addressing this issue begins with recognizing that the consequences of climate change create an equity issue. Our communities of color and lower-income areas are hardest hit. The necessary preventive solutions have not been implemented, and our strategy will need to switch to mitigation. Climate change requires investments to protect the most vulnerable communities and ensure clean air and clean water for all Coloradans.</p><p>Here are three areas I would support:</p><p>Expand Colorado's renewable energy production and manufacturing to speed up a full transition to renewables</p><p>Enforce our air quality standards to protect the communities impacted by pollution, especially around our interstates and industrial areas</p><p>Fully fund our forest fire and flood prevention programs to protect communities, as well as our statewide air quality</p><p>HERNNDEZ: Holding Suncor and other polluters responsible for their harm, and requiring financial penalties, including a loss of license in the state of Colorado, to support remediation. The state also has a deep role in developing data matrixes that allow us to evaluate which communities are most deeply impacted by environmental injustice. We have mere years to reverse the climate emergency \u2014 Colorado can and must be a leader in making this reversal possible. In order to advert more severe consequences from climate change and curtail global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius we must act to fully funding the just transition plan, ensuring that all nonrenewable energy workers get high-paying, union jobs on renewable energy projects, and pass legislation that requires that the state and municipalities build publicly-owned, union-labor renewable energy projects to make up for the inaction of private energy corporations.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>ESPENOZA: A 2023 survey by The Colorado Health Foundation found the following as possible solutions to the cost of living problems people face: ' respondents suggested increasing tax credits for low-income Coloradans to address the cost of living, government investments to stimulate the economy and create better-paying jobs, and raising taxes on high-income earners \u2014 those making $500,000 or more annually \u2014 and putting those taxes toward housing, health care and education.' I agree with these suggestions.</p><p>HERNNDEZ: We must address cost-of-living concerns first by raising the minimum wage and expanding the right of all workers to unionize, and collectively bargain. Replacing the Colorado Labor Peace Act with an unapologetically pro-worker labor policy will allow more workers across the state to have the protections to collectively bargain for higher wages and better working conditions. But increasing wages solves only a portion of our community's concerns regarding cost of living \u2014 even with increased wages many tenants and homeowners face increasing costs, whether is the lack of controlling rent increases or managing a mortgage with high interest rates. Repealing the statewide ban on rent control and capping rents will allow tenants to remain in their communities longer and not have to worry about rents so quickly outpacing their income. In the short term, for homeowners we should pursue policies that protect consumers from predatory and discriminatory lending practices, while ensuring fair lending practices which can affect the terms and availability of mortgage, as well as providing more support to CHFA to provide more Coloradans with low interest mortgages. However, to truly deliver affordable housing we must treat housing as a human right, and prioritize providing quality affordable housing by developing publicly owned housing. Lastly, we must end the 30 plus year reign of TABOR that has severely limited our ability to support public services, and exacerbated income inequality in our state, by adopting a progressive tax code where people in Colorado who make or own a home over $2,000,000 pay their fair share.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>ESPENOZA: I do not.</p><p>HERNNDEZ: No, I do not. These cuts would destabilize the work we did to ensure that we balance manageable property taxes for homeowners and ensure we have fully funded schools across Colorado. While relief for property owners is a priority of mine, I disagree with an approach that puts our already underfunded schools on the chopping block to make it happen.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>ESPENOZA: I am running for this seat because I agree that democracy is on the ballot. This is the first time since 2018 that voters will vote in a contested primary to determine who they want to represent HD4. My opponent was appointed to this position by a small vacancy committee. I believe that democracy requires a determination by the electorate who should hold this seat.</p><p>In answering the importance of bipartisanship and my ability to navigate working with people who may have a different political philosophy, I would note that I have spent my entire life in rooms where no one else looked like me. I had to figure out how to navigate spaces that weren't created with women or minorities in mind, and how to be in places where others thought I didn't belong. With this experience I learned how to listen and work with others to accomplish shared goals. My goal in the legislature will be to work for the common good. With that as a framework, I am sure I can work across the aisle and with members in my own caucus who have different points of view.</p><p>HERNNDEZ: We have the strongest Democratic majority in Colorado that we have had in the last 80 years. Good governance is contextual, and in our current context, it means that rather than asking if we should work with a super-minority on the other side of the aisle we should be asking why we are not passing bills that supermajorities of our Democratic constituents are asking us to. The other side of the aisle doesn't have enough votes to govern, and they are often dedicated to ensuring that our Democratic majority struggles to govern effectively more than they are on passing good legislation that helps working people in Colorado. Bipartisanship should not be the only measure to gauge good governance. Good governance would be a super majority of Democrats being unafraid to take hard, progressive votes to enact legislation that the majority of Coloradans want.</p><p>Are there any votes the incumbent has taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?</p><p>ESPENOZA: I have not studied the votes of my opponent. However, I intend to introduce bills that are legally sound and substantive, which address the concerns of my constituents.</p><p>What is one bill, vote or other legislative action you've taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?</p><p>HERNNDEZ: As the first legislator in history to pass the assault weapons ban through the Colorado house, I look forward to returning to the statehouse to find common ground solutions to pass an assault weapons ban and advocate for data-driven approaches to prevent gun violence by investing in solutions in our community needs like housing, education, and high-paying union jobs.</p><p>House District 6</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.camachoforcolorado.com/\">Sean Camacho</url></p><p>Age: 40</p><p>City of residence: Denver</p><p>Occupation: Attorney</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elisabethepps.com/\">Elisabeth Epps</url></p><p>City of residence: Denver</p><p>Occupation: State representative</p><p>House District 6 comprises parts of Capitol Hill, Congress Park, Montclair and Lowry. Rep. Elisabeth Epps, a Democrat, won the seat in 2022 with about 86% of the vote. </p><p>Epps did not submit a survey response.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>CAMACHO: My number one focus is increasing the supply of housing at all price points. My other top priorities are lowering our cost of living and protecting our land, air, and water. These three issues are the most pressing, consequential, and long-term issues facing Colorado.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>CAMACHO: While engaging with community members on the campaign trail and in my personal life, I have learned that there are many issues considered top priority depending on the voter, family, and neighborhood. I can confidently say housing is the top priority for many HD6 residents; however, I frequently hear strong concerns about our education system, the climate crisis, Denver's cost of living, and protecting reproductive freedoms. So, it is difficult to narrow it down to a single issue. I plan to consult with constituents, subject matter experts, interested groups, and colleagues when creating legislation for each critical issue.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>CAMACHO: We are not going to solve this issue without state involvement. The housing shortage is too vast for the private sector and municipalities to solve alone. While I recognize that a community's needs vary by municipality and region, the state needs to take an active role in ensuring that steps are being taken across the state, especially in Denver, to increase the availability of affordable housing options.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>CAMACHO: We are in a race against time to do our part to mitigate the damage from climate change. The state is essential to ensuring Colorado completes its transition to complete sustainability. The cost of moving to green energy and sustainability will require state resources and partnerships to adopt sustainable practices and infrastructure that will protect Colorado's land, air, and water. My ideas to address climate change include increasing state investment in renewable energy; providing tax incentives to both businesses and individuals who modernize their vehicles and utilities; incentivizing private-sector investment in large-scale renewable energy infrastructure and technologies; expanding our public transit system so fewer people need to drive personal vehicles every day; and working with conservation scientists to regrow lost forests and promote biodiversity to keep Colorado's natural splendor.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>CAMACHO: We need strong action to modernize our land use laws, build affordable housing, and stabilize taxes for those on fixed incomes so that rising property values do not create further housing insecurity. Colorado must also pursue long-term solutions to help prepare our workforce for a changing world. Educational, apprenticeship, and training opportunities that set Coloradans up for high-quality jobs that present opportunities for growth and development will be key to alleviating the high cost of living. Additionally, I am a strong proponent of metro transportation. Gas, insurance, routine maintenance, and loan repayments are expensive and take a financial toll on Coloradans. I see well-functioning public transportation systems as one tool to save Coloradans time and money.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>CAMACHO: I have serious concerns that deeper property tax cuts through ballot measures will devastate K-12, higher education, and the vital services Coloradans depend upon. The legislature can continue to work to find a solution to rising property taxes that provides relief for Coloradans and maintains the funding we need to fund our future.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>CAMACHO: There are always opportunities for bipartisan cooperation. Citizens elect candidates to public office, regardless of party, with the hope that they will fight for issues and policies that can create lasting positive change for the most significant issues facing our state. That type of change cannot happen without bipartisan cooperation, and I intend to work with anyone willing to help deliver bold and positive change for HD6 and Colorado.</p><p>Are there any votes the incumbent has taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?</p><p>CAMACHO: There are several instances where I would have voted differently from the incumbent. One instance that stands out is voting for the Democratic budget at every opportunity. This year's budget made significant investments in education, affordable housing, reducing healthcare costs, workforce development, and many other issues that showcase democratic values. I would never have passed up an opportunity to vote to fund these important priorities for our state.</p><p>House District 10</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.junie4colorado.com/\">Junie Joseph</url></p><p>Age: 39</p><p>City of residence: Boulder</p><p>Occupation: State representative</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.friendsoftinamueh.org/\">Tina Mueh</url></p><p>Age: 57</p><p>City of residence: Boulder</p><p>Occupation: Retired middle school science teacher</p><p>House District 10 is centered in the city of Boulder. Rep. Junie Joseph, a Democrat, won the seat with 88% of the vote in 2022. She was appointed to the Democratic nomination that year after former Rep. Edie Hooton withdrew. </p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>JOSEPH: During my first term as House District 10 Representative, I passed 36 bills covering a wide range of crucial topics. These bills, which included pioneering measures such as statewide incentives for decarbonization, a first-in-the-nation e-bike tax credit, and facilitation of licensure for Spanish-speaking childcare providers, were a testament to the power of collaboration and shared vision.</p><p>One of the most fulfilling aspects of my legislative work has been turning the ideas and concerns of my constituents into policies that bring tangible improvements to our community. A prime example is the successful expansion of tax benefits to individuals 55 and older who rely on federal Social Security benefits. This initiative, driven by the needs of Boulderites, received overwhelming bipartisan support, bringing tax relief to many low-income members of our community.</p><p>In 2023, I spearheaded an eviction protection bill, <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb23-1120\">HB23-1120, which stands as pioneering state law by providing individuals on public assistance with extended mediation opportunities and a 30-day waiting period before facing eviction, mitigating the adverse impacts of sudden homelessness. Similarly, my commitment to equitable access to justice is exemplified through </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1286\">HB24-1286, which establishes an Equal Justice Authority to oversee a fund doubling the resources available for legal aid to low-income individuals and families in Colorado. This proactive measure ensures that economic status does not determine one's access to a fair legal system.</url></p><p>MUEH: Public education, climate action, and affordability for workers and families.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>JOSEPH: The biggest issues that are concerning to Community members in Boulder House District 10 are 1) Housing, 2) Public Safety/Homelessness, and 3) environment. House District 10 residents can trust my track record and expect me to remain steadfast in my commitment to environmental sustainability, affordable/attainable housing, and social justice. </p><p>With housing costs continuing to be out of reach for many residents of HD10, affordability in Boulder and across the state is a top priority. I will continue to tackle both the symptoms and the underlying issues. I will advocate for policies focusing on rent stabilization and addressing the interconnected challenges of high housing, childcare, and healthcare expenses. I will continue supporting initiatives that boost economic opportunities, enhance workforce development, and promote affordable housing options.</p><p>My goals for addressing homelessness in Boulder and the Denver Metro area involve more than emergency responses to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. We need comprehensive programs that keep people housed via emergency rental and financial assistance, transitional housing options for people recovering from addiction or mental illness, and permanent supportive housing initiatives for those who need long-term support. Recognizing the unique challenges faced by vulnerable populations, such as foster youth aging out of the system, I will advocate for tailored behavioral health services and transition programs to facilitate stable housing and holistic well-being.</p><p>My personal passion for promoting decarbonization and sustainable practices is a driving force behind my initiatives. I will prioritize actions to combat climate change and protect the environment, pushing for legislation that promotes sustainable and renewable energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and enhances our cities and state's resilience to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>MUEH: Housing and homelessness differ, but there's intersection, so both are part of Boulder's biggest issue. The cost of housing in HD10 is high, and a sizable percentage of people who work or study here can't live here. Many people live in communities outside of Boulder, which is not ideal for many reasons, including increased vehicle dependency, traffic, and associated pollution. Others living here on the economic edge can become unhoused as market trends intensify, and we also have hundreds of people at any given time in Boulder who are unhoused for other reasons, including mental health challenges and substance use issues. This is a humanitarian problem for unhoused individuals who deal with the hardships of living outdoors. Unregulated encampments and unchecked criminal behaviors pose safety concerns to both unhoused people and community members.</p><p>While local governments must play a role, the state government should devote more resources to incentivize permanently affordable housing solutions. I don't believe that the unregulated market will produce the needed amount of affordable housing for low- and middle-income workers and families without specific affordability requirements. Additionally, I'd advocate for state resources for treatment and needed services, including housing or shelter, for our unhoused population.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>JOSEPH: The state plays a crucial role in ensuring economic strength, which relies on a robust workforce. Access to housing is key to nurturing this workforce. Thus, land use is both a state and local concern. While the state sets mandates, local communities are experts on their land use needs. It's vital for the state to collaborate closely with local governments to ensure that mandates are practical and actionable. This partnership ensures effective legislation that truly serves the community's needs.</p><p>Land use changes are not enough. We must do more to ensure the community stays housed. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, housing instability encompasses a number of challenges, including trouble paying rent, overcrowding, moving frequently, or spending the bulk of household income on housing. These experiences negatively affect physical health and make it harder to access health care. Consequently, in order to ensure the stability of those living on the margins in our community we must continue the work to ensure access to attainable housing for all. </p><p>MUEH: I would prefer the state provide guardrails and take a supportive role to address affordable housing, rather than prescribing specifics to communities. Density can certainly increase housing supply, but it will take funding or subsidies to ensure affordability, along with real policy requirements that some new housing be affordable. The state used federal funding through its Affordable Housing Transformational Task Force efforts, and state voters passed Proposition 123 to create long-term state funding for affordable housing. These types of revenue sources can produce actual tangible affordable housing, not just theoretical concepts.</p><p>I'm not trying to demonize private sector developers \u2014 their prices must meet expenses, provide fair wages, maintain building quality, and be profitable \u2014 so the market won't solve this problem without some government involvement. The cost of land is a huge expense in housing, so I'm in favor of more public landownership to take some land out of the private market where it typically appreciates. It seems Colorado is going to continue to grow, and the state will certainly need more housing if we keep growing, but there is room for local process so people in a community can provide reasonable input.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>JOSEPH: Cities and states each have their roles in educating and serving their communities. While cities are closest to the people and can educate on local issues, the state has the power to enact laws that affect everyone. Climate change, for example, impacts us all, as shown by alarming pollution levels across Colorado. We can't rely solely on local efforts to combat this global issue. Instead, state legislation can enforce change statewide, making the state Legislature our best tool for impactful environmental action.</p><p>MUEH: Mitigating the effects of climate change means we must at least prepare to minimize damage from wildfires or flooding, plus plan to ensure adequate water supplies. I will obviously support high-quality bills to do these things, and I know previous General Assemblies have passed many such bills.</p><p>Public safety has to be our top concern, but there are issues associated with disasters like wildfire, including air pollution, potential for erosion, short- or medium-term homelessness, and skyrocketing property insurance costs. So it's important to mitigate, but it's also important to minimize climate change-causing greenhouse gas emissions. Colorado should work to decarbonize its electric portfolio, and I support investigating Community Choice Energy to allow localities to increase the renewables in their energy source mix through provider competition.</p><p>For transportation, we should pursue more transit with dependable frequencies, moving away from fossil fuel powered vehicles, designing cities to be more favorable for walking or biking, and making sure more people can live near where they work or go to school. I very much enjoyed teaching my middle school science students about climate issues, and I support that outreach to Colorado adults too so we can better understand our climate footprints and take action.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>JOSEPH: The Legislature holds the key to effectively alleviating cost-of-living burdens for Coloradans of diverse backgrounds, irrespective of income levels or housing arrangements. This can be achieved through a multifaceted approach. The legislature must 1) continue to prioritize affordable housing initiatives, ensuring that every individual and family has access to safe and affordable housing options, 2) work with businesses to secure a livable wage for workers and implement robust wage theft protections to safeguard the rights and financial well-being of all workers across the state, 3) improve access to healthcare for all residents, guaranteeing that medical services are accessible and affordable, regardless of socioeconomic status 4) provide tax incentives for essential goods and services, as well as providing relief from property taxes, thereby lightening the financial burden on households.</p><p>MUEH: First, although many approach affordability from a how-do-we-reduce-costs angle, I see Colorado's lack of collective bargaining rights for many as integral to the problem. I support and will advocate for collective bargaining and organized labor as pathways to improved standard of living for workers and families throughout our state. As with the housing question above, we can't forget that the private sector typically owns and sets prices for items that contribute to high costs of living. The state government can make dents in this problem through things like targeted subsidies, grant awards, safety net programs, or tax credits.</p><p>I do support moving toward some type of rent limitation because so many Coloradans are paying too high a percentage of their income toward rent. It's a gigantic societal problem because high rent leaves people with less money available for other needs, which are probably also increasing in price. We might attempt to repeal or amend Colorado rent control law, or look at differences between 'rent caps' and rent stabilization, housing assistance subsidies, or allowing localized rent policy. Property tax limitations might also help both homeowners and renters, since landlords typically pass the cost of property taxes on to their renters.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>JOSEPH: I am committed to bipartisan efforts and collaboration in the legislative process. However, I cannot support any ballot initiatives that seek to override the progress achieved through the collaborative efforts of both branches of government: the legislature and the executive. We have made significant strides, particularly regarding property taxes, through bipartisan cooperation this year, and I will continue to advocate for and uphold these policies.</p><p>Furthermore, I am dedicated to informing the Boulder community about any hostile measures that aim to undermine the positive work we have accomplished, particularly in areas such as education, property and income taxes. It is essential that we remain vigilant in protecting the progress we have made for the benefit of all Coloradans.</p><p>MUEH: I absolutely understand that property tax bills can be a serious problem for certain Coloradans, but oppose what are now known as Initiatives 50 and 108. With 108, the fiscal analysis suggests that local governments will lose around $3 billion in property tax revenues, but the state government will be on the hook to backfill $2.25 billion out of that \u2014 and possibly more in future years. If 50 passes, statewide voter approval will be needed for local governments to retain tax revenue above 4% increases in a given year. My experience with statewide TABOR-related ballot measures suggests that voters will likely strike down measures if values increase more than 4%, even if revenue would go toward beneficial uses.</p><p>I'm a long-time educator, and property tax revenues primarily fund school districts, county governments, and special districts. I thought this year's legislative <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233 was a better proposal \u2014 limiting tax rates but with much more detail, less impact on a state government that has needs of its own, and more respect for revenue needs of school districts. The legislature can continue to properly address property tax issues in the future, unless they're tied to rates or limitations through these or similar initiatives.</url></p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>JOSEPH: As a Democrat representing my district, I am committed to bipartisanship because it's essential to effectively serve all constituents, regardless of party affiliation. I firmly believe that representing both Democrats and Republicans in my district requires collaboration across the aisle. However, I will never compromise or undermine our core democratic values in pursuit of bipartisanship.</p><p>Today's voters are weary of political theatrics and polarization. They yearn for a legislature where meaningful work gets done without unnecessary fanfare. Community members want to feel genuinely heard, knowing that their concerns are being addressed. Bipartisanship plays a crucial role in fostering this sense of inclusivity and ensuring that diverse voices are represented in the decision-making process.</p><p>I take pride in my track record of passing bipartisan legislation and will continue to prioritize collaboration as a means of achieving tangible results for the people I represent.</p><p>MUEH: There are hot-button issues like reproductive rights or assault weapons for which common ground is tough to find, but most state issues don't have to be that hyperpartisan. Even with tax policy, there is plenty of ground between the most extreme anti-taxers and people who would like extremely high taxes on the wealthy. With a bipartisan approach, you can deliberate and find the solutions somewhere in the middle that work the best for the most people. I don't think 'bipartisan' has to mean surrendering on core values, and I will listen with curiosity and interest to thoughtful points from across the aisle.</p><p>Even if I, or another legislator, strongly supports or opposes a given bill, opposing points can lead to amendments that make a bill better and fairer. In Colorado and many U.S. states, rural areas might lean Republican while urban areas lean Democratic (grossly generalized). Rural residents naturally understand rural issues better than urbanites, so their detailed input will be valuable to me no matter their political party. This idea of listening closely to people with lived experience and deep understanding of a particular issue, regardless of party affiliation, is an important part of representing and leading.</p><p>What is one bill, vote or other legislative action you've taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?</p><p>JOSEPH: As a Boulder representative I'm proud to say that I supported the new 'hands-free' law, which prohibits Colorado drivers from using their cellphones while driving. This legislation was a no-brainer for me because it aligns perfectly with our community's strong commitment to prioritizing biking over driving. By prohibiting cell phone use while driving, we're taking important steps to ensure the safety of cyclists on our roads, and I stand firmly with all Boulder cyclists in advocating for their right to feel safe while biking around our city.</p><p>Additionally, I championed a bill aimed at overhauling our state's organic waste management system. This decision was driven by my deep understanding of the urgent need to address climate change. I firmly believe that in order to make meaningful progress towards our climate sustainability goals, we must work together to decarbonize our state. By taking action at the legislative level, I am actively contributing to efforts to create a cleaner, greener future for Boulder and beyond.</p><p>I am fully committed to representing the values of our Boulder community in my legislative efforts. It's essential to me that our voices are heard and that our priorities are reflected in the decisions made at the state level. I am grateful to the Boulder community for entrusting me with this responsibility, and I look forward to continuing to advocate for our community's values in the legislature. </p><p>Are there any votes the incumbent has taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?</p><p>MUEH: Rep. Joseph voted to allow a divisive third-reading amendment during the 2023 special session, which would have inserted language into a simple bill providing food assistance to students from low-income families. The amendment would have disallowed use of federal grant money for food products from the West Bank or Gaza. I would have voted against allowing this amendment, as did most legislators, which was pretty clearly a political stunt that posed a threat to an important effort to feed Colorado kids.</p><p>Secondly, she had seemingly decided to vote for <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1448\">HB24-1448, a school finance revision, before consulting with local school officials from her school district. The bill would have taken funding from Boulder Valley schools and reallocated it to other districts, and a number of local school officials told Rep. Joseph just that during a late-session town hall meeting. The bill passed, but about 15 Democrats voted 'no,' and I would have joined them unless it were amended in ways that wouldn't cost our local schools and students. Legislators can't always agree with everyone in their districts, but they should reach out to or listen to relevant elected officials on issues that could affect them.</url></p><p>House District 30</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kyraforcolorado.com/\">Kyra deGruy Kennedy</url></p><p>Age: 34</p><p>City of residence: Lakewood</p><p>Occupation: Nonprofit executive director</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rebekahforcolorado.com/\">Rebekah Stewart</url></p><p>Age: 38</p><p>City of residence: Lakewood</p><p>Occupation: Lakewood city councilor, Ward 3</p><p>House District 30 is based in Lakewood. Rep. Chris deGruy Kennedy, who is married to Kyra deGruy Kennedy, currently represents the district and is term-limited. He won the seat with 66% of the vote in 2022.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>DEGRUY KENNEDY: There are so many, but I'll highlight climate change, gun violence prevention, and building a health system that truly helps people thrive. We've made good progress in Colorado reducing fossil fuel use and establishing carbon pollution limits for heavy industry, but we must ensure we implement these policies while accelerating the electrification of buildings and vehicles. We've been a national leader on gun violence prevention laws since 2013, but we still need to ban assault weapons, enforce waiting periods and age limits, and significantly increase our investment in mental health. Our health systems are too fragmented and too expensive \u2014 we spend more than almost every other country and have worse health outcomes.</p><p>The organization I run (Co-Thrive) is funding communities across Colorado to build advanced systems of collaboration between community leadership, healthcare, public health, environmental health, and all the social services a person needs to thrive, and we're watching people get healthier and happier while saving money to taxpayer systems. Protecting access to abortion care and contraception is also a huge priority, which is why I helped pass the bill codifying abortion in Colorado and am supporting the constitutional amendment on this November's ballot.</p><p>STEWART:</p><p>Housing affordability and availability, particularly access to affordable home ownership opportunities.</p><p>Increasing mental health support for people who need it, particularly kids in schools.</p><p>Supporting living wages for educators and government healthcare providers for attracting and retaining such essential workers.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>DEGRUY KENNEDY: While some issues come and go, public education has been a top Jeffco priority as long as I've been involved. I was proud to play a leadership role in the passage of the 2018 mill and bond ballot measures, which secured meaningful funding for our schools, and I'm proud of the legislature for finally paying off the BS factor this session. But the reality is that Colorado is still one of the worst states for education funding, and we must do better. Our teachers and education support professionals often can't even afford to live in the communities where they work, which has made it hard to attract and retain enough great teachers and keep class sizes small.</p><p>I believe Colorado's flat income tax is a big part of the problem, and I'm committed to restoring a progressive income tax, like we had before 1986. Big corporations and the wealthiest Coloradans should pay their fair share so we can fully fund our education, health, and social service systems, giving every Coloradan, regardless of your zip code or socioeconomic status, the opportunity to thrive.</p><p>Editor's note: The BS factor refers to the budget stabilization factor, which is the amount of money that lawmakers owed schools based on a funding formula, but choose not to prioritize.</p><p>STEWART: Housing affordability and continuing to combat the effects of climate change are the two issues I hear most from people when I'm knocking on doors. Here in Lakewood, I think we've built a really good model for cross-governmental collaboration with local nonprofits to best serve our neighbors experiencing homelessness. I see this as part of our broader housing affordability conversation. I'd like to see a more statewide/regional approach and collaboration similar to what we're doing in our city to serve people and address comprehensive supports like healthcare, employment support, and recovery resources.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>DEGRUY KENNEDY: While it makes sense for local governments to make most land use decisions, the massive shortage of affordable housing units in Colorado has increasingly made housing a statewide concern. Certain factions within city councils have pulled out all the stops to block the construction of new affordable housing, which have exacerbated housing pressures in neighboring cities. The state legislature was right to step in and pass legislation to pressure and incentivize local governments to upzone, especially around transit hubs and corridors. It doesn't make sense to push for high density housing everywhere, like the unfortunate proposed development near Belmar Park. That said, there are certain parts of my district that are perfect for multifamily housing, like the West Colfax corridor. And if we can push for more housing there, we can also attract new grocery stores, restaurants, and retail in a way that improves the quality of life for our current residents, too.</p><p>STEWART: My biggest focus when it comes to affordable housing, is affordable first time home ownership. We need to be focusing on building multifamily options like affordable townhomes and condos. I have personally experienced the high demand and low supply available to first time homebuyers. We lost out on eight offers before finally being able to purchase our townhome, and that was over six years ago. This issue just continues to get worse because of our lack of supply. We have to start having sincere and realistic policy conversations that will ensure that we're building these types of housing options so more working families can afford to own a home and build generational wealth.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>DEGRUY KENNEDY: The state has an incredibly significant role in addressing climate change from regulating oil and gas and our public utilities to making it easier for homeowners to install solar panels or join community solar or wind programs. So much work has been done since Governor Bill Ritter made climate a state priority nearly 17 years ago, but I've seen the way that the oil and gas industry has fought tooth and nail to maintain their profits. This session, when legislators proposed a robust package of legislation to address our poor air quality, the industry filed ballot measures and threatened to spend millions passing measures to undermine all of the state's progress on climate and air pollution. It is shameful that corporations have so much power that they can undermine the efforts of those who were duly elected by the people of Colorado.</p><p>I'm the only candidate in the HD30 race who is refusing campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry, whereas my Democratic primary opponent has accepted donations from 12 different oil and gas lobbyists. Voters can count on me to always put their clean air and clean water ahead of corporate profits.</p><p>STEWART: When it comes to climate change, one of the areas I've focused on locally is water conservation. Forty percent of municipal water usage is spent on residential landscaping, so I've helped create residential landscaping reduction programs that draw down state dollars and I am looking forward to continuing that work at the state Legislature.</p><p>We've also created an innovative sustainable development menu for new construction with evidence-based options that developers can choose from to build more sustainably, whether it be electrification, universal design, affordability, water/energy efficiency, tree canopy investment, etc. I'm excited for the opportunity to take ideas we've successfully implemented locally and explore ways to do that on a larger scale.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>DEGRUY KENNEDY: The reality is that the high cost of living hits lower and middle income families much harder, whereas there are many Coloradans who are doing just fine. That's why across-the-board tax cuts are not the best solutions. Rather, we should use targeted tax credits like the EITC and child tax credit to help more families with the high costs of housing, child care, and higher education.</p><p>When it comes to housing, there just aren't enough homes for all the people who live here. That imbalance of supply and demand has driven up rents and home prices. State tax credits to support affordable housing are critical to helping our local housing authorities build more affordable units, and we should continue to prioritize affordable housing (that is actually affordable) near bus lines and light rail stations.</p><p>In my work with Co-Thrive, we're seeing that when we do things differently and actually meet the needs of the folks in our communities, costs are lower for both the individual and the taxpayer system. So in addition to meeting the acute needs of Coloradans through tax policies, I'm committed to redesigning our systems to work more efficiently and effectively for folks with the highest needs.</p><p>STEWART: I am very thankful that we recently increased statewide child tax credits to support folks who are deeply affected by the increasing cost of living. The most important thing to keep in mind is that any proposed solution is looked at from an equity standpoint. For example, when we're talking about property taxes, how are we going to support renters and non-owners in those policy decisions and how do funding changes affect our school and fire districts? It's really critical that we do our best to ensure that every voice is at the table in these discussions so we have the best outcomes. </p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>DEGRUY KENNEDY: No. <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233 was a huge bipartisan success and will give every homeowner a new homestead exemption on their local government property taxes of 10% of the first $700,000 of value, while also protecting funding for K-12 education. The proposed ballot measures are reckless and would deliver deeper property tax cuts at the expense of our schools, fire districts, libraries, and child welfare offices. That's not a good outcome.</url></p><p>It's also important to note that local governments can still lower property taxes on their own, and that the state legislature passed a number of important income tax credits to help families, seniors, and all hardworking Coloradans afford the high cost of living in Colorado.</p><p>STEWART: I know property taxes have been painful for a lot of folks, particularly homeowners on fixed incomes. My biggest concern with deep cuts in this area is how they will affect our already underfunded school districts, keep our fire districts running so they can protect our communities, and even our local business improvement districts' ability to provide support for small businesses. I'd prefer we stick with the hard work that was done in the legislature in order to not cause unintentional harm by the effects of deeper cuts at this point in time.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>DEGRUY KENNEDY: What most people don't know is that there is a ton of bipartisanship at the state Legislature. In my time advocating at the Capitol through my work with MSU Denver and Young Invincibles, I worked with members of both parties all the time.</p><p>We can learn a lot by listening to different perspectives, and that legislation can be made better if we make real efforts to find bipartisanship. Coming from the bible belt in Mobile, Alabama, I'm a bit of a unicorn progressive, in that I have family and friends who are Republican that I respect deeply.</p><p>I also believe there are certain issues where finding bipartisanship is nearly impossible, like protecting abortion rights, fighting climate change, and making it harder for people to access high-powered weapons that make mass shootings more deadly. And in those cases, I will always stand up for my daughter's future.</p><p>STEWART: This was such an important lesson to learn and I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to learn it early on in my time as an elected official. Following my election to the Lakewood City Council, I immediately began work on an affordable housing policy that I had run on during the campaign. The measure I was proposing was aggressive and was going to take a lot to get passed. It was suggested I call another colleague (whose views on the matter were pretty opposite of mine) to discuss, and I did. We ended up working together to craft legislation that ended up moving the needle significantly AND also received a bipartisan supermajority of support on the vote. I could not have done that on my own. What we passed was significantly better than what I had initially wanted to do and received absolutely zero pushback from council or the community when it passed. It's an incredibly valuable lesson that I take with me and informs the way I approach governing now.</p><p>House District 31</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.juliamarvin.com/\">Julia Marvin</url></p><p>Age: 37</p><p>City of residence: Thornton</p><p>Occupation: State representative</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jacquephillipsforstaterep.com/\">Jacqueline 'Jacque' Phillips</url></p><p>Age: 61</p><p>City of residence: Thornton</p><p>Occupation: Attorney</p><p>House District 31 includes Thornton and extends northeast to Henderson. Rep. Julia Marvin, a Democrat, was appointed to the seat this year via a vacancy committee after former Rep. Said Sharbini stepped down. Sharbini won the seat with 59% of the vote in 2022.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>MARVIN: If elected, my top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session would be:</p><p>Affordable housing: I will advocate for policies that continue to address the housing crisis by increasing affordable housing options for both renters and homeowners. This includes supporting initiatives to develop more affordable housing units, bring down costs for renters, and expanding assistance programs for first-time homebuyers.</p><p>Reproductive rights and healthcare: I am committed to expanding access to reproductive healthcare services and protecting reproductive rights for all individuals. This includes ensuring access to contraception and abortion services, and fighting against any attempts to restrict reproductive rights.</p><p>Mental health issues: I will prioritize efforts to improve access to mental healthcare services and support initiatives that destigmatize mental illness. This includes increasing funding for mental health programs, expanding access to mental healthcare providers, and promoting mental wellness education and awareness campaigns in our communities.</p><p>PHILLIPS: I have spent decades as an education rights attorney to help guarantee our next generation's right to a quality, safe education. I will work tirelessly to ensure that every child in Colorado has access to the top-tier education they deserve, regardless of their background or abilities. My extensive experience as a special education attorney and educator has shown me the importance of \u2014 and winning strategies for \u2014 addressing the needs of students with disabilities and those from underrepresented communities. I will push for policies that close the achievement gap and provide adequate resources to schools to provide a best-in-class education, attract great teacher talent, and support our next generation of Colorado leaders.</p><p>Secondly, protecting women's rights is crucial, especially in the current climate where these rights are under attack across the nation. I will advocate for comprehensive reproductive health care, including access to safe and legal abortion services.</p><p>Lastly, promoting economic justice for working people is my campaign's heart and soul. I understand the struggles of working-class families, having been a single mother who worked her way through college and law school while supporting her child. I will work to pass legislation that supports fair wages, workers' rights, and equitable opportunities for all. This includes pushing for criminal justice reforms that address systemic inequalities and expanding the value and strength of unions in Colorado who advocate for their working professionals who keep Colorado moving forward.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>MARVIN: Residents in my district frequently express concerns about the high cost of living. It's a significant issue affecting working families and seniors alike. To address this, I support measures that tackle the root causes and provide immediate relief. This legislative session, we passed several initiatives aimed at alleviating financial burdens.</p><p>We introduced and expanded tax credits for working families, ensuring they have more money in their pockets. For seniors, we passed property tax exemptions and increased program funding to help manage rising costs. Additionally, we focused on affordable housing by promoting developments near transit hubs and reducing regulatory barriers for accessory dwelling units. These measures, combined with my ongoing commitment to funding education, supporting workers and small businesses, and improving access to affordable healthcare, demonstrate my dedication to making life more affordable for everyone in our community.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Residents in my district have consistently identified affordable housing as the community's biggest issue. The rising cost of living and housing prices have made it difficult for many families to secure stable and affordable homes. As your next representative, I will work to address this by advocating for policies that increase the availability of attainable, high quality housing and promote sustainable development.</p><p>One of my strategies will be to support legislation that reduces the barriers to condo and multi-unit housing construction. We have an entire generation of Coloradans who need homes and you can count the number of condo developers willing to engage with Colorado \u2014 one of the fastest growing states in the country \u2014 on one hand. We need better-funded mixed-income housing programs and to ensure that we don't develop homes only for the richest Coloradans, making it harder for middle class families who are the backbone of our state to thrive. Additionally, I will push for funding and support for programs that assist first-time homebuyers, making it easier for families to enter the housing market.</p><p>Another critical aspect of addressing this issue is protecting renters' rights. I will ensure that residents can stay in their homes without fear of sudden displacement and that as Colorado grows, we reverse the tendency for our working families to have to move further and further from their places of work, increasing their commute and decreasing time for their families.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>MARVIN: The state has a crucial role in addressing the affordable housing crisis by enacting laws that promote increased development and density, especially near transit corridors. This year, several key land-use bills were passed to drive down housing costs and enhance connectivity. For instance, <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1313\">House Bill 24-1313 requires local governments to zone for higher density near bus and rail stops, incentivizing affordable housing projects. Additionally, </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1152\">House Bill 24-1152 allows for accessory dwelling units, providing more flexibility in housing options. These measures aim to balance state objectives with local control, ensuring that while overarching guidelines are set, municipalities retain the ability to adapt these policies to their unique circumstances.</url></p><p>However, it is essential to strike a balance between state mandates and local autonomy. While statewide legislation can set the framework for increased housing density and transit-oriented development, local governments must have the flexibility to implement these changes in ways that suit their specific needs and infrastructure capacities. The amendments made to <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1313\">House Bill 1313, which removed punitive measures, exemplify this balanced approach. By collaborating with local authorities and respecting their input, we can effectively address the housing crisis while maintaining the character and needs of our diverse communities.</url></p><p>PHILLIPS: The state legislature has a crucial role in supporting housing development and density to address our affordable housing stock issue. Firstly, the state can provide strategic support to local governments and developers to encourage the construction of units which address the many different types of housing needs in Colorado. This includes grants, enhanced support for planning and permitting, and low-interest loans that make it financially viable for developers to build quality, attainable housing.</p><p>Secondly, the state must play a role in streamlining the regulatory process for housing development. By reducing bureaucratic red tape and clarifying approval processes for affordable housing projects, the state can help ensure that these projects move forward more quickly and efficiently. This also involves updating zoning laws to allow for higher density developments in areas where it makes sense, such as near public transportation hubs and urban centers. This requires a more effective partnership with our transit authorities.</p><p>Additionally, the state can support the development of mixed-use communities that combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. This approach not only addresses the need for affordable housing but also promotes sustainable and vibrant communities.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>MARVIN: The state plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change, and I am committed to advancing policies that address this urgent issue. My legislative focus includes expanding clean and renewable energy, funding affordable transportation options, implementing land use reforms to support greener and more affordable housing, and enforcing stricter air quality standards. This includes supporting bills like <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-229\">SB24-229 and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-230\">SB24-230, which enhance emissions controls and generate funds to mitigate fossil fuel impacts.</url></p><p>Additionally, water conservation is a top priority, given our severe drought conditions. Cooperative efforts with other states and bold actions to protect our water resources are essential. Ensuring that environmental policies prioritize the health and safety of all communities, especially those disproportionately impacted, is fundamental to creating a sustainable and equitable future for all Coloradans.</p><p>PHILLIPS: The state must lead by example in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy sources. This includes setting ambitious targets for carbon neutral energy generation and investing in clean energy infrastructure such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Critically, this includes supporting the continued training and skill development of the more than 300,000 Coloradans who work in the energy industry, many of whom are right in my own House District. In our fight against climate change and efforts to improve sustainability statewide, we must ensure we do not forget our residents who are just trying to keep the lights on \u2014 both theirs, and ours.</p><p>Another critical area is the protection of natural habitats and greenspaces here in Colorado that act as carbon sinks. I will advocate for policies that promote sustainable land use practices and conservation efforts to preserve these vital areas and help residents access them for recreation,</p><p>Additionally, Colorado must invest in climate resilience infrastructure to protect our communities from the impacts of climate change. This includes improving water management systems, enhancing emergency response capabilities, and supporting community-based adaptation projects. In particular, we must seek advanced fire prevention and response efforts to avoid future catastrophes like the nearby Marshall Fire of 2021 which caused over $500,000,000 in damage and at least three deaths.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>MARVIN: We need to implement a comprehensive approach that targets various aspects of affordability. This includes measures to increase wages and employment opportunities, reduce housing costs, provide affordable healthcare, and lower the burden of everyday expenses such as childcare and transportation.</p><p>To address housing affordability, the Legislature can support policies that promote the construction of affordable housing units and incentivize landlords to maintain reasonable rent prices. Additionally, initiatives to expand homeownership opportunities, such as down payment assistance programs, can help make owning a home more accessible.</p><p>For renters, implementing stronger tenant protections, can provide stability and security. Furthermore, investing in public transportation infrastructure and affordable childcare options can alleviate the financial strain on families and individuals, making it easier to afford basic necessities.</p><p>By taking a multifaceted approach that considers the needs of all residents, regardless of income level or housing status, the Legislature can make meaningful strides towards addressing cost-of-living concerns and improving the overall quality of life for Coloradans.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Firstly, increasing the availability of high-quality, attainable housing is paramount. This involves supporting the development of more affordable housing units, providing rental assistance programs, and supporting Colorado renters to add confidence and clarity to their cost of living.</p><p>Secondly, we must significantly expand access to apprenticeship and job training programs in Colorado to more effectively address the wage gap between our low-income and middle-income households. When we help Colorado's workforce develop professional and trades skills, not only do we elevate thousands of Coloradans' access to durable, well-paying careers and expand our middle class, but families can more easily afford life beyond the basic necessities. This virtuous cycle helps Colorado's economy fill the gaps in many of our professional trades which can make getting quality plumbing, HVAC, and automotive services difficult.</p><p>The Legislature must also address the cost of essential services, such as quality healthcare, access to reliable childcare, and utilities. Expanding access to affordable healthcare through better coordinated federal programs and initiatives can significantly reduce out-of-pocket expenses for families. Similarly, building more effective public-private programs for childcare assistance and workforce training programs can help working parents afford quality childcare without compromising their financial stability, and support access to quality childcare options.</p><p>Finally, Colorado must modernize its relationship with its public transportation infrastructure and act like the 6 million resident state that it is.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>MARVIN: This year, we made significant progress with the passage of <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">Senate Bill 24-233, which I supported. This bipartisan legislation represents the largest property tax reduction in 20 years. It was the result of intense negotiations and collaboration among lawmakers, the governor's office, nonprofits, business leaders, and various stakeholders across the state.</url></p><p>While I understand the appeal of deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives, the solution we achieved through SB24-233 is comprehensive and balanced. It provides immediate financial relief to homeowners and business owners while ensuring that the necessary funding for schools, fire districts, and local governments is maintained. Our approach reflects a carefully crafted compromise that addresses the urgent need for tax relief without jeopardizing essential public services.</p><p>Bipartisanship was crucial in reaching this agreement. The successful negotiation of SB24-233 demonstrated that when we come together and put politics aside, we can achieve meaningful results for the people of Colorado.</p><p>Given the extensive efforts and the broad consensus that underpinned SB24-233, I do not support additional ballot initiatives that would override the Legislature's work. Such measures could introduce uncertainty and potentially undermine the stability we have worked hard to achieve. I believe it is more prudent to allow the reforms from SB24-233 to take effect and assess their impact before considering further changes.</p><p>PHILLIPS: While property tax cuts can provide immediate relief to homeowners, they must be carefully balanced with the need to fund essential public services. I believe any proposal for deeper property tax cuts should be evaluated in the context of its broader impact on state and local budgets, particularly on funding for education, public safety, and our aging infrastructure.</p><p>Families across Colorado are suffering \u2014 and while property tax reductions give homeowners a much-needed break, overriding these measures with deeper cuts could potentially jeopardize this balance and lead to underfunding of critical services, while leaving our significant population of Colorado families who rent in the dust.</p><p>It is essential to consider the long-term implications of such cuts and ensure that they do not undermine the quality of public services that residents rely on. These types of sweeping cuts are easy to write, but they lack the precision of good government. I advocate for targeted relief measures that help our most vulnerable populations, such as low-income homeowners and our seniors, without compromising the financial stability of our state and local governments.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>MARVIN: My dedication to public service is firmly rooted in the belief that progress is achieved through collaboration and relationship-building across party lines. Throughout my time on Thornton City Council and now in the state Legislature, I have consistently prioritized working together with colleagues from all backgrounds to find common ground and deliver tangible results for my constituents. This approach has been instrumental in addressing key issues such as clean air, prenatal health, and campaign finance reform. By leveraging my skills in building relationships, I have been able to forge partnerships and reach compromises that translate constituent concerns into actionable legislation.</p><p>In my political philosophy, bipartisanship is not just important \u2014 it is essential. While some bills are never going to be bipartisan based on ideologies and values, there are many others where we can find common ground. Compromise fosters long-term stability and acceptance, as people are more likely to support policies that consider their interests. It encourages creative problem-solving and innovation by bringing together different perspectives. It embodies democratic values, showing respect for diverse views and a commitment to serving the public good. In essence, compromise isn't just about making concessions; it's about finding the best possible solutions that work for everyone.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Coloradans working together has been one of the critical components to defining our Colorado way of life. Indeed, democracy and long-term governance requires collaboration, open dialogue, and ensuring folks from all walks of life have a voice at the table. My experience as a city council member and civil rights attorney has taught me the value of reaching across the aisle, treating folks like the humans they are, and understanding their intentions can help us achieve meaningful outcomes.</p><p>One area where I see potential for common ground is in promoting transparency and accountability in government. Both parties can agree on the importance of an open government that operates with integrity and serves the public interest. We must build back trust and confidence in our government. When our residents know what's going on in their backyard and how their tax dollars are being spent, we all win. I've always had an open door policy for constituents because when we have open and respectful dialogue, we can better understand the needs of everyone in our state and that means the bills we write help more Coloradans, more effectively.</p><p>What is one bill, vote or other legislative action you've taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?</p><p>MARVIN: One legislative action that I believe best demonstrates my qualification for reelection is my work on <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1456\">House Bill 24-1456, aimed at combating the growing congenital syphilis crisis in Colorado. Shortly after joining the legislature, I learned from the Adams County Health Department about a shocking 625% increase in congenital syphilis cases in my district. This alarming trend reflects a statewide crisis, with a 900% increase since 2017 and projections indicating a fourfold rise in cases in 2024 compared to 2023.</url></p><p>HB24-1456, was developed in collaboration with local health departments and public health authorities. It followed a public health emergency order from the governor's office that mandates additional testing for congenital syphilis during pregnancy to catch and treat the infection early, thereby preventing severe complications and infant deaths. HB24-1456 complemented that order with a comprehensive, evolving response by empowering the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) to conduct emergency rulemaking and requiring the publication of de-identified case data to aid local agencies in their targeted responses. This bill highlights my commitment to addressing urgent issues through collaborative, data-driven solutions and proactive legislative measures, and working with stakeholders and constituents to solve problems.</p><p>Are there any votes the incumbent has taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?</p><p>PHILLIPS: With both chambers of the state legislature potentially having a supermajority next legislative session for the Colorado Democrats, who we send to the House in this seat matters a great deal.</p><p>Colorado's cost of living and housing access has never felt more difficult in my lifetime. As I knock on doors around Thornton, parents tell me their confidence in our schools has waned, and teachers tell me they feel unsupported and underpaid. My fellow workers tell me they struggle to make ends meet, while small business owners tell me they can't find the skilled workforce they need to compete. Our older neighbors tell me they're struggling to keep up with the cost of living, while we debate \u2014 but then kill \u2014 bills like the popular SB24-106 defects bill which would have brought Colorado in line with other U.S. states and helped drive more condo construction.</p><p>I'm running for state House because Thornton deserves an outcome-oriented leader who will spend her time on bills which will move the needle for Coloradans, work with her peers to drive pragmatic solutions to Colorado's problems, and pass comprehensive legislation rather than stopgap bills. <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-159\">SB24-159, for which my opponent was a prime sponsor, would have resulted in massive disruption to Colorado's economy, and up to 300,000 Colorado families' source of income without a single tactic for re-training those affected or any form of financial assistance. While I'm glad we killed the bill in committee, I'm committed to spending our limited legislative time on measures which will improve our quality of life, expand Colorado's middle class, enable access for fair and quality housing, and help expand Colorado's sustainability in a comprehensive, equitable way.</url></p><p>House District 36</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carterforcolorado.com/\">Michael Carter</url></p><p>Age: 51</p><p>City of residence: Aurora</p><p>Occupation: Attorney, school board member</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://bryan4colorado.com/\">Bryan Lindstrom</url></p><p>Age: 36</p><p>City of residence: Aurora</p><p>Occupation: Public high school history teacher</p><p>House District 36 includes north and east Aurora and parts of Arapahoe and Adams counties. It is current represented by Rep. Mike Weissman, who won with 64% of the vote in 2022 and is term limited in the House.</p><p>Carter did not submit a response.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>LINDSTROM:</p><p>Addressing the skyrocketing cost of living, particularly housing costs. We have some of the fastest increasing food prices and house prices in the country.</p><p>Fully Funded Public Education. Even after buying down the BS factor we are only at 1989 education funding levels. We have teachers leaving in droves because we don't have the resources we need.</p><p>Expanding worker protections. Colorado is a de facto 'right to work' state that leads to lower salaries, worse benefits, and worse working conditions. I want to make Colorado a strong pro-worker state.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>LINDSTROM: Cost of living is the number one issue with almost every person I talk to. Housing costs are skyrocketing and wages are keeping up. I will address it by taking on the Corporate Lobby that fights to block good housing and worker policies and fight to pass policies that keep people housed and make it easier for first time homebuyers to get into the market. I believe we need to take every step possible toward housing everyone.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>LINDSTROM: It should be one of the state's top priorities. Expanding housing access and affordability impacts everything. If housing is addressed, students learn better and move around less. If housing is addressed, people will have to drive shorter distances to work which reduces pollution. Keeping people housed and stable reduces crime. It is the number one issue we need to tackle and my community is demanding it.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>LINDSTROM: It is definitely an issue the state should address. We need to incentivize investment in wind, solar, geothermal, etc., and invest in public transit to reduce emissions. With that said, we need to ensure this transition is using union labor, high paying jobs with benefits and pensions. We can't leave behind working people in the process</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>LINDSTROM: Housing costs is the most expensive bill that people pay and things we can do is allow for rent stabilization, prevent corporations from owning residential property, utilize vacancy fees and other tools to reduce housing costs. But we also have to strengthen the ability for workers to organize so we can collectively increase wages and benefits and we should also incentivize worker-cooperatives to expand ownership and economic stability. We should also zone so mixed income housing is being developed in the same areas, expand community land trusts, and countless other fantastic measures we know work.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>LINDSTROM: I do not support any of the property tax cuts that are on the ballot this year, however, I would like to tax properties you live in differently than those used to make money off of so we can reduce taxes for those with one home without cutting taxes for the ultra-wealthy.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>LINDSTROM: I find a lot of common ground with everyday people from all parties. Everyone wants fully funded schools, safe communities, and a government that actually meets their needs. However, elected officials from all parties fall into partisanship and social media wars and a lot of other antics to build power for themselves rather than their communities. So I find it important to try to serve my entire district, regardless of party, but I don't think a bill being partisan or bipartisan speaks at all to the nature of how well it serves the people. Especially in Colorado, there are many elected officials that are committed to voting no on anything and I have no interest in working with people who do not engage in good-faith.</p><p>House District 49</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lesleyforco.com/\">Lesley Smith</url></p><p>Age: 66</p><p>City of residence: Boulder</p><p>Occupation: CU rengent at-large</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://maxforcolorado.com/\">Max Woodfin</url></p><p>Age: 44</p><p>City of residence: Boulder County</p><p>Occupation: Mental health counselor/psychotherapist</p><p>House District 49 spans from the Interstate 70 corridor to the Wyoming border and includes western Boulder County as its main population center. It is currently represented by Rep. Judy Amabile, a Democrat who won the seat with 64% of the vote in 2022 and is now seeking a Senate seat.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>SMITH: I had intended to run for re-election as CU regent at-large, but we are in a climate crisis. I decided to run to bring my expertise as a water scientist focusing on greenhouse gas emissions to the statehouse. I believe we must transition to a 100% clean energy economy to stop the devastating effects of climate change. We must develop robust plans for this transition. This will be my top priority.</p><p>Public education is also a top priority for me. We need to pay our teachers and staff the salaries they deserve. We need to provide an equitable education to all our students. A college education is out of reach for too many. I will fight to better fund both K-12 and higher education.</p><p>Affordability of housing and healthcare is a universal issue I've been hearing about across the district and the state. I look forward to seeing if the new legislation makes a sizable dent in housing stock and affordability. I believe healthcare is a basic human right. I will fight to ensure everyone has universal healthcare.</p><p>WOODFIN: 1. Greater access to mental healthcare for people of all geographies and socioeconomic status. I want to enact policies that increase the number of Medicaid mental health providers, and ensure both patients and providers have ease of access to reimbursement mechanisms. 2. Protect and enhance women's reproductive rights in the state of Colorado, and ensure that state employees' insurance covers all reproductive healthcare. 3. Develop initiatives that protect communities from wildfire, violent storms, and other climate-related disasters. This includes developing and funding robust, community-based forest mitigation that preserves the integrity of forest ecology while reducing fuels.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>SMITH: HD49 is geographically diverse. It is mostly mountain rural, but its population is dominated by the western part of Boulder with western Larimer, Gilpin, and Clear Creek counties making up the rest of the district. Despite its size, I have found there is a commonality in issues across the district: resilience to catastrophic fires and floods, forest health, water availability, and access to home insurance because the district is prone to fires. <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb23-1288\">HB23-1288, Fair Plan, provides insurance through the state to homeowners where home insurance is no longer available. I will be interested to see if this provides enough relief for homeowners. If not, then more money will be required to address the shortfall.</url></p><p>A common issue across most of the counties is dispersed shooting in sparsely populated areas on Forest Service Land. Representative Amabile has tried to pass legislation to regulate this and has not been successful. I will take this issue up next year, if elected. The issue of affordable housing comes up in all my discussions. In denser areas, like Boulder, I think the recently passed law to encourage denser housing is a good step forward in providing more housing that is potentially more climate friendly.</p><p>WOODFIN: Finding the one issue that unites residents in a district as vast as HD-49 is difficult, but there are some common issues that I hear regularly, from difficulty of accessing essential services in mountain communities, to the need for robust fire mitigation. However, what I hear more than anything \u2014 and a big part of why I am running \u2014 is that people in the district are concerned about the state of our democracy and want to see more civil dialogue. I intend to address this, both currently in my campaign, and then when I am elected into office, by consistently talking across political divides and finding common ground despite different approaches to policy.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>SMITH: As a former school board member, who held local control tightly as one of our tenants, I am a strong proponent of local control. Last year, when <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb23-213\">SB23-213 was introduced, I heard from elected officials from across HD-49 that that there was no stake holding and they did not want the heavy hand of the state dictating local control of land use policy. The bill died on the clock, and legislators did their stake holding and broke the bill down into several more palatable bites. The bill that mandates municipalities to develop their own housing plans with actionable items is a great start. Clear Creek County has already done this. They found Idaho Springs needs housing for workers, while Georgetown needs housing for those aging in place. This is a clear illustration that a one size fits all approach does not work. I think increasing density along transportation corridors is a good idea. I prefer the carrot to the big stick approach. The state could help this move forward with incentives. If after trying this approach, the needle is not moving on increasing affordable housing stock, then I would be open to exploring stronger measures like regulation of land use.</url></p><p>WOODFIN: I do think the state plays a limited role in both ensuring and encouraging municipalities and counties to make permanently affordable housing available. In some cases, this does mean overriding exclusionary zoning or discriminatory zoning practices. In other cases, this means legislating a minimum availability of affordable housing in every community. The legislature also needs to tackle the high rate of vacant housing (usually owned by out-of-state investors).</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>SMITH:The state plays a key role in mitigating the effects of climate change because the Colorado Energy &amp; Carbon Management Commission's (ECMC) mission is to regulate the development and production of the natural resources of oil and gas, a major contributor to climate change. We need to develop a clear plan for the transition to clean energy that won't shock the state's economy and workers in the fossil fuel industry. I would like to see a multi-pronged plan that includes the following. 1) Strictly clamp down now on methane emissions from fossil fuel activities and orphan wells. 2) Bring new clean energy technologies online. 3) Exponentially expand the infrastructure that supports the transportation of clean energy and make it more resilient to climate change by undergrounding power lines. <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-218\">SB24-218, Modernize Energy Distribution Systems, will help with this. 4) Retool workers to provide them the skills that will allow them to continue having well-paying jobs. Some trades, like the pipefitters, should be able to transition their work from extracting and transporting oil and gas to transporting energy created by geothermal and green hydrogen technologies.</url></p><p>WOODFIN: The state's role is to encourage, invest in, and incentivize both a transition to energy and industry that does not create greenhouse gasses, and also to encourage citizens to live sustainable lifestyles by creating better public transportation infrastructure and more walkable cities and towns. I would support and sponsor legislation of green jobs and green workforce initiatives that gives workers an opportunity to re-train and develop skills for a green economy. I also see the state playing a large role in funding wildfire mitigation efforts across the state through grants to local fire protection districts.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>SMITH: The Legislature made strides this session in addressing cost-of-living concerns. The Family Affordability Tax Credit, provides a tax credit per child and is stepped depending on the age of the children. This will put more money into the hands of lower income families and is estimated that the childhood poverty rate will decrease by 50. Homeowners are reeling from the steep increase in property values and, in turn, increased property tax rates. For those on a fixed income, some fear that they may not be able to continue living in their homes. The Legislature is trying to alleviate the sharp increase in rates through <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233, which reduces the valuation from an estimated 7.06% of the actual value of the property to 6.7% of the amount equal to the actual value of the property minus the lesser of $55,000 or the alternate amount. The cost of childcare is a financial burden for families. The state started providing 10 hours of free preschool for all children, but this has become unsustainable. I would be a proponent of a sliding-cost scale with family of means paying full tuition and lower income families continuing to receive free pre-school.</url></p><p>Editor's note: Colorado's Universal Preschool program provides between 10 and 15 hours per week.</p><p>WOODFIN: The legislature must ensure a fair and livable wage for all workers in the state of Colorado. Furthermore, the legislature needs to enforce existing labor laws and ensure that all workers have the right to engage in collective bargaining.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>SMITH: I absolutely do not support deeper property tax cuts through this year's ballot initiatives. We are the only state in the nation that has passed something like TABOR, and it has been a disaster for our state. As a former school board member during the 2008 depression and as a CU regent, I have seen the devastating impact TABOR has had on funding for both K-12 and higher education. We do not need more ballot measures that will diminish the state's coffers. Despite what people think, Colorado ranks in the bottom half nationally when it comes to property taxes. The sudden rise in valuations is complicated and linked to the repeal of the Gallagher amendment a few years ago. The legislature worked in a bipartisan manner with two Republican and two Democratic bill sponsors to develop a grand compromise, <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233, which will provide certainty on property taxes while protecting school districts and local governments from devastating cuts to their budgets. Initially, the Advance Colorado Institute was onboard with the compromise but reneged. I will work hard to help defeat the ballot initiatives if they both make the ballot in November.</url></p><p>WOODFIN: I support a property tax circuit-breaker for low and some middle-income homeowners so that the rapidly rising cost of property tax and homeowner's insurance does not force homeowners to vacate their homes. Currently, Colorado ensures property tax breaks for seniors and people on disability. However, this does not protect those on fixed or low-income who cannot afford the increase in taxes and the concurrent increase in homeowner's insurance.</p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>SMITH: I serve on a partisan board as a CU regent, which was Republican-dominated before 2022. I had to reach out to my Republican colleagues to get anything done; I have many examples. First, the climate strikes started in spring 2019. There was enthusiasm to do more on the sustainability front. I teamed up with a Republican regent to suggest to the new president, who formerly had been a Republican congressman, to use presidential funds to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day by developing a competition, The Sustainability Challenge, with cash prizes. He remembered planting a tree on that Earth Day and thought it was a terrific idea. This effort snowballed into including sustainability with measurable goals into the system's first strategic plan.</p><p>Second, after meeting with American Indian students with another Democratic regent, we were able to persuade some of the Republican regents that the system should have a Land Acknowledgement. We also suggested a bill that allows out-of-state American Indian students to pay in-state tuition. The Republican regents agreed, and the bill was passed. Finally, we have bipartisan chair and vice chair positions. My vice chair was the Republican that ran against me and had been appointed to the vacant CD5 seat!</p><p>WOODFIN: Absolutely, and this is a cornerstone of my campaign. While many may label my policy positions as progressive, I also see our current political divide in the context of a so-called culture war. I am a rural mountain resident who is a veteran and who hunts for my own sustenance; I also work with wood from our mountain land and can fix my own tractor (sometimes); these are not the attributes that some may ascribe to the 'Democratic elite.'</p><p>I think we need to break down the preconceptions we bring to our politics and get to know each other as humans, and I will do that with my fellow legislators across the aisle. I will also engage on policy issues that I think may have done some harm. For example, while I like the idea of wolves, I think the way we went about reintroducing them was flawed and alienated a good portion of rural Colorado. Many people west of the continental divide are frustrated because they see wolf reintroduction as an imposition from Front Range voters, and I cannot help but see their perspective on this. I also am unafraid to speak with people who are concerned about the 2nd Amendment. While I am in favor of stricter gun control measures and would like to see deep background checks (for example), I will not push this without sitting down with and having long-form conversations with those who oppose gun control. These are the nuanced discussions I will continue to have when I am in office.</p><p>House District 52</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ethnieforcolorado.com/about\">Ethnie Treick</url></p><p>Age: 46</p><p>City of residence:</p><p>Occupation:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yaraforco.com/\">Yara Zokaie</url></p><p>Age: 32</p><p>City of residence: Fort Collins</p><p>Occupation: Larimer County chief deputy assessor, tax attorney</p><p>House District 52 includes southern Fort Collins west of Interstate 25. It is currently represented by Democratic Rep. Cathy Kipp, who won the seat in 2022 with 65% of the vote.</p><p>If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?</p><p>ZOKAIE: Public Education Funding: This year, our neighborhood schools faced closure. We need a public education champion that will rework our school funding formula, and I have a detailed tax plan to get this done. I am running with support from our teachers, school board members and current Fort Collins representatives (incumbent Cathy Kipp and Andy Boesenecker) because they know I am committed to getting our schools the resources they need.</p><p>Progressive Tax Policy: As a tax attorney, I know that our middle earners disproportionately bear the tax burden. We can use our tax code to take care of our most vulnerable community members and end child poverty. Additionally, our property tax system needs work. Out-of-state corporate owners, who own a significant portion of the housing stock in Fort Collins, should be paying in at a higher rate.</p><p>Healthcare for All: I support a single payer healthcare system. I hope to pass a study bill next year. No one should go bankrupt because they got sick, and I have heard some truly heartbreaking stories on the campaign trail. I will always fight to protect our reproductive rights and make sure reproductive healthcare is accessible for all Coloradans, including those on Medicaid.</p><p>Clean Air and Water: We need to transition to renewable energy, invest in public transportation, and hold our top polluters accountable. I refuse funding from the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>TREICK: Increase Affordability: We need to create an economy that works better for everyone. Too many people in our state are struggling with barriers such as affordable housing, childcare or access to transportation, and paychecks are not going as far. Additionally, I will lead on workforce development to ensure workers are equipped for current and future job opportunities through apprenticeships, re-skilling and upskilling.</p><p>Protecting our Environment: Air quality is a top concern for many in Fort Collins and communities up and down the Front Range. The air we breathe and the water we drink are critically important to our quality of life. Our work on affordable housing is part of the solution, but we must also ensure utilities meet their renewable energy goals, and decrease emissions related to oil and gas production, transportation, and industrial operations.</p><p>Health Equity and Access: I believe healthcare is a fundamental right, not a privilege. We must increase access and equity, including for reproductive and mental healthcare, and develop innovative solutions to address root causes such as economic disparities, trauma and discrimination.</p><p>What do residents in your district say is the community's biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?</p><p>ZOKAIE: The residents of House District 52 are concerned about school closures. We came very close to having to close neighborhood schools this year, and it has highlighted the importance of electing a public education champion (i.e. someone that is not backed by those seeking to privatize education). As someone who learned English in public school, this issue is close to my heart. School closures impact the entire neighborhood, but it is our vulnerable kids that will suffer the most. I am committed to making sure our schools get the resources they need. We must increase per pupil funding, advocate for higher teacher pay, and ensure that all our schools are transparent about their funding. I will do whatever it takes to save our schools.</p><p>TREICK: I've knocked on thousands of doors talking with people in our community about the issues most important to them. The top issue I hear is affordable housing. To solve our affordable housing crisis, we need an all of the above approach to increase development of all types of housing and provide a diversity of options for residents at all stages of life.</p><p>I will prioritize developing more housing especially in areas near public transportation, extend affordability requirements on any project that utilizes public funds, and address corporate housing ownership. I will work to foster public private partnerships to increase workforce housing development and encourage collaboration to address the availability and cost of water as a major component of the price of new housing. Wages are also a root cause of our housing crisis, and I will continue to push for livable wages for workers and equal pay for equal work. We must ensure the right of representation for both renters and property owners and educate tenants about their rights and protections. Lastly, state and local governments should streamline the process that ties affordable housing projects up in red tape, increasing the cost to bring these projects to market.</p><p>The Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state's role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?</p><p>ZOKAIE: Housing is certainly an issue of statewide concern, and the state needs to address the housing crisis. We also need to be mindful of how we make these changes, as each locality has unique and diverse needs. I am especially concerned about gentrification and making sure that we do not displace any communities of color.</p><p>We must build more affordable housing. I support partnering with a government builder to create housing that is at a lower price point. I know there are members of the legislature who are exploring inclusionary zoning, and I look forward to joining their efforts. A housing plan must also go hand in hand with a transit plan. Increasing public transportation helps with affordability as no one area becomes more desirable. Finally, I often see candidates and elected officials discuss the affordable housing crisis without also discussing services for those going through homelessness. Homelessness is a manifestation of failed housing policy. We must provide these crucial services and support our renters in order to keep Coloradans housed.</p><p>TREICK: Colorado is in an affordable housing crisis and the state must work with local governments to encourage more housing options. Recognizing local control, the state should play the role of facilitator, collaborator and can provide technical assistance, but it's important to examine the issue on a regional or statewide basis.</p><p>What is the state's role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?</p><p>ZOKAIE: There is no Planet B \u2014 we must do everything in our power to mitigate the effects of climate change. We must also recognize that while this issue impacts everyone, low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately impacted. I support a just transition to clean renewable energy and providing incentives for people and businesses to make energy efficiency upgrades. I will protect our public lands from drilling and preserve our wildlife habitats. We must conserve the water we do have, protect our rivers and streams, and continue to research water recycling.</p><p>I refuse donations from the fossil fuel industry because I only want to be beholden to my Fort Collins community. I am the only HD52 candidate endorsed by Sierra Club and Conservation Colorado, because I have a proven track record of holding top polluters accountable and they know I am dedicated to making sure everyone has clean air and water.</p><p>TREICK: Climate change is a matter of statewide concern and the state's role is to set policy to mitigate its effects. For years, I collaborated with others to fight for environmental justice, pass state-level policies to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as improve air quality and create new jobs.</p><p>Air quality is a top priority for residents of Fort Collins and my experience at the Colorado Capitol is invaluable as we work to protect our environment.</p><p>I will ensure our utility companies meet their 100 renewable energy generation goal by 2050 or earlier, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production, reduce methane emissions from landfills and coal mining, and continue to invest in industrial decarbonization projects. I will invest in public transit and address market conditions to encourage the development of more affordable housing, especially in transit corridors, to decrease commute distances.</p><p>I'm dedicated to making sure we continue investments into forest health, wildfire mitigation and restoration, including our workforce to manage fires and the aftermath as it relates to forest health and the watershed. I will increase regional and statewide collaboration on water, address equity issues, and encourage more conservation and flexibility in the system.</p><p>How can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?</p><p>ZOKAIE: It's never been harder to make ends meet. As someone who grew up in a working-class immigrant family, and who is working while campaigning to put food on the table, I understand the hardships our residents are facing. I support measures to assist renters with the cost of rent and housing stability. I also think we need targeted property tax relief. We should increase the assessment rate for out of state corporate owners to make this relief possible.</p><p>One of my priorities is increasing tax credits for our most vulnerable residents, and building the infrastructure to pay out these credits without requiring a tax return to be filed. People who are not native English speakers or who are lower income are much less likely to file a tax return. We know that our vulnerable populations miss out on credits aimed to help them. If we are able to pass my plan, we would significantly reduce child poverty in Colorado.</p><p>TREICK: For more than a decade I have advocated for opportunities and resources that support the success of community members. Given this work, I understand that many in the workforce and many attempting to enter it face barriers like mental health, affordable housing, and access to transportation and quality childcare. Paychecks are not going as far as they did previously. We must tackle these issues to lower the cost of living and create an economy that works for everyone.</p><p>The legislature can increase quality childcare options by providing childcare workers free childcare or strengthening incentives for employers who offer childcare on-site. It can further invest in public transit, including last mile bus routes. It can address market conditions to encourage the development of more affordable housing for residents at all stages of life, strengthen incentives to first time homebuyers, and extend affordability requirements on any housing that utilizes public funds. It can foster public private partnerships to increase workforce housing development. And it can support universal healthcare to expand access and equity, including for reproductive and behavioral healthcare, and develop innovative solutions to address root causes such as economic disparities, trauma and discrimination.</p><p>Do you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature's property tax work from the most recent session?</p><p>ZOKAIE: No. The recent bill was a result of bipartisan compromise and it was pushed through to avoid these ballot initiatives, which would be devastating to local governments and our schools. I also believe the recent agreement was done in a way that makes sense for local assessors' offices.</p><p>TREICK: No, I support the bipartisan <url normalizedValue=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-233\">SB24-233, which will reduce local property taxes by $1.3 billion per year and overhaul assessment rates while backfilling critical services and our schools through the state education fund and general fund. The bill balanced the needs of homeowners and local governments across the state and better supports owners of low- to moderately-valued homes. Deeper cuts through the proposed ballot initiatives would be devastating to our schools and other local services.</url></p><p>Many Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/04/04/colorado-newsline-is-listening-to-voter-voices-in-2024/\">statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?</url></p><p>ZOKAIE: I think it is crucial to consider diverse viewpoints and give deference to stakeholder expertise. No elected official knows everything, and I will always have an open door to hear from my constituents, colleagues (Democratic or Republican), and industry experts. We are only able to craft intelligent and effective policy when we take into account opposing viewpoints. I have a proven track record of bringing opposing parties together to reach favorable solutions.</p><p>With that said, I refuse to compromise at the expense of vulnerable groups such as working people, people of color, and older adults. While I have many times found common ground with members of the opposite party, especially over fiscal policy, I do not believe in finding common ground with anyone who is racist or homophobic. If someone does not believe that I belong in this country because of the color of my skin, then we are likely not going to have a productive conversation.</p><p>TREICK: Given my experience at the Colorado Capitol, I know that good public policy making requires compromise. That compromise can come between individual legislators, within the Democratic caucus, between Democrats and Republicans, or by working with state agencies, policy experts or other stakeholders. It can be the result of a short conversation or a more lengthy one, but often is the product of a question that hadn't been considered previously. We achieve the best policy results when we listen to a diversity of voices and opinions. Policy that goes through this process is much more lasting and impactful.</p><p>A critical part of the work of a legislator is to build relationships with diverse groups of stakeholders and to listen to a wide variety of viewpoints. The work also requires the ability to balance multiple viewpoints and opinions and prioritize those from within the community.</p><p>One of the largest threats to our Democracy is how divided and vitriolic our politics has become. Many voters are tuning out because they don't believe their vote makes a difference. We must fight disinformation, listen to each other, and work together to make progress and build back trust in our Democracy.</p><p>SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.</p><p> DONATE </p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/06/10/2024-primary-voter-democratic-house-races/\">Voter guide 2024: Democratic state House primary races Q&amp;A appeared first on </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/\">Colorado Newsline.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1000979851887023091825907800056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009798</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C75-K9G1-JCMN-Y47F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567520</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"19083\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon Friday.</p><p>\"I want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there's a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\" Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, said at a news conference. \"Without rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\"</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year - contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. - with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to another, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>Officials in parts of the U.S. issued air quality alerts Thursday due to smoke drifting southward.</p><p>As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across Canada, more than half of them out of control.</p><p>In the Northwest Territories alone, 268 wildfires already burned more than 8,100 square miles.</p><p>Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta.</p><p>\"It's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later,\" because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community.</p><p>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory already were forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive.</p><p>A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told the CBC their vehicle began melting as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle began filling with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead.</p><p>\"I was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,\" said Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times.</p><p>She told the CBC her son kept saying: \"I don't want to die, mommy.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convened an urgent meeting with ministers and senior officials Thursday to discuss the evacuation.</p><p>Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close within 24 hours as the Northwest Territories health authority starts to reduce its services. In-patient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital will be moved in the coming days, if required, and most long-term care patients were transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website.</p><p>Officials said evacuations have so far been safe and orderly, and that evacuees from Yellowknife who can't find their own accommodations can get support in three centers in the province of Alberta. The closest of those centers is more than 620 miles by road from Yellowknife.</p><p>Officials in Calgary said they're preparing to take in thousands of evacuees and are opening a reception center at the Calgary airport. A second center was set up at a hotel for those who drive to the city, said Iain Bushell, the city's director of emergency management.</p><p>\"We're all tired of the word unprecedented, yet there is no other way to describe this situation in the Northwest Territories,\" Premier Caroline Cochrane posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. She urged residents to obey emergency management officials, traffic control devices and posted speed limits. \"The country is watching, and our neighbours are keeping us in their thoughts and prayers.\"</p><p>The evacuation order issued Wednesday night applies to the city of Yellowknife and the neighboring First Nations communities of Ndilo and Dettah.</p><p>Indigenous communities have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering native plants.</p><p>Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire specialist with Parks Canada, has said the wildfires \"are so dangerous and so fast-moving\" that evacuations increasingly are necessary, which is a challenge in remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Hundreds of wildfires raging in Canada's Northwest Territories prompt evacuations in what officials are calling a \"crisis situation.\"  Canadian Armed Forces soldiers build a firebreak Wednesday in Parker Recreation Field in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada.

Several new IOLs have entered the market in the past few years, and more are expected to become available in the future. Helping our patients navigate the decisions regarding these lenses often improves their satisfaction after cataract surgery. Patients look to us for advice on whether to consider a presbyopia-correcting IOL, what attributes to prioritize in their choice of lens, and whether their postoperative visual experiences are typical. Despite immense amounts of online information, this information is often hard to discover, obscured by marketing, and difficult to verify. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read more... </p><p>Paul Hahn, MD, PhD, shares insights on pegcetacoplan versus avacincaptad pegol in patients with geographic atrophy </p><p>Paul Hahn, MD, PhD; Sydney Crago, Editor, Modern Retina; David Hutton, Managing Editor, Ophthalmology Times </p><p>Paul Hahn, MD, PhD, shared insights on research comparing the relative efficacy of pegcetacoplan versus avacincaptad pegol in patients with geographic atrophy presented at the 2023 ASRS annual meeting. </p><p>See the interview... </p><p>EyeCon 2023: 2 days of education for optometrists, ophthalmologists </p><p>Marlisa Miller, Editorial Intern </p><p>EyeCon is a unique meeting experience combining optometry and ophthalmology tracks, with presentations and educational opportunities on the hottest topics in eye care. It will be held December 1 to 2, 2023, in Sanibel Harbour, Florida.

Compare this to the 13% of Black citizens who make up the US population,2 and you can see the disparity of representation in the industry. </p><p>\"There's a big [gap] in between those 2 numbers. [The 13% Promise] is really about saying, 'Hey guys, we know there's a problem, let's put a numerical value to the problem and let's work that out,'\" said Adam Ramsey, OD, cofounder of Black EyeCare Perspective. \"Let's find ways to increase representation. Let's get creative. [Let's get] diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging to be important.

McCabe, MD; Donna L. Shotwell, OD </p><p>When presbyopia-correcting drops were introduced, many eye care providers thought they would be a quick, easy fix for the unhappy presbyopes in our offices, perhaps envisioning wide distribution of samples and on-demand prescribing. That was probably never the best approach, especially when non-eye care practitioners started prescribing the medication. </p><p>Late 2022 saw the publication of several case reports1-3 of patients who experienced retinal detachment (RD), retinal tears, or vitreomacular traction following the use of topical pilocarpine 1.25% (Vuity; Allergan/AbbVie) for presbyopia correction.

The gift, announced in 2013, is one of the largest research donations in Wilmer's history. It will fund vision-saving research and a professorship. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a news release from the Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Pickens' interest in the treatment and research of eye conditions developed in the 1980s after his father's diagnosis of macular degeneration. At the time, no treatments existed to prevent decline of his father's healthy vision. </p><p>The latest financial gift was made after Cordia and Jay Rosser, a foundation representative, visited Wilmer leaders and researchers early this summer to discuss how the donation would be used at the institute and new research spaces under construction at Johns Hopkins. </p><p>Jay Rosser noted that Pickens' philanthropic impact exceeded $1 billion and was directed at some of the world's most cutting-edge research institutions, and the Wilmer Eye Institute is high on that list. </p><p>Ophthalmologists warn castor oil shouldn't be rubbed in the eyes, no matter what they do on TikTok </p><p>Ophthalmologists are issuing a warning not to use castor oil as a way to treat vision problems amid claims circulating on TikTok. </p><p>In its heyday, castor oil was considered a jack-of-all-trades home remedy, used as a laxative, a moisturizer and even as a chest rub to ease lung congestion. Now, it is making a comeback as some influencers on TikTok claim they are using castor oil as treatment for vision problems. </p><p>Advertisement </p><p>However, ophthalmologists are sounding the alarm, according to an NBC News report, with dozens of videos on the social media platform receiving millions of views showing people rubbing castor oil over their eyelids, across their eyelashes and under their eyes to help treat issues like dryness, floaters, cataracts, poor vision, and even glaucoma. </p><p>Castor oil is a type of vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the castor bean plant, and it has been used for thousands of years in traditional and folk medicine to treat a range of issues from bronchitis to skin infections. </p><p>Castor oil on store shelves are not meant to be used on the eyes and could contain dyes, preservatives, fragrances or other ingredients that can cause irritation or infection. It also may not be sterilized. </p><p>Dr. Ashley Brissette, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said in a statement that castor oil is not a cure-all. If anyone has concerns about their eyes, then need to see an ophthalmologist.\" </p><p>Moreover, Dr. Vicki Chan, a practicing ophthalmologist in Los Angeles, said in a statement that castor oil does not have any effect on cataracts or glaucoma. </p><p>Concern over unknown long-term effects of wildfire smoke </p><p>With 2023 officially being the worst wildfire season ever in Canada, ophthalmologists are urging for more awareness on the long-term effects wildfire smoke can have on the eye. </p><p>Wind has pushed the wildfire smoke across Canada and several states in the United States, causing major dips in air quality \u2013 at one point New York City had the worst air quality on the planet due to the wildfire smoke. </p><p>There are currently more than 1000 active wildfires burning in Canada, with 740 of them being labeled as \"out of control\" by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which noted more than 5000 wildfires have started in Canada this year. </p><p>According to Vancouver ophthalmologist Briar Sexton, MD, eye symptoms such as dry, itchy, red, painful, watery and gritty eyes can happen before the smoke is even noticeable. </p><p>A recent review on the wildfires that swept across Australia in 2020 by Environmental Pollution found evidence that wildfire smoke and other air pollution sources have harmful effects on ocular surface, causing eye symptoms and changes to normal function of the ocular surface. The same review found it remained to be seen whether repeated or long-term smoke exposure carries an increased risk long term of ocular surface disease. </p><p>WIO Summer symposium: Empowering aspirations </p><p>The 2023 Women In Ophthalmology Summer Symposium will begin on Thursday, August 24, and run to Sunday, August 27, at the JW Marriott Marco Island Beach Resort, Marco Island, FL. </p><p>The WIO Summer Symposium is a \"must-attend event,\" according to the organizers who said the symposium is a curated meeting for women offering the best of the best'content in all subjects of importance to women ophthalmologists. Nowhere else will attendees find so many dynamic speakers and specialized educational content in a collegial atmosphere designed specifically for women. </p><p>The conference has both in-person and virtual programs. Interested parties can register for the in-person program, as well as for the virtual meeting online. </p><p>Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, the main educational days of the conference, all feature sessions designed to uplift, inspire, and empower attendees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OPTTME-4F1E1C8B917796FECE202E3E2399E13E4BDF761449A50BD9688C1020230812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D695ABFA5C45 OPOLOT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68XS-JJF1-JCXN-V0GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">483655</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 MJH Life Sciences\u00ae All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ophthalmology Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44420\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The blaze has already scorched more than 47,000 acres along a 85-mile perimeter. Rain boosted hopes that the fire could be brought under control yesterday, but strong winds have made the fire \"very aggressive,\" the Valencian regional government said. Four people were still hospitalized after suffering severe burns Wednesday when several passengers tried to jump off a train that had stopped and tried to go back amid surrounding flames. The train had inadvertently headed into the fast-spreading wildfire. Regional government head Ximo Puig has requested a report from the firefighting services to clarify why the train was allowed to proceed through the burning area. Spain has been hit harder than any other European country by forest fires this year, according to the European Commission's Copernicus Earth observation program. Up to early August, 43 large wildfires - those affecting at least 1,235 acres - were recorded in the Mediterranean country, while the average in previous years was 11. The European Forest Fire Information System estimates Spain has seen 704,000 acres burn this year - four times more than the average since records began in 2006.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000182b635ddf6ada7bebd43840001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66D7-VB71-JBSK-R00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 19, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CA1V</classCode><className>TRAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

New research from the University of Georgia shows, for the first time, that these changes may affect what kind of treatment patients need to combat exposure to such pollutants.</p><p>\"We found that after emissions entered the atmosphere, there were changes in chemical composition that affected how they expressed their toxicity,\" said Rawad Saleh, assistant professor in the College of Engineering. \"The toxicity mechanisms are different if you're exposed to smoke directly from a fire, versus after it spends time in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>For the study, published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, Saleh and a team at UGA burned biomassoak foliage, pine needles and hickory twigsin an environmental chamber, then used UV radiation to initiate photochemical aging of the emissions. In a laboratory setting, they exposed human lung epithelial cells to the resulting aerosol.</p><p>How do wildfires affect the lungs?</p><p>The aerosol created by biomass burning is toxic to human lung epithelial cells, and the team's results indicate that the type of exposurefresh smoke versus aged smoke, for exampleaffects cells in different ways. Fresh smoke is worse at causing damage to mitochondria, which process food and produce energy at the cellular level. Aged smoke causes more oxidative stress, which can lead to cell death. Though damage from emissions exposure may be caused in different ways, on the surface it can appear to be the same.</p><p>\"There may be multiple people exposed to emissions from a forest fire that develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\" Saleh said. \"But our results suggest that someone exposed to fresh smoke, like a firefighter, might need different treatment for COPD than someone exposed to aged smoke 50 miles away from the fire. That's because the mechanisms causing the disease are different.\"</p><p>Elucidating these mechanisms will become more important, according to Saleh, as the pollutants in our atmosphere change over time.

This Northern Minnesota company is one of few companies in the US to manufacture thermally modified wood siding, decking, and dimensional lumber. McGruder's route to this game-changing start-up included more than a few adventures, including working as a photographer in the music industry, locally and around the country. His resume also includes multimedia work and social media campaigns for a number of Duluth businesses in a range of industries.</p><p>In 2022, McGruder joined Arbor Wood Co. and the affiliated firm, Intectural. Arbor Wood is part of a growing industry in thermally modified timber. Jon Heyesen, Arbor Wood CEO, and his team, worked closely with Duluth's Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI) as they developed and tested the new technology. NRRI secured funding from the National Science Foundation and partnered with Washington State University. NRRI obtained the required mechanical properties and accelerated aging tests for Arbor Wood to use in its processes.</p><p>The process heat treats wood in a low-oxygen kiln to enhance water and rot resistance and dimensional stability. Rot resistance is key. The moisture is essentially 'baked' out of the wood on a molecular level, leaving an equilibrium moisture content of around 6-7%. The wood is then used for super-durable, all-natural siding, decking, and other construction opportunities. Heyesen is encouraged by the reception.</p><p>Heyesen, McGruder, and the rest of the company are working toward a broad acceptance of thermally modified wood. Along with NRRI, they are developing products that are alternatives to top-grade lumber, chemically treated wood, and tropical hardwoods. One eventual goal is to use wood that poses forest fire hazards such as small-diameter ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine ash. Future experimentation includes using Minnesota's softer wood such as balsam fir.</p><p>McGruder combines the skills he learned at UMD in graphic design with his on-the-job and life experience in his current work. He remembers, \"Vicky Lehman was my first graphic design teacher, and she taught me all about typeface design.\" He recalls classes and adventures with Rob Wittig, Joellen Rock, Jennifer Gordon, and others. One expedition was a milestone. \"I studied graphic design in Istanbul with Robert Repinsky.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.d.umn.edu/articles/httpsnewsdumneduarticlesmax-mcgruder-2023\">https://news.d.umn.edu/articles/httpsnewsdumneduarticlesmax-mcgruder-2023</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8045137 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8045137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67CW-S601-JC11-11VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><timeReceived>11:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 18, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This paper uses remote sensing data on forest fires and remaining tree cover to estimate the effectiveness of a project targeted at reducing fire incidences in twelve protected forests in arid Burkina Faso. The project consisted of two components that were implemented in the villages surrounding the target forests: a campaign aimed at raising community awareness about the detrimental effects of forest fires, and a program to support establishing and maintaining forest fire prevention infrastructures. Using the Synthetic Control Method the paper finds that the project resulted in a 35% reduction in forest fire occurrences in the period of the year when they tend to be most prevalent --in November, at the very end of the agricultural season. However, this impact is short-lived (as the reduction only occurred in the first four years of the program). The reduction in forest fires also did not result in a detectable increase in vegetation cover--because the reduction in November was not sufficiently large to be captured via remote sensing, or because the duration of the reduction was too short for the vegetation to recover. The paper then tries to uncover the underlying mechanisms to shed light on which of the project's components were effective and to also learn how the program can be improved.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>In this paper we evaluated the impact of a forest fire prevention program in twelve of Burkina Faso's protected forests. Forest fires cause environmental damage in the form of both the increased emissions of greenhouse gasses and biodiversity loss. Forest fires are particularly damaging in arid regions because low precipitation results in fires spreading wider and vegetation regeneration being slower, resulting in forest fragmentation and degradation. Most of the forest fires in Burkina Faso are anthropogenic, with fire being used in economic activities such as agriculture (with the ashes acting as a natural fertilizer), cattle herding (to produce new shoots for grazing), hunting (to drive out game), or charcoal production. Reducing the frequency and size of man-made forest fires is thus essential for sustainable development, but evidence on effective fire reducing forest conservation policies is scarce.</p><p>The program we evaluate aimed to raise community awareness about the importance of preventing and mitigating forest fires, and to provide both the tools and knowledge necessary for forest fire containment. We use satellite images to monitor forest fire occurrences in each of Burkina Faso's 77 protected forests, for the period 2004-2019. We thus observe the frequency of forest fires in the intervention forests, and we use the Synthetic Control Method Abadie et al. (2010) to estimate each treatment forest's counterfactual outcome by assigning proper weights to each of the non-treatment forests.</p><p>We show that overall the program was not very effective in reducing forest fires. We find that the program reduced forest fires at the end of the agricultural season (in November) - after harvest, when farmers tend to use fire to burn the crop residue on their land. We do not detect any effects for any of the other months in the dry season, and also the vegetation cover was not significantly improved. Analyzing the forest fires' geographical spread suggests that the program was effective in reducing forest fires especially by means of better fire containment. The number of days a fire is detected on the average grid cell of treatment forests was reduced by 35% between 2014 and 2017, and we also find that the project's effectiveness tends to be stronger the more prevalent were the forest fires before the beginning of the program. Despite the initial success, the project's impact became statistically insignificant from 2018 onwards - even though the new institutions aimed at improving forest management, like the Forest Management Committees, were still in place. The project's impact was therefore quite temporary, and it also failed to significantly reduce the number of forest fires in any of the other months in the dry season. Probably as a result of this, we also find no significant increase in the amount of vegetation cover - either because the reduction in November forest fires was not sufficiently large to be captured via remote sensing, or because the size and duration of the treatment impact were not sufficient for the vegetation to recover. We thus conclude that just mitigating the geographical spread of post-harvest fires is not enough to substantially improve forest conservation, and that additional measures are needed to reduce not only the number of agriculture-related forest fires, but also the frequency and geographical spread of the fires emanating from other non-agricultural economic activities.</p><p>* * *</p><p>References</p><p>Abadie, A., 2021.

According to news reporting originating from Punjab, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have a wonderful potential to interconnect with the physical world and collect data. Data estimation, long lifespan, deployment, routing, task scheduling, safety, and localization are the primary performance difficulties for WSNs.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from IKG Punjab Technical University: \"WSNs are made up of sensor nodes set up with minimal battery power to monitor and reveal the occurrences in the sensor field. Detecting the location is a difficult task, but it is a crucial characteristic in many WSN applications. Locating all of the sensor nodes efficiently to obtain the precise location of an occurrence is a critical challenge. Surveillance, animal monitoring, tracking of moving objects, and forest fire detection are just a few of the applications that demand precise location determination. To cope with localization challenges in WSNs, there is a variety of localization algorithms accessible in the literature. The goal of this research is to use various optimization strategies to solve the localization problem. In this work, a modified learning enthusiasm-based teaching-learning-based optimization (mLebTLBO) algorithm is used to cope with a 2D localization problem applying the notion of an exclusive anchor node and movable target nodes.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"A modified LebTLBO algorithm seeks to increase overall efficiency by assessing the exploration and exploitation abilities. The computational results reveal that this technique outperforms others with respect to localization errors in a 2D environment of WSN.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Optimized Approach for Localization of Sensor Nodes in 2D Wireless Sensor Networks Using Modified Learning Enthusiasm-Based Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization Algorithm.

Four separate studies since 2016 show that 97%, 99%, more than 99% and 100%, respectively, of climate scientists were in agreement about this basic fact.</p><p>Greenhouse gases are the culprit: Atmospheric concentrations of carbon and methane are at all-time highs, and they have gotten worse in recent years even as the warnings have grown more dire. Emissions were estimated to be 12% higher in 2019 than in 2010 and 54% higher than in 1990. We have known the truth about global warming during all of that period, and failed to act, in large part due to factual charlatanism and political failures.</p><p>The consequences, if left unchecked, are dire: It's alarming - but not alarmist - to note that we are already seeing the effects of global warming, which will grow even worse if unchecked by dramatic reductions in greenhouse gases.</p><p>Heat waves and droughts are increasing. Spring snow cover is shrinking. Glaciers are retreating. The oceans are warming, rising and acidifying. The number of annual extreme weather events - record highs, once-in-a-century weather events - is growing. Wildfires are worsening. Coastal areas face particular challenges.</p><p>The IPCC said that more than 3 billion people around the planet are \"highly vulnerable\" to climate change, exposed to threats to food and water access, deadly extreme weather, and damage to coastal infrastructure. This includes communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South American, and small islands. Between 2010 and 2020, the IPCC reports, human mortality from floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in these highly vulnerable regions than in other places.</p><p>Warming is contributing to more wildfires: The number of large fires burning in the Western U.S. has grown dramatically since 1984, and there is evidence that global warming is a big reason. While it's true that there are many factors involved, including the amount of vegetation and forest management practices, researchers in 2016 concluded that the effects of global warming - increased drier vegetation and reduced snowpack, etc. - caused more than half the increases in \"fuel aridity\" since the 1970s and doubled the amount of land considered a \"forest fire area\" since 1984. There is also strong evidence that fires are getting bigger and burning longer - effects that are also associated with climate change.</p><p>The effects in our region are already widespread: The annual average temperature has risen almost 2 degrees since 1900 in Idaho, Oregon and Washington, according to the USDA's Northwest Climate Hub. (Alaska's annual temperature has risen more than anywhere else, increasing by 3 degrees since 1925).</p><p>Precipitation trends are changing, with a reduction in summer rain and more winter precipitation falling as rain, rather than snow. Snowpacks are smaller, overall, and they melt earlier in the spring. Droughts are more common and expected to increase. More warming is expected to worsen these consequences.</p><p>The \"hockey stick\" is accurate: People trying to stupidify the public like to claim that the so-called hockey stick graphic - which shows the historical trend in global temperatures as a \"handle\" of relative stability for centuries followed by a rising \"blade\" of temperature increases in the late 20th century - has been \"discredited.\"</p><p>That is flatly wrong. The hockey stick is roughly as discredited as the results of the 2020 election - in other words, not at all discredited, except among those who consume a junk-fact diet. The basic pattern of the temperature rise has been confirmed more than a dozen times, according to Scientific American.</p><p>Robin Lamboll, a British climate scientist, put it this way: \"The different ways to estimate historic climates have become more numerous, but all with broadly the same message, and so the conclusions of the original graph have become only more solid since 1999.\"</p><p>Significant change is required: Some consequences are inevitable at this point, but the worst effects of warming can be offset by \"deep, rapid, and sustained global greenhouse gas emissions reduction,\" the IPCC said.</p><p>The best estimates now predict that warming will likely exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius in this century - avoiding the 2-degree rise seen as urgent to avoid the worst consequences. It is far from certain that the world is taking the steps to avoid that. Deep cuts in emissions could result in a \"discernable slowdown\" in warming within 20 years. What it will take, the IPCC said, is \"net zero CO2 emissions\" - meaning an elimination of carbon emissions or a balance between carbon emitted into the atmosphere and carbon removed.</p><p>Is there the political will and widespread scientific understanding to make this happen? In a paper published last year in the journal Nature, scientists estimated that there was a slightly higher than 50% chance that the we can avoid a 2-degree rise in temperatures this century - if all the pledges countries made under the Paris Agreement are kept.</p><p>Which is a big if.</p><p>It's past time to ignore the doubt merchants and act: \"The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now and for thousands of years,\" the IPCC concluded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-43177400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695T-DKX1-JC0C-J1B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>MAIN Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 13, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

Canada has about 500 fires burning with over 220 blazes burning \"out of control,\" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Canada is experiencing its worst fire season primarily because of global warming, including lower forest soil moisture and much higher temperatures in the boreal region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Historic boreal forests are drying, heating up, and burning in Canada and Russia. Arctic temperatures are rising nearly four times faster than the planetary average. Meanwhile, boreal areas of the world, from Russia to Canada, are running much hotter than the global average.</p><p>In addition to a wide range of naturally emitted respirable particles, these forest fires re-emit lead and mercury deposited by past fossil fuel burning. With the remobilization of these dangerous metals, we are breathing pollution from the past.</p><p>While we have long known about dangerous lead and mercury emissions from forest fires, until recently, it was unknown whether the pollutants released during forest fires were from natural or industrial sources. One study that measured isotopic lead composition in ash from the 2009 Jesusita Fire in southern California showed that the ash from the wildfire contained industrial lead primarily from leaded gasoline used in Southern California from the 1960s through the 1980s.</p><p>We are experiencing breakneck environmental changes, including heat waves, Derechos, severe rain bombs, massive global forest fires, and more intense hurricanes. In short, as we all breathe the toxic smoke in Pittsburgh, we are just beginning to experience the many impacts of a climate crisis. We can all witness the unambiguous message in the weirding of our world's climate. I am at a loss to explain how so many in Congress sit back and do nothing when ocean temperatures are off-the-charts this year.</p><p>The earth is nearing the 1.5 C. threshold that climate scientists have long warned us about. Ice that once covered much of the Arctic will vanish in summer sometime this decade. Permafrost is rapidly turning to methane-leaking wetlands, creating dangerous feedback. Boreal forests encroach on the warming tundra, further destabilizing the Arctic region.</p><p>Meteorologists have been predicting that we will experience a hotter-than-normal summer. El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o, coupled with climate change, will increase global temperatures. Summer temperatures have steadily increased over the past three decades from climate pollution. A warming climate will result in more and worse heat waves, wildfires, and other extreme weather events. Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas are currently experiencing a deadly heat dome.</p><p>The climate crisis is an unprecedented global threat facing all humanity and nature. Staggering fossil fuel emissions must end, and we all have a role to play. Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and cement are not decreasing. Despite all the warnings, carbon pollution actually increased by 1.0% in 2022, hitting a new record high of 36.6 billion tons of CO2.</p><p>With many Federal carrots in the Inflation Reduction Act and few sticks to constrict carbon pollution, governmental policies must move faster to avoid a full-blown climate crisis. At the same time, misdirected state policies and deeply flawed SCOTUS decisions are making things worse. We must acknowledge our individual roles in the global crisis.</p><p>It is everybody's problem. Let us not be guilty of making it someone else's problem. It is time to turn down the global thermostat and that takes all of us.</p><p>* We can help avoid a full-blown crisis by installing solar panels or buying clean energy (wind and solar) others produce. With thirty-five solar panels, our home manufactures and sells more solar than we can use daily in our home and EV. We buy wind at night. It turns out we sell more clean energy than we buy.</p><p>* Make your next vehicle electric and charge it with clean energy, preferably from your solar panels. Not everyone can afford a new car, but those who can, should.</p><p>* Take advantage of the federal tax incentives to encourage clean energy production and energy conservation and enjoy low-cost energy as a producer.</p><p>* Compost and grow a garden. Food from a home organic garden has a very low carbon footprint. Coupled with composting, it can have a positive carbon impact.</p><p>Time is short, and the job requires all of us to act now. I saw a sign that caught my attention. It said, \"Living more sustainable is not a hippy thing. It is a survival thing.\"</p><p>Larry Schweiger is chair of the Climate Reality Action Fund and the past President of the National Wildlife Federation and the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Associated Press: Haze from the Canadian forest fires hangs over PNC Park at a Pirates game in late June.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-230711115933211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NP-Y1F1-DYRS-T1SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 P.G.

The 24-story apartment tower went up in flames on Wednesday, June 14 in West London. The flammable material used for the cladding of the building is banned in both Europe and the United States. The Grenfell Tower building regulations are now under investigation.</p><p>Russia - Russia warns the United States-led coalition fighting in Syria that it will be tracked by Russian anti-aircraft forces in both the sky and the ground and treated as targets. A statement was released by the Russian defence ministry after the U.S. shot down a Syrian military plan on Sunday, June 18.</p><p>United Kingdom - In London, a van drove into a crowd by a mosque early on June 19. The attack injured 10 people. According to the police, all the victims were Muslims. This is the third incident that involved a vehicle being driven into a crowd in the city.</p><p>France - In Paris, a motorist crashed his car into a police convoy. The attacker was pulled out of the car. Investigators found more weapons and explosives inside the vehicle. They believe it was a terrorist attack due to the amount of gas canisters that didn't explode. The French authorities have not named the dead suspect but he was known to the police.</p><p>United States - Otto Frederick Warmbier passed away six days after he was released from imprisonment in North Korea. The 22-year-old arrived in Cincinnati on June 13 after being held in prison in North Korea for 18 months. He was returned in a coma after a result of sleeping pills and toxins. He was held in prison for stealing a political propaganda poster.</p><p>Portugal - Portugal's deadliest forest fire continues to burn the districts of Leiria and Castelo Branca. The fire started Saturday, June 16 and killed 63 and injured 70. Portugal media outlets blame a lack of coordination between services in charge of fire prevention and firefighting and poor forestry reserve planning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5447364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:671V-HY61-DY7P-T0F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"323\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mirror: Fairfield University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 30, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Fairfield</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLPS</classCode><className>2017 GRENFELL TOWER FIRE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

The revenue part of the EU budget also continues to be free from material error, like in previous years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Commission takes note of ECA`s reserves as regards the regularity of expenditure under both the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A strong and flexible EU budget to overcome major crisis</p><p>In 2022, just as the global economy was beginning to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia launched a war of aggression against Ukraine. In that context, the EU budget provided crucial support to Ukraine, while at the same time supporting those affected by the socio-economic consequences of the war. The EU budget assisted Ukraine and the Member States with Euros15.4 billion, while support from the RRF - for a total of Euros138.7 billion in 2022 - has continued to foster inclusive green and digital transitions through concrete reforms and investments.</p><p>The EU budget also delivered on the EU's climate commitments and achieved tangible results for households across Europe. In 2022, Euros119.4 billion were dedicated to measures contributing to climate objectives, representing 36% of the EU budget and NextGenerationEU. Through cohesion policy, 22 million citizens benefitted from flood protection and 19 million citizens benefitted from forest fire related measures.</p><p>Despite the more difficult market environment, encountered by all issuers, the demand for EU bonds remained high in 2022. The Commission is implementing a debt management strategy that aims to build a strong and liquid issuance programme. Thanks to its funding strategy, the Commission has further strengthened its already well-established name in debt markets.</p><p>Commission's views on ECA report on the 2022 EU budget</p><p>The Commission recalls that the estimated level of error reported by the ECA is not a measure of fraud, inefficiency, or waste. It is an estimate of EU expenditure made that did not comply with certain rules. For operations under the MFF the Commission does not always share the ECA's assessment on whether an irregularity has taken place, or on how to assess the financial impact of the errors identified. This leads to different conclusions on the extent and depth of the issues identified in certain policy areas.</p><p>As regards the implementation of the RRF, the Commission welcomes that the ECA agrees with the Commission's assessment of the vast majority of milestones and targets included in the 2022 RRF grant payments. The Commission disagrees however with the ECA's findings of limited instances of irregular RRF payments. The Commission also notes that, in any case, the ECA's estimated financial impact for what it alleges are irregular RRF payments is below the materiality threshold of 2%. We maintain that all RRF payments in 2022 were made correctly.</p><p>The Commission keeps improving the management of the EU budget to reduce the risk of errors</p><p>Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of checks performed by national authorities, other partners, and the Commission itself, the Commission knows where the risks are for the EU budget and can take targeted remedial actions, both before and after payments are made. The objective of the Commission is to ensure that, once a programme is closed, and all controls and corrections are carried out, the remaining level of error is well below 2%. This objective was achieved for 2022, as the Commission estimates, based on projected future corrections, the risk at the closure of the programmes to be at 0.9%.</p><p>The Commission continues to improve its financial management of the EU budget as necessary. As the main source of errors is the complexity of the rules for implementing partners and beneficiaries, the Commission introduced simplifications for the 2021-2027 programmes, including the roll-out of electronic management of all grants for programmes managed directly by the Commission. In addition, the Commission continues to extend the use of simplified forms of funding to further reduce the administrative burden for final recipients, starting with small and medium enterprises. The Commission also keeps working closely with the Member States and other partners towards ensuring a sound financial management of the EU funds.</p><p>As regards the RRF the Commission has to a large degree already implemented ECA's recommendation to improve its internal processes for the assessment of payment requests compared to the financial year 2022. In addition, the Commission has over the last year significantly increased the level of clarity and transparency of its assessment procedures. In 2023, also taking into account the recommendations of the European Parliament, the Council and the European Court of Auditors, the Commission further strengthened the robustness of its control framework to provide additional assurance on the regular use of RRF funds and the effective protection of the Union's financial interests, thereby complementing the primary responsibility that lies with the Member States.</p><p>Background</p><p>The publication of the Annual Report of the ECA, and the presentation of the Integrated Financial Accountability Reporting (IFAR) package to the European Parliament, kicks off the annual 'discharge procedure' of the EU budget to take stock of the achievements of the EU budget in 2022.</p><p>The IFAR is a package of Commission's reports that provides detailed information, from different angles, about how the EU budget was implemented. These reports are key to ensure transparency and accountability on how taxpayers' money is used.</p><p>When deciding whether to grant, postpone or refuse the discharge, the European Parliament takes into consideration the IFAR package prepared by the Commission, the ECA Annual Report and any relevant ECA Special Reports.</p><p>The European Commission works hand in hand with the Member States, and other partners, to ensure that the EU budget continues to be spent effectively, to the benefit of citizens, remains protected from fraud and irregularities and helps achieve concrete results according to the Union's policy priorities.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For More Information</p><p>Integrated Financial and Accountability Reporting 2022 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://commission.europa.eu/publications/integrated-financial-and-accountability-reporting-2022_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/publications/integrated-financial-and-accountability-reporting-2022_en</url>)</p><p>Annual management and performance report 2022 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://commission.europa.eu/publications/annual-management-and-performance-report-2022-0_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/publications/annual-management-and-performance-report-2022-0_en</url>)</p><p>Factsheet - Delivering on results and protecting the EU budget in 2022 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/4af79d5e-b682-436d-ad75-987a1f3d0d51_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/document/4af79d5e-b682-436d-ad75-987a1f3d0d51_en</url>)</p><p>Official website of the European Court of Auditors (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eca.europa.eu/en\">https://www.eca.europa.eu/en</url>)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quote(s)</p><p>In 2022, the EU budget contributed to support Ukraine and to cushion the economic impact of Russia's unjustified war.

(AP) \u2014 Firefighters have significantly slowed the spread of a California forest fire near Yosemite National Park, allowing officials to lift some evacuation orders for residents of remote mountain communities.</p><p>By Wednesday, the Oak Fire in Mariposa County had churned through more than 29 square miles (75 square kilometers) of tinder-dry trees and brush, with 32% containment, Cal Fire said.</p><p>At least 74 houses and other structures have been destroyed.</p><p>Fire spokesperson Chris Garcia said around 3,800 people were allowed to return to their homes starting Tuesday. About 2,200 residents remain under evacuation orders.</p><p>Ground crews with air support got a break from increased humidity and lower temperatures as monsoonal moisture moved through the Sierra Nevada foothills early this week.</p><p>\u201cThey're definitely making good progress,\" Garcia said of firefighters working in steep, rugged terrain.</p><p>Officials were investigating the cause of the fire sparked last Friday southwest of the park, near the town of Midpines.</p><p>California has experienced increasingly larger and deadlier wildfires in recent years as climate change has made the West much warmer and drier over the past 30 years. Scientists have said weather will continue to be more extreme and wildfires more frequent, destructive and unpredictable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-c95bc139487bab4196339b22372df94620220727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:661B-KNS1-DYMD-6196-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"219\"/><timeReceived>5:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

(\u201cHarfang\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V: HAR) is pleased to announce that its summer field campaign is set to begin on its portfolio of highly prospective gold and lithium properties in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region, Qu\u00e9bec (Figure\u00a01). With recent lithium discoveries, new advances in already existing resources and the Qu\u00e9bec strategy on Critical and Strategic Minerals (\u201cCSM\u201d), this region has taken centre stage for lithium exploration in Canada.</p><p>Commented Ian Campbell, President and CEO,\u201cWe are ready and excited to initiate our $1.5\u00a0M summer 2023\u00a0exploration program that will focus on the exploration of our extensive portfolio of properties in James Bay, some of which have the potential to host both gold and lithium deposits. We are well positioned throughout the entire region in which our team has extensive operational experience. Our summer program will be a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d approach including both a geological and prospecting evaluation, combined with onsite geochemistry with the focussed objective of rapidly developing high-priority drill targets on both gold and lithium projects. This program will begin as soon as the province-wide restrictions imposed by the Qu\u00e9bec government as a result of the regional forest fire situation are lifted. We are not aware of any of our projects being directly affected by these fires at this time and we are closely monitoring the situation.\u201d</p><p>Gold Exploration Program</p><p>Lake Menarik Property</p><p>The Lake Menarik Property is characterized by multiple high-grade gold occurrences hosted in a polyphase intermediate intrusion (syenite, monzonite and monzodiorite) and adjacent volcano-sedimentary rocks (Figure\u00a02). The geological setting of Lake Menarik is reminiscent of that of the Timmins mining camp based on the occurrence of gold-bearing monzonite/syenite intrusions, volcanic and sedimentary rocks including a Timiskaming-type conglomerate, and lamprophyres.</p><p>The recently completed maiden shallow drill program that mainly focussed on the Pierre Monzonite area, successfully demonstrated that wide zones of gold mineralization associated with increasing intensity of alteration extend at depth in the southeast area of the monzonite. These observations were highlighted by 21.0\u00a0metres grading 1.75 g/t Au including 14.1\u00a0metres grading 2.49\u00a0g/t\u00a0Au (LMN-23-01), 75.0\u00a0metres grading 0.54\u00a0g/t Au including 3.0\u00a0metres grading 6.75\u00a0g/t Au and 1.0\u00a0metres grading 12.65\u00a0g/t Au (LMN-23-04), and 47.0\u00a0metres grading 1.15\u00a0g/t Au including 7.0\u00a0metres grading 3.75\u00a0g/t Au (LMN-23-17) (see news release dated May 11, 2023).</p><p>The planned field campaign is designed to generate additional drill targets and will focus on advancing the overall understanding of the geological model east of the Pierre monzonite and several other target areas. These areas include the Induced Polarization (\u201cIP\u201d) anomalies hosted in the Timiskaming-type conglomerate, the Greco gold showing adjacent to mining claims acquired last fall (1.04\u00a0g/t Au over 24.9\u00a0metres [channel]), and the 2022 discoveries such as the Oswald showing (up to 17.30\u00a0g/t Au, 217\u00a0g/t Ag and 0.61% Pb [grab samples] and up to 6.34\u00a0g/t Au, 60\u00a0g/t Ag and 0.09% Pb over 0.4\u00a0metres [channel]) and the ankerite zones (up to 2.87\u00a0g/t Au in grab samples) extending up to 700\u00a0metres long and 50\u00a0metres wide. This program will be enhanced by recent geophysical data from the IP survey and the detailed heliborne magnetic survey also flown over the contiguous Menarik East Property. Harfang has also designed a till survey to cover the eastern part of the Lake Menarik Property.</p><p>Lithium Exploration Program</p><p>Harfang will conduct a first-phase surface exploration program (prospecting, mapping, rock sampling) on its assets favourable for lithium occurrences. This program includes prospecting on the Serpent-Radisson and La Passe claims and on the new acquired Lemare, Ewart, Sakami, Ross and Conviac properties. These new assets were acquired by map designation following a recent geological compilation and a statistical processing of more than 13,400\u00a0analyses of lake bottom sediments extracted from the Qu\u00e9bec government digital database (SIGEOM) (see news releases dated on January 19 and February 8, 2023). The main objective of this program is to find Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum Pegmatite (\u201cLCT Pegmatite\u201d) warranting more advanced exploration, including drilling. More detailed information is given below for Serpent-Radisson, Lemare and Lake Menarik properties.</p><p>Serpent-Radisson Property</p><p>In 2022, Harfang conducted a preliminary prospecting program in the southeastern portion of the Property, already known for its gold and copper occurrences, to assess the potential for LCT Pegmatite. The program quickly led to the discovery of several pegmatite dykes, some containing highly anomalous beryllium (up to 25,000 ppm), cesium (up to 998\u00a0ppm), lithium (up to 1,420\u00a0ppm), niobium (up to 278\u00a0ppm), rubidium (up to 1,095\u00a0ppm) and tantalum (up to 173 ppm). The program for Serpent-Radisson will mainly focus on the follow-up on these discoveries since the Company believes this area contains significant potential based on the presence of a fertile S-type granite located in the immediate area. In addition, the field crew will continue prospecting the Property for gold, particularly in a large sector where 65\u00a0soil samples (up to 2.27\u00a0g/t Au) defined a gold anomaly covering 2.2 km2 (see news release dated October 5, 2022).</p><p>Lemare Property</p><p>The Lemare Property consists of 269\u00a0claims located approximately 20\u00a0kilometres southeast of the Whabouchi lithium deposit owned by Nemaska Lithium (\u201cNemaska\u201d). Nemaska recently signed a long-term agreement with the Ford Motor Company for the supply of lithium products including lithium hydroxide, as North American automakers race to secure supplies of battery materials to meet the electric vehicle output. The Lemare Property includes several strong lake bottom sediment lithium anomalies of which four are \u226599.5th percentile of the entire SIGEOM database. Some of these calculated anomalies form a tight cluster in an area dominated by granite and pegmatite of the Opatica Subprovince.</p><p>Lake Menarik Property (Southwestern Part)</p><p>The southwestern portion of the Lake Menarik Property, west of the Billy-Diamond Highway, was staked last fall for its lithium and gold potential (Figure 3). Harfang is planning prospecting on these claims that have seen little historical exploration. Known mafic volcanic rocks on the Property offer a favourable geological setting for hosting lithium-bearing pegmatite. These volcanics are part of the same rock unit that hosts the Mia lithium occurrences located 25\u00a0kilometres to the southwest.</p><p>Actual Forest Fires Situation</p><p>On June 3, the minist\u00e8re des Ressources naturelles et des For\u00eats du Qu\u00e9bec issued a news release prohibiting access to the forest on lands of the public domain and on the closure of roads for consideration of public interest. The news release can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/incendies-de-foret-modification-du-territoire-touche-par-linterdiction-dacces-en-foret-sur-les-terres-du-domaine-de-letat-et-par-la-fermeture-de-chemins-48424\">https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/incendies-de-foret-modification-du-territoire-touche-par-linterdiction-dacces-en-foret-sur-les-terres-du-domaine-de-letat-et-par-la-fermeture-de-chemins-48424</url>.</p><p>The recent restrictions imposed by the Qu\u00e9bec government, as a result of the regional forest fire situation, have temporarily halted mining exploration operations in northern Qu\u00e9bec.

That is equivalent to more than 220,000 soccer fields, or more than twice the size of New York city.</p><p>Northern Lao PDR saw the most forest encroachment, with about 5.7 million rai converted to maize farms since 2015. In Myanmar's Shan state, 3.1 million rai of forest was destroyed, while northern Thailand saw 2.9 million rai turned into corn cultivation.</p><p>\"Mass maize farming is moving from northern Thailand to Myanmar and Laos, where it's harder for us to monitor and engage with local communities due to the political situation,\" Tara said.</p><p>In total, maize farming increased more than 38% from 13 million rai to 18 million rai - almost the size of Belgium - between 2015 and 2023, according to Greenpeace.</p><p>The report also showed that the hot spots areas with fires according to satellite data in maize farming areas during the cultivation season grew from 31% in 2020 to 41% this year.</p><p>Another 42% of this year's hot spot was attributable to forest fires. The rest was rice paddy and other crop plantation-related hot spots.</p><p>\"Our study shows that the maize industry continues to play a key role in destroying forests in the Mekong subregion,\" Tara said.</p><p>\"It is also primarily responsible for the toxic air pollution that has become an annual affair... It shouldn't have been a 'haze season' every start of the year.\"</p><p>Culprits of worsening air pollution</p><p>Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand are among the top 30 countries with the worst air pollution, according to a study released on Aug. 29 by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).</p><p>The fine particles PM2.5 count for Southeast Asia's most polluted country, Myanmar, was almost 35 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00ce\u00bcg/m3), seven times worse than the World Health Organization's air quality guideline, according to EPIC's Air Quality Life Index.</p><p>In Lao PDR, the PM2.5 was around 27 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3, while in Thailand, it was around 23 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3.</p><p>Earlier this year, many areas in northern Thailand, Myanmar and Laos remained blanketed in toxic haze for weeks due to out-of-control wildfires and agricultural burning, with more than two million people hospitalized with respiratory issues in Thailand alone.</p><p>Experts say the deteriorating air pollution during the region's crop cultivation season started after Thailand imposed zero tariffs for maize imported from Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia to support the cross-border contract farming program about two decades ago.</p><p>Thailand is now among the world's largest animal feed producers, and one of the largest for pork and poultry too. Maize is the primary ingredient, making up over a third of the animal feed.</p><p>Despite the smog, many maize farmers in the region continue to burn the remains because it is the easiest way to get rid of the stubble to prepare for subsequent cultivation. However, smallholder farmers should not be solely blamed since they do not have an alternative, experts have told RFA.</p><p>\"We observe heavily indebted and disempowered farmers with weak land tenure, severe soil erosion, constantly engaged in land conflicts with the state, virtually forced to encroach upon forests, and blamed by society for widespread air pollution at a regional level,\" said one research paper published this month in the Resources, Environment and Sustainability journal.</p><p>\"The corporate players are the winners in this system, whereas farmers and the environment are losers.\"</p><p>RFA Burmese made several calls to contact Myanmar military officials but did not get a response. Shan state's junta-appointed government spokesperson, Khun Thein Maung, told RFA that local government officials from Myanmar and Thailand are discussing the issue.</p><p>\"In fact, there was no burning on our side. There is no proof,\" he said, adding that corn plantation areas have expanded by a few acres but \"not doubled or tripled\" to meet demand for local animal feed and foreign export.</p><p>\"Residents are benefitting from it. Farmers make money from the business. It supports the socio-economic life in the region,\" he said, adding that no big agro-industry is involved.</p><p>A Shan state-based environmental activist, who asked not to be named, fearing retribution, told RFA that maize cultivation increased during the previous NLD government.</p><p>\"49% of corn cultivation in Myanmar is in Shan state, contributing to 55% of the total production. But little has been done to educate local farmers about shifting cultivation and burning of stubble [which often] causes forest fires,\" he said.</p><p>In Laos, the \"government has taken strict measures to reduce slash-and-burn cultivation,\" an official from the agriculture and forestry department of Oudomxay Province told RFA.</p><p>\"The provincial authorities in northern Laos have issued notices telling farmers to stop burning forest and to prevent the forest fire and prevent it from spreading.\"</p><p>The Thai government did not respond to RFA requests for comment, with some officials saying that they are waiting for policy directives from the newly-formed government.</p><p>In 2020, the five Lower Mekong governments created a Chiang Rai Plan of Action to reduce the hotspots by 30% and 40% by 2023 and 2025 respectively.</p><p>However, Greenpeace data showed that the hot spots have actually increased slightly, from 161,728 in 2020 to 162,218 in 2023.</p><p>It is \"a complete policy failure\" by the governments, Tara said.</p><p>RFA Lao, Kyaw Lwin Oo from RFA Burmese, and Nontarat Phaicharoen from BenarNews, an online news outlet affiliated with RFA, contributed to this report.</p><p>Edited by Elaine Chan and Mike Firn.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126126542</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6956-N3Y1-JCBF-S40N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 12, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good young men. Nowhere to hide. The fire was relentless.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week marks the 83rd memorial anniversary of the worst forest fire disaster in Wyoming history when it came to loss of firefighter lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an obscure and difficult place to reach called Blackwater, a group of forest rangers and Civilian Conservation Corps firefighters lost their lives on Aug. 21, 1937.</p><p>Lightning started the fire that burned some 1,700 acres in the Shoshone National Forest west of Cody on that fateful day.</p><p>Although the fire began on Aug. 18, it slept and was not detected until two days later. Some 58 men were deployed in the area.</p><p>A weather event called a \"dry cold front\" was instrumental in the fire blowing up and engulfing the crew that died. Nine men perished immediately, and another six died later of their horrific burns. Another 38 men suffered injuries as almost the entire crew was injured or killed in the conflagration.</p><p>The cause was later specified as an undiscovered \"hot spot\" that was rapidly expanded by this weather condition that can move into an area so fast. Back in 1937, before satellites, technology was not in place in helping to predict weather.</p><p>Lander's Karl Brauneis is a national expert on forest fires, and cites several changes to firefighting brought about by tragedies like the Blackwater.</p><p>\"The development of a fixed lookout detection system, coupled with aerial detection and the 'Ten Standard Fire Orders,' all helped keep fires smaller and safer for the men who fought them,\" he said. \"The 1939 Smokejumper program of fast aerial initial attack by parachute was in direct response to the Blackwater tragedy. Soon, a very aggressive system of prevention, detection and control was in place nationwide.\"</p><p>Karl laments the loss of so many fire lookout towers in recent years and believes that many should be rebuilt to help provide for early detection.</p><p>But the key to better firefighting management, according to Karl, has been the loss of our federal timber sale program. Federal timber not only provided for American jobs and reduced fuel loads, but also paid for school districts, county roads and bridges, and, most importantly, the large Forest Service crews that planted trees, piled brush and built trails. Those crews were all financed by the timber sold and were not linked to the appropriated federal budget.</p><p>The recollection of this horrible Cody-area fire was also on my mind seven years ago, as more than 200 firefighters dealt with a fast-moving fire that ripped through Sinks Canyon State Park and the southern end of the Shoshone National Forest just outside of Lander.</p><p>Smoke covered our town, and we could watch the flames from our deck.</p><p>A development called Homestead Park, with about 30 homes and cabins, came within 50 yards of being burned. A huge DC10 jet tanker that was based in Casper that year dropped about 11,000 gallons of slurry on the fire during each pass and appeared to be the decisive factor in saving the subdivision.</p><p>To me, the power of that fire was relentless. I was worried it might follow the river bottom all the way to Lander. Instead, the fire was limited to about 2,000 acres.</p><p>Such losses by fire have been detailed in two of the best books that I have read. They are just amazing works.</p><p>\"Young Men and Fire\" is a book by Montanan Norman Maclean, who also wrote \"A River Runs Through It.\" Maclean is an amazingly conservative writer who labors on each word. It takes him over 10 years to produce a book. His book is the story about a fire in the Gates of the Mountain area of Montana in 1949 that killed 13 smokejumpers.</p><p>Author Timothy Egan wrote \"The Big Burn,\" which detailed a massive fire that covered the state of Idaho in 1909-10 and killed more than 100 brave, but ill-equipped firefighters.</p><p>Those fires and the politics behind its non-suppression helped preserve the fledgling U.S. Forest Service, which was being attacked and decimated by powerful members of Congress working for the big lumber companies. It took a mighty effort by President Teddy Roosevelt and USFS head Gifford Pinchot to keep the service in place.</p><p>In 2020, we are primed for a horrible fire season in Wyoming. Pray for rain, and if you live in the trees, you may want to create a nice clearing around your property.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Bill Sniffin</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WYTRIB-802bfd92e17d11ea98f700163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WYTRIB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-2851-DYVF-910N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162642</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Adams Publishing Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle (Cheyenne)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>bill sniffin</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

According to news originating from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Satellite remote sensing plays an important role in wildfire detection.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Heilongjiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"Methods using the brightness and temperature difference of remote sensing images to determine if a wildfire has occurred are one of the main research directions of forest fire monitoring. However, common wildfire detection algorithms are mainly based on a fixed brightness temperature threshold to distinguish wildfire pixels and non-wildfire pixels, which reduces the applicability of the algorithm in different space-time regions. This paper presents an adaptive wildfire detection algorithm, DBTDW, based on a dynamic brightness temperature threshold. First, a regression dataset, MODIS_DT_Fire, was constructed based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometry (MODIS) to determine the wildfire brightness temperature threshold. Then, based on the meteorological information, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) information, and elevation information provided by the dataset, the DBTDW algorithm was used to calculate and obtain the minimum brightness temperature threshold of the burning area by using the Planck algorithm and Otsu algorithm. Finally, six regression models were trained to establish the correlation between factors and the dynamic brightness temperature threshold of wildfire.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate the regression performance. The results show that under the XGBoost model, the DBTDW algorithm has the best prediction effect on the dynamic brightness temperature threshold of wildfire (leave-one-out method: RMSE/MAE = 0.0730). Compared with the method based on a fixed brightness temperature threshold, the method proposed in this paper to adaptively determine the brightness temperature threshold of wildfire has higher universality, which will help improve the effectiveness of satellite remote fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Wildfire Detection Algorithm Based on the Dynamic Brightness Temperature Threshold.

All proceeds will support wildfire prevention and conservation throughOne Tree Planted, a non-profit organization dedicated to global reforestation.</p><p>Utilizing the eco-friendly blockchainSolana, the FIREWATCH project aims to flip the script on conversations about NFT's and the environment, proving that it is more than possible to operate the technology sustainably. On average, NFT transactions use 340 kilowatt hours of energy, which is more than one-third of the energy a typical American home consumes in one month. In comparison, Solana transactions expend less energy than three Google searches and 17 times less energy than a full phone charge.</p><p>\"We are thrilled to launch the FIREWATCH project and leverage our expertise in sustainable web development to promote reforestation and forest fire resiliency at a time when it is so urgently needed\", says Ashish Toshniwal, Founder and CEO of YML. \"As NFTs are still in their relative infancy, we are also excited to demonstrate how this emerging technology can be harnessed for positive change.\"</p><p>This project comes at a time when global climate change is becoming increasingly urgent. 2020 and 2021 recorded the highest number of California wildfires in history, with more than 4 million acres burned in the state. Additionally, with the current state of the environment, climate scientists predict a 50% surge in wildfires by 2050 (source: CalFire). Through FIREWATCH, YML anticipates generating more than $1M in funds benefitting fire prevention and restoration projects across the state of California.</p><p>\"We all have a role to play in protecting the environment and combating climate change, and we admire YML's dedication to being an innovative force for good.\" says Matt Hill, Founder &amp; Chief Environmental Evangelist at One Tree Planted. \"With YML's support, we're restoring areas across California that have been degraded by wildfires, as well as protecting California's forests from future fires with innovative forest fire prevention projects.\"</p><p>\"It's exciting to see FIREWATCH utilize NFTs on Solana to mobilize community and action around climate change,\" said Amira Valliani, policy lead at the Solana Foundation. \"NFTs are becoming an increasingly popular way for communities to come together around shared causes. Solana's advantages as an eco-friendly, low cost chain make it an excellent home for projects like these.\"</p><p>The FIREWATCH project is currently live at\u00a0https://firewatch.fundwhere NFT units can be purchased based on four tiers \u2014 $100, $500, $3,000 and $100,000.\u00a0</p><p>About YML:</p><p>YML (Y Media Labs) is a design and technology agency bringing Silicon Valley to the world by creating award-winning digital products and experiences.

Experts gathered to share main outcomes, exchange experiences, and discuss the way forward. This project was funded by the Government of Italy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The workshop covered two key components focusing on the Forest Fire Information Management System for early warning in Ethiopia, which was implemented by the Disaster Risk Management Commission (DRMC) of Ethiopia and UNDRR, with the technical and scientific support of the CIMA Research Foundation. This project was developed in the context of the \"Africa Road Map for Improving the Availability, Access and Use of Disaster Risk Information for Early Warning and Early Action, including in the Context of Transboundary Risk Management\"[1]. Technologies, including the MyDEWETRA[2] platform, an open-source web-based system for real-time monitoring and forecasting of natural hazards and the forest fire forecasting model RISICO were deployed to assist the issuance and dissemination of early warnings for early actions across Ethiopia.</p><p>Thomas Tamanini, Programme Coordinator at Italian Agency for Development Cooperation, Addis Ababa. said, \"This is only a start to build the multi-hazard early warning systems for early action, which will include floods, droughts among other natural hazards. The goal is to put in place preventive measures for people affected.\"</p><p>Amjad Abbashar, Chief, UNDRR Regional Office for Africa, noted \"I am pleased that this work on early warning and preparedness is also part of a greater initiative implemented in collaboration with national, regional, and continental partners. In this respect, it contributes to a wider network of activities, focused on improving the availability and quality of risk information for early warning and early action.\"</p><p>Nesibu Yasin Seid, Deputy Commissioner, Disaster Risk Management Commission said \"The project on disaster risk reduction in general, and the forest fire information management system in particular, is important for the early warning systems for early action in Ethiopia since the country faces many potential risks. \"</p><p>The other component discussed was the Risk Sensitive Budget Review of Ethiopia. This was carried out with the aim of supporting the DRMC in tracking and promoting investments that contribute to DRR in Ethiopia. The outcome of this review uses evidence on Ethiopia's domestic resources and official development assistance dedicated to DRR activities. It also provides Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) information on consolidated sectoral planned and/or actual spending.</p><p>\"This project is only the beginning. I hope each and every partner will keep working effectively together to come up with fruitful results\", said Girma Kabtamu, Director General, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (EFCCC).</p><p>Finally, the project also produced a working paper \"Assessing vulnerabilities to disaster displacement: a good practice review for stakeholders working on displacement, including those collaborating within the Durable Solutions Initiative in Ethiopia. The Durable Solutions Initiative was developed by the Government of Ethiopia, the United Nations, international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and donors for communities affected by internal displacement in the country. The DSI provides a principled operational framework to guide the work of all partners to support internally displaced persons to rebuild their lives in sustainable ways. The working paper was undertaken with UNDRR's partner, the International Institute for Environment and Development, a policy and action research organisation.</p><p>[1] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undrr.org/publication/africa-road-map-improving-availability-access-and-use-disaster-risk-information-early\">https://www.undrr.org/publication/africa-road-map-improving-availability-access-and-use-disaster-risk-information-early</url></p><p>[2] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mydewetra.world\">https://www.mydewetra.world</url>/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124870071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6469-BKD1-JCBF-S04V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 29, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Perhaps surprisingly, everyone else had, too. The collaged, Easter egg\u2013laden set was an immediate hit in cover meetings at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and the first book had hit shelves, but then Strick says a literary agent intervened. The books looked too artsy, and he wanted something more straightforward to reach the masses. So with only one installment on the market, the line got scrapped for a more traditional look\u2014author photo with big, clean type, and a solid blurb.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThere\u2019s nothing scarier than [someone saying], \u2018this book is not going to sell with that cover,\u2019\u201d Strick says. \u201cSo any initial love kind of gets pushed aside.\u201d</p><p>She was crushed (as are the people who still reach out to her to this day to ask where they can get the complete set). But the whole episode underscores a larger fact that I\u2019ve come to believe after writing about book covers for years\u2014killed covers are often where you can find the really great stuff. The surprising work. The refreshingly genre-breaking, exciting, unfiltered output that nudges the field toward its next evolution.</p><p>Ultimately, when you see a book cover in a store or online, you\u2019re really just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Because at most of the really big imprints, that cover probably went through the ringer.</p><p>Strick says that in general, the process begins with a designer receiving the manuscript and a jacket brief outlining the mandatory elements (e.g., title, author name, maybe a blurb), and comparison titles for reference. The timeline is usually tight, and when it comes down to it, the creative stakes are high: You\u2019re essentially tasked with creating a single image to brand thousands of words that could have been years in the making.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough, because to the author, it\u2019s their baby,\u201d Strick says. \u201cAnd in some cases, they\u2019ve been working on this for a decade. And you have two weeks to come up with an idea.\u201d</p><p>From there, designers create comps, or a series of proposed designs for the team to weigh. The reasons why some comps meet untimely ends are many,  from an editor or marketing lead\u2019s personal preferences to genre conventions to performance metrics of similar approaches to the author\u2019s best friend\u2019s opinion or, maybe, the sheer fact that an exec has a cold that day. Of course, this isn\u2019t to say that what hits the market is bad\u2014in fact, I\u2019d contend we\u2019re in a golden age of book cover design, with each publishing season bringing a deluge of insanely great jackets. But at the end of the day, a lot of fantastic and fascinating work hits the cutting room floor.</p><p>So as \u201cBest Book Covers of the Year\u201d lists pop off this month, let\u2019s celebrate the work that didn\u2019t win the day. Here are some of the best book covers of 2023 that you did not see\u2014with insight directly from the designers who created them.\u00a0The version that ended up being scrapped is on left, the final version is on the right.</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI love the cover that was chosen so much (the big dark waves backdropping the brittle lines of sheet music evoke the sweeping story and emotional impact), but there is one outtake that is stuck in my head when I think of the book. There is one scene at the end that I can\u2019t let go of: Music tying two people together is played, and images of people lost appear in redacted colors of light. Whether real or illustrative, this is the image that held everything that happened in the story in a suspended moment before the exhale of finishing the book. I wanted to create that scene but without any visual clutter of a setting, other objects in the room, or even people. In this outtake everything but the crucial information fades to black. It is the simplicity and starkness that I find so appealing.\u201d \u2014Math Monahan</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll Be Seein\u2019 Ya by Jon Robin Baitz is a play set in turbulent COVID times, examining the relationship between nostalgia and the ever-looming anxieties surrounding mortality and old age. I began with this painting by artist Perry V\u00e1squez. The spontaneously combusted palm tree captured the sudden, disorienting, and solitary atmosphere of living alone in pandemic times, while also alluding to the LA forest fires. I enjoyed how this symmetrical, two-paneled composition suggests a \u2018before and after\u2019 sequence marking the initial spark and the gradual expansion into forest-fire-orange California sunset.\u201d \u2014Cecilia Zhang</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCritically acclaimed British novelist Ian McEwan has quite the roster of books, and with that (no surprise), he has built a visual brand in his covers. I thought it would be exciting to simply go against the brand, and view his name in a different light. With instruction to avoid using a piano, I tried doing something I thought of as playful and British, while still remaining true to the tone and sophistication of his writing. I don\u2019t remember it going over all that well!\u201d \u2014Janet Hansen</p><p>(For this edition, the publisher would ultimately keep Tina Berning\u2019s art from the UK release.)</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThe Damages is about a woman who is forced to reckon with her past after her ex-partner\u2014the father of her child\u2014is accused of sexual assault. On the cover, I wanted to create a sense of rupture . . . a sense of buried information coming to the surface. To make the artwork, I started with a Getty image of a woman looking into her mailbox. Then I edited out the mailbox to give the photo a surreal quality. With the mailbox gone, the woman appeared to be looking at nothing . . . to be looking at her life. Then I added the holes. I liked the idea of representing \u2018damage\u2019 this way\u2014as holes in the character\u2019s life that also function as gashes on the book itself\u2014gashes exposing hidden words. The concept made sense to me, visually and thematically. \u2018Damage\u2019 is the impact that words have when they are buried for too long.</p><p>\u201cLike so many ideas, this concept did not make it onto the final cover. The editorial and sales teams wanted something more commercial, with a bigger sans-serif typeface for the title. This is pretty typical feedback for a book designer to hear. We are always walking a fine line between the commercial objectives of the work and our own idiosyncratic sensibilities. I often gravitate toward weirder, quieter designs, but sometimes the material warrants something with a broader reach. The surreal absurdity of the \u2018holes\u2019 design was not the best tonal match for the content. We ended up going with something simpler, but still striking. A college dormitory\u2014the scene of the alleged assault\u2014with the word \u2018damage\u2019 looming large overhead.\u201d \u2014Kate Sinclair</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve developed a gut feeling toward comps that I think will win the final vote. I wasn\u2019t far off in the case of Jordan Peele\u2019s new anthology of Black horror. What made this comp stand out for me was its overall configuration. I appreciated the way the type wraps around the edge of the cover; the variation of Thunderhouse Pro\u2019s thicks and thins, along with its distressed fill, framing the artwork by Arnold J. Kemp. I enjoyed cutting into the foiled artwork and featuring some ragged edges that creeped out a bit onto the type, and the pop of neon lime in contrast with the red. The title was ultimately changed to Out There Screaming to strengthen the unique creative exploration of each author\u2019s \u2018Sunken Place,\u2019 instead of sticking strictly\u00a0to the idea of the Sunken Place within Jordan Peele\u2019s work.\u201d \u2014Janay Nachel</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCinema Love centers around a queer couple in post-socialist China whose illicit relationship begins and blooms in the darkness of an old cinema. We follow the ripple effects of their connection through subsequent generations until we arrive at present day New York City Chinatown. Upon meeting in the theater for the first time, the couple exchanged a cigarette\u2014and I immediately tried using this visual to evoke a sense of intimacy and temporality. Hazy cigarette smoke felt appropriate: fleeting, moody, a little retro in this context. I wanted to anchor the motif down with a representation of the couple themselves, and I thought it felt appropriate to have them a bit vignetted to convey a sense of the past. I\u2019m genuinely really happy with the final cover\u2014which feels so true to the story in a different way to me\u2014but am still so fond of this version, which I think nicely anchors the hazy wistfulness of their love story with a graphic starkness.\u201d \u2014Dana Li</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThe title Hangman has so much visual significance that I found an irresistible opportunity to pay homage to the timeless allure of the classic Hangman game.\u201d \u2014Alex Merto</p><p>[Left: Draft cover, Right: Final cover]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe had this beautiful portrait of [author] Maggie [Millner], and we were interested in the idea of doubles and reflections, as the book itself is written in couplets.

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Over the last decade, various deep neural network models have achieved great success in image recognition and classification tasks.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include China University Industry-academia-research Innovation Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangsu Government Scholarship For Overseas Studies. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"The vast majority of high-performing deep neural network models have a huge number of parameters and often require sacrificing performance and accuracy when they are deployed on mobile devices with limited area and power consumption. To address this problem, we present an SSD-MobileNet-v1 acceleration method based on network compression and subgraph fusion for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Firstly, a regularized pruning algorithm based on sensitivity analysis and Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM) was proposed. Secondly, the Quantize Aware Training (QAT)-based network full quantization algorithm was designed. Finally, a strategy for computing subgraph fusion is proposed for FPGAs to achieve continuous scheduling of Programmable Logic (PL) operators. The experimental results show that using the proposed acceleration strategy can reduce the number of model parameters by a factor of 11 and increase the inference speed on the FPGA platform by a factor of 9-10.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The acceleration algorithm is applicable to various mobile edge devices and can be applied to the real-time monitoring of forest fires to improve the intelligence of forest fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An SSD-MobileNet Acceleration Strategy for FPGAs Based on Network Compression and Subgraph Fusion.

In his melodramas, Petzold has established a fascination with the trope of love lost at the hands of misrecognition. At the crossroads of historical circumstance and feelings of personal guilt and shame, his protagonists carry burdensome secrets, with devastating consequences. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/28851-phoenix\">Phoenix </url></emphasis>(2014), a woman survives the Holocaust only to have her husband mistake her identity, leading to her discovery that he was the one who turned her in to the Nazis. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://mubi.com/en/us/films/transit-2018\">Transit </url></emphasis> (2018), a refugee living under a fascist regime falls in love with a woman but struggles to disclose to her that her husband has died. The climactic tragedy of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11617052/\">Undine </url></emphasis> (2020) follows from a misapprehension over a past lover.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His latest film at first appears to diverge from recent work. Set in contemporary seaside Germany, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss0jpO3txVQ\">Afire </url></emphasis> takes a break from the backdrops of extreme repression and deprivation that the director has favored for at least a decade. Germany\u2019s history surfaces here only in passing jokes, as when a character calls attention to the eccentricity of East German spellings of names. Taking cues from \u00c9ric Rohmer\u2019s summertime romantic comedy-dramas, Petzold fills much of the film with routine errands, trips to the beach, and aimless conversations over dinner\u2014scenes of leisure and languor that appear plotless.</p><p>How sustainable is this reliance on disaster for character growth and for inspiring feeling?</p><p>To say that \u201cnothing happens\u201d in these sequences would be to dismiss all that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">does</emphasis> happen: fervent storytelling, late-night swims in bioluminescent waters, the kindling of new friendships and romances. At this relaxed tempo, Petzold appears to try something that is new for him, portraying the possibilities of life and love free from historical tempests and personal misfortune. Leon (Thomas Schubert), the protagonist, is rather insensitive to all this that takes place around him, preferring the joyless task of writing his novel\u2014work that is neither getting done nor good.</p><p>Yet <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Afire</emphasis> is really a slow build to the disaster that Petzold does so well. Only by dint of calamitous events, it seems, can Leon awaken to the reality he resolutely shuts out. The arrival of a forest fire, suddenly overwhelming the plotless plot, seems to satisfy a perverse fantasy grounded in the belief that extremity is required for a life lived fully. Yet something is lost when a slow comedy of manners with no real storyline turns into a melodrama. How sustainable is this reliance on disaster for character growth and for inspiring feeling, the film seems to ask. And what if the events in question are part of an existential crisis for the planet, a series of catastrophes so severe that they imperil the future of life?</p><p>Leon is suffering the pressure of following up on the success of his debut novel while on vacation with his friend Felix (Langston Uibel). From the start, every hitch in their plans makes him crabby. First the car breaks down, then a third guest announces herself at their retreat, then the roof begins to leak. Leon reacts to these events with exasperation and entitlement, offering nothing in the way of practical solutions. Felix, by contrast, is nimble; quick to pick up on warning signs and solve problems. To Leon\u2019s detriment, the two friends are true opposites: Felix agreeable, responsible, fun-loving, attractive; Leon serious.</p><p>Leon, the kind of person who would be horrible to spend real time around, is cinematically interesting for the desires he expresses when nobody is watching. The first such moment takes place as he eats his cereal in the morning, having just passed a sleepless night with loud sex noises wafting over from the adjoining room. From inside, he catches a glimpse at the culprit: Nadja (Paula Beer), a blonde Russian woman in a red dress, leaving the house with a sprightly step. He watches as she gets on her bike and pedals off, until Felix saunters in and asks if he has seen her. Leon says he has not, ashamed of his own interest.</p><p>His voyeurism becomes more active when Felix leaves him alone to go to the beach. Leon chooses to stay because he needs to work, a formula he rehearses ad nauseam. With Felix out of sight, he abandons his workstation beneath the pergola and meanders into Nadja\u2019s room. Snooping around, he plays her vinyl, rummages through her notes and drawings, examines the items she\u2019s splayed messily around her room. His expedition is cut short when he catches sight of Felix returning. In a frenzy, he replaces her items, bolts out of the house with an unaccustomed vitality, and arranges himself beneath the pergola, tapping at his keyboard as if he had been there all afternoon.</p><p>As Felix, Nadja, and Nadja\u2019s lover, Devid (Enno Trebs),grow close, Leon confines himself to the pergola, where he conducts himself importantly and ineffectually at his laptop. Windows, recurrent motifs in Petzold\u2019s films, become potent symbols of Leon\u2019s pining and self-loathing, indulging his curiosity while shielding him from the reciprocal trial of being seen. During the day, he skulks around the premises, stealing glances at Nadja through the kitchen window as she cooks and cleans. From his bedroom, he condemns himself to preparing for his tough days ahead of writing, looking on wistfully as they divert themselves outdoors with a game of badminton played with light-up rackets. Leon soon encounters what he fears the most. As he peers at their game, Nadja registers his gaze and returns it.</p><p>Leon proves susceptible to narrow-minded assumptions: He is rude to Devid because he is a lifeguard, and he is slow to catch on to Felix and Devid\u2019s developing romantic involvement. His perception of those around him is prescribed rigidly by dominant social scripts, and his own identity is fashioned after an ideal type that only renders selective desires, observations, people, and events legible to him. And he is excessively sensitive. When Nadja offers to read a draft, he is rattled, claiming that one misplaced comment from her could derail the whole enterprise, referring to a prior incident with a \u201ccleaning lady.\u201d When he finally lets her read it, he watches her leaf through the pages with paranoia and flies into a rage when she indicates tersely that she doesn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Scenes of Leon\u2019s tedious attempts to work are followed shortly by the most impressive scene in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Afire,</emphasis> when Leon realizes that he is far from the most impressive intellect at the vacation home. Over a dinner with his publisher, Helmut (Matthias Brandt), Nadja reveals that she is in fact a literary scholar. She is working on a thesis about the \u201cquake of love\u201d and the \u201cquake of representation,\u201d which draws on Heinrich von Kleist\u2019s novella <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://bookshop.org/a/1620/9798429158839\">The Earthquake in Chile </url></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis> Pushed further, she names her favorite poem, Heinrich Heine\u2019s \u201cThe Asra,\u201d about a tribe who \u201cperish when they love\u201d\u2014a text Helmut admires. She recites it once and, upon encouragement, again, her radiance on full display. Devid gleams straightforwardly with pride, while Leon looks around in embarrassed horror. With Nadja\u2019s identity made clearer, he must consider her reproof of his book and of his character anew. Her returned gaze suggests that the novelist beneath the pergola is not the only one who has been making meaning out of things.</p><p>Suddenly an encroaching forest fire rains down ash on their property. It is as if Nadja\u2019s reading has unleashed the very kind of natural disaster that is the subject of her thesis. Under new conditions of emergency, the rhythm, tone, and genre of the film are transformed. With dizzying speed, it hastens toward its final cadenza. Leon looks upon a scene he compares to the charred and embalmed lovers of Pompeii, then loses Nadja, with whom, he realizes too late, he was in love. He finally finds a deserving topic for his novel.</p><p>Petzold has wrestled with the ethics of telling stories about disaster before. Midway through<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Transit</emphasis>(2018), the protagonist, a man who has assumed the identity of a writer in order to flee his country, faces interrogation by the consul. Asked whether he will criticize his country in writing, he responds:<br/></p><p>When I was a small boy, I often went to school outings. Some were great. But unfortunately, the next day, our teacher would have us write an essay: \u201cOur School Trip.\u201d And after the holidays, there was always an essay: \u201cWhat I did on Holiday.\u201d Or \u201cThe Best Part of Holidays.\u201d \u2026 At some point it felt like I was experiencing it all just to write a school essay about it. And for the writers who were with me in the camps, all the terrifying and horrific events were only material for their writing. The camp. The escape. Death. The war. I won\u2019t be writing any more school essays.</p><p>The speech, delivered with conviction, expresses a distaste for artists who capitalize on atrocities by converting them into creative inspiration. And yet the character performs this disavowal of writing while using a stolen identity. Does he really mean it? At the last minute, the protagonist gives his precious exit visa to a doctor, surrendering both his new lover and the prospect of a better life. Sentenced to living out the rest of his life in this bleak setting, he recounts his tale to a bartender\u2014his only respite now is to tell stories from his past life\u2014furnishing the narrative frame of the film. By the end of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Transit</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,</emphasis> Petzold re-sanctifies a lofty narrative of grand loves and grand sacrifices.</p><p>Does the search for humanity in cataclysm\u2014a pursuit that can take over one\u2019s life\u2014make us, conversely, less human?</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Afire,</emphasis> Petzold revisits the question posed in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Transit.</emphasis> Does the search for humanity in cataclysm\u2014a pursuit that can take over one\u2019s life\u2014make us, conversely, less human? Petzold has signaled his own identification with Leon in interviews. The writer and director both gravitate toward narratives in which young men look to big, recognizably life-altering events\u2014insurmountable love and loss\u2014to transform them.</p><p>When Helmut reads the opening pages of Leon\u2019s uninspired first draft while reviewing them with him in a meeting, it becomes readily apparent why Nadja reacted to them with disgust. It is a cloying, misogynistic piece about a missed connection, chock-full of references to the woman in question\u2019s \u201ccleavage.\u201d With the events in the last act of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Afire,</emphasis> Leon finally possesses \u201creal experience\u201d of the sort that can rescue him from his solipsistic writing. His writing and conduct outwardly improve at a rapid clip. The newly mature Leon is thoughtful and expansive, yet there is something garish about his transformation at the eleventh hour.</p><p>Over and over again, Petzold\u2019s characters have been made to reckon with their responsibilities in the wreckage of history, tasked with reimbuing a wayward world with dignity. The characters of<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Afire </emphasis>confront a crisis that threatens to vacate all narratives of meaning, and Leon comes out the other end with a feeble text. It\u2019s better than what came before, but can it begin to make sense of what has taken place? This time, the atrocity is not historical but natural, and Petzold is cynical about the redemptive potential of melodrama in an age in which disasters, if still largely caused by human decisions, unfold beyond the grasp of our control. If he wants Leon to scrutinize the stories he tells about himself, the ending of<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Afire</emphasis>suggests that there is a possibility he finds even more concerning: a future with no stories at all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWRPON-httpsnewrepubliccomarticle174833afirecomedymannersendworldchristianpetzoldfilmreview</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWRPON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VW-5G51-JCMC-W16B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">485137</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1905\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The New Republic, LLC  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Republic (Online)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51341\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 4, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States, Chile &amp;

(\u201cHarfang\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V: HAR) is pleased to announce its field crew began exploration work on its Lemare lithium property in the central part of Eeyou Istchee James Bay, Qu\u00e9bec (Figure\u00a01). The property is located to the southeast of the Whabouchi lithium deposit and is accessible by the Route du Nord. With recent lithium discoveries, new advances in already existing resources and the Qu\u00e9bec strategy on Critical and Strategic Minerals (\u201cCSM\u201d), this region has taken centre stage for lithium exploration in Canada.</p><p>Commented Ian Campbell, President and CEO, \u201cWe are pleased to report that the recent restrictions imposed by the Qu\u00e9bec government as a result of the regional forest fire situation have been lifted in most of the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region and our field crew has been mobilized to resume the exploration program. This program is a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d approach including both a prospecting and geological evaluation. Access to our properties in the northwest of the region (Lake Menarik, Serpent-Radisson, Ewart, Sakami, Taiga, La Passe and Menarik East) is not yet authorized, but we are hopeful this situation will be resolved in the near future. We wish to acknowledge the continuing efforts to suppress forest fires and express our gratitude to those involved for their hard work under difficult conditions.\u201d</p><p>Lithium Exploration Program</p><p>Harfang intends to conduct a first-phase surface exploration program (prospecting, mapping, rock sampling) on its assets favourable for the discovery of spodumene bearing pegmatites. This program includes prospecting on the Serpent-Radisson, La Passe, Lemare, Ewart, Sakami, Ross and Conviac claims. The main objective of this program is to find Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum Pegmatite (\u201cLCT Pegmatite\u201d) warranting more advanced exploration, including drilling.</p><p>The Company acquired Lemare claims by map designation as a result of geological assessment combined with a statistical processing of more than 13,400\u00a0analyses of lake bottom sediments extracted from the Qu\u00e9bec government digital database (SIG\u00c9OM) (see news releases dated on January 19 and February 8, 2023). Ewart, Sakami, Conviac and Ross claims were staked following the same evaluation.</p><p>The Lemare Property consists of 269\u00a0claims located approximately 22\u00a0kilometres southeast of the Whabouchi lithium deposit owned by Nemaska Lithium (\u201cNemaska\u201d). Nemaska recently signed a long-term agreement with the Ford Motor Company for the supply of lithium products, including lithium hydroxide, as North American automakers race to secure supplies of battery materials to meet the electric vehicle output. The Lemare Property contains several strong calculated lake bottom sediment lithium residual anomalies of which four are \u226599.5th percentile of the entire SIG\u00c9OM database (Figure 2). Some of these anomalies form a tight cluster in an area dominated by granite and pegmatite of the Opatica Subprovince.</p><p>Once the restrictions are lifted in the northwestern part of Eeyou Istchee James Bay, Harfang will resume its exploration program on its gold and lithium projects in this region.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release was prepared and approved by Fran\u00e7ois Huot, P.Geo, Vice President Exploration of Harfang, who is a non-independent qualified person for the technical disclosure as defined by the National Instrument 43-101\u00a0Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI43-101\u201d).</p><p>About Harfang Exploration Inc.</p><p>Harfang Exploration Inc. is well financed with approximately $6.7\u00a0M in the treasury as of April\u00a030, 2023 and is a technically driven mineral exploration company with the primary mission to discover ore deposits in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario. The Company is managed by an experienced team of industry professionals with a proven track record of success, controls a portfolio of highly prospective projects and has a strong financial position. Harfang is dedicated to best practices through engagement with all stakeholders and commitment to the environment.</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors and for further information, please contact:</p><p>Ian CampbellPresident and Chief Executive OfficerTel: 647-680-3820Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:icampbell@harfangexploration.comWeb\">icampbell@harfangexploration.comWeb</email> : <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.harfangexploration.com\">www.harfangexploration.com</url></p><p>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information</p><p>The information in this news release includes certain information and statements about management\u2019s view of future events, expectations, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements.

Some small showers also reached the area Wednesday and a smattering of rain is in the forecast for the coming week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Manheim Township fire Chief Scott Little, president of the Lancaster County Fire Chiefs Association, said 45 of the 70 fire chiefs in the county gathered Wednesday to discuss the burn ban, which is scheduled to run through July 9.</p><p>Of the chiefs present, about 80% favored sustaining the ban, Little said. The organization is still collecting votes from its remaining members.</p><p>The survey is part of the association\u2019s plan to meet with county commissioners today to give input on the threat of wildfires and issue a formal recommendation. Commissioners plan to revisit the issue during one of their weekly public meetings next week.</p><p>Little said the association is also collecting data on 911 calls and emergency responses to reports of outside fires in the county to inform their recommendation to county officials.</p><p>\u201cWe have had several calls that (firefighters) have been dispatched to this week for wildland brush-type events,\u201d Little said. \u201cSo people are still not abiding by the ban until the fire employees show up with the (county order) in hand.\u201d</p><p>Across Pennsylvania, vegetation is dry and conditions are ripe for fire. The state Department of Environmental Protection on Thursday declared a statewide drought watch. The agency is encouraging residents and businesses to reduce their water usage by 5% to 10% as a preventative measure, in case drought conditions continue long enough that water supplies are threatened. The conservation measure is voluntary, according to the DEP.</p><p>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the county is experiencing \u201cmoderate\u201d drought conditions, the second-lowest of its five drought stages.</p><p>East vs. West</p><p>Many people associate wildfires with California and Western states, where they have become a nearly year-round phenomenon in recent years, as a shifting global climate produces more extreme weather events.</p><p>But the majority of wildfires in the U.S. occur east of the Mississippi River, Little said.</p><p>Wildfires have been common in Pennsylvania for millennia, said Mike Kern, chief of the forest fire protection division at DCNR, and vegetation has adapted to survive them.</p><p>The immediate threat in Pennsylvania is not necessarily air quality or loss of habitat, Kern said, but the loss of life and property. Even small fires can overtake homes and leave death in their wake.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much: leaves around the house, leaves under a deck and even a creeping fire, if nobody stops it, could burn somebody\u2019s house down,\u201d Kern said.</p><p>The problem begins and ends with humans. Last year, 99% of the wildfires the state recorded came from human activity, according to state data.</p><p>As of Monday, the state has recorded 1,365 wildfires, only six of which were caused by lightning \u2014 the way naturally occurring wildfires start. The rest resulted from human activity.</p><p>Wildfires most frequently start with people burning trash, a common practice in rural areas, where garbage collection is less likely to be a municipal service. So far this year, 723 wildfires were caused by trash burning, according to state data.</p><p>Rural areas in Lancaster County and beyond are filled with areas where wildfires typically occur \u2014 at the point where human development meets vegetation, whether that be crops, woods or scrubland. Firefighters and forestry experts call it the \u201cwildland-urban interface,\u201d where people and nature meet.</p><p>Most wildfires in Pennsylvania consume just an acre or two, according to state data. Last year, 2,700 acres burned from 1,036 fires.</p><p>\u201cWhen people think of wildfires, they think of thousands of acres, but that\u2019s really not the case,\u201d Little said.</p><p>So far this year, the county has seen fewer wildfires than neighboring counties, according to a state map of wildfire events. The map shows about a dozen recorded wildfires in the county this year, eight of them from trash burning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWERA-60e63a5a0bba11ee8ddb4f0c9ef24ada</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWERA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68GJ-R1R1-JC8F-20NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222875</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 LNP Media Group, Inc.

These sites are also visited regularly by staff and often have a campground host nearby to monitor campfire safety. All of this mitigates the chance of an escaped campfire becoming a wildfire.</p><p>Fire restrictions are based on a variety of factors including forest conditions, fuel moisture levels, and weather predictions. Fire management officials monitor these risk factors to determine when to begin, increase, and rescind fire restrictions.</p><p>Under Stage 1 restrictions, the following are prohibited: \u2014 Building or maintaining a fire, campfire, or charcoal briquette fire outside of established fire rings within designated developed campgrounds and picnic areas. \u2014 Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, a designated campground or recreation area, or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter that is barren or cleared of all flammable material. \u2014 Using a motor vehicle off paved, gravel or dirt National Forest System roads and trails, except within a designated developed Off-Highway Vehicle area.</p><p>The Tahoe National Forest urges the public to stay vigilant and to always follow these principles when out on forested lands: \u2014 Campfires: Attend your campfire at all times. Ensure your fire is completely extinguished: drown with water (not dirt), stir with your shovel, drown again, and feel for any heat using the back of your hand. Continue this process until no heat remains. \u2014 Stoves: If using pressurized or bottled liquid fuel stoves, lanterns, or heating devices, use in barren areas with at least 3 feet of clearance from grasses and other debris that may catch fire. Prevent stoves from tipping. \u2014 Spark arrestors: Ensure that all internal or external combustion engines have a spark arresting device properly installed, maintained and in effective working order. \u2014 Flammable Items: Fireworks are prohibited on all national forests year-round, leave them and all other pyrotechnic devices at home. Always use caution with smoking. Extinguish all smoking materials dead out on bare soil. Pack out all cigarette butts and filters. \u2014 Vehicles: When traveling, ensure your chains are properly connected. The hot underside of the vehicle and dragging chains can start a fire. Stick to driving on designated roads and trails and be careful to not park your car or OHV in tall, dry vegetation, including grass.</p><p>The Tahoe National Forest Motor Vehicle Use Map can be found online at tinyurl.com/mhv6ekwb. Not all Tahoe National Forest recreation sites will allow campfires.

New research from the University of Georgia shows, for the first time, that these changes may affect what kind of treatment patients need to combat exposure to such pollutants.</p><p>\"We found that after emissions entered the atmosphere, there were changes in chemical composition that affected how they expressed their toxicity,\" said Rawad Saleh, assistant professor in the College of Engineering. \"The toxicity mechanisms are different if you're exposed to smoke directly from a fire, versus after it spends time in the atmosphere.\"</p><p>For the study, published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, Saleh and a team at UGA burned biomass--oak foliage, pine needles and hickory twigs--in an environmental chamber, then used UV radiation to initiate photochemical aging of the emissions. In a laboratory setting, they exposed human lung epithelial cells to the resulting aerosol.</p><p>How do wildfires affect the lungs?</p><p>The aerosol created by biomass burning is toxic to human lung epithelial cells, and the team's results indicate that the type of exposure--fresh smoke versus aged smoke, for example--affects cells in different ways. Fresh smoke is worse at causing damage to mitochondria, which process food and produce energy at the cellular level. Aged smoke causes more oxidative stress, which can lead to cell death. Though damage from emissions exposure may be caused in different ways, on the surface it can appear to be the same.</p><p>\"There may be multiple people exposed to emissions from a forest fire that develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\" Saleh said. \"But our results suggest that someone exposed to fresh smoke, like a firefighter, might need different treatment for COPD than someone exposed to aged smoke 50 miles away from the fire. That's because the mechanisms causing the disease are different.\"</p><p>Elucidating these mechanisms will become more important, according to Saleh, as the pollutants in our atmosphere change over time. Human-caused emissions from sources like vehicles are being reduced as technology improves, but forest fires are increasing their share of pollution as climate change creates warmer, drier conditions.</p><p>\"Historically, people used to think that emissions from forest fires or burning wood are not as toxic as burning fossil fuels, but they have similar levels of toxicity,\" he said. \"Ten to 20 years from now, most of the things we breathe that are harmful will probably come from a forest fire somewhere in the world.\"</p><p>Co-authors include Khairallah Atwi, a former UGA graduate student now working in the private sector, as well as Sarah N.

These were the days when being a progressive was considered 'counter-culture' and cool, with every major rock star and celebrity tapping into youth angst and hippie philosophy. The progressive shift led to considerable social instability in the 1970s.</p><p>It is common these days to hear leftists in popular media argue that TV shows like Star Trek or Doctor Who were 'always woke' and that they are simply carrying on the tradition. This is simply not true. While many productions in the US and in Europe displayed liberal sensibilities, woke activists are not liberal and do not hold liberal values. They are, rather, a hybrid ideology combining elements of Marxism/communism/fascism, collectivism, moral relativism and narcissism.</p><p>One could argue that the woke cult is the natural end state, the unavoidable final evolution of liberal thinking. That may be true, but that's a debate for another day. The point is, the woke activism of today has very little in common with the political movements of the 1960s. In fact, if you were to go back in time only 15 years ago and tried to explain to a typical Democrat in the US or Labour member in the UK what leftists are trying to get away with in 2024, they would laugh in your face and call you crazy.</p><p>In our decade nearly every major television and film franchise of the past has received the woke treatment; what leftists call 'updating for modern audiences.' As a consequence, nearly every franchise has suffered an extreme collapse in audience number, ad revenues and box office receipts. Why? Because woke ideology is a fringe movement making up a tiny percentage of the population. Almost no one likes it, hence the reason why 'Get Woke, Go Broke' has become a rule rather than a theory.</p><p>Doctor Who has not been able to escape this rule despite being considered an open sci-fi world where almost anything goes. The problem is, it doesn't matter what the canon technically allows or what the writers want - In the end the fans always dictate what succeeds and what fails. When a show starts preaching at people about respecting gender pronouns, they aren't going to stick around to see what happens next.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.voiceofeurope.com/peru-officially-classifies-transgender-people-as-mentally-ill\">Peru Officially Classifies Transgender People as Mentally Ill</url></p><p>Transgender, non-binary, and intersex individuals are officially classified as mentally ill in Peru, despite criticism from LGBTQ activists, reports The Telegraph.</p><p>The government of Peru has officially classified transgender, non-binary, and intersex people as mentally ill.

Melinda Adams instead is pulled toward the term pyromantic - a lover of \"good fire\" for the benefits it can bring to people, communities and the environment as a whole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Langston Hughes Assistant Professor in Indigenous Studies &amp; Geography &amp; Atmospheric Science at the University of Kansas, Adams extols the benefits of cultural or ceremonial fire in a new paper she has co-written for the journal Ecopsychology.</p><p>Adams collaborated on the paper, titled \"Solastalgia to Soliphilia: Cultural Fire, Climate Change, and Indigenous Healing,\"with Erica Tom, instructor in English at the Santa Rosa (Calif.) Junior College, and Ron Goode, honorable chairman of California's North Fork Mono Tribe.They detail the benefits to university students and community members who took part in a series of ceremonial burns on Indigenous lands in California that they organized as part of ongoing community-based participatory research project in partnership with the University of California-Davis (where Adams obtained her doctorate) and the Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center.</p><p>The researchers wrote that by taking part in a ceremonial burn (the term Goode and Adams both use) a few acres at a time - usually through pile burningor grass burning for the restoration of culturally significant plants - and guided by traditional environmental knowledge, the participants shifted in significant ways from the \"Solastalgia\" of the paper's title - a word coined by Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht for looming environmental dread - to \"Soliphilia,\" defined as a heightened state of environmental awareness and concern, which the authors say also engenders feelings of control.</p><p>\"Whether you are a Native person that's learning about fire, an allied person that's wanting to learn about the presence of Indigenous peoples and our land stewardship and climate solutions, or community members that care about the places that we all live and work in and hopefully all care about, there's a role for everybody in learning about good fire,\" Adams said.</p><p>As wildfires have grown larger and more frequent as the result of climate change, so, too, has the fear of them grown in the Western states.</p><p>\"We've had young people and students who experienced the Carr Fireor the Paradise fire,so they've lost their family homes or been affected in some way,\" Adams said. \"Or they were already afraid of fire from engrained ideas that all fire is bad fire. So students participated in the ceremonial burn demonstrations to learn an Indigenous perspective of not running from fire but working with it as a land stewardship tool. The experience is powerful as a healing concept. ... There's growing interest in cultural fire because it's a mitigation tool that people are starting to educate themselves about. These are practices that we have held onto, as Indigenous peoples, since time immemorial.\"</p><p>Adams studies and leads cultural/ceremonial fire from an Indigenous lens and invites others to learn from traditional practices, with Indigenous peoples always leading these demonstrations. She says her eco-cultural work serves to reiterate what Indigenous communities have always known: Through close connections with lands and waters, and scientific observation over time, there are numerous benefits to purposely lit cultural fire.</p><p>\"In addition to the cultural-social effects of cultural fire, I also study the soil effects of cultural fire, of native fire, and its potential for carbon storage - everybody's raving about carbon storage with climate effects - and I also talk about the water-holding capacity that good fire invites to soilscapes,\" Adams said.</p><p>The authors wrote that the benefits of \"placing fire on the land\" can be expanded from an individual to an environmental level as participants in programs like the one Adams helped lead in California take the lessons they've learned into their careers in the field.</p><p>Adams, who joined KU's faculty in spring 2023, led her first ceremonial burn at the KU Field Stationin March. She looks forward to more, working with tribes, nearby Haskell Indian Nations University (of which Adams is also an alumna), faculty and community members and Indigenous peoples in the Midwest.</p><p>\"That's part of my work in trying to widen the scope of good fire,\" Adams said. \"We say good fire, meaning it's purposeful, it has an ecological, cultural or social benefit that it's bringing, as opposed to catastrophic wildfire, forest fire, which in most of us it's ingrained to be dangerous and something to stay away from. ... Not all fire is bad fire.\"</p><p>Image: Melinda Adams uses a drip torch to lead a cultural burn at the KU Field Station. Credit: Joey Orr, Andrew W.
