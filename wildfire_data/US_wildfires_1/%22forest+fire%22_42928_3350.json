The greenhouse effect from methane and nitrous oxide generated by the Canadian forest fire is equivalent to about 110 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, and that's on top of the one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide cast off by wild fires, he added.</p><p>Together, that more than 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 emission from the wildfires so far is twice the amount of the total energy related CO2 emission in Canada in 2021 alone.</p><p>In a column that Liu wrote to CGTN earlier in July, he had predicted that the CO2 emission would surpass one billion tonnes.</p><p>\"It's quite astonishing,\" he said.</p><p>As of Thursday, firefighters had battled with 4,818 cases of blazes in 2023 alone, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), and the total area burned had exceeded 12.2 million hectares.</p><p>An ecological disaster</p><p>In addition, air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, aerosols, and black carbon from Canadian wildfires do not stay in one place. For example, the movement of pollutants has caused the worst pollution weather in New York City since 1960 and had topped Chicago's air quality index standard by 5.6 times on June 27.</p><p>And these pollutants go further than shared border areas thanks to the westerly circulation and weather dynamics, according to Wang Zhe from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics under CAS, who's also on the research project with Liu.</p><p>The pollutants had traveled to Scandinavia in Europe on May 25, spread to Iceland and Greenland on June 8, and reached the European continent on June 26. These pollutant accounted for more than 5 \u00ce\u00bcg of PM2.5 per cubic meter in Europe from June 27 to 30. They've also reached North Africa and Asia, according to Wang.</p><p>\"The Canadian wildfire is indeed a global environmental event. And as it is still ongoing, its final impact will definitely be much more serious than the existing data,\" Wang said.</p><p>The loss of plantation and biodiversity, the exposure of soil, and the transmission of pollutants to Arctic areas will cause a complicated impact to global ecosystem that requires further comprehensive analysis in the future, Wang added.</p><p>\"We need to notice that the wildfire events occurs more frequently nowadays, which has exceeded the scope of a natural change that the European and American countries had long believed in. Rather, they have become a kind of destructive ecological disaster,\" Liu said.</p><p>China's solutions</p><p>Despite facing severe natural and social challenges, China has made significant progress in forest and grassland fire prevention. The comprehensive capacity for fire prevention and control has significantly improved, and forest fire incidents in 2021 and 2022 remained at historically low levels.</p><p>In May, China issued the \"Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening Forest and Grassland Fire Prevention and Control under New Circumstances,\" demonstrating the determination of the country to mitigate major forest and grassland fire risks and ensure the safety of people's lives, property, and ecosystems. Now, China's \"prevention-oriented, combined prevention and suppression\" approach is offering beneficial lessons for the world.

I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. One of the wars on Israel's borders could be drawing to a close with a potential ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. A source tells CNN, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has approved an agreement in principle, but any deal would still need to be approved by the cabinet, which is planning to meet and vote on Tuesday.</p><p>Lebanese officials say dozens were killed in an Israeli strike over the weekend, and that the death toll has risen to over 3,000 since mid- September. Meantime, there is little hope for a ceasefire in Gaza, where the humanitarian situation in the north has been described as apocalyptic by aid officials.</p><p>It's been one year since the only deal between Israel and Hamas led to the release of over 100 captives taken on October 7th. Around 100 hostages are still believed to be held inside Gaza to this day. Aviva Siegel was released as part of that original deal last November, but her husband Keith, an American-Israeli citizen, remains in captivity. And she's joining us now from Israel.</p><p>Aviva Siegel, welcome to the program. And I just want to know what you're thinking today regarding the fact that you and about a hundred others were released exactly a year ago. What do you think about that deal that enabled that?</p><p>AVIVA SIEGEL, FORMER HOSTAGE HELD BY HAMAS AND WIFE OF KEITH SIEGEL, CURRENTLY HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: Hello, everybody, and thank you for having me. I am lucky to be sitting here and that everybody can see me alive, because I nearly died in Gaza. The only way to get the hostages out is to bring them back with a deal and we know that after so many months and so many days have passed while Keith, my husband, that's American citizen, is underneath the ground, 40 meters underneath the ground, and just praying that somebody will come and take him out and bring him home. I cannot wait for that to happen.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Aviva, do you know that he's under the ground? Have you had word from others? Were you kept underground? What was your situation and what do you think your husband is going through?</p><p>SIEGEL: Yes, I was twice underneath the ground and I want to tell everybody that it's worse than hell. It's the worst thing that anybody go through in this world. We were just thrown underneath the ground 40 meters and we were left there alone.</p><p>I remember there were two terrorists that were with us and they were talking and then suddenly, it was silence. And I looked at Keith and I said, Keith, do you think they left us here alone, underneath the ground? It was dark, we could hardly see anything, and we did not have any oxygen to breathe. We got to a state that I looked at Keith and saw that he could hardly breathe. And he said that he feels that he can't breathe.</p><p>[13:05:00]</p><p>And I want to tell you that I told Keith just lie down and try and breathe, and that's what we did. We just lay down with no -- not able to even talk, to pick ourselves up, even to sit. We had to lie down and try and breathe while I was thinking in my head, who's going to die first, Keith or I? And I just prayed that I would die first because it was very difficult for me to see Keith. I could not even watch him and watch his chest going up and down and up and down while I felt the same, I just want to die.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Have you had any word about him from any of the other hostages or anybody?</p><p>SIEGEL: No, not at all. The only thing that we do know is that Keith -- they released -- the Hamas terrorists released a video of Keith in April, and that's more than a half a year ago. Keith looks pale. He looks old. He looks tired. He's begging and he's crying to get out of there. He's 65 years old. He was taken from his house with Hamas terrorists in his pajamas, and he's still there, underneath the ground. We've been told that the hostages are underneath the ground just where I was, and I nearly died.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Can I ask you, Aviva, since your release you've been part of a hostage family advocate group, You Want Them Back. And this week, hostage families gathered to mark the anniversary of that one deal that enabled your release and that of others. The theme of the gathering was a year is too long for a deal. So, why do you think there hasn't been another deal and there haven't been hostages released in that fashion?</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, I don't know why it's taking so long. I just do know that Keith is not sitting in front of me and I'm waiting for him to come back. And I just want him to come back alive. I want him to come back strong. And I am just so scared of what kind of Keith we're going to get back. How thin he's going to be. What is he going to look like? If he's going to be so ill, that we'll just have to take care of him for the rest of his life? Because it's dangerous there.</p><p>The Hamas terrorists did not treat us like people. They did everything they wanted to make us feel that we're not even human beings. We were taken -- all human rights away. We weren't allowed to talk. We weren't allowed to hug. We weren't allowed to feel. We weren't allowed to stand or move our bodies.</p><p>And you know, Keith, while he was taken, he was pushed by the Hamas terrorists. And they broke his ribs and they shot him on his hand he used to beg them to lie down sometimes during the day just to relax his pain and they said no. They used to eat in front of us while they starved us. And they used to drink water while they did not bring us any water to drink.</p><p>I'm a witness of one of the girls that was touched. And I just remember how fragile she was after it happened, but she had to continue to the Hamas terrorists that did touch her. I'm a witness to one of the girls that was beaten up into pieces and she was hit in such a brutal way and she did not even scream because she was scared to. She was scared that they would kill her. And I remember when she came back after they beat her, she was shaking and crying and I could not even give her a hug. I was not allowed to.</p><p>And I'll never forget them treating Keith in such a brutal way and so many times I wanted to just cry while I couldn't. But I used to look at Keith in his eyes and tell him that I love him and that I care about him because that's the only thing that they let me do, the Hamas terrorists. They took control of us in any way that you can think of. I'll never forget myself taking my foot out of a blanket because I was too hot to cool myself down and the Hamas terrorists came and threatened me that I'm not allowed to take my foot out. And that's the amount of control that the Hamas terrorists had on us.</p><p>And one of the times they took us and they put black material and covered my eyes and I had to walk myself down three stairs -- of stairs and trying to figure out where to put my next foot. I'm 63 years old. Keith is 65 years old. He was taken by Hamas and Hamas is responsible of everything that's going there and Hamas is responsible of not bringing and letting Keith and all the hostages come home. I'm worried --</p><p>[13:10:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: Aviva --</p><p>SIEGEL: Yes?</p><p>AMANPOUR: We could -- we hear you loud and clear. And obviously, like you, we really hope that Keith and the others come back and we just hope that a ceasefire in Lebanon may mean a ceasefire in Gaza at some point. But we really, really appreciate you being with us on this anniversary of your release. I can just imagine the horror and the pain that you're going through. Thank you for being with us.</p><p>SIEGEL: Thank you so much. I just want to say that Keith and I are peacemakers and we want good for the whole world. So, please help us make this world a better world for everybody.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And that's a really strong message to end our conversation on. Thank you for that. Now, Israel's cabinet has voted to sanction Haaretz, which is the country's oldest newspaper. That happened over the weekend. Citing its coverage of the war on Gaza following the October 7th attacks. Haaretz described the move as an attempt to, quote, \"silence a critical, independent newspaper.\"</p><p>Meantime, Israelis, and many around the world, are still digesting the ICC's decision last week to issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and from the deputy Hamas leader, Mohammed Deif.</p><p>The court said it found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes, including starvation as a method of war. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy says the U.K. would follow due process if Netanyahu visited Britain, but the United States and other allies have rejected the ICC warrant.</p><p>Geoffrey Nice is a leading human rights lawyer who prosecuted the former Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, in 2002 at the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. Now -- he's the man. Now, he's joining us. Welcome to the program, Geoffrey Nice.</p><p>You heard -- let me just respond to Aviva Siegel. You just heard this desperate commentary from a former hostage whose husband is still there and the description she made of how she was treated by Hamas and how the others were treated by Hamas. I want to ask you your opinion as a legal scholar and one who's prosecuted these crimes before, do you think Hamas should have been charged with genocide as well as the crimes against humanity that they have been charged with at least three people, Sinwar, Haniyeh, who are both being killed by Israel, and Deif, who we don't know whether is alive or not because genocide was not part of the charges.</p><p>GEOFFREY NICE, LEAD PROSECUTOR AT THE TRIAL OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVI AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER: I don't have a fixed view on whether there was evidence sufficient for genocide.</p><p>AMANPOUR: We have a problem with the sound.</p><p>NICE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you hear me?</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. Now I can hear you. Geoffrey, sorry, it wasn't coming through to my ear. So, now I can hear you. What's the answer?</p><p>NICE: Yes. I have no fixed view on whether the evidence was sufficient to meet the strict test of genocide on one side or the other. What is absolutely clear and has been clear from before this conflict or war started is that what Hamas has done, both in the firing of unaimed rockets and particularly in respect of hostages is of course criminal. There's no doubt about its absolute wickedness. And indeed, it would be very hard not to be moved by the extremely powerful statements of your previous contributor.</p><p>But that doesn't necessarily mean that Hamas is culpable of genocide, because genocide requires proof of a particular state of mind of the leader or other person suspected of committing genocide. And it's very -- it's not easy to prove that state of mind, especially against leaders who don't say very much, as the leaders you refer to did not do.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Just as a devil's advocate, you know that the charter talks about the elimination of the State of Israel. Do you -- does that warrant - - does that reach a legal definition?</p><p>[13:15:00]</p><p>NICE: That I think has always been thought of as a question possible or probable component part of any allegations of genocide made against those who cleave, stick to that particular charter. I think there's been some variation of it. You'll be able to tell me if I'm wrong about that. But that is not necessarily in itself sufficient. Hamas may be regarded as wider than simply those who drafted the original charter. So, I'm afraid -- I'm not afraid -- I don't think that in itself is enough.</p><p>It may also be the case that the court in issuing these arrest warrants has in mind that it can add further charges -- not charges, allegations, the allegations that support arrest warrant or arrest warrants.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. So, let me ask you now the bit that has caused a huge sort of, you know, hornet's nest, and that is the Thursday indictment of not only Mohammed Deif of Hamas, who was deputy of the military wing known as the Al-Ghassan Brigade, but of Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister Yoav Gallant. And that is the -- you know, the thing is alleged crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza.</p><p>You know, back in May, you told me that you welcomed all the investigation and Karim Khan's decision to apply for warrants. Now, the warrants have been approved by the panel at the ICC. But what I want to first ask you is, are you surprised by the level of rejection of these warrants against Israeli leaders by allies, you know, and many, many newspapers and leading opinion makers and thought leaders?</p><p>NICE: No, I'm not surprised. The horrifying conflict between Palestinians in Gaza, maybe elsewhere in Israel and the State of Israel generates the strongest of emotions in politicians and in commentators and even in media. And the legal issues of whether or not certain crimes may have been committed, and if so, by who, need to be detached from emotion and looked at clinically.</p><p>So, on the one hand, there's no reason to doubt that the very extended consideration given by these judges to the material presented to them has led to a solid conclusion that it may be very difficult to change on any form of appeal or reconsideration, but it's not going to change the emotional response on both sides about this conflict, and those therefore lead both to enthusiastic acceptance of the appropriateness of countries arresting Mr. Netanyahu, should he and Gallant and the other gentleman or man, if they fall into a particular country and on the other side to outright rejection of the work of the court.</p><p>It's unfortunate in my view, it's very unfortunate --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Go ahead. What's unfortunate?</p><p>NICE: -- because -- it's very unfortunate that there isn't a more general acceptance of the use of -- and I use the word use perhaps in a particular way, the use of the court by the International Community in big and powerful countries generally, what we the people, you and I, wish to see is the end of war. We wish to see this kind of horrifying treatment of people on both sides come to an end.</p><p>And I'm afraid our political leaders overlook the potential value of investigation, not necessarily convictions by other war criminals, by war criminals that may or may not affect the behavior of future leaders of conflicts, we overlook or they overlook the value of investigation.</p><p>If support had been given to the ICC to investigate Operation Protective Edge, which happened in 2014, when it was given jurisdiction, if it -- that had enthusiastic support, it's by no means certain that what happened starting in October last year would have happened.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Can I ask you, Geoffrey -- yes. I just got -- I don't have a huge amount of time left, but I want to ask you this. I was, you know, at The Hague reporting on your prosecution of Slobodan Milosevic, and then, of course, all the other alleged war criminals who also were indicted on genocide charges. And of course, there were a whole load of their backers who totally rejected it, Russia, the East European nations are, the Global South, they totally rejected it.</p><p>[13:20:00]</p><p>The same has happened about the ICC indictment of Putin. We know the ICC has indicted the former president of Sudan and others. Do you -- this is the first time the leader of a democratic country supported by the United States has been indicted. So, what do you make of that? I mean, that's one of the fault lines that we're seeing right now.</p><p>NICE: Well, standing back and not focusing on the horrors of this particular conflict, for the court to deliver on its mandate and to look at a problem that happens to be sensitive in the United States of America is a good thing because it shows that there is at least the possibility that the admittedly limited value that there may be in judicial investigation and processes of an international court can stand up to the big pressures that inevitably come from hegemonic powers like the United States of America.</p><p>And I suspect, time will show, that the majority of the populations around the world would prefer to see the international criminal law in this case doing what little it may but the best it can to seeing the conflict such as the horror happening in Israel, Gaza and on the West Bank continue.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And lastly, one of the statutes or one of the guidelines is that if the country has an independent and active judiciary, well, it should be left to the country to do it. The ICC said that, you know, there'd be no progress since it applied for the warrants. What do you make of that? Do you think it was too short a time to give the Israeli judicial system chance to look into it, could it have done in the midst of war?</p><p>NICE: They were specifically invited to consider asking for a deferral. They didn't. That was one of the matters dealt with on a PRR as a matter of jurisdiction. Is it likely or possible in the particular and emotional circumstances that -- in which this conflict sits, that Israel would institute war crimes trials against Mr. Netanyahu? I think it's unlikely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. Sir Geoffrey Nice, chief prosecutor at the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague against Milosevic, thank you so much indeed.</p><p>Now, he's the man who changed the media landscape forever. When Ted Turner founded CNN in June 1980, the first ever 24-hour cable news channel, he democratized information by beaming it into homes all around the world. Now, a new docuseries, \"Call Me Ted,\" takes us back to where it all began, with an intimate look at his personal life and his turbocharged career. Here's a clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TED TURNER, FOUNDER, CNN: I just came up with the idea that superstation would be a good way to describe ourselves.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How come no one else had thought of that?</p><p>TURNER: How come nobody else thought the world was round, then Columbus came around?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ted was a legend, an American hero.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wanted to build this entertainment empire.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I spoke to the husband wife duo, producer Joni Levin and writer-director Keith Clarke about Ted Turner's guiding principles and his enduring legacy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Joni Levin and Keith Clarke, welcome to the program. A lot has been done on Ted Turner. What was it that you wanted to achieve with this series?</p><p>JONI LEVIN, PRODUCER, \"CALL ME TED\": You know, I felt, about seven years ago when I was thinking about Ted, I thought that nobody had really done that definitive deep dive on his life and legacy, where it's not just his achievements, which are many, but it was really looking at the shadows and the obstacles that this man had to overcome to become the person that he is today.</p><p>And the thing that I loved about Ted is that he always felt that, you know, it was we, the people, you know, the fans in the stadium, the citizens of the world that could change the momentum of a game, whether it's climate, whether it's nuclear, the environment, preservation of democracy, like he has done and continues to do, and that was something that I felt that everybody should take a page from, and it was being able to really put that forth, you know, so that people could take a look at this and, you know, and become active, proactive, you know, be involved, believe in themselves.</p><p>[13:25:00]</p><p>He was such a believer. He was told no so often and he just took no and turned it into on. And I think that's such a great message. And so, that was really, you know, what I wanted to put forth and why I wanted to do this.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Keith, did you -- do you think you guys learned anything more about Ted than you didn't know before by going through this process that Joni has described?</p><p>KEITH CLARKE, WRITER AND DIRECTOR, \"CALL ME TED\": Oh, yes, I think that, you know, what's interesting to me from a storyteller's point is just his personal journey. You know, we can appreciate his accomplishments of many of the icons that we have out there. But Ted's journey, you know, when a man stands up and, you know, basically says at the beginning of our story, I'm afraid of abandonment, I'm afraid to be alone, I just think that's such a deep dive into somebody's psyche and how they accomplish so much. And yet, they're carrying this burden that basically just guided him each and every day.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to take this opportunity to play one of the clips you've given us and it is exactly about the idea of what happened, how he was abandoned at a very, very young age. Here's this clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: I came along next November 19, 1938. The first Turner born north of the Mason Dixon line. Another beautiful baby, Mary Jane, came along in September of 1941, and was the apple of my parents' eye.</p><p>That date was significant, because when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, just a few months later, my father joined the U.S. Navy. They decided to take their infant daughter, Mary Jane, but leave me behind to attend the Cincinnati boarding school. I was four years old.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Honestly, just that scene is heartbreaking. And of course, you know, I've been an employee and an admirer of my boss for decades. And yet, that vulnerability and the way you portrayed it is something not all people know about. Tell me, Joni, what did that initial sense of abandonment do to him? How did it affect him as a young man and then as an entrepreneur and a global game changer?</p><p>LEVIN: Well, I think -- you know, I think he struggled with that and anxiety a lot. And -- but what it did is it also propelled him forward. And so, it was -- it's almost like the idea that, you know, if you, as a shark, you know, if you don't keep moving, you die, and that's kind of Ted. He always needed to be moving. There was always more to do. There was always more mountains to climb.</p><p>So, I think on one hand, it was, you know, a powerful motivator for him, and yet it also was something that always damaged him. You know, it's like Jane said his father tried to break him, and he didn't, but I think his father really damaged him, and that was the beginning of the damage.</p><p>John Malone says this wonderful thing, he said, no man of success can pull the needle out of your ass, it's been stuck up there since you were a child. And that was his needle.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let's just say right now from the outset, people like John Malone, Brian Roberts, these are also titans of this industry. And I think they both feel that they had a lot to owe Ted Turner, who was the -- you know, the trailblazer. And as such, Keith, you got them as executive producers. They helped fund and they were very important interviews throughout the series, right?</p><p>CLARKE: Ted, as we know, and as people will see, is a bigger than life character. You know, he's a pirate, he's all of those things, daring do, you know, sailor, champion, lust at sea, all of those great things. And the importance of that for these guys is I think they live vicariously through him. They're more conservative guys. They might do some of those things. They don't do it to the extent.</p><p>And they allowed this guy, you know, the classic man (ph) of the south go forth and say all the things and, you know, bust down the doors. And I think that they all acknowledge, at least privately, in there -- a little publicly, I guess, is that they owe their fortunes to Ted.</p><p>You know, when cable started, they had a hope of getting something like 8 percent of the audience nationwide. Ted came in and said, hell no, I want 100 percent. You know, I want to compete with the networks.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And also, just remind people, I mean, I know it, because I work for CNN, but with that risk and that gamble and that all in, he changed the entire media landscape. It was really a global revolution. Just remind how that happened and how perilous it was and how it could have failed at any moment along the way.</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>LEVIN: Well, and that again goes back to, you know, Ted's nature, you know, his instinctive nature. I mean, now he really had it, you know, whatever that it is. But, you know, again, people thought he was nuts and they always said no to him. And as I said, he took no and turned it into on, that was his -- that was who he was. And so, he was always planting the flag, you know.</p><p>And he used to say, you know, I'm just going to go as far as I can, as fast as I can, and I'll worry about it when I get there, whether it was CNN, or cable, or, you know, whatever it was. And that was just his nature, and I think it's just his inner belief, his inner belief in who he was and things were not always transactional for him, it was really about doing the right thing. And you don't find that often.</p><p>AMANPOUR: That -- I was going to ask you that because that is something that, you know, those who work for him and have been in his orbit really admire, the fact that he always did the right thing on climate, on, you know, the environment, on nuclear weapons. You know, on -- even trying to bring peace between the Soviet Union as it was and the United States.</p><p>So, I want to play the other clip that we have, and that is him narrating, from a different project, how essentially, he took over his father's billboard business. And the idea was that he was trying to save that before even he became the cable revolutionary. Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Truth be told, I doubt that most people thought I was up to running the business anyway. After all, it wasn't long before that that my father had declined on giving me even the top job in the Atlanta operation. He said, Teddy, you're just not going to make it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But it was, I really want to show him, prove to him that I could do it. For whatever reason, when his dad was around, he was always a failure.</p><p>TURNER: Turner Advertising represented my father's life's work. He loved the company and what he'd really want me to do was to save it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, again, it's a really interesting beginning for him business wise. So, he's narrating part of that and then you have his actual son Teddy Jr., picking up some of the story. So, he always felt that he had to somehow please his dad, who could -- who was in his life very hard on him, often, and who ended up dying by suicide, and that in -- that also was a big burden that Ted carried through his life.</p><p>CLARKE: Yes, I think that Ted was haunted by his father. I think for -- Ted loved his father, even though his father abused him. I mean, you know, he physically abused him, beat him and all that stuff, which is what Joni says earlier. As Jane said, you know, the father tried to break him but couldn't.</p><p>And it's also, I think, the sins of the father that haunted Ted. You know, it's all about choices at the end of the day, right? And so, he -- his father was a womanizer. And, you know, that was Ted, too. And, you know, his father wasn't around for his kids for Ted when he was young. And Ted followed that, too. That was the sins of the father. But at some point or other, Ted had this fabulous revelation of what was important.</p><p>You know, he had three things in his life. He had family, he had business, and he had sailing. Sailing, he was, you know, named Sailor of the Year four times in a decade. He won the America's Cup. He had survived the Fastnet Race. You know, when 15 other people died, and 80 boats were sunk, the worst disaster in history.</p><p>And Ted is at this crossroads. He's starting CNN. What's most important to me? You know, and he looked around. And at one time he discarded his family and said, you know, what's important to me is sailing and business. And then he looked at this moment and said, you know what, family is more important. Business is important. I'm going to put down the other love of my life, sailing. And he just quit. Then he just focused on his family and business. And then --</p><p>LEVIN: And I think that's really the arc of his story. I mean, he's not a righteous man. He started off somewhat selfish, I would say, but then becomes more selfless when he does realize that it's not always about him. It is what you have left at the end of the world. It's the family and it's the environment, and it's our planet, because he loves the planet, he loves the people within the planet, and that's his whole goal, is to save.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>LEVIN: And so, at the end of the day, I think that's ultimately where he got to.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And finally, Joni, I want to ask you, because we haven't really talked about the impact of CNN on the world. And, just, what will the series tell about CNN, its original promise, how it exploded onto the world, obviously during the First Gulf War, and where it stands now, given how legacy media is almost being overtaken by whatever, podcasts and social media and streaming?</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>LEVIN: Yes. You know, when it first started, I mean, Ted always felt that it was not about the personalities, it was about giving the facts. Let's state the facts and let people decide how they feel about things. And, you know, that was what he was all about. And, you know, wanted to be international. Wanted to be everywhere. And that really started when he went and met with Castro. And after he realized, you know, Castro really looks at CNN all the time, he can't live without it. That's when Ted came home and picked up the phone and started calling all these other countries to set it up.</p><p>But you know, you were there at CNN early on when every week you were wondering whether he could even pay the bills. And so, for him, it was just -- I think it was the idea of connecting the world. I mean, that was really, I think, his whole goal at the beginning, was making sure that they're -- that, you know, we're -- we should all be connected in a sense.</p><p>CLARKE: CNN changed the world, but I think CNN changed Ted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: I dedicate the news channel for America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARKE: I think that's when he realized the world is bigger than his little world of Atlanta, his sailing, and all of these things. When he went and started going and had to meet in these -- the leaders of the world, they all want to meet Ted because, obviously, the reach of CNN in itself is that they could -- everybody could tap into what the Americans were thinking, et cetera, et cetera. But it changed Ted. And that's when he says, you know what? The world is bigger than me. I'm interested in the environment. How can I use my platform to go out there? And the guy was a rock and roll star.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Joni Evans, Keith Clarke, thank you so much.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And it is a remarkable story. The six-part documentary, \"Call Me Ted,\" is now streaming on Max, which is owned by CNN parent company Warner Brothers Discovery.</p><p>Now, the annual climate summit wrapped up in Baku, Azerbaijan over the weekend after much wailing and gnashing of teeth over the amount rich polluting nations should be paying poorer nations to decarbonize and mitigate their climate crises. The deal struck was about a quarter of what they had asked for.</p><p>This COP29 in oil producing Azerbaijan follows last year's in the UAE, also a petro state, but which hammered out a landmark commitment to transition away from fossil fuels. But Saudi Arabia has been lobbying to derail that commitment ever since, and hopes that Donald Trump's return to the White House will help, given his drill, baby, drill policies and his cabinet picks filled with industry execs and deregulators.</p><p>But as wildfires spread across North America with increasing frequency, the dissonance between that harsh reality and climate policy is being felt. Author John Vaillant details this in his recent New York Times opinion piece, and he's joining Hari Sreenivasan in this discussion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Christiane, thanks. John Vaillant, thanks so much for joining us. You know, Americans and I guess North Americans in general are used to seeing almost now a forest fire season, and we associated with say, California or maybe Colorado.</p><p>You wrote a piece in The New York Times recently that said, ladies and gentlemen, the Northeast is burning. Why is this significant? What's the change here?</p><p>JOHN VAILLANT, AUTHOR, \"FIRE WEATHER\": I think what we're seeing is this creeping of flammability and like so many other Americans and Canadians, we assumed 10 years ago that wildfires were a California problem, maybe a Colorado problem, maybe an Australia problem. But I live in British Columbia, and that's a technically a rain forest. And we've been having terrible fire seasons for the past decade.</p><p>And so, I saw it creeping northward up into Oregon, up into Washington, up into B.C. And so, logically, you'd think, OK, this is still moving. And I think in the northeast, where I grew up, where -- you know, very familiar landscape to me, we've had this sort of sense, well, we won't be touched by that. You know, that's a western thing, it's an Australian thing, but we were nice and wet here. It's cool and green. And yet, this trend in heating, warming and drying across the continent is spreading steadily and measurably.</p><p>If you talk to foresters, if you talk to forest hydrologists, they, you know, have the inside scoop on that. And so, they're not surprised by this. But the United States right now is in the driest year in recorded drought history for the entire country.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You know, help our audience distinguish in their minds what might be weather versus what might be climate, right, because right now, as we're having this conversation, I'm doing this from New York City, and we just experienced one of the longest dry spells. We're starting to see all of this from this kind of month and a half, say, without rain. But help us put that into perspective that it's maybe not just this year or this cycle, what are the longer trend lines?</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>VAILLANT: So, there are this kind of two tracks that we're on. And one is natural climate fluctuation. You have warm years and cold years, you have snowy winters, you have dry winters, but then you also have -- and so that's natural to see fluctuation there.</p><p>On top of that though, we have, you know, fossil fuel emission driven climate change, which is measurably heating the atmosphere and the oceans. And so, that is this extra push from behind. And so, what we're seeing now is, you know, record temperatures. It's certainly warmer than normal in the northeast. And, you know, think about your laundry outside on a warmer day, your laundry is going to dry faster. Well, so is the forest floor, so are the grasses. But the other thing, when you look at it globally, it's not just the northeast that has low reservoirs.</p><p>The Mackenzie River, one of the great rivers of the Canadian North, is right now at record low levels. There are huge lakes in the Canadian Subarctic, really inland seas, that are at record low levels. The Amazon River is at a record low level. So, this is a global issue. And when you have warmer air, you're going to have more evaporation.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: What is so unseasonable about this? What is it, you know, about this that is so out of the ordinary that even our bodies feel like there's something off?</p><p>VAILLANT: I know I grew up in Massachusetts and I remember snow flurries in October. And I sound like an old man saying that, but I don't think anybody of any age remembers mass -- you know, hundreds of wildfires burning up and down the I-95 Corridor. You know, that is not anybody's diary, you know, from the past. And so, we really are going through this visible measurable change and we're feeling it in our bodies. It's changing our concept of what the seasons are.</p><p>And so, now out west, people's concept of summer rather than being this time of kind of liberty and freedom and being outside and the sun and the warmth, is when's the smoke going to roll in, you know, when am I going to have to stay inside because it's too smoky? And again, for, say, people in British Columbia or Washington State, that is just not a reality that any of us grew up with.</p><p>And so, we're -- you know, our consciousness is being sort of forced into this new concept of what seasons even mean. And that creates a real dissonance. I mean, if you think about it, you know, we've been around for a long time, not just in North America, but, you know, as homo sapiens on Earth, and we've never had to go through a change this rapid where, you know, in a decade or two, we're actually having to almost redefine what seasons are.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You know, you wrote a fascinating book called \"Fire Weather.\" And in it you describe -- going to the fire that was in 2016 in Alberta, Canada. But one of the things that you mentioned in there is that essentially now fires are burning over at longer seasons and with greater intensity than any other time in human history. I mean, why is that?</p><p>VAILLANT: All right. there are a couple of factors. And one of them -- you know, the simplest one is the heat that we're generating. So, I mean, what the irony is that our economy, our civilization is powered by fire. We think about oil and gas as energy, but it does not become energy until we burn it. So, we are burning literally trillions of fires around the globe in our engines, in our furnaces, in our hot water heaters, in our stoves globally, there's a huge amount of fire and also emissions coming off of all of those fires. So, that's impacted the atmosphere in terms of CO2 and methane, making the whole planet hotter. And the irony is that makes the planet more conducive to burning.</p><p>And so, you couple that then with 100 years of very successful fire suppression, especially in North America. So, now, you have these huge buildups in the forest, including, you know, in the northeast, which, you know, was logged off 150 years ago. There's a lot more forests there now. But with these elevated temperatures, it's -- and more evaporation, you have drier forest and it's easier for fires to get going.</p><p>And so, in Fort McMurray, that this -- the petroleum hub of Canada, which is 600 miles north of the Montana border in the Subarctic, it was 93 degrees. There was still ice on the lakes, it was 93 degrees and the relative humidity that day, May 3, 2016, was 12 percent, which is equivalent to Death Valley in the month of July. And so, we're having these conditions that create opportunities for fire that we've really hardly ever seen before.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>SREENIVASAN: There were, in the fire that you're talking about, 88,000 people that were evacuated, right? And when you see images of fire approaching different communities, especially in the United States, you see this sort of mix of reactions. Some people are like, I can't wait to get out. Oh, my gosh, I'm stuck in traffic. This is horrible. I don't want to die here, right? And then there's other people, similar to a hurricane, who end up trying to hunker down and trying to say, this is my really, really precious home, whatever, I'm going to stand here with a fire hose. What explains how this affects people in figuring out their kind of personal relationship to fire, the environment, their belongings?</p><p>VAILLANT: Hari, this -- I really think this is sort of the question for our decade. You know, it's one of the big questions as fire impinges on our communities more intensely because it burns faster and more intensely now because of heat and, you know, The Journal, in fact, made that their cover story, the changing nature of wildfire and how fast it moves.</p><p>And so, many people who live in fire prone places, especially out west, have a kind of outdated notion of fire and what they might do to combat it. And now, fires are moving faster and with such intensity, so they can project radiant heat of close to 1,000 degrees. You know, a human can't survive that.</p><p>But what if your home is uninsured or what if you live on a ranch, and, you know, your grandfather fought fires and your mom fought fires? And so, you're going to too, except now it's 110 degrees. And the relative humidity is in the single digits. And so, this fire is now -- it's not just going to be a fire on the land, it's going to be a firestorm rolling over you.</p><p>And yet, there's this -- you know, I think there's a natural stubbornness and wish to protect what's ours. But again, if you don't have the means to replace it, if you don't have insurance, which fewer and fewer Americans have now, that's going to change your calculus.</p><p>So, there's a few different factors, but some of it too, is, again, going back to consciousness and thinking about how -- we're needing to catch up with the climate. The climate's moving beyond us right now. We still have outdated notions of it and it's capable of new outrages now. We've seen it in the flooding, you know, after Hurricane Helene, and we've seen it in the fires in Paradise and Lahaina, really shocking energy.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: I wonder why has it taken so long for the capital markets, the insurance providers to reflect this kind of climate realities, right? I mean, we see now there are a number of states where I think 12 insurance -- or seven out of the 12 insurance carriers pulled out of California just in the last couple of years because they don't want to be insuring wildfires. I wonder, like, why haven't the capital markets reflected this risk appropriately?</p><p>VAILLANT: There is extraordinarily -- there's extraordinary dissonance in the financial sector. And so, where you have the insurance industry who does the math and they realize we cannot afford these losses anymore, I understand that 50 insurance companies have pulled out of Louisiana and Florida alone in the past four years. I didn't even know there were 50 insurance companies there.</p><p>So -- and they've realized they can't -- they can no longer afford to cover losses on, you know, multibillion dollar disasters, which are happening almost annually now. So, the insurance industry, in a way, is sort of the grownups in the room who are actually observing the damage done and tabulating it in this quite objective way. Meanwhile, you have the petroleum industry and financial markets who are very bullish on anything that appears to make money.</p><p>And so, there's a lot of investment in offshore drilling right now. So, there's this terrible disconnect and really conflict of interest, even within the financial markets. And so, that's another reckoning, you know, for the 2020s that we're going to have to square up or nature is going to square it up for us.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You know, at the moment, the nominations that President-Elect Trump has for, you know, his pick for EPA chief is Congressman Lee Zeldin. I mean, he's got a fossil fuel executive who might run other parts of the division. So -- and I wonder -- and he's made no secret about wanting to withdraw from the Paris Accords, as he did the first time. What does that do to any kind of cohesive policy?</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>VAILLANT: Hari, it puts us in a really vulnerable position. When you effectively have a policy of climate denial, which the province of Alberta does and which it looks like the Trump administration may have. So, when you have the leaders saying, this isn't happening, this is not an issue, and yet, we're having billion-dollar disasters that are uninsurable every year, we're having bigger fires, bigger floods. And so, there is -- you know, we can't really function as a society in a world that is living by two different realities and two different standards.</p><p>And so, with that -- I mean, the upshot for the citizen is suffering and confusion and the upshot for the states is they're going to have to take more individual responsibility at the municipal level, at the state level for managing their own climate policy when, in fact, the science is objective.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: What does that scenario look like as the map becomes less than habitable for different climate reasons?</p><p>VAILLANT: Exactly. Where do you go? There's a kind of contraction that's going to happen and it's going to be driven by the insurance industry. And some people will still -- will remain without insurance, but you're really exposed. And that's a kind of vulnerability that makes it hard for societies to function well, and this representative -- or I think Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island put it really well when he said you know, without insurance, well, climate disruption makes places -- makes homes uninsurable.</p><p>And when a house is uninsurable, it's really hard to get a mortgage. And without a mortgage, that impacts the housing industry. And without a functioning housing industry, you don't have a functioning economy because that's one of the pillars of the American economy.</p><p>And so, it's not rocket science. You know, it's really quite simple that when you put people in these vulnerable situations, when you don't deal with climate, don't deal with CO2 and the world becomes more flammable, more floodable, that is going to have direct impacts, measurable impacts as we're seeing in the insurance industry on our entire economy. And so, it really seems like good business sense to address climate in a meaningful way, which we have absolutely the tools to do.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Is the global community able to get its arms around this? I mean, because we seem to have these COP meetings increasingly in states whose primary economic driver is the fossil fuel industry, right? This time it's in Azerbaijan. It was in Qatar before. And I wonder, you know, there are efforts to try to create funds to mitigate climate disasters, but it always gets hung up on, well, who's going to pay for it and how much are the -- you know, the smaller countries who might actually feel a greater brunt of it just by their geography, how much do they are they -- how much are they entitled to? How much do the people who are generating the fossil fuel emissions owe?</p><p>VAILLANT: There's -- there is no mitigation fund that's going to cover the global climate damage bill. You know, when you lose an entire island, when you lose an entire neighborhood, my understanding for the -- even just for Hurricane Helene, which is just one hurricane, I think that the tab for that is over $150 billion. And then, Milton, right on the heels of that, you know, that's right up there too, no one even talks about Hurricane John, which came in at the same time and trashed the resort City of Acapulco for the second time in 11 months. So, that's a whole tourist city. That's a whole economy basically wiped out. Who's going to build there now?</p><p>So, you know, these hundreds of millions that people are talking about are drops in the bucket. That's really going to be tens of trillions. And again, that just highlights the dissonance, this kind of there is a -- there's a deep longing we have to maintain the status quo. And that uneven transition into renewable energy, which is happening in parallel with these other things we've been speaking about is -- you know, it's underway. I'd feel confident that it's unstoppable, but it's a patchwork effort at the moment.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: The book is called \"Fire Weather,\" author John Vaillant, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>VAILLANT: Hari, it's great to be with you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And finally, on that note, to save our planet, hundreds of climate activists gathered in Busan, South Korea to show us that life is in plastic is not fantastic.</p><p>[13:55:00]</p><p>Forming a giant human sign urging end plastic.

Later that day, a large forest fire along the Klutina River was reported near that area.</p><p>The government alleges McDonald started the fire despite knowing there was a high fire danger at the time. Investigators determined the fire started when he failed to properly extinguish the camp fire, according to the statement.</p><p>Messages were sent to three email accounts and a voicemail was left at one phone number, all believed to belong to McDonald.</p><p>Stephanie Holcomb, who owns the guiding service, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that it\u2019s not certain that others may be to blame, but in a civil case, the preponderance of evidence favors the plaintiff, in this case the government.</p><p>\u201cEven in the settlement report, one of the last sentences was it cannot be substantiated that there wasn\u2019t other users at the site after Josh, so that\u2019s why I say life isn\u2019t always fair,\" Holcomb said. \u201cI\u2019m more than willing to take responsibility and to face this, but it\u2019s only a 51% chance \u2014 maybe, which seems like an awful lot of wiggle room to like really ruin someone\u2019s business.\"</p><p>A copy of the settlement was not available on the federal court online document site, and a request for a copy was made to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.</p><p>The $900,000 will help cover the costs incurred by state and federal firefighters to extinguish the fire, which burned about 0.28 square miles (0.71 square kilometers).</p><p>\u201cAs we experience longer fire seasons and more extreme fire behavior, we will hold anyone who ignites wildland fires accountable for the costs of fires they cause,\u201d S. Lane Tucker, the U.S. Attorney for Alaska, said in the statement.</p><p>Escaped campfires like this one are the most common for human-caused wildfires on Bureau of Land Management-managed lands in Alaska, the federal agency said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-6d028bff641ec68e086c8d2bfdc1847120240124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B5T-J2V1-DYMD-650W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><timeReceived>10:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 24, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Oregon\u2019s Justice Department said it is also seeking $109 million in damages related to those fires.</p><p>In addition to that, the U.S. Forest Service has asked PacfiCorp to pay $356 million for firefighting costs and damages related to the Slater Fire that started in California but also crossed over the border into Oregon.</p><p>The fires <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-brown-fires-us-news-wa-state-wire-ca-state-wire-8e4e0818146a72c713de625e902f9962\">were among the worst natural disasters</url> in Oregon\u2019s history. They killed nine people, burned more than 1,875 square miles (4,856 square kilometers) and destroyed upward of 5,000 homes and other structures.</p><p>The Oregon lawsuits say PacifiCorp negligently failed to shut off power to its 600,000 customers during a windstorm over Labor Day weekend in 2020, despite warnings from state leaders and top fire officials, and that its power lines caused multiple blazes.</p><p>Representatives of PacifiCorp and Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined to comment about the new liabilities. The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the potential lawsuits.</p><p>Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire estimates that its utilities face at least $8 billion in claims across all the wildfire lawsuits already filed in Oregon and California although the damages could be doubled or even tripled in some of those cases and some of the lawsuits don\u2019t list a dollar amount.</p><p>Those costs, combined with the uncertain regulatory environment in western states where wildfires have become more prevalent, are making it harder for utilities like PacifiCorp to decide when it makes sense to invest in major new power plants and transmission lines.</p><p>\u201cIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE\u2019s (Berkshire Hathaway Energy\u2019s) forest-fire losses and can intelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western states,\u201d Buffett said in <url normalizedValue=\"https://berkshirehathaway.com/2023ar/2023ar.pdf\">his letter</url>. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Buffett said that in extreme cases like with Pacific Gas and Electric in California or Hawaiian Electric utilities could face bankruptcy and the country may have to decide whether to turn to public power if private investors are no longer willing to take the risks associated with the utility business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-2313403237cb663487daf1953fe952a920240226</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BDV-NF51-DYMD-62Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Kunming, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Vegetation and fire archives of the late Holocene are essential for understanding the importance of natural and anthropogenic forcings on past and future vegetation successions as well as climate changes.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Special Project For Basic Research of Yunnan Province-key Project; Yunnan Project For The Introduction of Advanced Talents. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Yunnan Normal University: \"Here we present a 1640-year record of vegetation and fire history of the Lake Haixihai catchment in northwestern Yunnan, southwest China. Pollen and charcoal analyses as well as XRF (X-ray fluorescence) analysis of lacustrine sediments from Lake Haixihai were employed to reveal its regional vegetation, forest fire, and soil erosion intensity changes over the last 1640 years. The results show their significant changes attributed to both climatic conditions and human activities: The lake catchment witnessed the densest forests (including pine and hemlock forests, and evergreen broadleaved forests) and the weakest soil erosion of the last 1640 years as well as relatively frequent forest fires at 380-880 AD, when vegetation succession, forest fire, and soil erosion were mainly driven by natural forcings, i.e., climatic conditions. A significant and abrupt drop in forest density, minor changes in abundance of forest components, and gradually strengthening soil erosion occurred at the transition from 880 to 1040 AD, when anthropogenic forcings such as the development of agriculture and systematic deforestation gradually became dominant ones driving vegetation succession and soil erosion. After this transition, forest density and soil erosion intensity never returned to the level before 880 AD, implying that the modern landscape in the lake catchment was already established approximately at as early as ca. 1040 AD.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"No significant changes in forest component and density as well as forest fire and soil erosion occurred until 1940 AD. The most frequent forest fires, the strongest soil erosion, and low forest density after 1940 AD might be attributed partially to climatic conditions and partially to extensive deforestation around 1960 AD.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A 1640-Year Vegetation and Fire History of the Lake Haixihai Catchment in Northwestern Yunnan, Southwest China.

Where will we find refuge? Where? How?\" <br/>Miguel Angel Henriquez, a 58-year-old farmer from Santa Juana in the same region, told AFP that he saw a neighbor brave the flames to try and rescue some of his animals. \"He did not come out. I yelled at him to come out of the fire, but he didn't listen.\" <br/>A woman from El Santo, in the municipality of Tome, described that \"most of the houses\" in her settlement were burnt. <br/>\"The people did not manage to save anything, they left with what they wore, because the fire advanced very quickly.\" <br/>President Gabriel Boric attended the wake of a firefighter in the town of Coronel, telling mourners: \"The whole of Chile cries with you. I am here to tell you that you are not alone.\" <br/>On Sunday morning, a drop in temperature promised some respite for the 5,300 firefighters deployed against the blazes. <br/>\"There is a small window of improvement in climatic conditions on Sunday and Monday,\" Monsalve told reporters, but warned temperatures could once again approach 40 C by Tuesday. <br/>Ten people have been arrested, the official added, on suspicion of arson. <br/>With some 260 active fires, the government maintained a state of emergency in the regions of Nuble, Biobio and La Araucania, allowing the deployment of additional resources, restriction of free movement of people and the use of soldiers in containment operations.  <br/>\"We face the emergency with unity,\" Boric said on Twitter. <br/>A plane left from Spain Sunday with 50 firefighting specialists, soldiers and drone pilots on board. <br/>\"We have just sent a plane to Chile with a contingent of the Emergency Military Unit to help extinguish and control the fires that are plaguing the country. All our support for the Chilean people,\" tweeted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. <br/>Other countries including Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Mexico have also offered help, according to the Chilean government. <br/>On Saturday, Interior Minister Carolina Toha said Chile was becoming one of the countries most vulnerable to fires due to climate change. <br/>Fire conditions that would have seemed extreme just three years ago are becoming more common, she said. <br/>In 2017, a rash of fires in the same region left 11 people dead, injured nearly 6,000 and destroyed 1,500 homes. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/chile-forest-fire-toll-rises-hundreds-left-homeless-3664560?utm_source=newstex&amp;utm_medium=Feed&amp;utm_campaign=_content\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767167562786256625876100075</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67GM-RT71-JCMN-Y0CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><timeReceived>8:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 5, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Science</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

No injuries or damage to property occurred from the fire, which burned 418 acres before being declared 100 percent contained about eight hours after it started. Winds gusting between 30 and 40 mph fanned the flames. </p><p>But the fire was burning in a remote, uninhabited section of the Stafford Forge Wildlife Management Area in Little Egg Harbor Township, just west of Exit 58 of the Garden State Parkway in southern Ocean County. No one had to be evacuated, even as fire trucks and water tankers were positioned near the homes that firefighters considered potentially vulnerable to the blaze, said Greg McLaughlin, administrator of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. \"The wind has been ripping all day. But it's been consistently in one direction, which helps,\" he said. Also hampering the fire's spread were numerous marshy bogs within the wildlife area that are wet from spring rains, McLaughlin said. The fire was spotted from an aerial observation tower in the Pinelands at 11:44 a.m. State, county and local investigators were looking into how it might have started, but no cause was immediately apparent, McLaughlin said. The fire service has been doing controlled burns in the Pinelands in recent weeks to consume dead leaves, twigs and other forest floor fuel that could accelerate a wildfire. There were no burns being done anywhere else in the state on Tuesday because of the high winds, officials said. About 45 firefighters used 11 trucks, numerous water tankers, a bulldozer and a helicopter to fight the fire. The fire was burning not far from the Air National Guard's Warren Grove target range, where a 2007 forest fire burned 17,000 acres.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000186c1c2db60a3bfe9fac6780000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67Y4-0921-DY7N-F188-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 8, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000418</classCode><className>COUNTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001840</classCode><className>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

These changes, however, are poorly monitored and rarely factor into post-fire recovery efforts or risk assessments, according to a CSU-led article published May 14 in Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The literature review, initiated and led by Thomas Borch, a soil chemist and professor in CSU's Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, found that better techniques are needed to monitor fire-induced changes in soil chemistry. This enhanced monitoring could inform decisions on how to treat drinking water sourced from burned areas, support reforestation, and protect workers against toxins during post-fire cleanup, rebuilding or revegetation.</p><p>The work was conducted in collaboration with researchers at Stanford University. CSU doctoral student Jacob VanderRoest and postdoctoral researcher Holly Roth also contributed to the review article.</p><p>\"A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms in soil can help explain, for instance, why drinking water from a forest fire-impacted watershed is suddenly more toxic, or why a forest is not coming back,\" said Borch, a senior author of the study.</p><p>\"In our study, we mesh organic and inorganic chemistry together, whereas a lot of fire research will typically just consider one subject area,\" said Claudia Avila, a soil biogeochemist who co-led the study with Alandra Lopez while both researchers were postdoctoral scholars in the lab of Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability Professor Scott Fendorf.</p><p>Climate and ecosystem impacts</p><p>The review highlights evidence from recent studies suggesting wildfires may release more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than anticipated. Charcoal-like remnants of burned wood and other organic materials, known as black carbon, may not trap carbon dioxide for as long as scientists had hoped.</p><p>\"Carbon that's gone through forest fires and becomes black carbon can actually turn more readily into carbon dioxide by microbes than previously thought,\" said Fendorf, the Terry Huffington Professor at Stanford.</p><p>\"From a climate perspective, we still have a poor understanding of how much of the carbon that is left after a fire has the potential to be transformed into greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide,\" said Borch, who worked in Fendorf's lab as a postdoctoral fellow 20 years ago.</p><p>Wildfires can have many benefits for ecosystems, the authors note. For example, some fires can increase the nitrogen content in soil organic matter and augment the water solubility of soil organic carbon, setting the stage for regrowth. However, recovery depends on the presence of other chemicals. For instance, certain types of organic molecules formed in soil during fires, called karrikins, are needed for many seeds to germinate. If the local soil chemistry and fire conditions do not produce enough of these karrikins, revegetation may be stunted.</p><p>Other research included in the new review has shown that wildfires can double the soil concentration of a group of toxic chemicals known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which can induce chemical reactions that inhibit revegetation. These molecular-scale effects could well explain the mystery of vast areas where trees have struggled to reestablish after wildfires in the Rocky Mountains, Borch said.</p><p>Wildfires can also alter the chemical properties of inorganic materials such as metals within soils. Fire can change the metals into dangerous forms that readily move through the environment, ending up in the air or nearby water, the authors explained. The collaborators from Stanford University had previously documented high levels of a hazardous form of the metal chromium at wildfire sites resulting from heat-induced transformation of naturally occurring, benign forms of chromium. At sites where extremely hot, long-lasting fires cooked soils to high temperatures for extended periods, chromium persisted for many months until the next large rain event.</p><p>Other research on chromium indicates that after lower-intensity fires, remnant plant and animal tissue in soil can allow the toxic form of chromium to return to its inert form. Taken together, these studies illustrate the broader reality that wildfire impacts on soil chemistry depend on the intricate nature of the fire and landscape, including fire duration and temperature.</p><p>Predicting and mitigating wildfire risks</p><p>Broader surveillance and modeling could inform wildfire management decisions and strategies for protecting lives, property and natural resources. Avila offers an example of how this approach to informed stewardship could help prevent the leaching of metals into drinking water supplies.</p><p>\"By identifying an area that has a high potential for, say, chromium release, we can call for prescribed burns that are lower intensity and reduce the potential for high-intensity, toxin-releasing fires,\" said Avila, who is now an assistant professor of environmental and ocean sciences at the University of San Diego.</p><p>\"If we can grasp the complexity of the intertwined processes that are happening both on the organic and the inorganic side, then that helps give us the ability to predict outcomes for different fire, landscape and geological conditions,\" Fendorf said.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Nature Reviews Earth and Environment <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00548-8\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00548-8</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsmediarelations.colostate.edu/2024/05/15/csu-leads-comprehensive-review-of-wildfire-research-in-collaboration-with-stanford-university/\">https://newsmediarelations.colostate.edu/2024/05/15/csu-leads-comprehensive-review-of-wildfire-research-in-collaboration-with-stanford-university/</url></p><p>Contact: Allison Sylte, 720/849-1907, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:allison.sylte@colostate.edu\">allison.sylte@colostate.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8627831 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8627831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C1W-SX11-JC11-1292-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"969\"/><timeReceived>3:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 16, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

My daughter has asthma and she had to go back on her inhaler [to be able to breathe normally],' Daruwala told Al Jazeera.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A longtime resident of the scenic Himalayan town that is a popular tourist destination in the state of Uttarakhand, Daruwala knew immediately what had happened: The nearby forests and vegetation were on fire again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least 1,313 large fires have ravaged the hills of Uttarakhand since November - among the highest count in the country.Officials estimate the fires have already damaged nearly 1,100 hectares (about 2,718 acres) - about three times the size of New York's Central Park -of forest land in the state.</p><p>Nainital residents say the frequency and intensity of the fires have worsened in recent years, and that the fires are reaching increasingly closer to human settlements.</p><p>That's what happened that evening.</p><p>When she looked out her window, Daruwala saw a large flaming line of burning vegetation inching nearer to her apartment complex. 'It came so close to our habitations that the [water] tank of one of the buildings got burned,' she said.</p><p>The panicked residents of the area quickly mobilised, beating down the fire while the forest department sent people to help them.</p><p>'We were lucky we could stop the fire from reaching us. Because it is not easy, you can't simply throw a bucket of water on a burning tree. These are pine trees that secrete resin which is used to make turpentine and is highly flammable,' Daruwala said.</p><p>'You have to rake earth over the fire and starve it, all the while hoping that the breeze doesn't aggravate it or blow it in another direction.'</p><p>Are heatwaves to blame?</p><p>The region has witnessed reduced winter precipitation in recent years. That in turn has left vegetation dry. 'Then there is El Nino [unusually warm ocean temperatures that affect climate] that is adding to the dryness and heat,' Raghu Murtugudde, climate scientist and professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>It is an explosive mix - literally.</p><p>Experts say heatwaves have contributed to rising fire incidents across India. In 2023, India experienced some of its worst heatwaves on record since 1901, with temperatures in parts of the country touching 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). This year, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has already declared multiple heatwaves, with the capital of New Delhi recording temperatures  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/30/india-reports-first-heat-related-death-this-year\">as high as 52.9C (127.2F) in May, resulting in more than</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/india-heatwave-deaths-heat-stroke-climate-change-880f26e3b8eeb066d2db2308502783d2\">100 people dead.</url></p><p>The lowered soil moisture creates what is known as a vapour pressure deficit, Murtugudde explained. 'When the air isn't saturated, it sucks out moisture from plants as well,' he said. That in turn leaves the vegetation even drier. In such conditions, he said, even a cigarette butt thrown carelessly can start a large forest fire.</p><p>According to the Forest Survey of India (FSI), nearly 10.66 percent of the country's forest cover is under 'extremely to very highly fire-prone zone'.</p><p>Uttarakhand state authorities have said the fires are man-made, and at least three individuals have been arrested. 'In the Indian context, almost all forest fires are man-made,' said Mohan Chandra Pargaien, an Indian forest official in the southern Telangana state, which too has been experiencing frequent fires.</p><p>Locals and animal herders across the country are often known to burn the stubble that remains after grain is harvested, as well as dry grass. In Uttarakhand, they also look to clear the fallen pine needles to make way for fresh vegetation that is used as pasture for their animals, Pargaien said.</p><p>Pargaien hails from Nainital and is familiar with the increase in the frequency of forest fires. 'We are seeing this in the Deccan [southern region of India] as well, where we have grasslands that dry out in the summer, and villagers set fire to the husks hoping to grow more lush pastures for their animals,' he shared.</p><p>Increasing heat adds to the challenges that officials face in controlling wildfires, the forest official said.</p><p>'The forest was not always this dry'</p><p>Daruwala, the Nainital resident, also added that the state had received little to no rains this past season creating water shortages. The rains also serve as fire extinguishers.</p><p>'The rains played a big role last year in helping stop the fires. But this year, there has been lesser rains. The climate has been drier,' she said. 'The forest was not always this dry.'</p><p>Human activity along with with worsening heat and climate patterns make for a fatal combination.</p><p>'With Uttarakhand, it's a hilly terrain, with high-intensity winds shifting fast. Also, a lot of the trees are pine, which are highly flammable. These factors contribute to the fire spreading faster and also make it challenging to control,' she said.</p><p>Prevention and preparedness</p><p>There is a need for long-term planning, Murtugudde, the climate scientist, said. The existing climate change predictions, he said, are inadequate in helping countries like India prepare for such calamities.</p><p>'They don't give you very location-specific information. Nor do they factor in geopolitical scenarios like the Israel-Palestine war or the Ukraine-Russian conflict,' he said, referring to the 2100 projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that predict warming between 1.2 and 4.1 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The wars in Gaza and Ukraine are believed to have led to an expansion in greenhouse emissions - the weapons industry, which has been in overdrive, is a major polluter.</p><p>'It's meaningless to imagine too far into the future,' Murtugudde said.</p><p>'The best thing countries like India can do is focus on developing short-term projections for the next 10 to 15 years that factor local data, because the longer the period you want to integrate [for predictions], the coarser the resolutions of your models will be,' he said.</p><p>'It was well-known that this season was going to be dry and hot because we knew that 2023 was warm, but we don't know yet what will come in the next decade. That should guide the forest protection management in its efforts for prevention,' he added.</p><p>Since many of the fires are man-made, Pargaien said more efforts made towards raising awareness of forest conservation would help, along with steps to minimise activities like stubble burning. 'However, we also need to first address the core issues on why people are starting fires, which is livelihood,' said Pargaien.</p><p>Many communities depend on the forest and the surrounding lands, specifically to support animal husbandry and other allied activities such as the gathering of wood for fuel.</p><p>Though the fire did not reach Daruwala's apartment, the air in her home remained hazy for days. 'It has to burn out, and along the way can cause tremendous damage,' she said. 'My heart goes out to all the birds and wildlife that lived in the forests. We have seen some injured animals, but we don't know how many creatures have died.'</p><p>'When it comes to a conflict between humans and animals or a forest, human interests take precedence. But we must not forget that we have entered the forest, and it is our duty to look after it,' she said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/6/28/smoke-was-so-thick-forest-fires-scorch-indian-mountains-amid-heatwave\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXJZ-ALJZ1363415204083338472580600082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALJZ-136341</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CC0-7SD1-JCMN-Y005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><timeReceived>5:43 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

According to news originating from Penang, Malaysia, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Firebrands are the primary source of ignition for large wildfires and urban wildfires (WUIs). China is a country with a high incidence of forest fires, and there are great differences in the terrain, climate, and other natural conditions in different regions; the frequency of forest fire will lead to greater regional differences.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University Sains Malaysia: \"In the process of fighting forest fire, the fire commander should make an accurate analysis and judgment according to the various signs of the fire, which are the key to ensure the safety of the participants and to realize a quick decision. Existing studies of firebrands formation have been performed using limited quantities of wildland fuels with limited MC fuel levels and environmental conditions and lacking comprehensive data analysis including typical wildland timbers basic fuel, pyrolysis and flammability properties, and forest fire dynamic knowledge (including forest fire development period analysis and the harm of heat flux to the human body) to guide the firefighting strategy. To better understand the characteristics of firebrand formation in different Chinese regional places, a systematic study to quantify wildland fuels ignition formation by testing different fuels under different conditions is needed. The objective of this study was to determine the basic pyrolysis and flammability of wildland fuels with high fire intensity in typical areas of China to provide relevant property data, offering insight into how wildland fuels arrangement can determine the movement of wildfires for firefighting strategy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the pyrolysis performance of selected wild fuels under different heating rates and different fuel MC values. The flammability of selected wildland fuels at different heat fluxes and at different moisture contents was determined using a cone calorimeter. This study measured the pyrolysis and flammability of some selected wildland fuels and found that some controlling factors (MC levels, heating conditions) influenced the outcome variables, especially the flammability of wildland timber. Fire behavior refers to the intensity at which a fire burns and how it moves.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research results point out the following: (1) Forest fire barriers or fuel breaks should be separated among Eucalyptus robusta Smith and Pinus massoniana before or in the fire due to high risk for ignition and strong flammability, and it is suggested to remove, control, and replace high-risk flammable timbers with low-risk flammable timbers as a part of long-term wildland fire management strategies. (2) Fire commanders could utilize some research to test conclusions and make an accurate analysis and judgment: The TTI time for each material indicates the ideal time for firefighters to put out fire, the peak of heat-release time indicates a fully developed fire to suggest firefighters finish work before the forest fire spirals out of control, and the flameout time represents the moment of low risk of fuel ignition, so firefighters could allow the fuel to burn out and change the extinguishing target to other regions of developing forest firebrands.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Laboratory-Scale Study of Selected Chinese Typical Flammable Wildland Timbers Ignition Formation Mechanism.

She is spending a year as a New York Times Local Investigations fellow examining the intersection of politics and environmental issues. She can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:leia.larsen@nytimes.com\">leia.larsen@nytimes.com</email></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike Siaperas, a wealthy software executive, was looking for a change. He found it 10,000 feet above sea level in eastern Utah, buying a ranch that he would turn into a luxury hunting retreat. But there was a problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You couldn't see 10 feet in front of you, the trees were so overgrown,\" he recalled in an interview for a podcast in 2021. \"I wanted to see wildlife.\"</p><p>So he bulldozed swaths of forest on his property and an adjacent state reserve. Then he patented a technique that could strip as much as 100 acres of woodland in a day and tested it at a nearby ranch owned by one of America's wealthiest families. He has since started a tree removal company, created a charity for veterans and opened a pricey lodge at his ranch, hosting retired Navy SEALs, former football stars and other guests to ride all-terrain vehicles, shoot firearms, hunt and bond.</p><p>Those ambitions have been significantly aided by Utah taxpayers, an investigation by The New York Times and The Salt Lake Tribune has found.</p><p>Since 2019, state lawmakers have appropriated more than $5 million to support Siaperas' forestry work, although less than half of it has been paid out. His proposals have been backed by influential allies, met with little to no competition and relied on unproven or disputed scientific claims.</p><p>The funding is part of a pattern of questionable contracts the state - led by a Republican governor and a Legislature with a GOP supermajority - has awarded over the past decade to politically connected people pushing moneymaking projects they claimed had ecological benefits.</p><p>One plan lawmakers endorsed - selling off Utah's biggest freshwater lake to a private company purporting to solve its water quality issues - was deemed unconstitutional by the state attorney general. Another endeavor has funded lobbying against federal protections for wolves, even though none inhabits the state.</p><p>Managing natural resources in the West has long been subject to politics and conflict. In Utah, more than three-quarters of the state's forests lie on federal land. That has stoked long-standing tensions between state lawmakers, who prioritize commercial use of trees and water, and the federal government, which is more focused on long-term sustainability.</p><p>In a conservative state, said Sara Dant, an emeritus professor of history at Weber State University, \"constituents don't really want to hear an ecological or an environmental argument in place of what they often see as an economic argument.\"</p><p>Forests are among the resources that state leaders claim they can manage better than their federal counterparts. And Siaperas' tree-clearing method, known as \"roller felling,\" is an example of a practice they wanted to deploy.</p><p>Inspired by an article Siaperas saw in a 1950 issue of Popular Mechanics, roller felling involves a cable strung between two bulldozers. A 10,000-pound barrel in the center keeps the cable suspended 4 feet high so it doesn't catch on stumps. The process uproots everything in its path.</p><p>\"It's kind of like going in and removing cancer from a body,\" he told lawmakers as he sought more funding for his work this year.</p><p>Siaperas, who declined interview requests for this article, has offered varying rationales for his method To prevent wildfires. To fight drought by reducing water-guzzling conifers. To improve the habitat for trophy animals that draw hunters, whose licenses generate state income.</p><p>But some scientists criticize his method as environmentally disruptive, far more so than controlled burns or other practices they say create fewer risks. \"To me, it looks like nothing more than a pet project with a thin veneer of science,\" said Ben Abbott, an ecology professor at Brigham Young University.</p><p>\"I'm disturbed by the process we went through to approve something like this.\"</p><p>Clearing the ranch</p><p>For most of his career, Siaperas, 66, has focused on running Med USA, a medical billing software company he registered in 1989. He remains the chief executive of the business, which says on its website that it has clients in nearly every state.</p><p>Soon after buying his 1,200-acre property, on the West Tavaputs Plateau in eastern Utah, in 2007, he began cutting down conifers.</p><p>Ripping conifers out of the forest floor caused an aspen colony on the property to send up new shoots and saplings from its sprawling root system, effectively making clones of itself.</p><p>With white trunks, quivering leaves and striking fall colors, aspens are beloved in Utah. They attract moose, deer and elk, which feed on their shoots. While susceptible to pests and disease, aspens are presumed to slow or resist wildfire and regrow if knocked down.</p><p>The Utah Department of Natural Resources took notice of the aspens on Siaperas' land.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2019, the agency awarded him more than $200,000 to remove trees and promote aspen regeneration on at least 75 acres of his ranch and at least 276 acres on the adjacent Cold Spring Wildlife Management Area - a state reserve open to hunters. Many of the cleared acres connect the properties.</p><p>By 2017, Siaperas had honed his roller-felling process and registered a new company, 106 Reforestation. (The \"106\u2033 refers to the acreage of Pando, a massive aspen colony in south-central Utah.)</p><p>Some scientists say they're concerned about long-term consequences, especially at the higher altitudes where Siaperas has planned to cut. Trees grow larger there and recover more slowly.</p><p>The work will affect \"decades, if not centuries, of ecosystem development,\" said Paul Rogers, an ecologist at Utah State University who has studied the roller-felling process.</p><p>Using heavy machinery to tear down trees leaves a lot of debris that the state needs to remove to prevent fires. Clear-cutting large areas of forest leads to erosion and polluted water supplies. And scientists worry about impacts on a variety of wildlife, not just game.</p><p>'A little thing to help'</p><p>During the 2016 election season, Siaperas began forging political connections. He donated $2,700 to Donald Trump's presidential bid and $4,800 to the Republican National Committee. His involvement in politics was encouraged by Don Peay, the head of Trump's Utah campaign.</p><p>Peay, 63, a longtime GOP donor, has been a fixture on Utah's Capitol Hill for nearly three decades, pushing for hunting-related causes. Lawmakers almost always back the bills he champions and block those he opposes. He was impressed by the roller-felling project and would eventually help form a nonprofit connected to Siaperas' ranch.</p><p>They first met and became friends in 1994, when Peay hosted a rally to bolster the state's mule deer populations. Shortly after, Peay founded Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, a group that raises money for state conservation projects by auctioning off Utah hunting permits at an annual expo.</p><p>The expo has raised $80 million for the state since 2001. It attracts celebrities like Wayne LaPierre, the former chief executive of the National Rifle Association, and Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter who was a keynote speaker in 2016. Two years later, the then-president's son visited Siaperas' property, Range Valley Ranch, and shot a bear and a mountain lion nearby.</p><p>In 2019, Siaperas reached a new level of business for his tree-clearing enterprise. He spoke on Capitol Hill after a lobbyist connected him to state lawmakers, Peay said. Several legislators visited the ranch to see the results. That year, one of them requested $2 million on Siaperas' behalf for \"strategic and targeted forest fire treatment.\"</p><p>The next year, Eric Hutchings, a Republican then serving in the state House of Representatives, said he requested $500,000 to support Siaperas' business. In an interview, Hutchings recalled that lawmakers were worried about the shrinking Great Salt Lake and the threat of wildfire, given record damage a few years before. \"As a Legislature, we were like, 'What do we do?'\" he said, adding, \"I feel good about having done a little thing to help.\"</p><p>Lawmakers earmarked another $900,000 in 2021, totaling $3.4 million in allocations over three years.</p><p>That process was unusual. Typically, state environmental experts design projects and find suitable contractors, often through open bidding. In this case, lawmakers handpicked someone with little relevant experience and set aside millions of dollars for his business.</p><p>Utah has one of the shortest legislative sessions in the nation 45 days. That makes the appropriations process a rapid-fire event in which part-time lawmakers - many of them developers or real estate investors - and lobbyists have mere minutes to make their case to get budget items funded. There is limited input from scientists and experts, and no opportunity for public feedback.</p><p>A tailor-made contract</p><p>Initially, more than $1 million of those funds went to a roller-felling trial. Siaperas leveled 900 acres of woodland on two private ranches starting in 2020. One of them was Preston Nutter Ranch, a 42,000-acre property that abuts his land and is owned by family members behind Hunt Energy, who are worth nearly $25 billion.</p><p>With the pilot project complete, he participated in his first competitive bidding process in late 2022, for the clearing of 825 acres in the state reserve of Currant Creek.</p><p>Eight contractors submitted bids, ranging from $552,225 to $3.2 million. Siaperas' estimate came in at $950,000 - almost exactly what state lawmakers had appropriated in 2021.</p><p>Days later, the state canceled the process, requiring contractors to take a virtual site visit. The proposal request was reissued in March 2023. This time, the scope of work called for a heavy-duty cable \"pulled between two dozers\" with a \"rotating fulcrum roller to keep the cable elevated roughly 4 ft off the ground.\"</p><p>Siaperas had patented his fulcrum roller in 2020. His company was the only contractor to submit a bid on the revised proposal.</p><p>\"It seemed to me that they were custom-tailoring this job just to give it to exactly who they wanted,\" said Chris Ivester, whose business was the low bidder in the initial process.</p><p>Jamie Barnes, the Utah state forester who oversaw project logistics, said the job could have gone to Siaperas through a sole-source award because he held the patent. State officials decided to have a competitive process anyway.</p><p>\"I can completely see why people would think that was a rigged bid,\" Barnes said. \"It was not.\" She added that the wide range of previous bids suggested that contractors did not understand the project's scope.</p><p>As it turned out, Siaperas was able to roller-fell only about 10% of the Currant Creek project because the site was too steep for his equipment. The state paid him $240,000, about a quarter of the budget.</p><p>The $5 million lodge</p><p>His most recent strategy to obtain state funds for his roller-felling company was through his nonprofit, Atlantis USA Foundation, registered in 2022. The charity's website says it intends to bring about positive change for veterans \"through conservation of our lands and our values.\" Last year, Peay, who was then serving on its board, appeared before a legislative appropriations subcommittee requesting funds. Lawmakers appropriated $1 million for Atlantis that year and $700,000 this year.</p><p>The state budget description for the funds makes no mention of veterans, however. Instead it directs the money to be spent on restoring aspens to decrease wildfires.</p><p>In a conflict-of-interest form filed with the Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity, which is overseeing the $1 million from last year, Siaperas disclosed his intention to hire 106 Reforestation to do the work.</p><p>Since 2020, Siaperas has made campaign contributions to Utah's governor, Spencer Cox ($10,417); attorney general, Sean Reyes ($25,000); and former House speaker, Brad Wilson ($5,000). Cox and Reyes praised Siaperas in a 2023 video promoting his nonprofit that compared his efforts to Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic.</p><p>Last September, Siaperas opened the Atlantis Lodge on his ranch. Ben Cervinski, a representative for Siaperas and the nonprofit, said the lodge has cost more than $5 million so far and remains in \"phases of completion.\" Veterans could stay at special rates, according to the ranch's website. But for other guests, the lodge was listed at $2,500 a night per person. Smaller cabins, like the one where Donald Trump Jr. had stayed, and glamping tents went for less. Siaperas planned to turn the ranch into a boutique ski resort in winter and had enlisted high school students to dig private biking trails. The website removed the pricing information after Siaperas briefly spoke to a reporter for The Times and The Tribune.</p><p>To date, he has not used the money appropriated to Atlantis for any forestry work, officials said. The state of Utah, his primary client, has not identified any sites where roller felling could be deployed, though the governor's office paid Atlantis $900,000 after the nonprofit submitted an invoice in June 2023.</p><p>In an email to the governor's office last month, Cervinski asked to return that money.</p><p>Still, Siaperas and his ventures have collected at least $1.35 million from the state since 2020 alone.</p><p>Patience for such projects appears to be wearing thin among some lawmakers. Legislators are investigating the payments to Siaperas' ventures, a state auditor confirmed. Rep. Casey Snider, a Republican from Cache County, commissioned an audit of the payments to Peay for wolf lobbying this year.</p><p>Though Siaperas once claimed in an interview that he could take any business, even one he knew nothing about, and \"make it work,\" 106 Reforestation is now rethinking its business strategy.</p><p>\"If you want to lay blame, it's at the federal government,\" said Peay, because it manages most of the suitable land.</p><p>He recalled how he and Siaperas envisioned licensing veteran-owned roller-felling companies in every Western state.</p><p>\"Every veteran would love to have 106 Reforestation on our federal lands,\" Peay said, \"running big equipment, being out in nature, getting away from all the chaos and making more water, less fires, better wildlife habitat.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service confirmed that the federal agency was not considering any roller-felling projects.</p><p>106 Reforestation is now trying to \"engage\" with private landholder clients instead, according to Cervinski.

According to news originating from Jilin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In recent years, the influence of extreme weather patterns has led to an alarming increase in the frequency and severity of sub-surface forest fires in boreal forests. The Ledum palustre-Larix gmelinii forests of the Daxing'an Mountains of China have emerged as a hotspot for sub-surface fires, and terrain slope has been recognized as a pivotal factor shaping forest fire behavior.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include The National Key R&amp;D Program of China. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Beihua University: \"The present study was conducted to (1) study the effect of terrain slope on the smoldering temperature and spread rate using simulated smoldering experiments and (2) establish occurrence probability prediction model of the sub-surface fires' smoldering with different slopes based on the random forest model. The results showed that all the temperatures with different slopes were high, and the highest temperature was 947.91 \u00b0C. The spread rates in the horizontal direction were higher than those in the vertical direction, and the difference increased as the slope increased. The influence of slope on the peak temperature was greater than that of spread rate. The peak temperature was extremely positively correlated with the slope, horizontal distance and vertical depth. The spread rate was extremely positively correlated with the slope. The spread rate in the vertical direction was strongly positively correlated with the depth, but was strongly negatively correlated with the horizontal distance; the horizontal spread rate was opposite. The prediction equations for smoldering peak temperature and spread rate were established based on slope, horizontal distance, and vertical depth, and the model had a good fit (p &lt; 0.01). Using random forest model, we established the occurrence prediction models for different slopes based on horizontal distance, vertical depth, and combustion time.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The models had a good fit (AUC &gt; 0.9) and high prediction accuracy (accuracy &gt; 80%). The study proved the effect of slope on the characteristics of sub-surface fire smoldering, explained the variation in peak temperature and spread rate between different slopes, and established the occurrence prediction model based on the random forest model. The selected models had a good fit, and prediction accuracy met the requirement of the sub-surface fire prediction.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Influence of Terrain Slope on Sub-Surface Fire Behavior in Boreal Forests of China.

(Salom\u00f3n Cruz/X) <br/>On Feb. 28, the day after the conflagration began, residents of San Lucas Quiavin were attempting to keep the fire from reaching their village when the advancing flames surged and took the lives of five farmers. <br/> Since then, the firefight was taken over by the Defense Ministry (Sedena), the Navy (Semar), the National Guard, and state civil protection personnel. <br/> Other villages affected include San Felipe G\u00fcil and San Pablo G\u00fcil. <br/> Officials at the press conference indicated that more than 400 firefighters were battling the blaze, some of them on behalf of the National Forestry Commission (Conafor). <br/>Some of the 400+ firefighters working to extinguish the wildfire in Oaxaca. (@GobOax/X) <br/>An MI-17 Navy helicopter had carried out six water drops from its 2,500-liter capacity bucket from Saturday through 10 a.m . Sunday, officials noted, but no update was available beyond that. <br/> Mountain residents had held a protest to demand that an aircraft join combat efforts, but at the press conference, officials stressed that water drops are only a small part of the strategy in fighting fires. <br/> Officials said that 9,800 work hours had been put into battling the blaze as of Sunday morning, with 95% of the fight carried out on the ground and 5% through the use of technology such as helicopters. <br/> Much of the on-the-ground work has involved setting up firebreaks and applying counterfire; additionally, there was surveillance to prevent the contained portion of the fire from getting out of control. <br/> Officials also reminded communities to be extra careful when slashing and burning, and in a Monday morning post [2]on the X social media platform, the state's civil protection unit warned that the burned areas represent a risk for flash floods. 'Stay aware of inclement weather if you are in or near an area affected by a wildfire,' the unit wrote. <br/> So far this year, 35 forest fires have been recorded in Oaxaca, affecting more than 1,500 hectares, Magdalena Coello, director of the Oaxaca state forest commission, was quoted as saying in newspaper El Imparcial. At least two are active, including one in the jungles of Chimalapas.[3] <br/> With reports from El Universal[4], Animal Politico[5] and El Imparcial[6] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/5-die-battling-forest-fire-in-central-oaxaca/\">https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/5-die-battling-forest-fire-in-central-oaxaca/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/CEPCyGR_GobOax/status/1764676911358193800\">https://twitter.com/CEPCyGR_GobOax/status/1764676911358193800</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/20000-chiapans-left-stateless-as-oaxaca-votes-to-change-border/\">https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/20000-chiapans-left-stateless-as-oaxaca-votes-to-change-border/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/incendio-forestal-en-san-lucas-quiavini-oaxaca-es-controlado-al-90-y-liquidado-en-un-50/\">https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/incendio-forestal-en-san-lucas-quiavini-oaxaca-es-controlado-al-90-y-liquidado-en-un-50/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://animalpolitico.com/estados/incendio-forestal-en-san-lucas-quiavini-oaxaca\">https://animalpolitico.com/estados/incendio-forestal-en-san-lucas-quiavini-oaxaca</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://imparcialoaxaca.mx/oaxaca/845696/incendio-forestal-ha-consumido-700-hectareas-en-quiavini/\">https://imparcialoaxaca.mx/oaxaca/845696/incendio-forestal-ha-consumido-700-hectareas-en-quiavini/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-MXND10009654170958305241925876100028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MXND-10009654</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BGF-8HH1-F03R-N4V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><timeReceived>7:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Boozman College of Public Health</url> projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases per day in children under the age of 17.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>\u201cCOVID is no longer smoldering. It has broken out into a raging forest fire that will grow in size and strength,\" according to the UAMS forecast. \u201cWe cannot stand still. We must act to reduce the consequences of this new surge to the extent possible.\"</p><p>The state's cases on Tuesday increased by 1,875 to 367,007 total since the pandemic began, the Department of Health said.</p><p>Dr. Jose Romero, the state's health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a \u201csurge on top of this surge\" when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated.</p><p>\u201cI expect to see this year significant outbreaks within the school system,\" Romero said during a virtual discussion on vaccine hesitancy held by U.S. News &amp; World Report. \u201cWhat\u2019s already telling me that\u2019s going to happen are the number of day care closures that have occurred because of outbreaks occurring, and camp exposures and closures occurring.\"</p><p>Romero said the key to combatting those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks.</p><p>The White House's vaccine coordinator was in Arkansas to meet with Romero, hospital leaders and other health officials about the outbreak in the state.</p><p>Gov. Asa Hutchinson earlier this month began holding <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/arkansas-governor-hutchinson-covid-vaccine-hesitancy-09cadd2e75ddd5a4c0758b2cb1b6cbfd\">town halls around the state aimed at addressing people who have so far resisted getting vaccinated</url>, and he planned more of the forums next week.</p><p>The state's virus hospitalizations on Tuesday increased by 28 to 815, with 313 in intensive care and 131 on ventilators. UAMS Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson said the increases are straining hospital resources.</p><p>\u201cOur staffing is really stretched thin at this point,\" Patterson said. \u201cIt's not a matter of finding beds, it's a matter of finding people to take care of patients, whether they're COVID-19 positive or not.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-3b1adb89c919596f4a763140b1fe0b1320210720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6361-TNC1-JC5B-G3YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><timeReceived>10:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 20, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Gif-sur-Yvette, France, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"With an increase in the amount of natural disasters, the combined use of cloud-penetrating Synthetic Aperture Radar and deep learning becomes unavoidable for their monitoring.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from CentraleSupelec: \"This article proposes a methodology for forest fire detection using unsupervised location-expert autoencoders and Sentinel-1 SAR time series. The models are trained on SAR multitemporal images over a specific area using a reference period and extract any deviating time series over that same area for the test period. We present three variations of the autoencoder, incorporating either temporal features or spatiotemporal features, and we compare it against a state-of-the-art supervised autoencoder. Despite their limitations, we show that unsupervised approaches are on par with supervised techniques, performance-wise.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"A specific architecture, the fully temporal autoencoder, stands out as the best-performing unsupervised approach by leveraging temporal information of Sentinel-1 time series using one-dimensional convolutional layers. The approach is generic and can be applied to many applications, though we focus here on forest fire detection in Canadian boreal forests as a successful use case.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Detection of Forest Fires through Deep Unsupervised Learning Modeling of Sentinel-1 Time Series.

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Anthropogenic activities including slashing and burning (or swidden agriculture), illegal logging, and agricultural residue burning, are important drivers and driving mechanisms for the occurrence and development of global active fires especially in the tropics. In the past, limited by the access to the global datasets of gridded population density and consistent active fires, the research on the correlation between the occurrence and development of active fires and human activities was relatively insufficient.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: \"It is of great significance to clarify the relationship between human and fire for the sake of revealing the nature of fire regime, estimating carbon emissions and public health management. With Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C6) active fire products provided by the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) and LandScan Global Population Database (e.g., population density) developed by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) during 2003-2019, the dynamic characteristics of spatial and temporal correlations between occurrence intensity of agricultural and forest active fires and population distribution in Mainland Southeast Asia were quantitatively revealed through GIS-based fishnet (1km) statistical analysis and bivariate spatial correlation. The results show that: (1) Nearly 80% of the 'fire-affected grids' in Mainland Southeast Asia were positively correlated with population distribution during the study period. Grids with medium positive correlation and above (r&gt;0.4) accounted for approximately 75%, mainly distributed in areas with low population density (&lt;25 persons/km2) and covered by forest, including central and eastern Thailand, eastern and western Myanmar, northern Laos and northeastern Cambodia. (2) Cropland 'fire-affected grids' in Mainland Southeast Asia during 2003-2019 have more population than forest fire-affected grids. More than 90% of the agricultural fire grids and nearly 3/4 of the counterpart of forest fire were positively correlated with population distribution. (3) The grids of strong positive correlation within agricultural fire area were mainly distributed in areas with population density of 25~100 persons/km2, such as southern Myanmar, and central and eastern Thailand.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In contrast, the corresponding grids within forest fire area were mostly seen in areas with population density below 25 persons/km2, which include eastern and western Myanmar, northern Laos, and northeastern Cambodia. (4) The correlation between occurrence intensity of agricultural and forest fires and population distribution during 2003-2010 was significantly higher than that during 2011-2019, while the annual average population increased obviously in cropland and forest fire grids in the second period.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Dynamic Characteristics of Correlation between Cropland and Forest Active Fires and Population Density in Mainland Southeast Asia.

The fires have long been overlooked.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2 May 2024</p><p>WASHINGTON A new study presents the first large-scale analysis of fire patterns in west and central Africa's wet, tropical forests. The number of active fires there typically doubled over 18 years, particularly in the Congo Basin. The increases are primarily due to increasingly hot, dry conditions and humans' impact on the forests, including deforestation. The increase in forest fires is likely to continue given current climate projections, according to the study.</p><p>With fires increasing in other historically wet forests, such as the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Amazon, wet forest fires can no longer be ignored, the researchers say.</p><p>Scientists have known for decades that wet forests in western and central Africa have fires, but because the fires tend to be much smaller than their counterparts in dry woodlands and savannas, relatively little research has been done on Africa's tropical forest fires. This has led to uncertainty over where and when they burn, what exacerbates them and how that might shift in response to climate change.</p><p>\"Historically, scientists have not considered fire to be an important part of wet, tropical forests, but there's been work in the Amazon in recent decades that has suggested otherwise,\" said Michael Wimberly, an ecologist at the University of Oklahoma who led the study. \"We need to start thinking about wet forests as being susceptible to fires and considering fire an important impact of climate change in tropical forests.\"</p><p>The study was published in Geophysical Research Letters, which publishes high-impact, short-format reports with immediate implications spanning all Earth and space sciences.</p><p>Drier forests, frequent fires</p><p>Previous research on fires in wet, tropical African forests has typically focused on relatively small areas or used datasets that were not representative of the whole forest system. Wimberly's new study is the first comprehensive assessment fire patterns in wet African forests, which are mostly ignited by humans.</p><p>The researchers used satellite imagery to track active fires from 2003 to 2021 in western and central Africa, including the Congo Basin. The researchers found an unambiguous increase in fire frequency over time. The greatest increases were in the Northwest Congolian Lowland Forests, where there were 400 more active fires per 10,000 square kilometers (3,861 square miles) annually, in 2021 as compared to 2003. Across most of the Congo Basin, active fire densities typically doubled over the study period.</p><p>Areas with rapid forest loss, or deforestation, also saw more fire activity. Deforestation is associated with high levels of human activity and fragments the remaining forests, increasing the length of exposed edges where most fires burn. A forest's edge has a drier microclimate and more invasive species than interior forests, making it more susceptible to fire.</p><p>The researchers also compared fire occurrences to weather patterns and found clear associations between fires, high temperatures and vapor pressure deficit, which is an indicator of plant water stress. They found a particularly strong relationship during the 2015-2016 \"super El Nio,\" which brought anomalous heat and drought conditions to tropical Africa.</p><p>\"I was surprised at how strong and clear the climate signal was,\" Wimberly said.</p><p>The findings provide critical insights into how climate change could influence African forest fire activity, particularly during El Nio years, and highlight the need to control fires at forests' edges to prevent harmful feedback loops: A fire-affected forest is more likely to have less canopy cover and more fragmentation, increasing its fire risk.</p><p>\"Tropical forest fires have been long overlooked, but they're only going to become more important in the future,\" Wimberly said. \"We can't ignore them any longer.\"</p><p>#</p><p>Notes for journalists:</p><p>This study is published in Geophysical Research Letters, an open-access AGU journal.

According to news originating from Yakutsk, Russia, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"In 2019, the southern region of Eastern Siberia (located between 45\u00b0 N and 60\u00b0 N) experienced heavy floods, while the northern region (between 60\u00b0 N and 75\u00b0 N) saw intense forest fires that lasted for almost the entire summer, from 25 June to 12 August.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Russian Science Foundation. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (SB RAS): \"To investigate the causes of these natural disasters, we analyzed the large-scale features of atmospheric circulation, specifically the Rossby wave breaking and atmospheric blocking events. In the summer of 2019, two types of Rossby wave breaking were observed: a cyclonic type, with a wave breaking over Siberia from the east (110\u00b0 E-115\u00b0 E), and an anticyclonic type, with a wave breaking over Siberia from the west (75\u00b0 E-90\u00b0 E). The sequence of the Rossby wave breaking and extreme weather events in summer, 2019 are as follows: 24-26 June (cyclonic type, extreme precipitation, flood), 28-29 June and 1-2 July (anticyclonic type, forest fires), 14-17 July (both types of breaking, forest fires), 25-28 July (cyclonic type, extreme precipitation, flood), 2 and 7 August (anticyclonic type, forest fires). Rossby wave breaking occurred three times, resulting in the formation and maintenance of atmospheric blocking over Eastern Siberia: 26 June-3 July, 12-21 July and 4-10 August. In general, the scenario of the summer events was as follows: cyclonic Rossby wave breaking over the southern part of Eastern Siberia (45\u00b0 N-60\u00b0 N) caused extreme precipitation (floods) and led to low gradients of potential vorticity and potential temperature in the west and east of Lake Baikal. The increased wave activity flux from the Europe-North Atlantic sector caused the anticyclonic-type Rossby wave breaking to occur west of the area of a low potential vorticity gradient and north of 60\u00b0 N.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This, in turn, contributed to the maintenance of blocking anticyclones in the north of Eastern Siberia, which led to the intensification and expansion of the area of forest fires. These events were preceded by an increase in the amplitude of the quasi-stationary wave structure over the North Atlantic and Europe during the first half of June.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Effects of Rossby Waves Breaking and Atmospheric Blocking Formation on the Extreme Forest Fire and Floods in Eastern Siberia 2019.

According to news reporting from Bogota, Colombia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Throughout the years, wildfires have negatively impacted ecological systems and urban areas.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Universidad Sergio Arboleda; Colombian Ministry of Science And Technology-minciencias; Cyted-red Premia Through The Project \u201cred De Prevencion, Mitigacion Y Rehabilitacion De Areas Afectadas Por Incendios Forestales (Redpremia)\u201d. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Universidad Sergio Arboleda: \"Hence, reinforcing territorial risk management strategies against wildfires is essential. In this study, we built an early alert system (EAS) with two different Machine Learning (ML) techniques to calculate the meteorological conditions of two Colombian areas: (i) A 3D convolutional neural net capable of learning from satellite data and (ii) a convolutional network to bias-correct the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output. The results were used to quantify the daily Fire Weather Index and were coupled with the outcomes from a land cover analysis conducted through a Naive-Bayes classifier to estimate the probability of wildfire occurrence. These results, combined with an assessment of global vulnerability in both locations, allow the construction of daily risk maps in both areas. On the other hand, a set of short-term preventive and corrective measures were suggested to public authorities to implement, after an early alert prediction of a possible future wildfire. Finally, Soil Management Practices are proposed to tackle the medium- and long-term causes of wildfire development, with the aim of reducing vulnerability and promoting soil protection.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In conclusion, this paper creates an EAS for wildfires, based on novel ML techniques and risk maps.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Design of a Forest Fire Early Alert System through a Deep 3D-CNN Structure and a WRF-CNN Bias Correction.

To this end, the German Federal Ministries competent for Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs and Climate Action, for Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer protection, for Food and Agriculture, for Housing, Urban Development and Building and the Greek Ministries competent for Foreign Affairs, for Environment and Energy, for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, and for Rural Development and Food acknowledged the good progress made in bilateral cooperation since their last consultations in May 2022 and agreed on perspectives for the work ahead.</p><p>We welcome Germany's participation as an \"Honored Country\" in the Thessaloniki International Fair 2024, as an additional positive step towards further strengthening and deepening Greek- German economic and business ties.</p><p>Greece and Germany held political consultations and discussed the progress and potential of their bilateral relations, as well as regional and international developments, namely Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, Western Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>Regarding European Union's priorities both countries place much emphasis on enhancing global competitiveness and resilience, implementing and further developing the European Green Deal also as a driver for growth and innovation. This includes the need to spur investments, both private and public, strengthen the EU Single market, remove unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, especially for SMEs and improve the competition framework as well as pursue an ambitious, robust, open and sustainable EU trade policy. Both countries support farming to adapt to climate change. Germany and Greece also place much emphasis on ensuring adequate defence funding. Both sides reaffirmed their support for EU enlargement, in accordance with conditionality and the principle of own merits, and for the parallel EU internal reform process in view of ensuring that Union policies are fit for the future and financed in a sustainable manner, based on the values on which the Union is founded, and that the EU institutions continue to function effectively, in accordance with the December 2023 European Council Conclusions. Moreover, both countries place much emphasis on expanding EU cooperation with third countries to address among others irregular migration.</p><p>On Migration, both sides acknowledged the milestone agreement on the Pact on Migration and Asylum and reconfirmed the importance of the Greek-German Migration Dialogue. In this context, it was agreed to continue working together, in preparing for the Dialogue's 12th Round, to be held in Berlin, on June 14th, 2024.</p><p>Greece and Germany enjoy an excellent level of cooperation at the UN and share the same strong commitment to upholding the rules and principles enshrined in the UN Charter also in view of Greeces candidature as an elected member of the UN Security Council for the period 2025-2026 (elections on 6 June 2024).</p><p>Greece and Germany share the understanding that climate-related shocks threaten food security and economic growth and can contribute to displacement and instability. Both sides acknowledge that the common long-term target of the European Union is climate neutrality at latest in 2050. Together we are committed to accelerating the expansion of renewable energies, cross border energy infrastructure both for hydrogen and electricity and flexible demand to make Europe's energy system fit for the future.</p><p>In the field of green hydrogen both sides will continue to collaborate in the context of TSI (Project H2Greece). Moreover, the bilateral cooperation under the TSI umbrella has in the current month been enlarged to the implementation of the emissions trading system 2 and a national social climate plan for Greece (Project CLIMA+).</p><p>Both sides express their strong interest in the prospect of establishing stronger and more resilient energy interconnections within the EU. Both sides acknowledge that the green energy corridor between southern and northern Europe across the Adriatic Sea as expressed via the Green Aegean Interconnector (GAI) project merits further consideration.</p><p>The General Secretariat for Civil Protection (GSCP - Ministry for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection) has established and developed an extensive network of cooperation with several German authorities in the field of civil protection and disaster management.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that over the last few years, Germany has assisted Greece in the outbreak of disasters (forest fires and refugee crisis), the most recent being August 2023 and August 2021. It is worth mentioning that Germany has already participated twice in the UCPM pre-positioning program, sending immediately deployable ground forest fire teams to strategically chosen areas of Greece.</p><p>Regarding the agricultural Ministries, also responsible for rural development and food, the following issues were examined aiming to developing bilateral cooperation at the level of exchange of know-how and the strengthening of the cooperation between the two sides:</p><p>The implementation of agri-environmental measures and ecological programs within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy 2023-2027.</p><p>The management of waste from agricultural activities.</p><p>Carbon management and the circular economy in the context of agricultural activities.</p><p>Promotion of organic farming and sustainable viticulture.</p><p>The limitation of gas emissions which contribute to the climate crisis.</p><p>Climate change and extreme weather events highlight challenges and shared responsibility in the field of housing, urban development and building. Therefore, the topics of sustainable urban development, climate adaptation in municipalities, resilient urban development and climate-friendly heating, cooling and building were discussed. The field holds great potential for further knowledge sharing and in-depth cooperation.</p><p>Both sides have agreed to further strengthen German-Greek relations within the European family and continue this format of consultations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126574719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C59-0FM1-DYTH-G450-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 31, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Maine has long struggled to adequately provide both in-home and residential care for children with advanced behavioral needs, but the problem has worsened in recent years. The same workforce shortage that plagues many other industries has made it difficult for state-contracted agencies to recruit and retain behavioral health professionals willing to take on the challenging and sometimes dangerous work.</p><p>This month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2024/09/09/u-s-department-of-justice-sues-maine-over-treatment-of-children-with-behavioral-disabilities/\">the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state of Maine</url> for allegedly violating the civil rights of disabled children. Among the allegations are that the state has failed to invest in community-based providers and that it has been \"unnecessarily segregating children with behavioral health disabilities in hospitals, residential facilities and a state-operated juvenile detention facility.\"</p><p>Maine was first <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2022/06/22/justice-department-says-maine-breaking-law-by-over-institutionalizing-disabled-kids/\">put on notice by the Justice Department in 2022</url>, meaning it has had two years to fix deficiencies in the system.</p><p>Department of Health and Human Services officials are negotiating a potential settlement and would not be interviewed for this story, but spokeswoman Lindsay Hammes said the state remains committed to providing the right services at the right time for children. Access challenges started under the previous administration, she noted, and the pandemic both contributed to more behavioral challenges for children and \"profoundly affected the behavioral health workforce.\"</p><p>Gov. Janet Mills, in a news conference Friday at the University of Southern Maine, sidestepped a direct question about children languishing for months in hospital emergency departments.</p><p>\"I'm not going to comment on (ongoing) litigation,\" Mills said. \"We've been talking to the Department of Justice for a couple years about this matter, and we've also pumped a half a billion dollars into behavioral health management in recent years.\"</p><p>Mills insisted that the state has \"branched out\" and \"expanded mental health services\" in a number of areas.</p><p>But Nancy Cronin, executive director of the Maine Developmental Disabilities Council, a quasi-governmental agency funded by federal and state dollars, said Maine's system has failed too many children.</p><p>\"It's time to care about our kids,\" she said. \"These are kids who haven't had voices and we are not paying good enough attention to.\"</p><p>Caregivers and family members like Unangst hope the legal action focuses more public attention on the problems and forces the state to make improvements.</p><p>\"I thought maybe if this starts getting out there, people will start listening,\" she said. \"I'm not the only family going through this. We've always been sort of hidden and I think the assumption is that we're all just managing on our own, but that's not the case. We're suffering here.\"</p><p>Eliza and Andy Watson of Gray are also on waitlists for in-home services for their 9-year-old son Hunter. Their son is an in-patient at Spring Harbor Hospital in Westbrook, where he's being treated for behavioral health conditions.</p><p>Hunter's hospitalization could have been prevented if they had received consistent in-home services, the couple said. But they lost that support a year ago.</p><p>Another child, Abby Bedard of Bingham, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2024/07/14/a-13-year-old-bingham-girl-has-been-stuck-in-the-er-since-christmas-she-just-wants-a-place-to-call-home/\">has spent months living at Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan</url> because she can't get a placement in a community-based home.</p><p>Bedard, 13, has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and other emotional challenges that elevate the risk that she might harm herself or family members. Bedard's parents only wanted to keep her safe when they brought their daughter to the hospital as a last resort, never thinking that she'd still be there many months later.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'THEY ARE TURNING THEIR BACKS ON US'</emphasis></p><p>The Unangst family lives in a rural part of Winthrop, 10 miles west of Augusta. A sign on the front door warns visitors that a child with autism spectrum disorder lives here and might run away or resist help.</p><p>When Sue Unangst answers, one hand is on the doorknob and the other is holding Bruce's shirt. Tightly.</p><p>She repeatedly apologizes for her messy house. \"I don't get to clean a lot,\" she said.</p><p>Bruce was diagnosed at a young age with autism spectrum disorder. He's non-verbal and needs help to eat, bathe, even go to the bathroom. He's sometimes aggressive, too, mostly toward himself.</p><p>He used to run into walls, face first and at full speed. He's gotten so many bruises that Sue has to carry a doctor's note saying he isn't being abused so that she can take him in public without fear of someone calling child protective services.</p><p>And as he's gotten older, his increased strength and diminished understanding of his ability to cause harm has been a dangerous combination.</p><p>\"You have to have hands on him all the time,\" she said.</p><p>Sometimes, though, that's not possible. So, she tethers herself to him with a harness.</p><p>When Bruce was younger, a behavioral specialist came to his home five days a week, providing him with structure and affording his mother much-needed respite. Sue has two other children, one of whom also has special needs, although not as severe as Bruce's. Her husband died 10 years ago.</p><p>After the pandemic hit, Unangst lost her in-home care worker and still hasn't landed a replacement. Instead, her father helps as often as he can - he even sleeps on the couch some nights so he can be there early to get Bruce ready for school.</p><p>Based on Bruce's diagnoses, the state is required to provide him - and thousands like him across the state - with a certain level of care. But that's not happening.</p><p>He is now on three different waitlists - one for in-home support, one for temporary hospitalization at Spring Harbor hospital in Westbrook and one for long-term residential care. Every six months, his mother must reapply for services.</p><p>\"I work at a psychiatric center,\" she said, referring to Riverview in Augusta. \"I've seen what happens when people don't get care at an early age. It's not right. It's not OK. They are turning their back on us.\"</p><p>Some of his behavior changes are reactions to medications. But to properly regulate his prescriptions, Sue would need him in a supervised medical setting such as Spring Harbor.</p><p>Several months ago, Sue was scared for Bruce's safety and took him to the emergency room at Maine General in Augusta. They had to wait four hours before anyone came to see him and then they were told to wait longer. But Bruce's behavior was only getting worse, so she left.</p><p>\"I never heard from them again,\" she said. \"Except for a $500 bill.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM'</emphasis></p><p>Eliza and Andy Watson's son Hunter is currently an inpatient at Spring Harbor Hospital, receiving behavioral health treatment. But they say he may have avoided hospitalization if their family had gotten the help they needed from DHHS.</p><p>\"This is a failure of the system,\" Eliza said. \"If we had in-home help, we would have been more likely to keep him home, and in the community.\"</p><p>The family has received on-and-off services from DHHS since 2020, but their in-home care ended a year ago.</p><p>Experts who used to come to the home helped them recognize and manage Hunter's behavioral issues.</p><p>\"Because they weren't there every day, they would notice changes in Hunter that sometimes we missed,\" Eliza said. When the services were most effective - and the patchwork of services they received varied in quality - the social workers would teach Eliza and Andy communication skills used to de-escalate situations with Hunter.</p><p>Hunter has trouble regulating his emotions - especially when he becomes angry - and without consistent help, it seems like anything they do can set him over the edge. The Watsons adopted Hunter from the foster care system. They suspect he was abused but don't know exactly what happened to him before they began caring for him when he was 5.</p><p>Hunter loves the outdoors, including camping, swimming and fishing.</p><p>But Eliza said Hunter's \"fight-or-flight response 90% of the time is to fight, and that will include anything, punching, kicking, scratching, spitting and using any object against you.\"</p><p>\"When he becomes fixated on something, and you tell him 'No,' in his eyes we no longer are the parents, but instead we become the obstacle in the way, and he will do anything he can to remove the obstacle,\" Andy Watson said. \"I call him the 'other Hunter,' the 'different Hunter.' \"</p><p>The 'other Hunter' emerged one August day when they were planning on setting up a campfire. Andy said he went into the house for a few minutes, and when he came back out, Hunter had tried to start a fire by himself and had gotten hold of a can of lighter fluid.</p><p>\"I told him, 'That's bad news, you need to stop,' \" said Andy, who works at Lowe's and is a map maker. Andy said he feared his backyard might turn into a forest fire.</p><p>Hunter became enraged, doused Andy with lighter fluid and tried to set him on fire with a lighter.</p><p>Andy rushed Hunter to a guest room - a room they use to help calm Hunter down - but Hunter was able to knock down a door to get to Andy.</p><p>Eventually, Andy had to barricade himself in another section of their home, and then later in his truck.</p><p>He called the Maine DHHS crisis hotline, but no one was available. He called Eliza, who rushed home, and then 911.</p><p>Police arrived, and took Hunter to Maine Medical Center's emergency department. That same night, Hunter was sent home, but two days later, his emotional state deteriorated and he was admitted to Spring Harbor, where he has been ever since. He'll be able to return home as soon as they can stabilize his behavior with medications. Due to the hospitalization, Hunter re-qualifies to receive support services, but the Watson's are still on waiting lists.</p><p>When the in-home help is consistent, Hunter listens better, is less aggressive and is more trusting of adults, the Watsons said. However, it takes several months for Hunter to get used to and trust the clinicians and social workers.</p><p>\"The whole point is if they receive the right level of care, then these kids can become functional people in the world,\" said Eliza Watson, owner of Two Mums Kitchen. \"When he's not the 'other Hunter,' he is a delightful, curious, loving and inquisitive child.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'IT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT'S JUST SOLVED'</emphasis></p><p>Discussions between the Justice Department and Maine health officials are ongoing. The case is likely to either result in a settlement or lead to a consent decree under which the courts take control of a portion of Maine's system.</p><p>Other states are facing the same challenges. The Justice Department has put Utah and Rhode Island on notice for similar violations cited in the Maine lawsuit.</p><p>\"I really feel like there is momentum to move the system. There's a sense of urgency now,\" said Cronin, with the disabilities council. \"But the pressure needs to continue.\"</p><p>Cullen Ryan, who leads a statewide advocacy group called the Maine Coalition for Housing and Quality Services and is the parent of a child with special needs, said the challenges with providing services have been \"boiling at a low simmer for a long time.\"</p><p>\"But it's not a problem that's just solved ... because I think our system is such that it looks at things short term, instead of building systems and investing in them,\" he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, families are the ones who suffer.</p><p>\"A family doesn't know they have signed on to this really challenging situation just by virtue of giving birth to a child,\" Ryan said.</p><p>One area that could be improved, Cronin said, is increasing reimbursement rates for services so care providers can be paid more. While the rates have improved recently, wages in the private sector have increased more.</p><p>Jayne Van Bramer, president and chief executive officer of Sweetser, a nonprofit agency that provides children's services, said a new program called the ACT (assertive community treatment) Team works to provide comprehensive in-home and community services.</p><p>Sweetser has funding to serve 25 children in southern Maine, and Van Bramer said they've so far avoided workforce shortages because the state gave them enough money to provide $5,000 bonuses to attract and retain employees.</p><p>\"It's real money and it's caused people to take these jobs,\" she said.</p><p>But while the ACT Team is backed by the state and working to prevent crises in children, other programs that don't get as much support have to be cut. School-based behavioral health programs, for instance, had to be trimmed because the state did not come through with $1 million in needed funding.</p><p>The federal government's lawsuit criticizes the state for not investing appropriately.</p><p>\"To start, Maine could ensure that children actually receive the community-based behavioral health services that the state offers in theory and could address long waitlist by expanding capacity of community-based services and expanding the director care work force, especially in rural and frontier areas,\" the suit says.</p><p>DHHS spokeswoman Hammes, however, said the MaineCare rate reform implemented in 2023 resulted in an investment of $237 million in state and federal funds for providers. DHHS also plans to provide annual cost of living adjustments to keep pace with inflation. Additionally, the most recent biennial budget passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Mills included an additional $20 million in children's behavioral investments to improve accessibility, availability, and quality and consistency of services.</p><p>One new initiative is a pilot program called The Children's Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walk-in Center in Bangor, which serves youth in need of immediate mental health support. So far, approximately 150 children experiencing anxiety, depression, suicidality, and other behavioral health needs have visited that center.</p><p>According to the state's online behavioral health dashboard, there are more than 18,000 children receiving some level of services, and 197 children are in residential care (62 of them out of state).</p><p>The collective waitlist for services for the most severely disabled children is 456, and the average number of days on the list ranges from 48 in Franklin County to 267 in Hancock County. Thousands more are waiting for less acute, but needed services.</p><p>Although the waitlists remain high, DHHS spokeswoman Hammes said they have come down by more than 20% since 2022</p><p>Van Bramer said when children are in crisis, they end up in emergency rooms and institutions, which are the most expensive for the health care system. Prevention is better for children, more effective and less costly.</p><p>\"We have the money, but we are spending it in the wrong places,\" Van Bramer said.</p><p>One of the wrong places, experts say, is spending money on behavioral health at Long Creek Youth Development Center in South Portland, which the Justice Department referred to it as a \"de facto children's psychiatric facility.\"</p><p>Carol Garvan, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said when children aren't getting the services they need, \"they act out in ways where police are charging them with offenses linked to their behavioral health needs.\"</p><p>They then end up in Long Creek.\u00a0\"It's a really sorry indictment on our system that youth prison is what passes for mental health care in Maine,\" Garvan said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'I NEED TO FIND A PLACE HE'LL BE SAFE'</emphasis></p><p>Most days, Sue Unangst wakes up at 4:30 or 5 a.m. to get ready for work and get Bruce ready for school.</p><p>When she leaves for work, her father stays with Bruce until a van comes to take him to Margaret Murphy Center in Lewiston, a specialized school for children with developmental disabilities and emotional/behavioral disorders.</p><p>Unangst comes home by 4 p.m. and makes dinner, first for Bruce, then for her two older children.</p><p>It's been just the four of them for the last decade.</p><p>In 2014, Sue's husband, Eric \"lost his fight with depression,\" and took his own life.</p><p>She pauses to wipe away tears.\u00a0\"All he wanted was to be a good dad,\" she said.</p><p>Eric was an Air Force veteran. A picture of him in his uniform still hangs on the fridge in the kitchen.</p><p>After dinner, Sue typically takes Bruce for a walk, but not before strapping him into a big stroller.\u00a0She gives him medication at 8 p.m. that is supposed to calm him down and help him sleep.</p><p>\"But he might rock and roll until midnight,\" she said.</p><p>Bruce now sleeps in the same room as his mother. He used to have his own room until he kicked out one of his windows and tried to eat the glass.</p><p>She's grateful her job allows her flexibility. If Bruce has a meltdown at school and needs to be picked up, she has to leave. If the only time she can meet with one of his specialists is between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., she has to find time in her workday.</p><p>\"I have no life. I work, I go home. I don't go out, I can't have friends,\" she said.</p><p>Kylee Howard worked with Bruce for several years as a behavioral health professional in their home. When she left that employer for a different job, she wasn't replaced.</p><p>Howard has kept in touch with the family and tries to come see Bruce once a month.\u00a0\"He's just my friend now,\" she said.</p><p>One Sunday this month, Howard went apple picking with the family. Bruce darted all around the orchard, smiling the whole time.</p><p>Howard gets emotional thinking about the gap in services for Bruce and how his behaviors have regressed since she was with him regularly.</p><p>\"He was eating with a fork, he could use signs, he wasn't hitting himself. The way he flourished ... \" she said.</p><p>Howard confirmed what has long been a criticism of direct care work: that employees are not paid enough. She said she earned $16 an hour when she started and $20 when she left. Even though she developed a close bond with Bruce and the Unangst family, the work was challenging.</p><p>Still, the idea that Bruce has been languishing on a waitlist for services is unfathomable to her.</p><p>\"It's supposed to take a village,\" Howard said, \"and they are doing it themselves.\"</p><p>Sue Unangst thinks a lot about growing up and living in Maine her whole life, working since she was a teenager and paying taxes.</p><p>It should be easier, she said. Not easy, because parenting is rarely that, just easier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNJOU-httpswwwsunjournalcom20240929weresufferingheremainefamiliesofdisabledchildrenwaitforhelp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNJOU2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D3F-MP71-F03F-K4H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490508</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Lewiston Sun Journal  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunjournal.com </publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64499\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 29, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States &amp;

Maine has long struggled to adequately provide both in-home and residential care for children with advanced behavioral needs, but the problem has worsened in recent years. The same workforce shortage that plagues many other industries has made it difficult for state-contracted agencies to recruit and retain behavioral health professionals willing to take on the challenging and sometimes dangerous work.</p><p>This month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2024/09/09/u-s-department-of-justice-sues-maine-over-treatment-of-children-with-behavioral-disabilities/\">the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state of Maine</url> for allegedly violating the civil rights of disabled children. Among the allegations are that the state has failed to invest in community-based providers and that it has been \"unnecessarily segregating children with behavioral health disabilities in hospitals, residential facilities and a state-operated juvenile detention facility.\"</p><p>Maine was first <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2022/06/22/justice-department-says-maine-breaking-law-by-over-institutionalizing-disabled-kids/\">put on notice by the Justice Department in 2022</url>, meaning it has had two years to fix deficiencies in the system.</p><p>Department of Health and Human Services officials are negotiating a potential settlement and would not be interviewed for this story, but spokeswoman Lindsay Hammes said the state remains committed to providing the right services at the right time for children. Access challenges started under the previous administration, she noted, and the pandemic both contributed to more behavioral challenges for children and \"profoundly affected the behavioral health workforce.\"</p><p>Gov. Janet Mills, in a news conference Friday at the University of Southern Maine, sidestepped a direct question about children languishing for months in hospital emergency departments.</p><p>\"I'm not going to comment on (ongoing) litigation,\" Mills said. \"We've been talking to the Department of Justice for a couple years about this matter, and we've also pumped a half a billion dollars into behavioral health management in recent years.\"</p><p>Mills insisted that the state has \"branched out\" and \"expanded mental health services\" in a number of areas.</p><p>But Nancy Cronin, executive director of the Maine Developmental Disabilities Council, a quasi-governmental agency funded by federal and state dollars, said Maine's system has failed too many children.</p><p>\"It's time to care about our kids,\" she said. \"These are kids who haven't had voices and we are not paying good enough attention to.\"</p><p>Caregivers and family members like Unangst hope the legal action focuses more public attention on the problems and forces the state to make improvements.</p><p>\"I thought maybe if this starts getting out there, people will start listening,\" she said. \"I'm not the only family going through this. We've always been sort of hidden and I think the assumption is that we're all just managing on our own, but that's not the case. We're suffering here.\"</p><p>Eliza and Andy Watson of Gray are also on waitlists for in-home services for their 9-year-old son Hunter. Their son is an in-patient at Spring Harbor Hospital in Westbrook, where he's being treated for behavioral health conditions.</p><p>Hunter's hospitalization could have been prevented if they had received consistent in-home services, the couple said. But they lost that support a year ago.</p><p>Another child, Abby Bedard of Bingham, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2024/07/14/a-13-year-old-bingham-girl-has-been-stuck-in-the-er-since-christmas-she-just-wants-a-place-to-call-home/\">has spent months living at Redington-Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan</url> because she can't get a placement in a community-based home.</p><p>Bedard, 13, has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and other emotional challenges that elevate the risk that she might harm herself or family members. Bedard's parents only wanted to keep her safe when they brought their daughter to the hospital as a last resort, never thinking that she'd still be there many months later.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'THEY ARE TURNING THEIR BACKS ON US'</emphasis></p><p>The Unangst family lives in a rural part of Winthrop, 10 miles west of Augusta. A sign on the front door warns visitors that a child with autism spectrum disorder lives here and might run away or resist help.</p><p>When Sue Unangst answers, one hand is on the doorknob and the other is holding Bruce's shirt. Tightly.</p><p>She repeatedly apologizes for her messy house. \"I don't get to clean a lot,\" she said.</p><p>Bruce was diagnosed at a young age with autism spectrum disorder. He's non-verbal and needs help to eat, bathe, even go to the bathroom. He's sometimes aggressive, too, mostly toward himself.</p><p>He used to run into walls, face first and at full speed. He's gotten so many bruises that Sue has to carry a doctor's note saying he isn't being abused so that she can take him in public without fear of someone calling child protective services.</p><p>And as he's gotten older, his increased strength and diminished understanding of his ability to cause harm has been a dangerous combination.</p><p>\"You have to have hands on him all the time,\" she said.</p><p>Sometimes, though, that's not possible. So, she tethers herself to him with a harness.</p><p>When Bruce was younger, a behavioral specialist came to his home five days a week, providing him with structure and affording his mother much-needed respite. Sue has two other children, one of whom also has special needs, although not as severe as Bruce's. Her husband died 10 years ago.</p><p>After the pandemic hit, Unangst lost her in-home care worker and still hasn't landed a replacement. Instead, her father helps as often as he can - he even sleeps on the couch some nights so he can be there early to get Bruce ready for school.</p><p>Based on Bruce's diagnoses, the state is required to provide him - and thousands like him across the state - with a certain level of care. But that's not happening.</p><p>He is now on three different waitlists - one for in-home support, one for temporary hospitalization at Spring Harbor hospital in Westbrook and one for long-term residential care. Every six months, his mother must reapply for services.</p><p>\"I work at a psychiatric center,\" she said, referring to Riverview in Augusta. \"I've seen what happens when people don't get care at an early age. It's not right. It's not OK. They are turning their back on us.\"</p><p>Some of his behavior changes are reactions to medications. But to properly regulate his prescriptions, Sue would need him in a supervised medical setting such as Spring Harbor.</p><p>Several months ago, Sue was scared for Bruce's safety and took him to the emergency room at Maine General in Augusta. They had to wait four hours before anyone came to see him and then they were told to wait longer. But Bruce's behavior was only getting worse, so she left.</p><p>\"I never heard from them again,\" she said. \"Except for a $500 bill.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM'</emphasis></p><p>Eliza and Andy Watson's son Hunter is currently an inpatient at Spring Harbor Hospital, receiving behavioral health treatment. But they say he may have avoided hospitalization if their family had gotten the help they needed from DHHS.</p><p>\"This is a failure of the system,\" Eliza said. \"If we had in-home help, we would have been more likely to keep him home, and in the community.\"</p><p>The family has received on-and-off services from DHHS since 2020, but their in-home care ended a year ago.</p><p>Experts who used to come to the home helped them recognize and manage Hunter's behavioral issues.</p><p>\"Because they weren't there every day, they would notice changes in Hunter that sometimes we missed,\" Eliza said. When the services were most effective - and the patchwork of services they received varied in quality - the social workers would teach Eliza and Andy communication skills used to de-escalate situations with Hunter.</p><p>Hunter has trouble regulating his emotions - especially when he becomes angry - and without consistent help, it seems like anything they do can set him over the edge. The Watsons adopted Hunter from the foster care system. They suspect he was abused but don't know exactly what happened to him before they began caring for him when he was 5.</p><p>Hunter loves the outdoors, including camping, swimming and fishing.</p><p>But Eliza said Hunter's \"fight-or-flight response 90% of the time is to fight, and that will include anything, punching, kicking, scratching, spitting and using any object against you.\"</p><p>\"When he becomes fixated on something, and you tell him 'No,' in his eyes we no longer are the parents, but instead we become the obstacle in the way, and he will do anything he can to remove the obstacle,\" Andy Watson said. \"I call him the 'other Hunter,' the 'different Hunter.' \"</p><p>The 'other Hunter' emerged one August day when they were planning on setting up a campfire. Andy said he went into the house for a few minutes, and when he came back out, Hunter had tried to start a fire by himself and had gotten hold of a can of lighter fluid.</p><p>\"I told him, 'That's bad news, you need to stop,' \" said Andy, who works at Lowe's and is a map maker. Andy said he feared his backyard might turn into a forest fire.</p><p>Hunter became enraged, doused Andy with lighter fluid and tried to set him on fire with a lighter.</p><p>Andy rushed Hunter to a guest room - a room they use to help calm Hunter down - but Hunter was able to knock down a door to get to Andy.</p><p>Eventually, Andy had to barricade himself in another section of their home, and then later in his truck.</p><p>He called the Maine DHHS crisis hotline, but no one was available. He called Eliza, who rushed home, and then 911.</p><p>Police arrived, and took Hunter to Maine Medical Center's emergency department. That same night, Hunter was sent home, but two days later, his emotional state deteriorated and he was admitted to Spring Harbor, where he has been ever since. He'll be able to return home as soon as they can stabilize his behavior with medications. Due to the hospitalization, Hunter re-qualifies to receive support services, but the Watson's are still on waiting lists.</p><p>When the in-home help is consistent, Hunter listens better, is less aggressive and is more trusting of adults, the Watsons said. However, it takes several months for Hunter to get used to and trust the clinicians and social workers.</p><p>\"The whole point is if they receive the right level of care, then these kids can become functional people in the world,\" said Eliza Watson, owner of Two Mums Kitchen. \"When he's not the 'other Hunter,' he is a delightful, curious, loving and inquisitive child.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'IT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT'S JUST SOLVED'</emphasis></p><p>Discussions between the Justice Department and Maine health officials are ongoing. The case is likely to either result in a settlement or lead to a consent decree under which the courts take control of a portion of Maine's system.</p><p>Other states are facing the same challenges. The Justice Department has put Utah and Rhode Island on notice for similar violations cited in the Maine lawsuit.</p><p>\"I really feel like there is momentum to move the system. There's a sense of urgency now,\" said Cronin, with the disabilities council. \"But the pressure needs to continue.\"</p><p>Cullen Ryan, who leads a statewide advocacy group called the Maine Coalition for Housing and Quality Services and is the parent of a child with special needs, said the challenges with providing services have been \"boiling at a low simmer for a long time.\"</p><p>\"But it's not a problem that's just solved ... because I think our system is such that it looks at things short term, instead of building systems and investing in them,\" he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, families are the ones who suffer.</p><p>\"A family doesn't know they have signed on to this really challenging situation just by virtue of giving birth to a child,\" Ryan said.</p><p>One area that could be improved, Cronin said, is increasing reimbursement rates for services so care providers can be paid more. While the rates have improved recently, wages in the private sector have increased more.</p><p>Jayne Van Bramer, president and chief executive officer of Sweetser, a nonprofit agency that provides children's services, said a new program called the ACT (assertive community treatment) Team works to provide comprehensive in-home and community services.</p><p>Sweetser has funding to serve 25 children in southern Maine, and Van Bramer said they've so far avoided workforce shortages because the state gave them enough money to provide $5,000 bonuses to attract and retain employees.</p><p>\"It's real money and it's caused people to take these jobs,\" she said.</p><p>But while the ACT Team is backed by the state and working to prevent crises in children, other programs that don't get as much support have to be cut. School-based behavioral health programs, for instance, had to be trimmed because the state did not come through with $1 million in needed funding.</p><p>The federal government's lawsuit criticizes the state for not investing appropriately.</p><p>\"To start, Maine could ensure that children actually receive the community-based behavioral health services that the state offers in theory and could address long waitlist by expanding capacity of community-based services and expanding the director care work force, especially in rural and frontier areas,\" the suit says.</p><p>DHHS spokeswoman Hammes, however, said the MaineCare rate reform implemented in 2023 resulted in an investment of $237 million in state and federal funds for providers. DHHS also plans to provide annual cost of living adjustments to keep pace with inflation. Additionally, the most recent biennial budget passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Mills included an additional $20 million in children's behavioral investments to improve accessibility, availability, and quality and consistency of services.</p><p>One new initiative is a pilot program called The Children's Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walk-in Center in Bangor, which serves youth in need of immediate mental health support. So far, approximately 150 children experiencing anxiety, depression, suicidality, and other behavioral health needs have visited that center.</p><p>According to the state's online behavioral health dashboard, there are more than 18,000 children receiving some level of services, and 197 children are in residential care (62 of them out of state).</p><p>The collective waitlist for services for the most severely disabled children is 456, and the average number of days on the list ranges from 48 in Franklin County to 267 in Hancock County. Thousands more are waiting for less acute, but needed services.</p><p>Although the waitlists remain high, DHHS spokeswoman Hammes said they have come down by more than 20% since 2022</p><p>Van Bramer said when children are in crisis, they end up in emergency rooms and institutions, which are the most expensive for the health care system. Prevention is better for children, more effective and less costly.</p><p>\"We have the money, but we are spending it in the wrong places,\" Van Bramer said.</p><p>One of the wrong places, experts say, is spending money on behavioral health at Long Creek Youth Development Center in South Portland, which the Justice Department referred to it as a \"de facto children's psychiatric facility.\"</p><p>Carol Garvan, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said when children aren't getting the services they need, \"they act out in ways where police are charging them with offenses linked to their behavioral health needs.\"</p><p>They then end up in Long Creek.\u00a0\"It's a really sorry indictment on our system that youth prison is what passes for mental health care in Maine,\" Garvan said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'I NEED TO FIND A PLACE HE'LL BE SAFE'</emphasis></p><p>Most days, Sue Unangst wakes up at 4:30 or 5 a.m. to get ready for work and get Bruce ready for school.</p><p>When she leaves for work, her father stays with Bruce until a van comes to take him to Margaret Murphy Center in Lewiston, a specialized school for children with developmental disabilities and emotional/behavioral disorders.</p><p>Unangst comes home by 4 p.m. and makes dinner, first for Bruce, then for her two older children.</p><p>It's been just the four of them for the last decade.</p><p>In 2014, Sue's husband, Eric \"lost his fight with depression,\" and took his own life.</p><p>She pauses to wipe away tears.\u00a0\"All he wanted was to be a good dad,\" she said.</p><p>Eric was an Air Force veteran. A picture of him in his uniform still hangs on the fridge in the kitchen.</p><p>After dinner, Sue typically takes Bruce for a walk, but not before strapping him into a big stroller.\u00a0She gives him medication at 8 p.m. that is supposed to calm him down and help him sleep.</p><p>\"But he might rock and roll until midnight,\" she said.</p><p>Bruce now sleeps in the same room as his mother. He used to have his own room until he kicked out one of his windows and tried to eat the glass.</p><p>She's grateful her job allows her flexibility. If Bruce has a meltdown at school and needs to be picked up, she has to leave. If the only time she can meet with one of his specialists is between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., she has to find time in her workday.</p><p>\"I have no life. I work, I go home. I don't go out, I can't have friends,\" she said.</p><p>Kylee Howard worked with Bruce for several years as a behavioral health professional in their home. When she left that employer for a different job, she wasn't replaced.</p><p>Howard has kept in touch with the family and tries to come see Bruce once a month.\u00a0\"He's just my friend now,\" she said.</p><p>One Sunday this month, Howard went apple picking with the family. Bruce darted all around the orchard, smiling the whole time.</p><p>Howard gets emotional thinking about the gap in services for Bruce and how his behaviors have regressed since she was with him regularly.</p><p>\"He was eating with a fork, he could use signs, he wasn't hitting himself. The way he flourished ... \" she said.</p><p>Howard confirmed what has long been a criticism of direct care work: that employees are not paid enough. She said she earned $16 an hour when she started and $20 when she left. Even though she developed a close bond with Bruce and the Unangst family, the work was challenging.</p><p>Still, the idea that Bruce has been languishing on a waitlist for services is unfathomable to her.</p><p>\"It's supposed to take a village,\" Howard said, \"and they are doing it themselves.\"</p><p>Sue Unangst thinks a lot about growing up and living in Maine her whole life, working since she was a teenager and paying taxes.</p><p>It should be easier, she said. Not easy, because parenting is rarely that, just easier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLPRE-httpswwwpressheraldcom20240929weresufferingheremainefamiliesofdisabledchildrenwaitforhelp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLPRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D3F-MP81-F03F-K0MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Press Herald  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pressherald.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64498\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 29, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States &amp;

Our collective efforts to promote equitable economic growth and opportunity are rooted in a belief that democratic governance requires delivering tangible results for our people. Shared values anchor our commitment, including respect for democracy and the rule of law, diversity and inclusion, environmental and social protection, labor rights, and human rights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the inaugural Americas Partnership Summit on November 3, 2023, our leaders stated their intention to significantly strengthen our economic partnership through an enduring, high-level forum for deepening economic collaboration and integration that can take on the major global challenges of our time, from combatting the climate crisis to promoting greater social and economic opportunity. The leaders offered a roadmap to strengthen cooperation, integration, and innovation, asking foreign, trade, and finance ministers to focus on the following cross-cutting priorities:</p><p>* Strengthening regional competitiveness and integration</p><p>* Fostering shared prosperity and good governance</p><p>* Building sustainable infrastructure</p><p>* Protecting the climate and environment</p><p>* Promoting healthy communities</p><p>High-Impact Cooperation on Priority Issues for Our People</p><p>Today, we report important progress in advancing our objectives by promoting inclusive entrepreneurship, clean hydrogen, respect for the rule of law and transparency, sustainable food production, digital workforce development, and civilian space cooperation.</p><p>To expand entrepreneurship opportunities and provide entrepreneurs access to capital, Canada, the United States, and Uruguay are co-leading an effort to train an inclusive, diverse cohort of entrepreneurs. The USAID CATALYZE Americas Partnership Accelerator has started training the first cohort of social impact entrepreneurs from four Americas Partnership countries. The Accelerate Women Entrepreneurs Program will soon begin training its first cohorts of women-led/owned small and medium sized enterprises from six countries. These accelerator programs are designed to support approximately 750 entrepreneurs in ten Americas Partnership countries over three years and steer some of those graduates toward an Angel Investor Network led by the Uruguay Innovation Hub in partnership with IDB Lab.</p><p>To expand access to opportunity in the digital economy, we plan to build upon the successful semiconductor workforce symposium held in January in Costa Rica with a second semiconductor symposium September 5-6 in Mexico to identify opportunities in the semiconductor supplier ecosystem. We plan to accelerate efforts to work together with Costa Rica's Center of Excellence to offer virtual regional courses in cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, and other related digital areas. We seek to offer virtual digital skills and training region-wide to accelerator graduates and startups as part of the Angel Investor Network platform, under a joint entrepreneurship and digital workforce umbrella.</p><p>To advance our shared clean energy and decarbonization goals, the Americas Partnership clean hydrogen working group was established to promote clean hydrogen and derivatives in our respective countries and realize our hemisphere's potential as a leading region for investment in clean hydrogen and derivatives. Co-led by Chile, Uruguay, and the United States, the working group aims to help all countries assess the viability of clean hydrogen and derivatives in meeting their national clean energy and climate goals and where viable, through commercial development of projects. The working group launched a series of technical workshops focused on developing national policy, regulatory, and investment frameworks to support production and use of clean hydrogen and derivatives in which all partners benefit from the collective experiences of Americas Partnership members governments, independent experts, and private companies investing in clean hydrogen and derivatives projects in Americas Partnership countries and globally. By fostering the development and adoption of national strategies and roadmaps, the Americas Partnership is accelerating the development of clean hydrogen markets, value, and supply chains across the region. To support this aim, the working group is building upon the successful technical workshops by pursuing additional capacity building activities.</p><p>To strengthen the rule of law, transparency, and anti-corruption efforts, we are exchanging best practices and sharing information, most recently in a workshop hosted by the Dominican Republic, which showcased different models for fostering a culture of transparency and ethics in critical government functions. Between now and the Americas Partnership Summit of 2025, all partners plan, with technical assistance from sources such as the UNODC anti-corruption hubs, to convene stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society, to adopt and maintain measures for improved procurement practices and greater transparency in the same, consistent with their obligations under the UN Convention against Corruption and domestic law.</p><p>To strengthen food security and sustainable food production, experts gathered for workshops in Ecuador and Peru. With support from the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), we defined a regional agenda on bioeconomy initiatives, smart agriculture, deforestation-free sustainable production, and food systems transformation. Going forward and with the assistance of IICA, we intend to create a digital platform on sustainable agriculture best practices, resources, and opportunities, to promote the technical development of value chains for a more sustainable agricultural industry. We also intend to work on digital tools for traceability like the use of georeferencing to promote deforestation-free production and in a new generation of public policies that strengthen the agricultural and food systems of the Americas, which is essential to improve economic opportunities in rural areas and food security.</p><p>We are also strengthening our cooperation on the peaceful civilian uses of space through a working group co-led by the United States and Chile. That includes demonstrating how space-based assets and data can be used to improve forest fire and water management and exploring the impact of satellites on night sky astronomical observations. Going forward, we are continuing to focus on practical, impactful, environmental, and societal applications of space technology through the realization of additional workshops on the application of space and a possible space conference in 2025.</p><p>Innovative Financing Solutions for Sustainable Infrastructure and Biodiversity</p><p>We applaud the work being done in the trade and finance tracks of the Americas Partnership to enhance competitiveness, strengthen trade facilitation, and accelerate cooperation on financing for sustainable infrastructure. We recognize the importance of the ongoing collaboration between the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and IDB Invest to accelerate cooperation on financing for sustainable infrastructure through the Americas Partnership Platform.</p><p>We welcome our continued partnership with the IDB providing innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize investments in natural capital and biodiversity that advance climate change objectives through the Fund for Nature and looking forward to announcing specific projects in the coming years.</p><p>Strengthening Value and Supply Chain Competitiveness and Resilience</p><p>We appreciate the expertise and assistance of the IDB as we work to develop and strengthen resilient, secure, sustainable value and supply chains. We value the IDB competitiveness studies on critical minerals, semiconductors, and medical supplies coordinated under the finance and trade tracks.</p><p>Sustained Stakeholder Engagement for Results</p><p>We have engaged with private sector, civil society, and labor organizations to inform our work and continue to identify opportunities for further engagement with these key stakeholders. In this regard, we look forward to exploring the possibility of undertaking business delegations to partner countries, in coordination with the trade track.</p><p>Expanding the Partnership Consistent with High Standards</p><p>We collectively intend to expand the Americas Partnership to prospective participants and endorse a process that upholds the highest standards anchored in the principles of the East Room Declaration. To advance inclusive economic prosperity in the Western Hemisphere, we have adopted a formal process for considering prospective participants. Any nation in the Western Hemisphere that wishes to join the partnership can be considered by submitting an expression of interest to the foreign ministers of the Americas Partnership.</p><p>* * *</p><p>2025 Summit</p><p>We look forward to the 2025 Americas Partnership Leaders' Summit in Costa Rica.</p><p>For more information and media inquiries, please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:E_Communications@state.gov\">E_Communications@state.gov</email> To learn more about the Americas Partnership, visit the main webpage: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.state.gov/americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity/\">https://www.state.gov/americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity/</url>, and follow along on social media using the hashtag: #AmericasPartnership.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-delivering-on-the-promise-of-the-americas-partnership-by-unlocking-competitiveness-for-inclusive-prosperity\">https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-delivering-on-the-promise-of-the-americas-partnership-by-unlocking-competitiveness-for-inclusive-prosperity</url>/</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8729304 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8729304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CH8-TGS1-DYG2-R54V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1688\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 18, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He later posted photos of their mysterious underwater discovery on Facebook.</p><p>\"At first when we saw it in the boat, I thought it was cool to see something like that,\" Wollak, 36, told USA TODAY. \"At that time I didn't know the magnitude of what it was.\"</p><p>This month the Wisconsin Historical Society delivered news that was beyond the father and daughter's wildest dreams: They had discovered a long-lost 152-year-old shipwreck.</p><p>Researchers said last week they believe the ship Henley and her dad spotted is the remains of the George L. Newman, a vessel built before the Civil War. Historical records show that it sank in 1871 after struggling to navigate through heavy smoke from the Peshtigo Fire, the deadliest forest fire in U.S. history.</p><p>Until this year, the Newman had never been spotted, researchers told Wollak. As the Wisconsin Historical Society explained in a Facebook post, the ship was abandoned, became covered with sand and was \"largely forgotten - until it became exposed and was located by the Wollaks this past summer.\"</p><p>\"I was blown away by it, especially being able to share it with Henley,\" Wollak said.</p><p>Father-daughter outing</p><p>led to discovery</p><p>On Aug. 13, Henley asked her dad if they could go swimming off the southeast shore of Lake Michigan's Green Island. She wanted to look for rocks and sea glass. Her dad wanted to go fishing, he told USA TODAY.</p><p>The two struck a compromise. Wollak agreed to take Henley to her favorite spot, driving their motorboat boat \"real slow\" along the route there, to look for fish.</p><p>That's when they saw what they later learned was the George L. Newman. Wollak gave his daughter full credit for placing them where they were when they made the find.</p><p>\"She ultimately put us in that location because that's where she wanted to swim,\" Wollak said.</p><p>Maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen told FOX 11 News in Green Bay that local researchers \"didn't have anything\" about a shipwreck documented in the area where the Wollaks found the George L. Newman.</p><p>\"It's a pretty significant shipwreck, pretty old for Wisconsin shipwrecks,\" Thomsen said. Historical records say the vessel was more than 40 yards long and 9 yards wide.</p><p>Wisconsin shipwreck sank in 1871</p><p>Officials from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources later went to Henley's spot on the lake to capture sonar scans of the wreck. Historians said the ship on the lake bottom matched the measurements and best-estimated location of the George L. Newman.</p><p>The ship was built in 1855 in Ohio, and it was a three-masted barkentine, akin to a schooner, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society. On its last voyage in October 1871, the Newman was transporting lumber from Little Suamico, Wisconsin, according to the society.</p><p>Historians said the ship was sailing blind that day through thick smoke from the Peshtigo Fire, a forest fire that surrounded Lake Michigan's Green Bay and killed more than 1,200 people, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>\"To have it tied to the Peshtigo fire makes it even more special,\" Thomsen, the archeologist, told FOX 11 News.</p><p>The smoke was so dense that the Green Island lighthouse keeper left the light in the daylight, which is when the George L. Newman ran aground on the southeast point of Green Island, the historical society said. The lighthouse keeper rescued the crew and they salvaged what they could from the wrecked vessel.</p><p>Henley may not completely understand the historical significance of her discovery, her father said.</p><p>\"She has such a love for the outdoors, I think as she gets older the magnitude of this will sink in for her,\" Wollak said.</p><p>For now, Henley is most excited for next summer, when the lake will be warm enough to go swimming again. Fishing is growing on her, too.</p><p>And gazing out of her dad's boat into the waters of Lake Michigan will always hold a special place in her heart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Wollak and his daughter Henley</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>catch game fish on Lake Michigan.

According to news reporting originating from Yanbian University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires cause damage to property and the environment around the world every year. North Korea has suffered from fires every year. Fires may lead to temporary or permanent damage to forest ecosystems, long-term site degradation, and alteration of hydrological regimes, producing detrimental impacts on economies, human health, and safety.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Basic Research Project of The National Research Foundation of Korea; Samsung Academic Research; National Nature Science Foundation of China; Jilin Provincial Science And Technology Department Project. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Yanbian University: \"In North Korea, fires cause serious damage to the affected mountainous environment. However, it is very difficult to obtain ground information or perform field checks because of the political isolation of North Korea. Thus, there are few studies that have investigated North Korean fires. In this situation, remote sensing techniques and digital topographic data can be used to investigate fire characteristics in North Korea. In this study, fire trends were analyzed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LPDAAC) from 2004 to 2015, and Landsat data were processed to estimate burned areas in South Hamgyong Province (SHP) and Gangwon Province (GWP) in North Korea. The burn severity of large fires in elevation, slope, and landform features was also analyzed to investigate large fire-burned areas using 30-m-resolution Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). After the results were compared and discussed, the following conclusions were derived. (1) In terms of location, fires in SHP were relatively concentrated along BaekDu-DaeGan (BDDG), while fires in GWP were scattered throughout the province. (2) In terms of size, the large fire-burned areas with an area greater than 1000 ha are significantly more frequent in SHP than in GWP. In brief, large fires occurred more frequently and were more serious in SHP than in GWP. (3) In terms of forest type, coniferous areas were more susceptible to damage from fires and large fires than deciduous areas in both GWP and SHP. This is attributed to the combustible resin within the coniferous trees. Particularly, when a crown fire occurs, it tends to spread rapidly throughout the coniferous forest. (4) Regarding landforms, most large fires occurred along windward-side open slopes, while there were very few fires in shallow valleys, high ridges, or U-shaped valleys.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It is believed that cultivation in high-elevation terrain and a lack of fire-extinguishing equipment and systems allow large fires to spread quickly. North Korea is very susceptible to large fire damage and must develop preparation measures against such situations.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Investigation of Forest Fire Characteristics in North Korea Using Remote Sensing Data and GIS.

A series of prescribed burns will be conducted within the 8,600-acre Waynesville watershed. The protected watershed rises from Allens Creek up the flanks of the mountainside to the Blue Ridge Parkway, making it visible from much of South Waynesville.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The watershed supplies pristine drinking water not only to the town, but also to Lake Junaluska and along N.C. 209 into Crabtree. The prescribed burn is intended to improve the health of the forest, which in turn means improved water quality of the streams flowing through it.</p><p>The hope is that prescribed burns will be an \"Rx\" to restore forest health and diversity in the watershed, according to Dr. Pete Bates, both a WCU professor and forester with Forest Stewards.</p><p>\"Fire was a very key disturbance that shaped Southern Appalachian forests,\" Bates said. \"It is a natural part of our forest ecosystems.\"</p><p>To effectively restore forest diversity, prescribed burns will likely be done every five to 10 years, he said.</p><p>\"It's not a one and done,\" Bates said. \"If you are going to try and restore conditions to resemble what they might have been a while ago, you just can't go in and burn one time and expect that to happen.\"</p><p>The prescribed burn plan was outlined at the Waynesville town council meeting last week by Forest Stewards, a forestry nonprofit affiliated with Western Carolina University that oversees forest management in the watershed.</p><p>Because of clear-cutting that started around 1900 and continued for many decades, Bates said that much of the forest in the watershed is of uniform ages \u2014 in other words trees grew back from clear cut areas all at once so the trees in those areas all roughly the same age. He also said maple, birch and beech trees are replacing oaks, hickories and yellow pines in the watershed.</p><p>\"Maples are much higher users of water than oaks are,\" Bates said. \"Those species use 17% more water than oaks do. We need all the water we can get.\"</p><p>Mountain laurel is also becoming increasingly dense in the watershed and that is limiting the regeneration and growth of other species.</p><p>\"What we are trying to do is mitigate some of those issues and restore some of these forests by introducing fire,\" Bates said. \"The forest is less diverse than it used to be. It is our hope that we can initiate a prescribed burn program in the watershed to mitigate some of those changes, bring back some of that diversity.\"</p><p>When will the burns happen?</p><p>Waynesville signed an agreement with the North Carolina Fire Service to carry out the prescribed burns devised by Bates and his team. The prescribed burns will be conducted at no cost to the town.</p><p>\"The North Carolina Forest Service has been interested in this property and working with us for a long time,\" Bates said. \"We now have a signed agreement and they will implement any burns in the watershed. We will work with them to develop that.\"</p><p>He said the prescribed burns could begin sometime in April. The NCFS is currently working out the logistics for the first prescribed burn in the watershed but Bates expects it to be sooner rather than later.</p><p>\"As with any prescribed burn all the stars must align, the weather and everything else,\" Bates said.</p><p>Town manager Rob Hites said that town residents will be informed about the prescribed burn before it is initiated.</p><p>\"Our fire department will be involved, you just won't wake up one morning and there is a forest fire,\" Hites said.</p><p>Bates added that \"anyone in the fire world will know what is going on.\"</p><p>___ (c)2024 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

All these natural calamities point towards the fingerprints of climate change. A new term, 'global boiling', coined by the United Nations, gave renewed attention to the crisis. This arresting term was given after July 2023, making it the hottest month ever recorded in Earth's history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change is real and convincing. While many parts across continents, from Europe to North America to Asia, battled record-breaking heat waves in 2023, torrential rains caused massive landslides and floods in India, Slovenia, South Korea, Libya, and Japan. The melting of glaciers in Georgia caused a terrible landslide that took many lives. Worldwide, lower precipitation and extremely dry air conditions made vegetation more susceptible to fire. The California fires are well-known, but the disastrous Hawaii wildfires, which nearly wiped out the centuries-old Lahaina Town, surprised the scientific community. One can keep adding examples of such natural disasters to justify that climate change is an undeniable reality. However, it is prudent for me to analyze some of the latest science and chart a path towards a carbon-neutral Earth.</p><p>Globally, by some estimates, wildfires burn more than 9 million hectares of tree cover every year. One might argue that forest fires and subsequent plant regrowth are part of nature's carbon cycle. However, what is really disturbing is the extremely severe and longer fire seasons, which are often marked as the worst in modern history. A new USDA report finds that degraded forests lose their inherent ability to absorb and sequester carbon and could potentially become major carbon emitters by 2070. The report also suggests that rapidly ageing forests in many countries, notably in the US, exhibit a decreased ability to absorb planet-warming gases. This prompts a key question: Are we on the right track to reduce Kyoto Six emissions and achieve net zero on time?</p><p>Kyoto Six and Net-Zero</p><p>The Kyoto Six-carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons-are heat-absorbing gases that keep our planet at a pleasant 15 degrees Celsius. Given this crucial role, why should one be worried about these gases? Well, the answer is straightforward: continuous spewing of these gases into the atmosphere, mainly from burning fossil fuels, has resulted in the Earth trapping extra heat. This phenomenon, known as global warming, has been convincingly linked to extreme natural events, from frequent wildfires to glacial thawing leading to rising sea levels. The concept of 'net-zero emissions' or simply 'net-zero' revolves around achieving a balance between the amount of these gases emitted and the amount removed from our atmosphere. In order to achieve net-zero equilibrium, to date, 97 countries have stated their specific net-zero targets-between 2050 and 2070. Collectively, these countries account for 79.3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, the two major emitters, China and the United States, contribute 36 percent of the global total. And for the first time in 2023, India has surpassed the European Union-27, securing an uneasy third place in these rankings.</p><p>Charting the road ahead</p><p>India announced its net-zero target at the COP26 Summit in 2021, aiming for 2070. To put this in context, the country currently emits 3.17 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent each year, with the energy and agriculture sectors contributing the most at 2.22 Gt and 741.9 metric tonnes, respectively. Forestry is the only sector that squirrels away more carbon than it produces, thus acting as a carbon sink. Therefore, healthy forests hold the key to achieving net-zero goals until technology for capturing and storing direct carbon is developed.</p><p>However, the journey towards the ambitious net-zero target by 2070 is not smooth sailing. Over the last five years, from November 2018 to June 2023, a cumulative count of 1,116,330 forest fire events was detected across various forest ecosystems in India. These fires were sporadic and did not engulf large areas. What is concerning, however, is the noticeable increase in fire events when compared to those documented during 2003-2017, totaling 520,861. Given the substantial contribution of these fires to CO2 emissions, the central and state forest agencies should prioritize implementing the National Action Plan on Forest Fire.</p><p>While India is immune to devastating forest fires, the conversion of vast swathes of natural forest lands into monocultures-that is, just one tree species-like rubber, teak, and eucalyptus, particularly in the biodiverse northeast of India, is quite alarming. Also, the government aims to increase palm oil tree plantations on a number of remote islands in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelagos. Skewed afforestation practices since colonial time with nonnative species have badly impacted the \"wood wide web,\" the underground network of microbes that connect trees, triggering the potential soil carbon 'bomb'. According to a 2018 study, biodiverse forests can store twice the amount of carbon as forests with only one type of tree. This presents a real challenge to our net-zero efforts.</p><p>Therefore, experts overseeing afforestation projects should devise plantation strategies that involve a mix of native tree species. Allowing the natural regeneration of forests along with thoughtful plantations is an important option to address biodiversity and climate problems. Take, for example, the ambitious Great Nicobar Project, which involves the felling of a staggering 9,64,000 trees on the ecologically fragile islands. The government intends to mitigate the impact by planting an equivalent number of trees elsewhere. Here, the tremendous challenge is to strike a balance that does not restrict developmental activity, considering the fact that more than 80 percent of India's infrastructure in 2070 is yet to be built.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0063469540</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B3D-35W1-JB5M-W088-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Omega Printers &amp;

Shared values anchor our commitment, including respect for democracy and the rule of law,diversity and inclusion, environmental and social protection, labor rights, and human rights.</p><p>At the inaugural Americas Partnership Summit on November 3, 2023, our leadersstatedtheir intention to significantly strengthen our economic partnership through an enduring, high-level forum for deepening economic collaboration and integrationthat can take on the major global challenges of our time, from combatting the climate crisis to promoting greater social and economic opportunity. The leaders offered a roadmap to strengthen cooperation, integration, and innovation, asking foreign, trade, and finance ministers to focus on the following cross-cutting priorities:</p><p>* Strengthening regional competitiveness and integration</p><p>* Fostering shared prosperity and good governance</p><p>* Building sustainable infrastructure</p><p>* Protecting the climate and environment</p><p>* Promoting healthy communities</p><p>High-Impact Cooperation on Priority Issues for Our People</p><p>Today, we report important progress in advancing our objectives by promoting inclusive entrepreneurship, clean hydrogen, respect for the rule of law and transparency, sustainable food production, digital workforce development, and civilian space cooperation.</p><p>To expand entrepreneurship opportunities and provide entrepreneurs access to capital, Canada, the United States, and Uruguay are co-leading an effort to train an inclusive, diverse cohort of entrepreneurs. The USAIDCATALYZE Americas Partnership Accelerator has started training the first cohort of social impact entrepreneurs from four Americas Partnership countries.TheAccelerate Women Entrepreneurs Programwill soon begin training its first cohorts of women-led/owned small and medium sized enterprises from six countries. These accelerator programs are designed to support approximately 750 entrepreneurs in ten Americas Partnership countries over three years and steer some of those graduates toward anAngel Investor Network led by the Uruguay Innovation Hub in partnership with IDB Lab.</p><p>To expand access to opportunity in the digital economy, we plan to build upon the successful semiconductor workforce symposium held in January in Costa Rica with a second semiconductor symposium September 5-6 in Mexico to identify opportunities in the semiconductor supplier ecosystem. We plan to accelerate efforts to work together with Costa Rica's Center of Excellence to offer virtual regional courses in cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, and other related digital areas. Weseek to offer virtual digital skills and training region-wide to accelerator graduates and startups aspart of the Angel Investor Network platform, under a joint entrepreneurship and digital workforce umbrella.</p><p>To advance our shared clean energy and decarbonization goals, the Americas Partnership clean hydrogen working group was established to promote clean hydrogen and derivatives in our respective countries and realize our hemisphere's potential as a leading region for investment in clean hydrogen and derivatives. Co-led by Chile, Uruguay, and the United States, the working group aims to help all countries assess the viability of clean hydrogen and derivatives in meeting their national clean energy and climate goals and where viable, through commercial development of projects. The working group launched a series of technical workshops focused on developing national policy, regulatory, and investment frameworks to support production and use of clean hydrogen and derivatives in which all partners benefit from the collective experiences of Americas Partnership members governments, independent experts, and private companies investing in clean hydrogen and derivatives projects in Americas Partnership countries and globally. By fostering the development and adoption of national strategies and roadmaps, the Americas Partnership is accelerating the development of clean hydrogen markets, value, and supply chains across the region. To support this aim, the working group is building upon the successful technical workshops by pursuing additional capacity building activities.</p><p>To strengthen the rule of law, transparency, and anti-corruption efforts, we are exchanging best practices and sharing information, most recently in a workshop hosted by the Dominican Republic, which showcased different models for fostering a culture of transparency and ethics in critical government functions.Between now and the Americas Partnership Summit of 2025, all partners plan, with technical assistance from sources such as the UNODC anti-corruption hubs, to convene stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society, to adopt and maintain measures for improved procurement practices and greater transparency in the same, consistent with their obligations under the UN Convention against Corruption and domestic law.</p><p>To strengthen food security and sustainable food production, experts gathered for workshops in Ecuador and Peru. With support from the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), we defined a regional agenda on bioeconomy initiatives, smart agriculture, deforestation-free sustainable production, and food systems transformation. Going forward and with the assistance of IICA, we intend to create a digital platform on sustainable agriculture best practices, resources, and opportunities, to promote the technical development of value chains for a more sustainable agricultural industry. We also intend to work on digital tools for traceability like the use of georeferencing to promote deforestation-free production and in a new generation of public policies that strengthen the agricultural and food systems of the Americas, which is essential to improve economic opportunities in rural areas and food security.</p><p>We are also strengthening our cooperation on thepeacefulcivilian uses of spacethrough a working group co-led by the United States and Chile. That includes demonstrating how space-based assets and data can be used to improve forest fire and water management and exploring the impact of satellites on night sky astronomical observations.

According to news reporting from the Forest Research Institute by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Firebreaks are one of the protective measures used to safeguard forests in case of fire.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Forest Research Institute: \"Their purpose is to limit the possibility of fire spreading. This article describes how these protective measures are implemented along public roads in selected European countries. Based on the information gathered, it was found that there is a wide variety of approaches to firebreaks' construction, mostly due to different climatic and geomorphological conditions that influence the overall risk of forest fires. The forms of firebreaks used in Europe along public roads are either a mineralised belt (without vegetation) or a cleared belt of materials that are particularly susceptible to ignition and fire spread. Methods combining both are also used.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In Poland, there is a Type A belt, that is, a 30-m-wide belt at the border of a roadway or a facility that is free of dead trees, lying branches and felled or broken trees. In the absence of pan-European rules on preventive measures to protect forests from road fires, it might be helpful to establish a set of best practices that could assist in the revision of guidelines in individual countries.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Rules for the construction of firebreaks along public roads in selected European countries.

Scott Walker's signature legislation, which eliminated nearly all collective bargaining rights for most public employees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the full implications of Judge Jacob Frost's ruling remain unclear, here's what to know about the law and where it stands now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is Act 10?</p><p>Signed by Walker in 2011, Act 10 undid collective bargaining for most public employees, while providing exemptions for public safety employees like police officers and firefighters.</p><p>The law effectively ended collective bargaining for most public-sector unions by allowing them to bargain solely over base wage increases no greater than inflation. It also ended the automatic withdrawal of union dues, required annual recertification votes for unions, and forced public workers to pay more for health insurance and retirement benefits.</p><p>It was passed when Republicans held a trifecta in state government as a way to address a projected $3.6 billion budget deficit and delivered a windfall to taxpayers while also altering the relationship between government workers and their employers. The proposal sparked immense pushback, with as many as 100,000 people massing at the Capitol for a nearly monthlong protest and occupation leading up to the measure's passage.</p><p>At one point, 14 Senate Democrats even fled the state in an attempt to deny Republicans a quorum and block a vote on the legislation, prompting then-Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald to sign warrants ordering their detention and forcible return to Madison. The lawmakers returned of their own accord after Republicans found a procedural workaround and passed the legislation without them.</p><p>While \"general\" public employees such as teachers, administrative staff and sanitation workers saw their collective bargaining rights stripped away, employees classified as \"public safety\" workers like local police officers, state troopers and firefighters were permitted to continue collective bargaining.</p><p>Critics say the the law's definition of public safety workers is arbitrary, including some workers like motor vehicle inspectors in the safety realm, but not others, like conservation wardens, Capitol police and members of the UW-Madison Police Department.</p><p>A Wisconsin State Journal review of Act 10's impact found the law offered Wisconsinites cheaper government, lower taxes and a way out of the immediate budget crisis. The cost of those benefits was borne by public employees, and Act 10 exacerbated inequality among certain sectors of public workers.</p><p>So how did we get here?</p><p>Frost's ruling came in response to a lawsuit was filed late last year by the Abbotsford Education Association, Beaver Dam Education Association, SEIUWisconsin, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Locals 47 and 1215, Teaching Assistants' Association Local 3220 and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 695, as well AFSCME Local 1215 president Ben Gruber, Beaver Dam teacher Matthew Ziebarth and Racine Unified School District employee Wayne Rasmussen.</p><p>The plaintiffs argued that Act 10's exemption of some public safety workers from the bargaining restrictions violates the Wisconsin Constitution's equal protection clause by treating public workers with similar work duties differently.</p><p>Frost sided with the plaintiffs in his assessment, noting that just seven of the 22 \"protective occupations\" outlined in state statute that form the basis of what constitutes a \"public safety\" employee are exempted from the restrictions of Act 10.</p><p>Specifically, the law exempts the following public safety professions: members of the state patrol, state motor vehicle inspectors, police officers, firefighters, deputy sheriffs, county traffic police officers and combined village protective services officers.</p><p>Other protective service professions, however, are subject to the restrictions imposed by Act 10: conservation wardens, conservation patrol boat captains, conservation patrol boat engineers, conservation pilots, conservation patrol officers, forest fire control assistants, sheriffs, undersheriffs, state probation and parole officers, state forest rangers, fire watchers at Wisconsin veterans facilities, state correctional-psychiatric officers, excise tax investigators, special criminal investigation agents and assistant or deputy fire marshals.</p><p>The law's differential treatment between \"general\" and \"public safety\" employees and also within the public safety group violates the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection for all, Frost said.</p><p>Plaintiffs also noted in court filings that those exempted from collective bargaining restrictions endorsed Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial election, while those subject to the restrictions did not.</p><p>Hasn't the law been challenged before?</p><p>Yes. Attorneys for the Legislature and state Department of Justice argued for the case to be dismissed because previous legal challenges against Act 10 have failed. They've also said union officials waited too long to bring the latest legal challenge.</p><p>Assistant Attorney General Steven Kilpatrick, who is representing state agencies in the case, said in May the Legislature, when crafting Act 10, chose to exempt specific public safety employees because of the irreparable harm that would be caused if those employees chose to illegally strike.</p><p>Shortly after the law was passed, a Dane County judge barred its enforcement because of an alleged open meetings violation by a legislative committee, but the state Supreme Court overturned that action in June 2011.</p><p>In March 2012, a federal court struck down some parts of the law in a challenge by the Wisconsin Education Association Council, but it was later upheld in its entirety by a federal appeals court.</p><p>That same year, a Dane County judge struck down key parts of the law as it applied to school and municipal workers. The ruling was appealed, and in 2014 the then-conservative-leaning state Supreme Court upheld the law, ruling that public workers in Wisconsin do not have a constitutional right to bargain collectively.</p><p>In 2013, a Dane County judge dismissed a law enforcement union lawsuit that argued the law violated union members' rights to free speech and association.</p><p>What does the Walker recall have to do with this?</p><p>The passage of Act 10 created a political earthquake in Wisconsin. After the law was signed, opponents launched an ultimately unsuccessful recall election against Walker and Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch in 2012. Recall elections were also instituted against 13 Republican senators, three of which succeeded.</p><p>The former Government Accountability Board's posting of electronic versions of the Walker recall petitions spawned a cottage industry of online sleuths hunting for people in public office and the media who signed the petitions and thus might have a conflict of interest.</p><p>Frost, who Democratic Gov. Tony Evers appointed as a Dane County Circuit Court judge in 2020, appears to have signed the petition while he was a private practice attorney specializing in civil litigation and family law. Frost previously served as board president of Access to Independence, which provides services and advocacy to people with disabilities.</p><p>The Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct is silent on recall petitions, but state judges cannot take part in political party or candidate activities and should avoid \"the appearance of impropriety.\"</p><p>No parties in the case have filed a formal request seeking Frost's recusal.</p><p>But Republicans were quick to condemn the judge. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, called the ruling \"yet another example of courts legislating from the bench.\"</p><p>On the social media site X, Walker asked, \"Why elect a Governor and lawmakers if activist judges can impose their own will?!?\"</p><p>What happens next?</p><p>The immediate implications of Frost's ruling remain unclear, though it is almost certain to be appealed.</p><p>That means the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which last year shifted to a liberal majority for the first time in more than a decade, is likely to have the final say on the matter.</p><p>Justice Janet Protasiewicz, who joined the court in August, also signed the Walker recall petition and said while campaigning she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also said she would consider recusing herself from any legal challenges against the law.</p><p>Frost has given the plaintiffs 14 days to file a letter with the court indicating what sections of Act 10 should be severed and struck under his ruling, or file to take some other action. Defendants in the case have 14 days after that to respond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>STATE JOURNAL ARCHIVES Frost JOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL ARCHIVES Protesters gather inside the state Capitol during March 2011 demonstrations against Act 10.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WISTJL-24070575104262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WISTJL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CDH-0BJ1-DY37-5002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145460</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Madison Newspapers, Inc.

The area burning is far from the nearest homes, and no one had to be evacuated, although a nearby highway and railway line remained closed.</p><p>Authorities declared a 1,000-meter (more than half-mile) exclusion zone around the depot. Berlin's fire service said wildfires on the ground in the area around the storage site were largely extinguished by Friday morning. Cooler weather with at least a little rain brightened the outlook.</p><p>The ammunition dump itself, though, remained a problem. Experts approached it in armored vehicles to locate ammunition that might still pose a risk, fire service chief Karsten Homrighausen said.</p><p>They were evaluating whether crews need to cool down the stored supplies to prevent more detonations and if officials can scale back the exclusion zone. The German military said trying to drop water on the site from the air wasn't an option.</p><p>It remains unclear what triggered the first explosions at the ammunition dump. The site was created in Cold War-era West Berlin in 1950, and 25 metric tons or more of fireworks, World War II ammunition and other explosive ordnance was stored there before the fire started. Controlled blasts are carried out at the site twice a year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-ea49809d8bd2b15c07211f32fa342d5120220805</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6636-RHX1-JC5B-G269-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"264\"/><timeReceived>12:13 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 5, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fusion Power: The Sun's Energy on Earth</p><p>Fusion power, the process that powers the sun, has long been an elusive goal for scientists. However, recent breakthroughs at facilities like the National Ignition Facility have sparked new hope. Achieving net energy gain from fusion reactions opens up a realm of possibilities for a clean, almost limitless energy source. As global efforts like ITER and JET progress, the dream of a fusion-powered future inches closer to reality.</p><p>3. Solar Innovations: Beyond Rooftop Panels</p><p>Solar energy continues to be a frontrunner in the renewable market, but it's the novel applications that are catching eyes in 2024. Vehicles like the Aptera have been designed from the ground up to maximize solar energy efficiency, integrating solar panels into their very structure. Meanwhile, the concept of transparent solar panels is transforming windows into power generators, with companies like Solar Window leading the charge. Even forest fire detection is getting a solar boost, with technologies like Dryad Networks\u2018 \u2018electric noses' providing early alerts by detecting burning materials.</p><p>As we look forward to a year filled with promising advancements, these renewable energy technologies stand out not just for their innovation but for their potential to significantly impact our approach to sustainable living. Keep an eye on these developments as they move from prototypes to part of our everyday lives, steering us toward a cleaner, greener future.</p><p>There's Only One Green Planet by Tiny Rescue: Climate Collection</p><p>Related Content:\\xa0</p><p>Easy Ways to Help the Planet:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYNOGP-166606704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYNOGP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B07-DRN1-F11P-X44Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"417\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 OneGreenPlanet Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The area burning is far from the nearest homes, and no one had to be evacuated, although a nearby highway and railway line remained closed.</p><p>Authorities declared a 1,000-meter (more than half-mile) exclusion zone around the depot. Berlin's fire service said wildfires on the ground in the area around the storage site were largely extinguished by Friday morning. Cooler weather with at least a little rain brightened the outlook.</p><p>The ammunition dump itself, though, remained a problem. Experts approached it in armored vehicles to locate ammunition that might still pose a risk, fire service chief Karsten Homrighausen said.</p><p>They were evaluating whether crews need to cool down the stored supplies to prevent more detonations and if officials can scale back the exclusion zone. The German military said trying to drop water on the site from the air wasn't an option.</p><p>It remains unclear what triggered the first explosions at the ammunition dump. The site was created in Cold War-era West Berlin in 1950, and 25 metric tons or more of fireworks, World War II ammunition and other explosive ordnance was stored there before the fire started. Controlled blasts are carried out at the site twice a year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-ea49809d8bd2b15c07211f32fa342d5120220805</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6636-RHF1-DYMD-61BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"263\"/><timeReceived>12:13 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 5, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 A wind-whipped forest fire in the southern New Jersey Pinelands that threatened 16 homes Tuesday was fully contained by nightfall, and firefighters said they believed the homes were no longer in jeopardy.</p><p>No injuries or damage to property occurred from the fire, which burned 418 acres before being declared 100% contained about eight hours after it started.</p><p>Winds gusting between 30 and 40 mph fanned the flames. But the fire was burning in a remote, uninhabited section of the Stafford Forge Wildlife Management Area in Little Egg Harbor Township, just west of Exit 58 of the Garden State Parkway in southern Ocean County.</p><p>No one had to be evacuated, even as fire trucks and water tankers were positioned near the homes that firefighters considered potentially vulnerable to the blaze, said Greg McLaughlin, administrator of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>\u201cThe wind has been ripping all day. But it's been consistently in one direction, which helps,\u201d he said.</p><p>Also hampering the fire's spread were numerous marshy bogs within the wildlife area that are wet from spring rains, McLaughlin said.</p><p>The fire was spotted from an aerial observation tower in the Pinelands at 11:44 a.m.</p><p>State, county and local investigators were looking into how it might have started, but no cause was immediately apparent, McLaughlin said.</p><p>The fire service has been doing controlled burns in the Pinelands in recent weeks to consume dead leaves, twigs and other forest floor fuel that could accelerate a wildfire. There were no burns being done anywhere else in the state on Tuesday because of the high winds, officials said.</p><p>About 45 firefighters used 11 trucks, numerous water tankers, a bulldozer and a helicopter to fight the fire.</p><p>The fire was burning not far from the Air National Guard's Warren Grove target range, where a 2007 forest fire burned 17,000 acres.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC\">www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-c249c388b97826ff6d543260c1a77eef20230308</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67R1-JSF1-JC5B-G3KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"322\"/><timeReceived>2:03 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

(AP) \u2014 A wind-whipped forest fire in the southern New Jersey Pinelands threatened 16 homes Tuesday. But firefighters were optimistic they could keep the flames away from the houses.</p><p>No injuries or damage to property had occurred as of late Tuesday afternoon, when the blaze had burned 125 acres and was not contained at all.</p><p>Winds gusting between 30 and 40 mph were fanning the flames. But so far, the fire was burning in a remote, uninhabited section of the Stafford Forge Wildlife Management Area in Little Egg Harbor Township, just west of Exit 58 of the Garden State Parkway in southern Ocean County.</p><p>No one had to be evacuated in the initial hours of the blaze, even as fire trucks and water tankers were positioned near the homes that firefighters considered potentially vulnerable to the blaze, said Greg McLaughlin, administrator of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>\u201cThe wind has been ripping all day. But it's been consistently in one direction, which helps,\u201d he said.</p><p>Also hampering the fire's spread were numerous marshy bogs within the wildlife area that are wet from spring rains, McLaughlin said.</p><p>The fire was spotted from an aerial observation tower in the Pinelands at 11:44 a.m.</p><p>State, county and local investigators were looking into how it might have started, but no cause was immediately apparent, McLaughlin said.</p><p>The fire service has been doing controlled burns in the Pinelands in recent weeks to consume dead leaves, twigs and other forest floor fuel that could accelerate a wildfire. But there were no burns being done anywhere else in the state on Tuesday because of the high winds, officials said.</p><p>About 45 firefighters used 11 trucks, numerous water tankers, a bulldozer and a helicopter to fight the fire.</p><p>The fire was burning not far from the Air National Guard's Warren Grove target range, where a 2007 forest fire burned 17,000 acres.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twiter.com/WayneParryAC\">www.twiter.com/WayneParryAC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-c249c388b97826ff6d543260c1a77eef20230307</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67PX-T3D1-JC5B-G30K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><timeReceived>10:41 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;
