It's a road full of heartbreak and small victories and no guarantee of fame or success. I wanted to show that unvarnished life - minute by minute. I don't know how the story will end. Rob is still out on the road - chasing fame? A happy ending? You can't help but root for him to find it,\" said Producer Richard Parker.<br/><br/>The series is currently in post-production and is anticipated to be available around the New Year. Along with Richard Parker, the production's all-star team includes Executive Producers Charles Forbes and Elon Cook (Jersey Shore), Director David McAbee (Cupcake Wars), Director of Photography Gary Azzinaro, Editor Sean Patrick Dahlberg (Sesame Street) and Production Coordinator Chrissy Butcher (Keeping Up with the Kardashians).<br/><br/>When asked about the series, star and singer songwriter Robert Hunter said, \"Big dreams come at a big cost. Even if I lose, it's better than a lifetime of regret. That's what FAMELESS is about.\"<br/><br/>Fellow cast member Slayder Smet added, \"Being on the road with Rob and Becky for a year was like riding a bull through a forest fire - terrifying but kinda fun.\"<br/><br/>\"We are thrilled to launch FAMELESS as a SPACEMOB Original Series,\" said Eric Keith, Executive Producer and President of SPACEMOB studio, \"This show gives its audience the opportunity to see what real up-and-coming musical artists go through to make it. FAMELESS is loaded with adventure and is all heart. Richard Parker has done a tremendous job with his team highlighting this time in the lives of Robert Hunter and his wife Becky. This is one show people are not going to want to miss.\"<br/><br/>\"Rob and Becky Hunter put everything on the line when they decided to tell their story. This is almost a DIY series about a wife and husband, about an artist and his muse. It is compelling and fragile - an authentic reflection of a modern marriage. We are so fortunate to be partnering with SPACEMOB studio on this project,\" said Parker. \"Truly independent stories such as FAMELESS are exciting discoveries just waiting for an audience.\"</p><p>Contact Information:<br/><br/>Answer Media<br/><br/>Matt Brummett<br/><br/>816-629-6127<br/><br/>Contact via Email<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.answermedia.com\">www.answermedia.com</url></p><p>Read the full story here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pr.com/press-release/846757\">https://www.pr.com/press-release/846757</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRCM-0057159641</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRCM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63VH-TVG1-DXMP-K0X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389193</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 PR.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 15, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001085</classCode><className>MARRIAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001184</classCode><className>MUSIC INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009QWH</classCode><className>REALITY TELEVISION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS132</classCode><className>KANSAS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But they aren't as common in coastal areas, where several were reported last summer. <br/>Recent years \"is very unfavorable, with two consecutive years of drought (and) a persistent heat wave,\" deputy environment minister Sergio Federovisky said on Argentine public radio. <br/>According to the SNMF, about 330,000 hectares were destroyed by forest fires in 2021 compared to 1.1 million hectares in 2020. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

These airports also support essential air services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister of National Revenue, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Annie Koutrakis, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in Quebec.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, three airports in Quebec will receive over $3.4 million for safety-related projects and equipment that will help maintain safe airport operations for passengers, crews and airport workers. The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>La Grande Riviere Airport</p><p>* $476,000 to purchase a medium-sized snowblower and a runway surface friction tester</p><p>Mont-Joli Airport</p><p>* $451,000 to purchase a grader, a runway condition reporting system and a runway surface friction tester</p><p>St-Hubert Airport</p><p>* $2.5 million to rehabilitate the airport's field electrical centre and purchase a wet/dry combination material spreader</p><p>This funding is in addition to the more than $24.8 million announced under the program in May 2021 to support safety-related projects at the Gaspe, La Grande Riviere, Mont-Joli and St. Hubert airports.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country. Funded projects include runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife control fencing.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Local and regional airports play an integral role in Canada's transportation system and are important hubs for the communities they serve. This funding will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airport not only for personal and business travel, but also for community resupply of essential goods as well as access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres.\"</p><p>The Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue</p><p>As Canada works towards recovery, investments in our local and regional airports continue to be crucial to maintain safety, security, and connectivity for travellers, workers and communities. This funding will enhance safety for travellers, air crews and airport workers, while supporting jobs and our regional economy.\"</p><p>Annie Koutrakis, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport</p><p>\"The pandemic highlighted the important role Canada's local and regional airports play in our country's economy, and in sustaining the social and economic well-being of our communities. In addition to supporting personal travel, local and regional airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our commitment to build safer, healthier and stronger communities as Canada recovers from the pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* The Fall Economic Statement 2020 also announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airports System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* The eligible National Airports System airports are: Gander;

A wildfire that broke out yesterday near the Mediterranean coastal resort town of Manavgat, in Antalya province, had largely been contained, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli said. But another fire that started early today and swept through the district of Akseki, 30 miles north, kept firefighters engaged. </p><p>Three people were killed in the fires, and authorities evacuated nearly 20 neighborhoods or villages. Meanwhile, another forest fire broke out near the town of Armutalan, close to the resort of Marmaris, 200 miles west of Antalya, threatening a coastal residential area that includes hotels. The state-run Anadolu Agency said some people were being evacuated from the area as a precaution. Pakdemirli said a firefighting plane and five helicopters were involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control. The dead in the fires in Antalya included a 82-year-old man in Akseki's Kepezbeleni neighborhood, where 80% of the houses were incinerated, the district's governor, Volkan Hulur, told Anadolu. The Turkish government's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said in addition to the three dead, at least 112 people were affected by the fires, including 58 who were hospitalized, mostly for smoke inhalation. Authorities also rescued 10 people who were stranded at a restaurant by a dam near Akseki. AFAD said several homes, businesses, crops and vehicles were damaged in Manavgat but did not elaborate. \"At the moment, there is no immediate threat to any settlement or to life, but in the hours to come, if the wind changes direction, we will need to take additional precautions,\" Pakdemirli, the forest minister, told reporters in Manavgat. He said 10 intubated intensive care patients at Manavgat's state hospital were transferred to other hospitals as a precaution. The Antalya region is a popular vacation destination for tourists from Russia and other parts of Europe, but none of the holiday resorts was affected by the fires, officials said. Firefighters were also tackling wildfires in other parts of Turkey, including one that temporarily closed a highway between the southern Turkish cities of Mersin and Antalya, Anadolu reported.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017af261d57aaffaf37de18c0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63FY-32P1-JBSK-R2Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 29, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

More than 4,500 buildings remained threatened by the wildfire, which was burning toward thick, dry brush in the Angeles National Forest. Firefighters already battling the blaze in steep, rugged terrain in scorching heat faced more hurdles Saturday when hundreds of lightning strikes and winds up to 15 mph (24 kph) pushed the flames uphill. \"We set up a containment line at the top of the hills so the fire doesn't spill over to the other side and cause it to spread, but it was obviously difficult given the erratic wind and some other conditions,\" said fire spokesman Jake Miller. </p><p>The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of yesterday morning and has burned nearly 28 square miles (72 square kilometers) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 33 buildings had been destroyed, including at least a dozen homes. Temperatures were expected to hit the mid-90s to 100s, Miller said, a slight drop from Saturday when the mercury hit 111 degrees Fahrenheit (44 degrees Celsius) on Saturday at the firefighters' base camp. Thunderstorm and excessive heat were also a concern for firefighters battling a blaze that blackened almost 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in the foothills above the LA suburb of Azusa. The fire, believed to be started Thursday by a homeless man, is only 3% contained. Many areas of the state saw triple-digit temperatures through the weekend, and the combination of prolonged heat and smoke from wildfires sent ozone pollution to levels not seen in a decade in some areas. Air quality may reach unhealthy to very unhealthy levels in several regions of Southern California today, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said. In Northern California, a thunderstorm moving rapidly from the Pacific Ocean onshore brought thunder and more than 4,000 lightning strikes, some of which ignited small fires and knocked out power across the San Francisco Bay Area. Wind gusts reached 75 mph (121 kph), according to the National Weather Service. \"This is probably the most widespread and violent summer thunderstorm event in memory for Bay Area, &amp; it's also one of the hottest nights in years,\" tweeted Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. Unsettling weather triggered an unusual warning by the weather service of a fire-induced tornado at an out-of-control forest fire that broke out north of Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon. A massive fire cloud known as a pyrocumulonimbus formed over the fire, which started east of the town of Loyalton. When high winds came into contact with the fire and whipped it into the air, a spectacular tornado-shaped spiral of flames was formed. The fire has burned at least 31 square miles (80 square kilometers) and triggered evacuation orders for sparsely populated portions of Plumas, Lassen and Sierra counties, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Joe Flannery. Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters and air tankers faced \"extreme fire behavior,\" he said, and worked through the night to extinguish spot fires and protect threatened structures. At one point, the fast-moving fire jumped a highway and came dangerously close to a fire truck. A fire crew from Truckee tweeted a video of firefighters dragging hoses as they ran alongside a moving truck that was dodging the flames. -- Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V5-5GX1-F0YC-P008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Jim Jordan, R-Urbana, for reneging on statements the congressman made to The Lima News last summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sites held a press conference Tuesday morning from his Cable Road campaign headquarters where he blasted Jordan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At that time, Jordan said he would testify before the Jan. 6 investigation committee if he was called to do so. Jordan was called to do so Dec. 22, and Jordan rejected the committee's request Jan. 9 to the ire of many.</p><p>Sites called Jordan's actions cowardly and a violation of trust, saying his lies were piling up \"including fake lies about doctored text messages.\"</p><p>Sites then shifted his focus to when he enlisted in the Army, saying that unlike Jordan he kept the promises he made before shipping off. He encouraged Ohio's 4th District voters to hold the current occupant of its congressional seat to the same standard.</p><p>\"As a military policeman, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,\" Sites said.\"Jim Jordan took the same oath. Clearly, he has failed his oath and chosen party over country. I call on all the constituents of the Ohio 4th Congressional District to call or write Mr. Jordan, and demand he either testifies to the committee or resigns from Congress.\"</p><p>While talking about Jordan's claim of the committee sharing false text messages, Sites added, \"His text messages clearly state that the vice president could overturn the will of the people without evidence of voter fraud, just because the former president lost.\"</p><p>Sites also talked about what he would like to accomplish if he won the 4th District, laying out three key components to fix what he says has been magnified by the pandemic.</p><p>\"Bringing the supply chain back here will help create jobs here in the United States,\" Sites said. \"Creating healthcare for all, starting with the elderly, is so crucial. We have to take care of our own. And of course, climate chaos. We're into climate chaos, not climate change. We're past that now. And we see it all the time. I mean, Colorado just had a forest fire, in the middle of winter. If that doesn't speak to climate chaos, I don't know what does.\"</p><p>Helping Ohio's farmers was also on Sites' list of things he would like to accomplish, pointing out how \"climate chaos\" has made it difficult for them. While farmers aren't normally considered typical members of the Democratic Party, governing is about representing everyone, and he said many are the \"purple people in the middle\" who are somewhere between the far left and far right.</p><p>\"I think they want to know they are being heard,\" Sites stated. \"The Jim Jordan's and politicians like him is why we see this animosity and anger right now. They pit us against each other \u2014 it's the 'us against them' attitude in a two-party system like that. We lose everyone in the middle. So we just need to sit down and talk, and I think that's what America has gotten away from. Let's just talk.\"</p><p>Reach Joe Gilroy at 567-242-0398 or on Twitter @TLNJoeGilroy.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Lima News (Lima, Ohio) Visit The Lima News (Lima, Ohio) at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.limaohio.com\">www.limaohio.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCLNOH-20220112LMSitescallsJordanoutflipflop0112LM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">The Lima News (O KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64HH-2H71-DY8S-B0D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474156</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Lima News (Lima, Ohio)</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>The Lima News (Ohio)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 12, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009ZGJ</classCode><className>ELECTORAL DISTRICTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DSA9</classCode><className>ELECTION CRIME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N922120CC</classCode><className>LAW ENFORCEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp; VOTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLPQ</classCode><className>MILITARY SERVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000CTCO</classCode><className>ELECTION FRAUD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000980</classCode><className>JOB CREATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000A075</classCode><className>TEXT MESSAGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLPQ</classCode><className>MILITARY SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>PE000A20F</classCode><className>JIM JORDAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS151</classCode><className>OHIO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Gavin Newsom signs the legislation. The details of how the centers operate will be largely up to local officials.  <br/><br/>KEEP TABS ON THE LATEST CALIFORNIA POLICY AND POLITICS NEWS <br/> Processing Success! Thank you for subscribing. Please enter a valid email address  <br/><br/><br/>For years, the idea of establishing supervised drug injection sites has been a long-standing goal for some progressive California leaders looking to address the burgeoning overdose crisis. Efforts to launch such programs have come close, but never to the finish line. </p><p><br/>Now, as the latest legislation seeking to sanction these sites heads to the governor's desk, proponents are gearing up to make these injection sites a reality \u2014 and they hope a success \u2014 in the Golden State. <br/>Senate Bill 57[1] would authorize these overdose prevention pilot programs in Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles, which would operate through Jan. 1, 2028. <br/>While former Gov. Jerry Brown rejected similar legislation in 2018[2], supporters are hopeful Gov. Gavin Newsom will sign this one after he said he was open to the idea[3] during his campaign for governor. <br/><br/>'We have been engaging with the governor's office for the past four years on this measure. We haven't heard that he's not going to sign it, so we're hopeful that he'll stick to his word from 2018,' said Jeannette Zanipatin, California state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group that works to decriminalize drugs and a co-sponsor of the bill. <br/>Alex Stack, a spokesperson for the governor's office, said they don't comment on pending legislation. <br/>But if Newsom does sign it, what exactly would these sites look like? Who would be responsible for staffing them and how will they be funded? The details and logistics will be left to local officials. <br/>'They are asking us to help them address the escalations and crisis of overdose deaths that we're experiencing in California.' Sen. scott wiener, a san francisco democrat <br/>Because San Francisco has been considering this idea for almost a decade, it would likely be the first ready to launch a program in early 2023, Zanipatin said. Supervised injection sites could cost a couple of million dollars per year to run, and cities and counties that choose to establish these programs will have to find their own source of funding. <br/>Last year, New York City became the first to establish supervised injection sites in the U.S. Cities in other countries have operated such centers for years, including Vancouver[4], Mexicali[5] and Barcelona[6]. The Vancouver site is often referenced as a model \u2014 with about 1,700 individuals[7] using it each month, the center is credited with reducing overdose deaths[8] in its neighborhood and city. Switzerland was the first country[9] to open a supervised injection site in 1986. <br/>The goal of these programs, supporters say, is to provide drug users a safe, hygienic space where they can get clean needles and administer their own drugs under the supervision of trained staff. Staff members would monitor users and be ready to administer overdose reversal medications if needed, which could ultimately save lives. Medical groups in support of these programs have pointed out injection sites could also help reduce the risk of Hepatitis C and HIV infections[10] associated with intravenous drug use. <br/>Sen. Scott Wiener, author of the bill, said the jurisdictions that would pilot the programs asked to be included in the bill. 'They are asking us to help them address the escalations and crisis of overdose deaths that we're experiencing in California,' Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, said during an Aug. 1 legislative hearing. <br/> Learn more about legislators mentioned in this story  <br/><br/><br/> Scott Wiener  <br/> State Senate, District 11 (San Francisco) <br/> Expand for more about this legislator  <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://calmatters.org/legislator-tracker/scott-wiener-1970\">https://calmatters.org/legislator-tracker/scott-wiener-1970</url> State Senate, District 11 (San Francisco) <br/> Time in office <br/> 2016\u2014present <br/> Background <br/> Member, Board of Supervisors <br/><br/><br/><br/> How he voted 2019-2020 Liberal Conservative  <br/> District 11 Demographics Race/Ethnicity <br/> Latino 16% Multi-race 4%  <br/> Voter Registration <br/> No party 27%  <br/> Campaign Contributions  <br/> Sen. Scott Wiener has taken at least $859,000 from the Finance, Insurance &amp; Real Estate sector since he was elected to the legislature. That represents 13% of his total campaign contributions.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Those in opposition to Wiener's bill, including Republican legislators and law enforcement groups, argue these programs are a type of addiction maintenance that normalize illegal behavior. <br/>Before setting up their overdose prevention programs, the cities and counties must provide local health and law enforcement officials the opportunity to weigh in. Once set up, these centers must make referrals to substance use disorder treatment programs and other social services if the user wishes to access them. The bill would also protect people from criminal charges for using the sites. <br/>The overdose crisis has become one of the most pressing public health issues, with deaths and emergency room visits spiking in recent years, in large part due to the infiltration of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Overdose deaths from fentanyl jumped from 1,603 in 2019 to 3,946 in 2020, and then to 5,722 in 2021, according to the California Opioid Overdose Surveillance Dashboard[11]. <br/>California's second swing at this policy comes as the Biden administration is also embracing 'harm reduction' strategies[12] \u2014 which focus on keeping drug users alive and safe rather than punishing them. Needle exchange programs and programs that distribute the overdose reversal drug naloxone are some examples. <br/>Among those urging the governor to veto the bill is the Senate Republican Caucus. 'Fueling the drug epidemic with drug dens and needle supplies is like pouring gasoline on a forest fire. It merely worsens the problem,' the caucus wrote in an Aug. 1 letter to Newsom[13]. <br/>Law enforcement organizations[14] have stated their opposition to the bill, saying it sends the wrong message to the public and fails to address addiction at its root. <br/>Wiener and supporters of the bill say supervised injection sites will not solve the overdose crisis. Rather, the goal is to prevent deaths. <br/>Opponents have also raised concerns about the bill not providing a 'cognizable strategy for figuring out how to get the addict to the injection site,' John Lovell, a lobbyist with the California Narcotic Officers' Association, said during last week's hearing. 'What injection sites do is there is a magnet effect so that people come into the area,' but that doesn't mean they will actually go inside the facility, he said. <br/>Laura Thomas, director of HIV and harm reduction policy at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, another co-sponsor of the bill, said she doesn't think getting people into these centers will be a challenge. 'Overwhelmingly, people would prefer to use in a clean space. No one wants to be using drugs on the sidewalk. If we give people a better option they will use it,' she said.  <br/>An often-referenced survey of 602 injection drug users in San Francisco[15] showed that 85% would use a supervised injection site. About 75% of them said they would use it at least three days per week. <br/>'Fueling the drug epidemic with drug dens and needle supplies is like pouring gasoline on a forest fire.' Senate Republican Caucus <br/>The idea, according to supporters, is to build trust with people who come in, prompting them to spread the word and eventually link people to treatment when they are ready. These centers often look like a clinic, and people usually go through a brief interview when they first walk in. <br/>Thomas said that while it would be ideal for such centers to be open 24/7, realistically, hours of operation would be dependent on funding. That same San Francisco study showed that 62% of the drug users surveyed preferred a supervised injection site to be open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. <br/>Funding could prove to be a challenge in the long term. In New York City, where two safe injection sites opened last fall, the city and state do not pay for them. [16]The nonprofits running the programs seek private donations, making it difficult for the centers to extend their hours or expand into other neighborhoods. <br/>A supervised injection site in San Francisco is estimated to cost about $2.6 million a year,[7] according to RTI International, a nonprofit research institute. <br/>Thomas said California community organizations that already work in the field of substance use disorders would be best-equipped to run the programs, but funding should come from public health departments because they are a public benefit. <br/>Some of the cities and counties included in the bill have potential public funding streams. For example, Los Angeles County voters in 2020 passed Measure J[17], which allows the county to use at least 10% of its locally generated, unrestricted funding for community investment programs, which could include overdose prevention programs. <br/>'We're also hoping that these pilot projects serve as a catalyst and identify some private-public partnerships,' Zanipatin said. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://calmatters.org/health/2017/10/california-confronts-opioid-addiction-epidemic-despair/\">https://calmatters.org/health/2017/10/california-confronts-opioid-addiction-epidemic-despair/</url> Although the opioid crisis has not gripped California as it has some other states, rural areas have been hit especially hard.

Let\u2019s pause right here. We must awaken. While these actions are noble and may provide modest relief, we are ignoring the forest fire raging all around us.</p><p>The current narrative, commentary and even research on <url normalizedValue=\"https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/129180281\">burnout</url> is almost entirely focused on \u201cresilience\u201d and \u201cwell-being.\u201d The solutions being put in place inherently define the problem as residing within the individual person. In other words, the approach has largely been to fortify every healthcare worker with greater tolerance for stress. This is as appropriate as telling every worker in a nuclear power plant with a radiation leak to put on another layer of hooded coveralls and get back to work. Is the real problem that we are not resilient enough, or is it that we are drenched in a toxic environment every time we walk into the building? No matter how many well-earned bonuses, vacations, massages, or wellness apps are offered to employees, if they step into a damaging environment every day, nothing will meaningfully change. Their emotional, physical, mental and spiritual harm isn\u2019t going to go away by building more resilience.

People feel helpless, unable to make decisions, change their environment or make a difference. Healthcare workers don\u2019t feel heard, valued or authorized to act. Nor have they been provided the professional development to acquire foundational skills to navigate change, culture, conflict, teamwork or working in a crisis. Instead, they have been relegated to being task-masters with very narrow scope, shouldering productivity demands and bureaucratic burdens, competing for limited resources, and expected to be self-sacrificing, tireless, and perform flawlessly. My son works on the security team in a community hospital and tells me of daily episodes of verbal and physical assault not only involving patients and visitors against health workers, but also amongst health workers themselves. Sadly, this is commonplace within the US healthcare system. Even more tragic is the rate of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20180508/doctors-suicide-rate-highest-of-any-profession\">suicide</url> among physicians is the highest of any profession and double that of the general population.</p><p>The root cause of healthcare workers\u2019 suffering can best be described by the term <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-violence\">structural violence</url>, coined in the 1960\u2019s as a means of describing social structures or institutions that keep individuals from meeting basic needs or being severely marginalized. The exact same dynamic exists in healthcare \u2013 the environment (structure) in which people work results in harm (violence). It\u2019s no different than a nuclear reactor leak creating harm against the people working within the power plant. While we are eating more omega-3\u2019s and talking to our therapist \u2013 or doubling up on our radiation suits \u2013 our spotlight needs to shine brightly on the dysfunction of our workplace. And it must be remedied from the inside out. We will be old and gone long before any external agency will come along to fix it for us.</p><p>In the decades I spent as a physician executive, I have seen the disconnect between those in the executive suite (myself included) and those on the front lines. I see executives with a deep desire to empower the front line, but they struggle to follow through with concrete action. What stronger, more powerful expression of valuing the healthcare workforce than to declare that everyone here is a leader in their own right, and then to start treating them that way? Healthcare\u2019s most precious resource is its people. Yet, leadership training is usually exclusive to those with fancy titles and rank, leaving the vast majority behind. Our organizations should simultaneously equip top executives with skills to engage, include and empower the front line, while also training the entire workforce in how to build culture, how to manage change, how to resolve conflicts and how to build workplace respect and trust. By developing leadership capabilities in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">everyone</emphasis></emphasis>, organizations spread problem-solving capacity across the enterprise, build worker\u2019s trust in the institution by virtue of inclusion, and harness the creativity of the entire workforce. It will take all of this to repair our broken systems.</p><p>The workforce crisis is not a hopeless situation, but it takes bold action and big-picture thinking to alleviate these real pressures and unsustainable issues. Preparing caregivers with leadership capabilities is a tangible action that builds a trusting culture, demonstrates respect, promotes inclusion, and is our best bet to begin mitigating the violence our environment is causing us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Photo: PeopleImages, Getty Images</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDCIT-httpsmedcitynewscom202207thecurrentnarrativeonhealthcareburnoutisjustplainwrong</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDCIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6615-BSB1-JCMC-W0JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">481833</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><timeReceived>3:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Breaking Media, Inc.

Firefighters already battling the blaze in steep, rugged terrain in scorching heat faced more hurdles Saturday when hundreds of lightning strikes and winds up to 15 mph pushed the flames uphill.</p><p>\"We set up a containment line at the top of the hills so the fire doesn't spill over to the other side and cause it to spread, but it was obviously difficult given the erratic wind and some other conditions,\" said fire spokesman Jake Miller.</p><p>The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Sunday morning and has burned nearly 28 square miles of brush and trees. Fire officials said 33 buildings were destroyed, including at least 12 homes.</p><p>Temperatures reached more than 110 degrees and a pyrocumulus created erratic fire behavior, fire spokesman Tom Ewald said.</p><p>Thunderstorm and excessive heat were also a concern for firefighters battling a blaze that blackened almost 4 square miles in the foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. The fire, believed to be started Thursday by a homeless man, is only 3% contained.</p><p>Many areas of the state saw</p><p>triple-digit temperatures through the weekend and the combination of prolonged heat and smoke from wildfires sent ozone pollution to levels not seen in a decade in some areas. Air quality may reach unhealthy to very unhealthy levels in several regions of Southern California on Sunday and Monday afternoons, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said.</p><p>In Northern California, moisture from an offshore tropical storm fueled a thunderstorm that brought nonstop lightning strikes early Sunday, some of which ignited small fires and knocked out power across the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Wind gusts reached 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service, which said another round of lightning may early Monday.</p><p>\"This is probably the most widespread and violent summer thunderstorm event in memory for Bay Area, &amp; it's also one of the hottest nights in years,\" tweeted Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>Unsettling weather triggered an unusual warning by the weather service of a fire-induced tornado at an out-of-control forest fire that broke out north of Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>A massive fire cloud known as a pyrocumulonimbus formed over the fire, which started east of the town of Loyalton. When high winds came into contact with the fire and whipped it into the air, a spectacular tornado-shaped spiral of flames was formed.</p><p>The fire has burned at least 31 square miles and triggered evacuation orders for sparsely-populated communities along State Route 395 by the California-Nevada border, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Joe Flannery.</p><p>Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters and air tankers faced \"extreme fire behavior,\" he said, and worked through the night to extinguish spot fires.</p><p>Associated pressLightning forks over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as a storm passes over Oakland, Calif., on Sunday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-37475342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M4-60N1-DYFF-817T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Other sources such as Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder and director emeritus of the Potsdam Climate Institute set a much more stringent deadline of mere months.</p><p>Therefore, sustainability and the environment are the most important issue facing voters right now in choosing a candidate because it is the most important issue facing our planet.</p><p>It is natural, especially in a time in which many of us are experiencing great personal struggles, to find it difficult to envision and plan for the future. Especially when, in light of COVID-19, the future is so uncertain, so changed, that it feels painful to even imagine. While we cannot say for certain right now what the future will look like, what hardship and tragedy and sacrifice we will have to make to get there, it will come. When it does, we and our children and our grandchildren will need to live in it.</p><p>In order to live, we need a healthy planet.</p><p>\"Many of the global health challenges that we face today,</p><p>including infectious diseases, malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases are</p><p>all linked to the decline of biodiversity and ecosystems,\" Dr. Maria Neira, Director</p><p>of the Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health Department</p><p>of the World Health Organization in a commentary on the WHO website.</p><p>I know that planning for a sustainable future for our planet</p><p>and humanity requires some foresight. It also requires some sacrifice; giving up</p><p>certain fields of work in exchange for safer, more sustainable work. However, the</p><p>effects of why this change is necessary are right in front of us, right now.</p><p>From forest fire after forest fire to hurricane after hurricane, each more devastating than the last, it is easy to see that the imbalance we've created on the planet has taken a deadly toll, and we will keep paying this cost until something changes.</p><p>Change is not easy. It requires a lot of things. Mostly, it requires a keen empathy, for your fellow man and the planet and species which inhabit it alongside you that allow you to eat and breathe and thrive. Empathy for your children and their children and their children and the future you are passing down to them, like a gift or a curse through generations and generations of choices.</p><p>Your parents and their parents and their parents all made</p><p>choices that shaped the planet you live in now, the face of it, riddled with trash,</p><p>pocked with cavernous landfills, the water, undrinkable, the air, unbreathable,</p><p>the planet's resources, dwindling, like sand slipping through an hourglass.</p><p>It is true: time is running out.</p><p>However, there are still choices to be made which can help</p><p>save our planet starting with picking leaders who value the health of our</p><p>planet.</p><p>Right now, that choice is yours.</p><p>To find out different political candidates stances on sustainability and the environment visit Vote Climate U.S. PAC 2020 Climate Change Voter's Guide or The Sierra Club Election Center.</p><p>Early voting in Montgomery County is still going on this week Monday, Oct. 26- Friday, Oct. 29 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the County Election Commission on 350 Pageant Lane.</p><p>If you are unable to early or vote on election day, you may be eligible to vote by mail.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4798856</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:615S-09B1-DY7P-T09S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The All State: Austin Peay State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 28, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Clarksville</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>TN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Community trash pickup and opting out of plastic bags is no longer enough, they warned the board.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We don't have forever,\" Wright read. \"Not to act, not to live, not to slowly combat the climate crisis. We must have decisive, immediate action. We must declare a climate emergency.\"</p><p>Tracy-Hegg said she shouldn't have to worry about losing her house to a forest fire, her lake's biodiversity collapsing, the world falling apart around her.</p><p>\"I should live the life of a young person, not an adult,\" she told the commissioners. \"But I can't. Because our leaders are not acting to save this planet and my future. Now is your chance to change the narrative.\"</p><p>The resolution is an acknowledgment of climate concerns and a promise to find ways to do better. They asked that the government reduce its carbon footprint by way of building efficiency, conserving water and reducing emissions from its vehicles. Some of this is already in motion, Cook County administrator James Joerke said, as part of a capital improvement plan that's underway.</p><p>\"Our eyes are on the ball,\" he said, before encouraging the girls to consider public office when they are old enough. \"We are going to be taking action.\"</p><p>Wright traces her environmentalism to the Nordic Nature Group she started when she was 8 years old. It was a play group for kids who wanted to hunt for mushrooms, study birds or look at trees. Tracy-Hegg was a natural fit for the club.</p><p>The group's mission statement, she recalled, was redundant: \"to help nature in good ways and take care of the Earth.\" Her family moved from Maple Grove about six years ago, specifically looking for a life near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.</p><p>The girls' nature know-how grew - and so did their collective understanding of the bigger environmental picture.</p><p>\"We would go on hikes, camp out and have fun,\" Tracy-Hegg said. \"And then we were like, 'Our world is burning. What can we do about it?' \"</p><p>Jeanne Wright recalled Olya being overwhelmed by what she was learning.</p><p>She wanted to protect her daughter from the reality but said that would be a disservice. Eventually kids have to know the truth.</p><p>\"I talk with her a lot about how we can sit here and be upset, or we can take action,\" she said. \"Action can help us feel better.\"</p><p>Over the years, the girls have cleaned up trash, marched and created petitions. Tracy-Hegg has spent the day in a 3-foot-round Earth costume. They joined iMatter, a Twin Cities-based group for young people interested in climate and equity issues. They made a climate inheritance resolution and graded their town's greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The duo had immediate luck with the city of Grand Marais but didn't fare well in their first go-round with the county. In 2017 they were met with resistance. So Wright appreciates Tuesday's gesture.</p><p>\"They weren't able to think about creating a climate action plan or a resolution to say they cared about it,\" she said. \"The fact the county commissioners have said we're going to support it, I think it's a big step forward. There has never been a big formal statement.\"</p><p>Christa Lawler \u00b7 218-940-5840</p><p>@ChristaLawler</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN66697299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66WS-MXB1-JC8F-K118-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 27, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>YOUTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Business &amp;

Lead levels in Chico, the closest monitoring site to the Camp fire, were 50 times higher than normal for one 24-hour period during the fire.'You're not only now burning wood. You're burning heavy metals, and you're burning plastics and other things that wouldn't burn just in a forest fire,\" Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University, told the LA Times. The big picture: Researchers are also linking the potentially negative effects of wildfire smoke and COVID-19 with respiratory illnesses. A study published this month[3] found that wildfire smoke may greatly increase susceptibility to COVID-19. The immediate effects of wildfire smoke is also concerning to experts, who fear the smoke will drive high populations of unvaccinated people indoors and lead to a spike in community infections, Kaiser Health News[4] reports. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/Camp_Fire_report_July2021.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;#38;utm_source=govdelivery\">https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/Camp_Fire_report_July2021.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;#38;utm_source=govdelivery</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-22/studies-connect-wildfire-smoke-side-effects-covid-19-risk\">https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-22/studies-connect-wildfire-smoke-side-effects-covid-19-risk</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-021-00366-w\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-021-00366-w</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://khn.org/news/article/wildfire-smoke-drives-people-in-low-vaccinated-areas-indoors-raising-outbreak-fears/\">https://khn.org/news/article/wildfire-smoke-drives-people-in-low-vaccinated-areas-indoors-raising-outbreak-fears/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544162703234836925979100199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636M-CJ91-F03R-N4K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484226</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"377\"/><timeReceived>9:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 23, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009SVI</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES TIMES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

This is the case for most land regions, and has been confirmed by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have heated the planet by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.16 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. 'Every heatwave that we are experiencing today has been made hotter and more frequent because of climate change,' said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who also co-leads the World Weather Attribution research collaboration. A study in Nature journal this month found that heatwaves in Europe have increased three-to-four times faster than in other northern mid-latitudes such as the US. The authors linked this to changes in the jet stream - a fast west-to-east air current in the northern hemisphere.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Fingerprints of climate change <br/>To find out exactly how much climate change affected a specific heatwave, scientists conduct 'attribution studies'. Since 2004, more than 400 such studies have been done on extreme weather events, including heat, floods and drought. This involves simulating the modern climate hundreds of times and comparing it to simulations of a climate without human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. For example, scientists with World Weather Attribution determined that a record-breaking heatwave in Western Europe in June 2019 was 100 times more likely to occur now in France and the Netherlands than if humans had not changed the climate. <br/>Heatwaves to get worse <br/>'On average on land, heat extremes that would have happened once every 10 years without human influence on the climate are now three times more frequent,' said ETH Zurich climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne. Temperatures will only cease rising if humans stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Until then, heatwaves are set to worsen. A failure to tackle climate change[3] would see heat extremes escalate even more dangerously. Countries agreed under the global 2015 Paris Agreement to cut emissions fast enough to limit global warming to 2C (3.6F) and aim for 1.5C (2.7F), to avoid its most dangerous effects. Current policies would not cut emissions fast enough to meet either goal. A heatwave that occurred once per decade in the pre-industrial era would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5C of warming, and 5.6 times at 2C, the IPCC says. <br/>(Al Jazeera) Climate change drives wildfires <br/>Climate change increases hot and dry conditions that help fires spread faster, burn longer and rage more intensely. In the Mediterranean, that has contributed to the fire season[4] starting earlier and burning more land. Last year, more than half a million hectares burned in the European Union, making it the bloc's second-worst forest fire season on record after 2017. Hotter weather also saps moisture from vegetation, turning it into dry fuel that helps fires to spread. 'The hotter, drier conditions right now, it just makes far more dangerous,' Copernicus senior scientist Mark Parrington said. Hotter temperatures are also pushing wildfires into regions not used to them, and thus less prepared to cope. <br/>Climate change not the only factor <br/>Forest management and ignition sources are also important factors behind forest fires. In Europe, more than nine out of 10 fires are ignited by human activities, like arson, disposable barbecues or electricity lines. Countries like Spain face the challenge of shrinking populations in rural areas, as people move to cities, leaving smaller workforces to clear vegetation. Scientists say that without steep cuts to greenhouse gases, heatwaves, wildfires, flooding and drought will significantly worsen. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/record-heatwave-europe-uk-france-spain-wildfires\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/record-heatwave-europe-uk-france-spain-wildfires</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/28/climate-change-could-make-world-sicker-poorer-un-report\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/28/climate-change-could-make-world-sicker-poorer-un-report</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/11/5/climate-change-is-an-emergency-for-everyone-everywhere\">https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/11/5/climate-change-is-an-emergency-for-everyone-everywhere</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/21/wildfires-rage-in-europe-what-where-and-why\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/21/wildfires-rage-in-europe-what-where-and-why</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Alderson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stacy Alderson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. [Foreign Speech] Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CN's Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statements and additional legal information available at the beginning of the presentation. As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. and Canadian securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. They are more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements in our presentation. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a Q&amp;A session. I do want to remind you to please limit yourself to one question. As usual, the IR team will be available after the call for any follow-up questions. Joining us on the call today are Tracy Robinson, our President and CEO; Doug MacDonald, our Chief Marketing Officer; Ghislain Houle, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Harris, our Chief Operating Officer. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Tracy Robinson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>[Foreign Speech] I want to start today by saying a few words about the evolution of our operation structure. We were very pleased last week to announce the appointment of Derek Taylor to Executive Vice President and Chief Field Operating Officer; and Pat Whitehead to Executive Vice President and Chief Network Operating Officer. And you've all met both Pat and Derek. They are both accomplished and experienced operating officers, and they will both play prominent roles in CN's future and our success. Now, this isn't splitting Ed's roll into 2. We're making this bigger, and we'll be focusing on work that we haven't done before. Now, the structure we're creating will strengthen the competencies that are core to our future of driving profitable growth. It recognizes the equal importance and the distinct nature of competencies around building the plan and running the plan. Now, Derek and his field team will focus on continuing to improve the daily execution of our scheduled operating plan across our three operating regions and our intermodal terminal. They will drive on-time performance, along with continued improvement in dwell and in first-mile/last-mile delivery to our customers. Pat and his network team own the plan, and their focus will be on two things: continuing to refine the plan to optimize to our volumes and to improve velocity and to drive a more focused longer-term plan, including resourcing and the development and execution of the capital plan to both maintain our network on a lower cost per unit basis and expand it for growth where necessary in a more cost-effective manner.</p><p>Now, this structure splits the critical day-to-day focus of running the operation from the very specific work we need to do to ensure that we continually -- continue, rather, to operate well while we grow. I'm looking forward to working with Pat and Derek as we continue to refine this model and excited about the performance and the innovation that they will deliver in this next chapter. Now, they're both in the room with us today. They don't have speaking roles and they're not miked up, but they are here with us. It's Ed who, of course, will carry the operations dialogue on this call, and he is here and he is miked up and ready to go. You'll be hearing from him shortly. But before he gets to speak, let me just say how much, Ed, I have appreciated your willingness to step back in. I've appreciated your partnership in creating our path forward and your leadership in ensuring that we've got the right kind of winning conditions in place with our operations team for this transition. You've made a real difference, and I know that's exactly what you wanted to do. Now, before I hand it over to you, though, I have some comments on the business and on the quarter. Our railroad continues to run very well. It is the test of our operating plan that we can maintain our fluidity, our velocity and our customer service levels through different and challenging conditions. We've demonstrated that over these past few quarters. Now, through the forest fire season this spring and summer, which was the worst in Canada's history, the flood conditions in the East and West, and the West Coast port strikes, our operational performance remained strong and consistent, and we've demonstrated the ability to recover quickly. Our on-time train performance and our velocity have remained steady. Now, this is exactly what we're looking for. And our last-mile services improved.</p><p>We've been consistently over 90% for the last two quarters versus about 80% last year. This is the performance and the resiliency that we're looking for as the foundation of our growth plan moving forward. Now, on volumes, we have a tale of different market segments. You'll hear from Doug a little more on this. Our bulk business, so think grain, coal, potash, frac sand, has been strong all year. Our merchandise business is continuing to firm up. And for instance, we've seen an inflection in chemicals and plastics starting in August. In our consumer-related business, particularly the intermodal business, continues to be murky. Our domestic intermodal volumes are holding up relatively well, thanks to initiatives like the EMP [Phonetic] and the Falcon service. However, the international intermodal has been affected by two things: destocking over overall consumer consumption, which has impacted port volumes across the continent for everyone; and then the West Coast port strike. Now, coming out of the port strike, our Canadian destined volumes have returned. Our U.S. destined volumes moved to U.S. ports during the strike have not come back fully as yet. This is a temporary situation. We're confident in the value proposition that the Canadian ports offer in both service and cost, and we continue to work to get those volumes back to the Northern gateway. Now, I believe we've seen the bottom on volumes. We've started a controlled ramp-up of the operation to support growth. The growth plan we laid out earlier this year is continuing to progress. It's a mix of growth tied to economic strength and growth tied to specific customer initiatives.</p><p>Now, the volume growth tied to the economy will come as the economy lifts [Phonetic]. The benefits of our customer-specific initiatives are unfolding pretty much on plan. In both cases, we will see considerable margin leverage as volumes increase. I'm a big believer in the resiliency of the North American economy. This team has managed extremely well to the softer volumes, and what we can control continues to go very well, faster and better than plan, in fact. And we're ready as the volumes turn up. We've got a lot of confidence in this team, in this network and in this plan. Now, turning to our third quarter results, I'll keep it to just a few highlights. Our third quarter EPS was 21% lower than last year, and our operating ratio of 62% was higher than last year but remains at or near best in the industry. I am extremely proud that our customer service and operational efficiency have been top tier for six quarters now. The team will take you through the details in the quarter. I'll turn it over to them now, starting with Ed. Now, Ed, I said a few nice things earlier, but I need now to mention that this is your last quarterly call with CN. Thank you, and let's make it a good one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edmond Harris:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Tracy. Thanks for the kind words, I think. Before I jump into the quarter, I just want to take a minute to talk about these two guys, Derek and Pat. I've really gotten to know them over the past year, and they are among the finest operators I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Investors got to see a bit of their great chemistry and relationship back in May at Investor Day and how they work together. The entire network benefits from how well these guys operate every day. I can't tell you how confident I am in the future of the operation and the company with these two working as one, while expanding their responsibilities and pushing the team to be better every day. In fact, this quarter has been a great example of how well they work together because it was tough operating out there in quarter three. We started out by dealing with a 2-week port strike on the West Coast and then faced constant disruptions from forest fires and flooding until September. Running to a plan makes all the difference. For instance, we had a 2-day outage on our mainline east of Edmonton in the quarter. In the past, that would have taken us up to a week or more to get operations back in sync. This one took two days. The team really took it up a notch in September, though, with improvements in car velocity, train speed, through dwell, and origin and destination train performance. We told you how we decided not to furlough train crews earlier in the year.</p><p>Now, with grain coming on strong, we're seeing the benefit of that decision. All in all, we're set up well for a strong fourth quarter. I'm very proud of the whole operating team this quarter and especially the leadership provided by Pat and Derek. So how did the quarter shape up? Car velocity averaged 209 miles per day, which was down 1% compared to last year. Some of the other metrics we look at every day like train speed and train length were also down slightly. But when I think about the disruptions this quarter, I don't think we went a single week in July or August without a major network disruption. Stats that could tell you a lot about the quality of the people operating the network and the resiliency of running to a plan. And as well as the network ran this quarter, our yards were in even better shape. Our origin train departure improved to 89% in quarter three, which is right in the sweet spot that we targeted. This is one of the keys to delivering for our customers, and as Tracy has already covered our great local performance. Finally, on safety, we had six more reportable injuries and two more reportable FRA accidents than the third quarter of last year, which put some pressure on our quarterly metrics. But our year-to-date injury frequency ratio is still 11% better than 2022, our best-ever quarter three year-to-date performance. And our year-to-date accident ratio is also on track at 16% better than last year. Now, Tracy said it, this will be my last call as Chief Operating Officer. I'm going to hang around for the winter to give the team some support through the transition, but I officially hand over the reins to Derek and Pat on November 15. And like I said before, I have complete confidence in these guys and in this team. Tracy gave me two priorities when I came out of retirement last year, get this place running well again, coach and mentor the next generation of operating talent. As I head off to my fifth retirement, I'll sleep well at night knowing we knocked it out of the park on both counts. This place is running as well as I've ever seen it run, and the next generation is ready. And finally, on a personal note to the team around the table here today, it's been an honor and pleasure to come back to where I started and finish a career that I started over 50 years ago. It certainly has been my honor to be able to make that happen. Thank you. Now, it's Doug's turn to talk about top line performance and market outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ed, and all the best on your well-deserved retirement. Also, congratulations to Pat and Derek. I look forward to working even closer with you as we deliver for our customers together. We said it on the Q2 call that our commitment to our customers is to provide industry-leading service, and we continue to deliver on our promise. As for volumes, we believe the worst is behind us. They hit the bottom in July. We saw improvement in August and September. Through the rest of the year, we expect this trend to continue, and I'll give some more details in a moment. We continue to deliver core pricing ahead of CN inflation. The pricing environment remains robust, and our service levels are facilitating pricing conversations with our customers. We started the quarter in a bit of a hole with the port strike on the West Coast. This impacted international intermodal more than any other business segment. And as Tracy mentioned, we continue to see a hangover effect from cargo diversions to U.S. gateways. We ended the quarter with UAW strike starting at the Detroit Big three. Fortunately, this only had a limited impact on our volumes in Q3. Turning to Slide nine now, third quarter revenues were nearly $4 billion, down 12% versus last year on lower fuel surcharge rates, lower volumes, but partially offset by solid pricing. RTMs were down 5%, but excluding overseas, were up 1% for the quarter as we see a continuing recovery across the other business lines. For merchandise, metals and minerals, finished with the best quarter so far this year, supported by increased drilling programs in Western Canada driving strong sand shipments.</p><p>Demand for forest products remains below pre-COVID levels due to a challenging macro environment. Lower petroleum volumes in the quarter were mostly due to spot crude unit trains that we moved last year. We should lap that tougher comp in the fourth quarter. Plastics and chemicals sequentially strengthened in the quarter, which is a leading indicator of industrial production. Automotive continued to benefit from strong pent-up demand with limited strike impact. Turning to intermodal, I will remind you that storage revenues were normalized this year following last year's supply chain issues, which represents an impact of about $100 million in the quarter. In domestic intermodal, we saw the monthly year-over-year numbers turn positive in Q3, in part because of our Falcon service between Canada, Detroit and Mexico. International intermodal continues to be weak, but we were impacted -- and we're impacted by the West Coast port strike. We continue to see lighter U.S. discharge at Rupert and Vancouver, and we're working hard with our customers to get that volume back. Our bulk business has been outperforming since the start of the year. Starting with grain, we saw a strong weekly ramp-up in Canadian grain in September with the crops coming off the field about three weeks earlier than last year. Building on our strong service from the last crop year, grain is now rolling, and we expect strong volumes until at least next spring. We handled record potash volumes in the third quarter to export markets and the U.S. market.</p><p>The operating team is providing outstanding service to our customers for this incremental volume, but we are being careful not to oversell the network. Finally, the West Coast strike and subsequent terminal outage had a minor impact on met coal in the quarter, but commodity prices are still supportive of ongoing export volumes. Looking ahead to the balance of the year on Slide 10, we're seeing lots of momentum across almost all of our markets. With bulk leading the charge, Canadian grain is running full out. U.S. grain will also be strong, and similar to 2022, benefiting from record low water levels on the Mississippi and limited barge capacity, but tempered by demand in China. We expect solid potash demand in line with the Q3 run rate, and there could be additional upside with a robust export market. Canadian met coal should be strong for the rest of the year, and we have set an annual export record already with one of our largest customers. For overseas intermodal, we are seeing clear indicators of positive trends. Destocking appears to be nearing an end, but wholesale inventory to sales ratios remain elevated. We are forecasting a gradual improvement throughout 2024. On the domestic side, both retail and wholesale are tracking favorably over last year. As Tracey said, domestic is also helped by some growth initiatives. Rounding out with merchandise, we have a strong outlook for drilling with frac sand demand, aided by our network capacity enhancements in Northern BC. We expect automotive to outperform with continued pent-up demand contingent on how long the UAW strike goes on. And we expect a continued positive trend in chemicals, plastics and metals, and stable forest products. October is off to a good start and in line with how we have been modeling the quarter. Before I hand it over to Ghislain, I want to review on some of the unique growth initiatives we laid out at Investor Day. We announced our new long-term agreement with AltaGas yesterday, which will drive an increase in LPG export carloads through Prince Rupert and Ferndale, Washington. CN, along with our customers and supply chain partners, continue to invest and develop the Rupert gateway, which we highlighted at our May Investor Day.</p><p>On the Falcon product, we've been building up this service since its launch in May. It's now a solid and consistent product. In line with truck transits, we saw our first loads with STG Logistics a couple of weeks ago, and we continue to actively pursue opportunities to build density to and from Mexico as major RFPs come up for bid. CN's Eastern fuel strategy is progressing with the new distribution terminal in Toronto, ready to start receiving cars in December. In line with what we projected at Investor Day, we expect volumes to build over 2024. We continue to work with our customers on building up the electric vehicle supply chain. We now have five announced projects on our network in Eastern Canada. It's going to take a few years to fully develop this opportunity, but we're pleased to already see the first shipments of raw lithium moving on CN for export at Quebec City. Our Northern BC strategy is also progressing, as we finished the first capacity project in the area this month. This will allow CN to add additional frac sand and propane shipments to the network. To finish, I'm really excited about the next year and will have more to report on these opportunities in January. Over to you, Ghislain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>[Foreign Speech] But before I do that, I want to thank Ed for everything he has done this past year. I've known Ed a long time, and I'd like to wish him and his family a long, healthy retirement. And frankly, now I hope he stays in retirement. [Foreign Speech] to Derek and Pat on their appointments. Now, I will talk to Slide 12 of the presentation, which will provide more visibility on our third quarter performance. Volumes in terms of RTMs were lower by 5% on a year-over-year basis, including the impact of the external disruptions that Ed talked about earlier. We delivered operating income of around $1.5 billion, 21% lower than last year. Our operating ratio came in at 62%, up 480 basis points versus the operating ratio for the same period last year, but is only slightly higher year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. EPS for the quarter finished at $1.69, 21% lower than last year. The estimated impact of external disruptions on our network this quarter was unfavorable to EPS by $0.10 and dilutive to the OR by 130 basis points. In terms of expenses, labor was essentially flat versus last year, driven by 6% higher average headcount and general wage increases, offset by the U.S. wage accrual true-up related to new labor agreements in 2022 and lower incentive compensation this year. We have slowed and, in certain cases, stopped the pace of new hires through the quarter. Fuel expense was more than $175 million lower than in the same period last year, mostly due to a 20% decrease in price and a 6% lower workload in terms of GTMs. With rising fuel prices, we had an unfavorable fuel surcharge lag, which had a $0.10 impact on EPS in the quarter or $0.20 of EPS on a year-over-year basis. We generated close to $2.3 billion of free cash flow through the end of September.</p><p>We are investing in our railcar fleet and continue to invest steadily in track maintenance as well as capacity expansions with a view to capital efficiency, so we can be ready for the rebound. Moving to Slide 13, let me provide some visibility to the full year. Despite uncertainty in sectors related to consumer consumption, most other areas are demonstrating signs of strength. The bulk segment of our business continues to perform very well. We believe the worst is behind us, and you should expect operating leverage to improve as volumes come back. We are still calling for a gradual recovery in consumer-related freight demand in 2024. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of flat to slightly negative EPS growth in 2023 versus 2022. We assume that for the balance of the year, foreign exchange will be in the range of $0.70 to $0.75 and WTI in the range of USD80 to USD90 per barrel. However, full year assumptions continue to be $0.75 for foreign exchange and WTI at USD80 per barrel. We remain committed to shareholder distributions. We are confident in our long-term growth story and have increased the budget of our current share repurchase program, which runs through January 31, 2024, to approximately $4.5 billion, up from the previous budget of approximately $4 billion. Under this program, we have repurchased nearly 20 million shares for just over $3 billion through the end of September. In conclusion, let me reiterate a few points. The team is committed to the scheduled railroad model, which provides reliable service for our customers. Apart from international intermodal, we are seeing strength in many segments, and volumes continue to sequentially improve. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our full year 2023 guidance. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us financial flexibility, and we will allocate our capital in a manner that drives long-term value for our shareholders. Let me pass it back to Tracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ghis. Operator, I think we're ready to take some questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarrigle:</emphasis></p><p>James McGarragle This is James McGarragle. I'm on for Walter this morning. Thanks for taking my question. We've been tracking some TEU trends out of Prince Rupert, and some of the weakness that occurred as a result of the port strike in July looks to be extended into August and more recently, September. And I guess, my question relates to the extent this might be structural versus temporary. I know you addressed this in your opening comments, but can you speak more specifically to some of the service and cost benefits you have versus U.S. alternatives and the confidence you have in that volume coming back? And any update on your conversations with the shipping lines? And how quickly do you think we could see that come back?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Good afternoon, James. Yes, as we said earlier, we think this is a temporary issue. There are similar structural advantages to Rupert in particular, both, as you noted, economic and service. So we have set Principe up with a premium kind of container service into the U.S. markets, and that kind of strategy has been working. And as you noted, when the strike occurred, it's that business that started to move through the U.S. ports, but that structural advantage continues. And we're two days faster from China in Chicago than the other alternatives, and there are some economic advantages based partly on the currency, the Canadian currency and other that we think they stand even as we look into the future. So we think this business is going to come back. We're working with our customers on it. Our call is that it will come back gradually. We've lost a little confidence in the West Coast ports. It will come back gradually unless the volume really starts to pick up, and then it will come back more quickly. In the meantime, up at Rupert, we're continuing to lean into an increasing structural advantage. If you think about the import transload, it's now under construction. The port announced really have an export logistics park that's been approved and is going forward. So all of that, I think, is very supportive on the container side. And even outside of containers, Doug mentioned our AltaGas deal. We very much appreciate the business and the partnership with AltaGas. But that new agreement is going to drive considerable growth in that quarter. So we are actually -- if you think about the growth that we laid out for you at Investor Day on the Rupert corridor, we are ahead of that plan. So we're feeling pretty good about it and very strong about the structural advantage of Rupert.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarrigle:</emphasis></p><p>I appreciate it. And just a quick one on Bill C-47 and interswitching. I've seen some of the companies post about this on LinkedIn. But have you seen any customer uptick on interswitching? And any early commentary you can provide on the matter? And I'll turn it over. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. I would say that what we are focused on is driving the highest performance out of our supply chains in the country and in the continent. And we are prepared to continue to invest in capacity and that performance. The interswitching provisions and the concept of it is not at all supportive of supply chains that perform at high level. It slows cars down, slows service down, and it is not supportive of continued investment. And so, on that basis, we've objected to this. Having said that, we haven't seen a significant impact as of yet, but it's really good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Oglenski:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. And sorry if this is a little bit near-term focus, but Ghislain, can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces of your implied 4Q guide? Because I think it suggests that OR should improve sequentially. And obviously, you had some issues in the third quarter. But can you talk through the moving pieces here on how to get to the full year guide from where you are?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brandon. Well, I think as we said in our opening remarks, I think there's -- we see definitely improvement in volumes on a sequential basis. Just when you look at our volumes sequentially, in October versus September, were up 7%. So I think you can expect volumes to improve sequentially. And as volumes come in, I think that we are very comfortable that we will deliver some operating leverage. And maybe I'll pass it on to Tracy. Do you want to add anything, Tracey?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I think the other way to think about it, we are seeing the strength in volumes that Ghis is talking about. Our pricing is coming in exactly as the mandate that we gave Doug. And I am really pleased with the margins that this system is providing and this team is providing. I think we've had the best margins in the industry for the past, what, five, six quarters. And we've got -- we know that there's leverage there, particularly in the manifest business on the merchandise side as the volumes start to lift again. We're eager for that to happen, and it looks like it's starting to happen now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Oglenski:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the question, Brandon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cherilyn Radbourne:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to pick up on some of the new interchange relationships that you've negotiated with your rail peers. What do you think needs to happen to make these partnerships work better than they have in the past? And do you think that the willingness to cooperate will extend to include trickier situations where perhaps one of the key carriers has to accept a shorter length of haul?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, Cherilyn, thanks for that question. It is -- I think it is a change that we're seeing in the industry, right, for various reasons. And as we have our discussion, I would tell you that we are open for business and very eager to work with our partners and the other carriers to provide and design and provide the services that make sense for our customers. And the one that you've seen at least us step into most recently are really targeting getting truck traffic off the road. And things like the Falcon service, Doug is working as well on our new service with the NS, these are -- working with FXE in the case of Falcon and UP. We have a product in place now that's consistently delivering at very truck-like transits, and that's pretty remarkable. I think you're going to see more of this. And I would say that the nature of the dialogues that we've had so far with all of the carriers is that we'll conduct ourselves in a way as though we were a single carrier, right? And that may mean, in some cases, it's advantageous to one, and in other cases, advantageous to the other. But that's a principle that I think needs to underscore these relationships as we go forward. Doug, do you have anything to add to that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>The only thing I'll add, Cherilyn, is that it's all about service. So the quickest transit times to compete against truck is really what the operating teams between the railways are really focused on. And we don't really care how long the haul is, right? It's all about -- we need to get it there as fast as truck. All the teams are -- have been greatly focused on that. They've come up with some great products where we think we are truck competitive in all these corridors, and they're major truck lanes. So I assume that we're going to take our time. We're going to start to build this as we build momentum. It's going to take a while to pull trucks off the road, but we're pretty happy with the product so far, and we think we'll be successful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cherilyn Radbourne:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ravi Shanker:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Hi, everybody. Ed, congratulations and good luck with your retirement and congrats to the new incoming team as well. Maybe one kind of parting question for you. Kind of as you joined the team, was this transition kind of timing, what you had planned when you joined? Or is it something that you brought forward just given some of the traction that you've had with implementing the plan?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edmond Harris:</emphasis></p><p>When I came on board -- don't forget I consulted here for quite a few months before I came on board. And our evaluation of both Derek and Pat was almost immediate. Tracy and I were in agreement and in lockstep with what the future of this operating department was going to look like. And both of these individuals have stepped up to the plate. Quite frankly, they've been running the show for the last couple of months, just getting ready. And I'm extremely, extremely proud of what they've been able to do. And there's a testament to their promise. Our third quarter was tough, as I said in my speech. It was rough operating out there. And our metrics were only off a small percentage in car velocity, train speed cycles. We were doing everything right. And just to add on to what Doug just talked about between the carriers, just think of what this industry can do, if we take a day out of the cycle, all carriers do that, we get the traffic off trucks, and that's what it's about. So thanks for the nice comments. I appreciate it. I'll miss all of you, maybe. But it's been a lot of fun for me, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ravi Shanker:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thanks for that, Ed. And then, maybe as a follow-up, Tracey, can you share what the initial success has been like selling your Falcon service to your customers? Obviously, your peer has a bit of a speed advantage still. But kind of where are your customers sitting here in terms of their preference for speed versus value? Or kind of what are they looking for from that intermodal service?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Well, I would tell you that whether it's an intermodal service or any service, table stakes is the consistency of the service that we provide. In the case of going after the truck traffic like the Falcon service does, we know that means we also have to be fast. And I'm really impressed with the way the three organizations are working together to create a service and continually challenge it to where we can get time out. And you've seen that happen. And then to -- that's one thing, but to deliver it consistently every day is another thing completely. And we're doing that. And so as Doug said, this is a proof of concept, a model that we've got to prove to our customers, and it's going to grow over time. We expect it to start small, which it is, and it will grow over time. And Doug, I think we've said that we think this is a train a day both ways, ultimately. Is that...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>No, Trace, to answer it, that's the market share that we see out there, and it's going to take a while to get there, and we're going to make some progress. Like I said in my remarks, we are lucky enough to see STG join up on the service, and they started shipping their first loads a couple of weeks ago. It's our first real new, I'll say, third-party person that's come on, and that's great. We're looking forward to more.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ravi Shanker:</emphasis></p><p>Very helpful. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Group:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys and best of luck to you, Ed. So Ghislain, the $0.20 of headwinds in Q3 from fuel and external disruptions, should we just assume that those entirely go away, and that's basically the bridge to your full year guide? And then, as I think about next year, where you stand today, do you think the long-term guide of 10% to 15% earnings growth is achievable next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Thanks, Scott. I can answer the first part of your question, and then I'll turn it over to Tracy for the second part. So you're right. So when you look at the fuel surcharge headwind that we had in the quarter, it's $0.20 year-over-year. It's $0.10 this year. And if you remember, Scott, last year, we had a favorable fuel surcharge of $0.10. So year-over-year, it's $0.20. And then, there's another $0.10 of year-over-year disruptions that we quantified for you. So that's what we have to go through in the quarter. And despite all of this, we delivered a 62% OR, which we're quite proud and pleased about it. And then, I'll turn it over to you, Tracy, for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. As far as the guidance that we gave at Investor Day on the CAGR of 10% to 15% EPS, we are sticking to that. We see that, without a doubt, this railroad is running very well, continues to do so through all the shocks that it's gone through this year, a testament to the team. I'm impressed every day. We laid out a growth plan for you. Now, that was based on kind of this presumption of what Ghislain calls a supportive economy. We haven't seen that much this year, but we are starting to feel it come back. And that growth plan was a combination of two things. It was a piece of growth that is we're going to capitalize on as the economy -- coming from the strength of the economy. And then there's some very specific customer initiatives that we're working through. That list is growing that we're progressing without -- they're not tied to the strength of the economy. And those are coming on plan, or in some cases, Doug has bringing them in ahead of plan, as is the case for the Prince Rupert corridor. So we think that this plan stands. And the risk to it would be that underlying strength in the economy, but we're feeling pretty good about it as we sit here today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Group:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Scott Vernon:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, guys. Thanks. So, Tracy, I just want to push on that a little bit. Obviously, we're coming in a little bit weaker than we might have thought for 2023. As you think about that three-year envelope of 10% to 15%, with some of the growth initiatives starting to pay off, should we maybe be doing a little bit better than the lower end of the range? Or how should we be thinking about the contouring of that 10% to 15% over the three years? Is it more back-end loaded, middle loaded, front loaded?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>I think it is going to shift as far as in its timing. We're feeling pretty positive about the specific customer initiatives. What remains to be seen is exactly what the pace the -- the strength of the economy returning. So we'll give you a little bit more color on that in January, exactly what we're seeing. But right now, we're feeling good about our guidance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Scott Vernon:</emphasis></p><p>And then just on -- maybe just real quickly the capex side of that, there was a lot of concern, I think, when you had your Investor Day around the level of spend. Are you thinking about regulating that spend still in line with the volume anticipation?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Yes. We have these customer initiatives. If these customer initiatives, some of them fall off the table or some of them happen later, then obviously, we will regulate our capex accordingly. The capital envelope is a living thing. It's a dynamic thing. We look at it on a regular basis. So obviously, absolutely, we will look at our capex in light of those opportunities coming on board.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Scott Vernon:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Konark Gupta from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations to Ed, Patrick and Derek. Perhaps on international intermodal side, I want to figure out what's your visibility on timing for when the container traffic fully returns back to Canada from the U.S.? And then, as a follow-up on domestic intermodal, can you talk about the RFPs you're expecting in terms of size or nature for Falcon Premium? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, Konark. So on the international side, our customers are telling us they see a gradual ramp-up over the next year or so. So we're expecting that. That's what's in our forecast and our outlook moving forward. And that's the best visibility we have in the market. So we're depending upon them, and we think it's right. On the domestic side, outside of -- so, on the domestic Canadian side, things are going very well. We're actually seeing increases there year-over-year, which is fantastic. So, that market has come back -- coming back nicely. We see some green shoots there. On the Falcon, we're seeing RFPs on a regular basis. Now, customers have to be able to trust us and do it. So we're out there getting trials with them and things like that. It's going to take a while to build this off the road. At the same time, we know truck rates in the U.S. have been depressed over the last year, and we're competing against those as we move forward. We do have a great product, and we know we're going to win as time moves on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Fadi Chamoun from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fadi Chamoun:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Ed, Pat and Derek, congrats on the roles. And Ed, if this is truly your last retirement, all the best, and thanks for all the advice over the years. Maybe, Doug, on the fourth quarter, if you can give us -- what are you assuming for volume in the fourth quarter in terms of growth year-on-year or sequentially, just to kind of help us track your progress on that front? And my question on the cost per headcount, per employee, like how should we think about this sequentially into Q4? And I know you have some labor negotiations coming up here. And how do you think about kind of the best way for us to think about that cost per headcount in 2024?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Listen, Fadi, I'm going to take the first one, and I'll hand it off to Ghis for the second one. So, as we're looking at volumes kind of week over week and month over month, we're seeing that sequential strength. And right now, we're looking at sequential growth in all but kind of the international -- even in the international volumes sequentially, though we're seeing real strength coming from most, if not all of our business lines as you look at it sequentially over time. So we've mapped that out. Doug is pretty close to his customers and what they're planning over the course of this year. So it's on that basis that our confidence remains on our guidance. And if you look at industrial production as well, we've said that we were going to do better than industrial production. Industrial production is strengthening. And I think that -- Doug, what do you think you'll see us do that on everything, maybe except the international lines, would that be the case?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>No, I agree with that 100%, Tracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you. Ghis?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So Fadi, on the average comp per employee, when you look at it sequentially, it's up 2% in Q3 versus Q2, and that's mostly due to a 4% wage increase on our U.S. employees that started in July 2023. And for next year, again, I would continue to assume regular wage increases, and we're just replacing employees for attrition, and that's about it. So that's the answer to that question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fadi Chamoun:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>Great, good afternoon. Ed, I'll stick to it. Congrats on your last call and your attempt on the fifth retirement. And congrats to Derek and Pat, which is great, as Tracy said, they have no mic. So Tracy, you can really talk about them now. I guess, just a numbers question real quick and then a long-term one. The casualty costs, they ramped up in the quarter. I just want to understand, is that sticky? Or is that just because -- I think it was mentioned there were a couple of extra accidents in the quarter. But long term, my question would be just -- I know you've talked a little bit about the 10% to 15%. I know that's not linear. But how should we think about that as you start to rebound? And maybe give us upside downside? Is it just the volume? Because Doug sounds like you've got a lot of confidence that we passed the bottom. So, is that just moving past the storms and the U.S. grain crop bouncing up? Maybe talk about the upside, downside on that range for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, Ken, maybe the first -- your first question on the casualty cost, I'm looking at my notes here. C&amp;O, casualty and other is mostly flat on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So I'm not sure what number you're looking at.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>I just looked at -- it was just up sequentially, right? So I know it year-over-year. Is that seasonal in terms of the accidents at [Indecipherable]?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. On -- sequentially, it's -- again, it's just up about 6%, 7%, and it's really lower horsepower -- high horsepower income. This is tough to say for a French guy. So it's just mostly lower high horsepower income in Q3 versus Q2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Yes. If it's not a trend, that's fine. I just want to make sure...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>No, it's not.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>That was nothing that was sticky based on...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>We true-up on our horsepower every quarter. So you have some ups and downs depending on how we interchange our trains with other roads and so on and so forth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>And on the volume question, so you're right, we don't see this as being linear. And what we did put together was kind of -- last year was kind of a 10-year view on what our growth would look at. What we put in front of you guys in -- earlier this year was the three-year view on that. And so, a good chunk of that, as we've said, are a number of customer initiatives that Doug is working, and that's not a static list. It moves around a lot. And I'm excited about some of the new ones that are coming out of that list. What remains uncertain is the other part of it, which is the volume growth that's going to come with our customers and our partners on just the economic strength. And so, we're modeling in kind of what we've talked to you about. Next year, we'll give you a little bit kind of related to industrial production. We'll give you a little bit more color on that in January when we talk to you next. But I would say that, that would be the biggest risk for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>It is the volume side?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. On the economic, that volume, which is tied to economic strength as opposed to the specific customer initiatives that we're working. Thanks for your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Benoit Poirier from Desjardins. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benoit Poirier:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. [Foreign Speech] and happy retirement, Ed. And congrats to Pat and Derek for their new roles. If we move to Eastern ports, there's a labor agreement up for renewal with the dock workers at the Port of Montreal, and there's also the potential strikes with the St. Lawrence Seaway. So just wondering if you have seen any cargo diversions so far and kind of the actions that are taken so far to mitigate the potential impact of those labor agreements?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, Benoit. I'll take that. It's Doug. So, on the St. Lawrence, obviously, it's brand new. The products that move on the St. Laurence that really, I'll say, are complementary to the rail, really grain is the main one. So right now, there's enough elevation capacity in Thunder Bay for this week and probably most of next week. And if the strike lasts post that, then we have offered a train package to our customers to be able to move product into the East from Western Canada. So it would be -- we'll start to look at some business there. You also have the iron ore that tends to move export via Quebec City from the Minnesota area. So we may -- there may be some opportunities there as well, but most of that should just move to the dock like normal. So I don't see a lot of changes for us overall as this moves forward. When you look at the Port of Montreal, we have prepared for that. We've put a package together to actually move a lot of our customers' freight over the Port of Halifax. We're only in the process now of going out to the market with that so that they know what's available, and we're just starting that planning now. But we do have the operational plan already in place.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benoit Poirier:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And just a follow-up on Contrecoeur. We've seen a great announcement over the last few weeks. What would be the next milestone to monitor, Doug?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>So Contrecoeur, the next one will be really, I think, you will see a new RFP for a port operator, that will be the next big milestone for what they're telling us. They're going to start work on the dock as it is today or the waterfront as they call it. So that's where that money is going, Benoit. So they're going to start there without a port operator being named. And then, the port operator will be the next big milestone. So we're looking forward to that as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benoit Poirier:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much for the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Wetherbee:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, I wanted to ask about headcount and resources maybe in general. As you think about kind of reaccelerating the growth and this line of sight that you have to volume growth as we move forward into 2024, where do you think you are in resources? I guess, maybe asked another way, do you think that there's a certain amount of volume growth that you can absorb with the headcount and sort of the overall resource base that you have today? Or do you think you'll need to be adding incrementally as we move forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for that question, Chris. So let's think about it this way. We are resourced right now to move the volume that we have, but the resourcing decisions that we make are based on six or nine months from now. So we're planning now for what we need out there. And as we think about it, think about the bulk business, that business is moving now. As that -- if and as that grows, that's new incremental train starts, we'll need kind of the resources for them. If you think about the merchandise business, however, that has some quite significant room. If we think about -- even in this quarter, our volumes were down, for example, 5%. Our train starts are down 2%. So in running the scheduled operation, we're maintaining the integrity and the discipline of that schedule, which means that our trains are running a little short. So the first lift in volumes, particularly in merchandise, is going to go on to the end of those existing trains. And there's a tremendous amount of leverage there. And of course, that's done with the existing crew base. On the international side, as that starts to ramp up, that also will be incremental kind of train starts. So we're doing this planning now for next year, and we've got some hard to hire locations that we're still working on. But other than that, I think we're in great shape.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Wetherbee:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And 4Q should be roughly flattish or slightly higher than where we are from a heads perspective?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>I think that's pretty much baked right now. So yes, it should be about what we are now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Wetherbee:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for your time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the question, Chris.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Steve Hansen from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, thank you for the time. I'll stick to one question as instructed. It seems like everyone on this call doesn't understand what that means. But in any case, a question for Doug or Tracy. Grain has been one of your biggest tailwinds year-to-date piggybacking off last year's harvest. At this juncture, I think it's fairly well known that this year's harvest was anything but superior. I understand you've got a couple of weeks of tailwinds from an early harvest, but I'm surprised your comments on the outlook were more balanced or cautious. You suggest that it was quite bullish. And I'm just trying to square the two given the harvest backdrop. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So listen, the grain crop this year wasn't a bad crop, I can tell you, but it was smaller without a doubt last year, our lines in the North, and the drought was a little bit -- we didn't have the same kind of drought conditions. And we're moving a lot of grain right now. What it does mean, as Doug has said in the past, is that it can -- we can run out of grain to move a little bit earlier in the year next year, and that may be an issue in Q2, I guess, Doug. But we've got -- on the offsetting, we've got a number of customer initiatives that are going to -- that are starting to produce volume now that we think is going to be -- give us a -- it's going to be a good offset to that. Doug, anything else?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>No, you covered the Canadian grain really well. And on the U.S. grain, we're seeing some strong volumes right now because of the Mississippi being so low. But a lot of that's going to be tempered by overall demand with China and other countries. So we're moving good volumes right now. The team is doing a great job at that. We're really sold out in the U.S. market. We're going to see how the rest of the year plays out here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>Appreciate your time</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the one question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Justin Trennon Long:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could comment on your expectation for the sequential progression of yields on a cents per RTM basis as we move into the fourth quarter? And maybe along with that, give a little bit more color on the core pricing trends you're seeing. I heard you say that they remain above inflation. But I'm curious if pricing is getting better, worse or about the same on a year-over-year basis. Yes. Let me start with that one, and then I'll hand it over to Ghis. But I would say that pricing can be difficult to see based on the revenue line. So the revenue line includes a bit of noise around storage fees that were higher last year than this year. There's some fuel surcharge noise in there. There's the currency noise in there, and there's -- so there's a -- it's hard to see the pricing through it. But I can tell you this, we've given Doug a mandate on the backs of the service that the guys have been able to provide for our customers to come in above our inflation level. And he is consistently doing that on the contract renewals, and we have mechanisms in the multiyear contracts that are providing that for us as well. So the underlying pricing is doing well. And Ghis, I don't remember the first question, but...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>You covered it. When you look at either cents per RTM or revenue per RTM, as we've always told you guys not to look at this as a proxy for yield because it's a lot of moving parts. There's FX in there. There's the auxiliary [Phonetic] charges that you talked about, Tracy. There's also the fuel surcharge. So -- and I know that you're looking -- you're trying to find metrics for yield, but this has got a lot of noise, but we're very confident. And Doug made the point that our pricing is above our rail inflation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you for the question. And I think one more question, and then we're out of time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Certainly. The last question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Chiang:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for squeezing me in here. Congrats Ed, Patrick and Derek. Maybe just turning to automotive, when I think back to your Investor Day, you laid out a number of opportunities related to the EV supply chain. It does feel like that we might be slowing down here in terms of EV adoption. At least that's we're hearing from the OEMs. Just wondering any changes to your long-term potential growth opportunity there, the volume capture opportunity, just given what some of the OEMs are doing as they adjust production around their EV portfolio?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Kevin. So, it's a great question. So EV, it starts really back at the battery, so all the minerals that go into it. So we've started moving some of the raw lithium. Listen, on our network, we're now up to -- well, it was five, but it's just got to six plants located on our network, really all in Eastern Canada, for construction, either of the batteries themselves or for some of the parts that go into the batteries or for the refining of the raw lithium and other metals. So we're starting to build that supply chain up. And we knew it wasn't going to be right away. These plants take a while to get built. In the interim, we're still seeing the EV production schedules moving forward at most of the Big three. Now, we know GM just came and pushed theirs back by about a year, but that's okay, right? There's still lots of other products that move in the automotive side, and that will give us time to actually have all these plants constructed in Eastern Canada, where we can actually haul those batteries down and the other parts, too. So it's moving along quite well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Chiang:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. Great color. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. It's just -- go ahead, operator.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Tracy Robinson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. I jumped the gun a little there. Listen, I just want to echo, Ed, the comments on the call today. Thank you for what you've done here and for ending the long, very impressive run with us. It's a privilege and it's been a lot of fun working with you and watching you. And they're not miked up, but let me say this about the guys at the end of the table here, Derek and Pat, very much looking forward to working with you. But the truth is, as we all know, this plan was implemented a number of months ago. And so, you have this place running really, really well. We're excited about where we're headed. This is all about executing our plan and the plan we laid out at Investor Day. The pieces are all in place. The core engine is performing well. And we're ready and really eager for that rebound. So, thanks for joining us today, and we'll talk to you all early in the year. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-094428e30614589198444580a0441501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB8-WVJ3-RSHD-T46F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 AlphaStreet Inc.

My name is Julianne, and I will be your operator today. Welcome to CN's Third Quarter 2023 Financial and Operating Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Stacy Alderson, Assistant Vice President, Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Alderson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stacy Alderson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. [Foreign Speech] Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CN's Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statements and additional legal information available at the beginning of the presentation. As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. and Canadian securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. They are more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements in our presentation. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a Q&amp;A session. I do want to remind you to please limit yourself to one question. As usual, the IR team will be available after the call for any follow-up questions. Joining us on the call today are Tracy Robinson, our President and CEO; Doug MacDonald, our Chief Marketing Officer; Ghislain Houle, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Harris, our Chief Operating Officer. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Tracy Robinson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>[Foreign Speech] I want to start today by saying a few words about the evolution of our operation structure. We were very pleased last week to announce the appointment of Derek Taylor to Executive Vice President and Chief Field Operating Officer; and Pat Whitehead to Executive Vice President and Chief Network Operating Officer. And you've all met both Pat and Derek. They are both accomplished and experienced operating officers, and they will both play prominent roles in CN's future and our success. Now, this isn't splitting Ed's roll into 2. We're making this bigger, and we'll be focusing on work that we haven't done before. Now, the structure we're creating will strengthen the competencies that are core to our future of driving profitable growth. It recognizes the equal importance and the distinct nature of competencies around building the plan and running the plan. Now, Derek and his field team will focus on continuing to improve the daily execution of our scheduled operating plan across our three operating regions and our intermodal terminal. They will drive on-time performance, along with continued improvement in dwell and in first-mile/last-mile delivery to our customers. Pat and his network team own the plan, and their focus will be on two things: continuing to refine the plan to optimize to our volumes and to improve velocity and to drive a more focused longer-term plan, including resourcing and the development and execution of the capital plan to both maintain our network on a lower cost per unit basis and expand it for growth where necessary in a more cost-effective manner.</p><p>Now, this structure splits the critical day-to-day focus of running the operation from the very specific work we need to do to ensure that we continually -- continue, rather, to operate well while we grow. I'm looking forward to working with Pat and Derek as we continue to refine this model and excited about the performance and the innovation that they will deliver in this next chapter. Now, they're both in the room with us today. They don't have speaking roles and they're not miked up, but they are here with us. It's Ed who, of course, will carry the operations dialogue on this call, and he is here and he is miked up and ready to go. You'll be hearing from him shortly. But before he gets to speak, let me just say how much, Ed, I have appreciated your willingness to step back in. I've appreciated your partnership in creating our path forward and your leadership in ensuring that we've got the right kind of winning conditions in place with our operations team for this transition. You've made a real difference, and I know that's exactly what you wanted to do. Now, before I hand it over to you, though, I have some comments on the business and on the quarter. Our railroad continues to run very well. It is the test of our operating plan that we can maintain our fluidity, our velocity and our customer service levels through different and challenging conditions. We've demonstrated that over these past few quarters. Now, through the forest fire season this spring and summer, which was the worst in Canada's history, the flood conditions in the East and West, and the West Coast port strikes, our operational performance remained strong and consistent, and we've demonstrated the ability to recover quickly. Our on-time train performance and our velocity have remained steady. Now, this is exactly what we're looking for. And our last-mile services improved.</p><p>We've been consistently over 90% for the last two quarters versus about 80% last year. This is the performance and the resiliency that we're looking for as the foundation of our growth plan moving forward. Now, on volumes, we have a tale of different market segments. You'll hear from Doug a little more on this. Our bulk business, so think grain, coal, potash, frac sand, has been strong all year. Our merchandise business is continuing to firm up. And for instance, we've seen an inflection in chemicals and plastics starting in August. In our consumer-related business, particularly the intermodal business, continues to be murky. Our domestic intermodal volumes are holding up relatively well, thanks to initiatives like the EMP [Phonetic] and the Falcon service. However, the international intermodal has been affected by two things: destocking over overall consumer consumption, which has impacted port volumes across the continent for everyone; and then the West Coast port strike. Now, coming out of the port strike, our Canadian destined volumes have returned. Our U.S. destined volumes moved to U.S. ports during the strike have not come back fully as yet. This is a temporary situation. We're confident in the value proposition that the Canadian ports offer in both service and cost, and we continue to work to get those volumes back to the Northern gateway. Now, I believe we've seen the bottom on volumes. We've started a controlled ramp-up of the operation to support growth. The growth plan we laid out earlier this year is continuing to progress. It's a mix of growth tied to economic strength and growth tied to specific customer initiatives.</p><p>Now, the volume growth tied to the economy will come as the economy lifts [Phonetic]. The benefits of our customer-specific initiatives are unfolding pretty much on plan. In both cases, we will see considerable margin leverage as volumes increase. I'm a big believer in the resiliency of the North American economy. This team has managed extremely well to the softer volumes, and what we can control continues to go very well, faster and better than plan, in fact. And we're ready as the volumes turn up. We've got a lot of confidence in this team, in this network and in this plan. Now, turning to our third quarter results, I'll keep it to just a few highlights. Our third quarter EPS was 21% lower than last year, and our operating ratio of 62% was higher than last year but remains at or near best in the industry. I am extremely proud that our customer service and operational efficiency have been top tier for six quarters now. The team will take you through the details in the quarter. I'll turn it over to them now, starting with Ed. Now, Ed, I said a few nice things earlier, but I need now to mention that this is your last quarterly call with CN. Thank you, and let's make it a good one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edmond Harris:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Tracy. Thanks for the kind words, I think. Before I jump into the quarter, I just want to take a minute to talk about these two guys, Derek and Pat. I've really gotten to know them over the past year, and they are among the finest operators I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Investors got to see a bit of their great chemistry and relationship back in May at Investor Day and how they work together. The entire network benefits from how well these guys operate every day. I can't tell you how confident I am in the future of the operation and the company with these two working as one, while expanding their responsibilities and pushing the team to be better every day. In fact, this quarter has been a great example of how well they work together because it was tough operating out there in quarter three. We started out by dealing with a 2-week port strike on the West Coast and then faced constant disruptions from forest fires and flooding until September. Running to a plan makes all the difference. For instance, we had a 2-day outage on our mainline east of Edmonton in the quarter. In the past, that would have taken us up to a week or more to get operations back in sync. This one took two days. The team really took it up a notch in September, though, with improvements in car velocity, train speed, through dwell, and origin and destination train performance. We told you how we decided not to furlough train crews earlier in the year.</p><p>Now, with grain coming on strong, we're seeing the benefit of that decision. All in all, we're set up well for a strong fourth quarter. I'm very proud of the whole operating team this quarter and especially the leadership provided by Pat and Derek. So how did the quarter shape up? Car velocity averaged 209 miles per day, which was down 1% compared to last year. Some of the other metrics we look at every day like train speed and train length were also down slightly. But when I think about the disruptions this quarter, I don't think we went a single week in July or August without a major network disruption. Stats that could tell you a lot about the quality of the people operating the network and the resiliency of running to a plan. And as well as the network ran this quarter, our yards were in even better shape. Our origin train departure improved to 89% in quarter three, which is right in the sweet spot that we targeted. This is one of the keys to delivering for our customers, and as Tracy has already covered our great local performance. Finally, on safety, we had six more reportable injuries and two more reportable FRA accidents than the third quarter of last year, which put some pressure on our quarterly metrics. But our year-to-date injury frequency ratio is still 11% better than 2022, our best-ever quarter three year-to-date performance. And our year-to-date accident ratio is also on track at 16% better than last year. Now, Tracy said it, this will be my last call as Chief Operating Officer. I'm going to hang around for the winter to give the team some support through the transition, but I officially hand over the reins to Derek and Pat on November 15. And like I said before, I have complete confidence in these guys and in this team. Tracy gave me two priorities when I came out of retirement last year, get this place running well again, coach and mentor the next generation of operating talent. As I head off to my fifth retirement, I'll sleep well at night knowing we knocked it out of the park on both counts. This place is running as well as I've ever seen it run, and the next generation is ready. And finally, on a personal note to the team around the table here today, it's been an honor and pleasure to come back to where I started and finish a career that I started over 50 years ago. It certainly has been my honor to be able to make that happen. Thank you. Now, it's Doug's turn to talk about top line performance and market outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ed, and all the best on your well-deserved retirement. Also, congratulations to Pat and Derek. I look forward to working even closer with you as we deliver for our customers together. We said it on the Q2 call that our commitment to our customers is to provide industry-leading service, and we continue to deliver on our promise. As for volumes, we believe the worst is behind us. They hit the bottom in July. We saw improvement in August and September. Through the rest of the year, we expect this trend to continue, and I'll give some more details in a moment. We continue to deliver core pricing ahead of CN inflation. The pricing environment remains robust, and our service levels are facilitating pricing conversations with our customers. We started the quarter in a bit of a hole with the port strike on the West Coast. This impacted international intermodal more than any other business segment. And as Tracy mentioned, we continue to see a hangover effect from cargo diversions to U.S. gateways. We ended the quarter with UAW strike starting at the Detroit Big three. Fortunately, this only had a limited impact on our volumes in Q3. Turning to Slide nine now, third quarter revenues were nearly $4 billion, down 12% versus last year on lower fuel surcharge rates, lower volumes, but partially offset by solid pricing. RTMs were down 5%, but excluding overseas, were up 1% for the quarter as we see a continuing recovery across the other business lines. For merchandise, metals and minerals, finished with the best quarter so far this year, supported by increased drilling programs in Western Canada driving strong sand shipments.</p><p>Demand for forest products remains below pre-COVID levels due to a challenging macro environment. Lower petroleum volumes in the quarter were mostly due to spot crude unit trains that we moved last year. We should lap that tougher comp in the fourth quarter. Plastics and chemicals sequentially strengthened in the quarter, which is a leading indicator of industrial production. Automotive continued to benefit from strong pent-up demand with limited strike impact. Turning to intermodal, I will remind you that storage revenues were normalized this year following last year's supply chain issues, which represents an impact of about $100 million in the quarter. In domestic intermodal, we saw the monthly year-over-year numbers turn positive in Q3, in part because of our Falcon service between Canada, Detroit and Mexico. International intermodal continues to be weak, but we were impacted -- and we're impacted by the West Coast port strike. We continue to see lighter U.S. discharge at Rupert and Vancouver, and we're working hard with our customers to get that volume back. Our bulk business has been outperforming since the start of the year. Starting with grain, we saw a strong weekly ramp-up in Canadian grain in September with the crops coming off the field about three weeks earlier than last year. Building on our strong service from the last crop year, grain is now rolling, and we expect strong volumes until at least next spring. We handled record potash volumes in the third quarter to export markets and the U.S. market.</p><p>The operating team is providing outstanding service to our customers for this incremental volume, but we are being careful not to oversell the network. Finally, the West Coast strike and subsequent terminal outage had a minor impact on met coal in the quarter, but commodity prices are still supportive of ongoing export volumes. Looking ahead to the balance of the year on Slide 10, we're seeing lots of momentum across almost all of our markets. With bulk leading the charge, Canadian grain is running full out. U.S. grain will also be strong, and similar to 2022, benefiting from record low water levels on the Mississippi and limited barge capacity, but tempered by demand in China. We expect solid potash demand in line with the Q3 run rate, and there could be additional upside with a robust export market. Canadian met coal should be strong for the rest of the year, and we have set an annual export record already with one of our largest customers. For overseas intermodal, we are seeing clear indicators of positive trends. Destocking appears to be nearing an end, but wholesale inventory to sales ratios remain elevated. We are forecasting a gradual improvement throughout 2024. On the domestic side, both retail and wholesale are tracking favorably over last year. As Tracey said, domestic is also helped by some growth initiatives. Rounding out with merchandise, we have a strong outlook for drilling with frac sand demand, aided by our network capacity enhancements in Northern BC. We expect automotive to outperform with continued pent-up demand contingent on how long the UAW strike goes on. And we expect a continued positive trend in chemicals, plastics and metals, and stable forest products. October is off to a good start and in line with how we have been modeling the quarter. Before I hand it over to Ghislain, I want to review on some of the unique growth initiatives we laid out at Investor Day. We announced our new long-term agreement with AltaGas yesterday, which will drive an increase in LPG export carloads through Prince Rupert and Ferndale, Washington. CN, along with our customers and supply chain partners, continue to invest and develop the Rupert gateway, which we highlighted at our May Investor Day.</p><p>On the Falcon product, we've been building up this service since its launch in May. It's now a solid and consistent product. In line with truck transits, we saw our first loads with STG Logistics a couple of weeks ago, and we continue to actively pursue opportunities to build density to and from Mexico as major RFPs come up for bid. CN's Eastern fuel strategy is progressing with the new distribution terminal in Toronto, ready to start receiving cars in December. In line with what we projected at Investor Day, we expect volumes to build over 2024. We continue to work with our customers on building up the electric vehicle supply chain. We now have five announced projects on our network in Eastern Canada. It's going to take a few years to fully develop this opportunity, but we're pleased to already see the first shipments of raw lithium moving on CN for export at Quebec City. Our Northern BC strategy is also progressing, as we finished the first capacity project in the area this month. This will allow CN to add additional frac sand and propane shipments to the network. To finish, I'm really excited about the next year and will have more to report on these opportunities in January. Over to you, Ghislain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>[Foreign Speech] But before I do that, I want to thank Ed for everything he has done this past year. I've known Ed a long time, and I'd like to wish him and his family a long, healthy retirement. And frankly, now I hope he stays in retirement. [Foreign Speech] to Derek and Pat on their appointments. Now, I will talk to Slide 12 of the presentation, which will provide more visibility on our third quarter performance. Volumes in terms of RTMs were lower by 5% on a year-over-year basis, including the impact of the external disruptions that Ed talked about earlier. We delivered operating income of around $1.5 billion, 21% lower than last year. Our operating ratio came in at 62%, up 480 basis points versus the operating ratio for the same period last year, but is only slightly higher year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. EPS for the quarter finished at $1.69, 21% lower than last year. The estimated impact of external disruptions on our network this quarter was unfavorable to EPS by $0.10 and dilutive to the OR by 130 basis points. In terms of expenses, labor was essentially flat versus last year, driven by 6% higher average headcount and general wage increases, offset by the U.S. wage accrual true-up related to new labor agreements in 2022 and lower incentive compensation this year. We have slowed and, in certain cases, stopped the pace of new hires through the quarter. Fuel expense was more than $175 million lower than in the same period last year, mostly due to a 20% decrease in price and a 6% lower workload in terms of GTMs. With rising fuel prices, we had an unfavorable fuel surcharge lag, which had a $0.10 impact on EPS in the quarter or $0.20 of EPS on a year-over-year basis. We generated close to $2.3 billion of free cash flow through the end of September.</p><p>We are investing in our railcar fleet and continue to invest steadily in track maintenance as well as capacity expansions with a view to capital efficiency, so we can be ready for the rebound. Moving to Slide 13, let me provide some visibility to the full year. Despite uncertainty in sectors related to consumer consumption, most other areas are demonstrating signs of strength. The bulk segment of our business continues to perform very well. We believe the worst is behind us, and you should expect operating leverage to improve as volumes come back. We are still calling for a gradual recovery in consumer-related freight demand in 2024. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of flat to slightly negative EPS growth in 2023 versus 2022. We assume that for the balance of the year, foreign exchange will be in the range of $0.70 to $0.75 and WTI in the range of USD80 to USD90 per barrel. However, full year assumptions continue to be $0.75 for foreign exchange and WTI at USD80 per barrel. We remain committed to shareholder distributions. We are confident in our long-term growth story and have increased the budget of our current share repurchase program, which runs through January 31, 2024, to approximately $4.5 billion, up from the previous budget of approximately $4 billion. Under this program, we have repurchased nearly 20 million shares for just over $3 billion through the end of September. In conclusion, let me reiterate a few points. The team is committed to the scheduled railroad model, which provides reliable service for our customers. Apart from international intermodal, we are seeing strength in many segments, and volumes continue to sequentially improve. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our full year 2023 guidance. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us financial flexibility, and we will allocate our capital in a manner that drives long-term value for our shareholders. Let me pass it back to Tracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ghis. Operator, I think we're ready to take some questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarrigle:</emphasis></p><p>James McGarragle This is James McGarragle. I'm on for Walter this morning. Thanks for taking my question. We've been tracking some TEU trends out of Prince Rupert, and some of the weakness that occurred as a result of the port strike in July looks to be extended into August and more recently, September. And I guess, my question relates to the extent this might be structural versus temporary. I know you addressed this in your opening comments, but can you speak more specifically to some of the service and cost benefits you have versus U.S. alternatives and the confidence you have in that volume coming back? And any update on your conversations with the shipping lines? And how quickly do you think we could see that come back?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Good afternoon, James. Yes, as we said earlier, we think this is a temporary issue. There are similar structural advantages to Rupert in particular, both, as you noted, economic and service. So we have set Principe up with a premium kind of container service into the U.S. markets, and that kind of strategy has been working. And as you noted, when the strike occurred, it's that business that started to move through the U.S. ports, but that structural advantage continues. And we're two days faster from China in Chicago than the other alternatives, and there are some economic advantages based partly on the currency, the Canadian currency and other that we think they stand even as we look into the future. So we think this business is going to come back. We're working with our customers on it. Our call is that it will come back gradually. We've lost a little confidence in the West Coast ports. It will come back gradually unless the volume really starts to pick up, and then it will come back more quickly. In the meantime, up at Rupert, we're continuing to lean into an increasing structural advantage. If you think about the import transload, it's now under construction. The port announced really have an export logistics park that's been approved and is going forward. So all of that, I think, is very supportive on the container side. And even outside of containers, Doug mentioned our AltaGas deal. We very much appreciate the business and the partnership with AltaGas. But that new agreement is going to drive considerable growth in that quarter. So we are actually -- if you think about the growth that we laid out for you at Investor Day on the Rupert corridor, we are ahead of that plan. So we're feeling pretty good about it and very strong about the structural advantage of Rupert.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarrigle:</emphasis></p><p>I appreciate it. And just a quick one on Bill C-47 and interswitching. I've seen some of the companies post about this on LinkedIn. But have you seen any customer uptick on interswitching? And any early commentary you can provide on the matter? And I'll turn it over. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. I would say that what we are focused on is driving the highest performance out of our supply chains in the country and in the continent. And we are prepared to continue to invest in capacity and that performance. The interswitching provisions and the concept of it is not at all supportive of supply chains that perform at high level. It slows cars down, slows service down, and it is not supportive of continued investment. And so, on that basis, we've objected to this. Having said that, we haven't seen a significant impact as of yet, but it's really good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Oglenski:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. And sorry if this is a little bit near-term focus, but Ghislain, can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces of your implied 4Q guide? Because I think it suggests that OR should improve sequentially. And obviously, you had some issues in the third quarter. But can you talk through the moving pieces here on how to get to the full year guide from where you are?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brandon. Well, I think as we said in our opening remarks, I think there's -- we see definitely improvement in volumes on a sequential basis. Just when you look at our volumes sequentially, in October versus September, were up 7%. So I think you can expect volumes to improve sequentially. And as volumes come in, I think that we are very comfortable that we will deliver some operating leverage. And maybe I'll pass it on to Tracy. Do you want to add anything, Tracey?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I think the other way to think about it, we are seeing the strength in volumes that Ghis is talking about. Our pricing is coming in exactly as the mandate that we gave Doug. And I am really pleased with the margins that this system is providing and this team is providing. I think we've had the best margins in the industry for the past, what, five, six quarters. And we've got -- we know that there's leverage there, particularly in the manifest business on the merchandise side as the volumes start to lift again. We're eager for that to happen, and it looks like it's starting to happen now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Oglenski:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the question, Brandon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cherilyn Radbourne:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to pick up on some of the new interchange relationships that you've negotiated with your rail peers. What do you think needs to happen to make these partnerships work better than they have in the past? And do you think that the willingness to cooperate will extend to include trickier situations where perhaps one of the key carriers has to accept a shorter length of haul?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, Cherilyn, thanks for that question. It is -- I think it is a change that we're seeing in the industry, right, for various reasons. And as we have our discussion, I would tell you that we are open for business and very eager to work with our partners and the other carriers to provide and design and provide the services that make sense for our customers. And the one that you've seen at least us step into most recently are really targeting getting truck traffic off the road. And things like the Falcon service, Doug is working as well on our new service with the NS, these are -- working with FXE in the case of Falcon and UP. We have a product in place now that's consistently delivering at very truck-like transits, and that's pretty remarkable. I think you're going to see more of this. And I would say that the nature of the dialogues that we've had so far with all of the carriers is that we'll conduct ourselves in a way as though we were a single carrier, right? And that may mean, in some cases, it's advantageous to one, and in other cases, advantageous to the other. But that's a principle that I think needs to underscore these relationships as we go forward. Doug, do you have anything to add to that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>The only thing I'll add, Cherilyn, is that it's all about service. So the quickest transit times to compete against truck is really what the operating teams between the railways are really focused on. And we don't really care how long the haul is, right? It's all about -- we need to get it there as fast as truck. All the teams are -- have been greatly focused on that. They've come up with some great products where we think we are truck competitive in all these corridors, and they're major truck lanes. So I assume that we're going to take our time. We're going to start to build this as we build momentum. It's going to take a while to pull trucks off the road, but we're pretty happy with the product so far, and we think we'll be successful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cherilyn Radbourne:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ravi Shanker:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Hi, everybody. Ed, congratulations and good luck with your retirement and congrats to the new incoming team as well. Maybe one kind of parting question for you. Kind of as you joined the team, was this transition kind of timing, what you had planned when you joined? Or is it something that you brought forward just given some of the traction that you've had with implementing the plan?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edmond Harris:</emphasis></p><p>When I came on board -- don't forget I consulted here for quite a few months before I came on board. And our evaluation of both Derek and Pat was almost immediate. Tracy and I were in agreement and in lockstep with what the future of this operating department was going to look like. And both of these individuals have stepped up to the plate. Quite frankly, they've been running the show for the last couple of months, just getting ready. And I'm extremely, extremely proud of what they've been able to do. And there's a testament to their promise. Our third quarter was tough, as I said in my speech. It was rough operating out there. And our metrics were only off a small percentage in car velocity, train speed cycles. We were doing everything right. And just to add on to what Doug just talked about between the carriers, just think of what this industry can do, if we take a day out of the cycle, all carriers do that, we get the traffic off trucks, and that's what it's about. So thanks for the nice comments. I appreciate it. I'll miss all of you, maybe. But it's been a lot of fun for me, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ravi Shanker:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thanks for that, Ed. And then, maybe as a follow-up, Tracey, can you share what the initial success has been like selling your Falcon service to your customers? Obviously, your peer has a bit of a speed advantage still. But kind of where are your customers sitting here in terms of their preference for speed versus value? Or kind of what are they looking for from that intermodal service?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Well, I would tell you that whether it's an intermodal service or any service, table stakes is the consistency of the service that we provide. In the case of going after the truck traffic like the Falcon service does, we know that means we also have to be fast. And I'm really impressed with the way the three organizations are working together to create a service and continually challenge it to where we can get time out. And you've seen that happen. And then to -- that's one thing, but to deliver it consistently every day is another thing completely. And we're doing that. And so as Doug said, this is a proof of concept, a model that we've got to prove to our customers, and it's going to grow over time. We expect it to start small, which it is, and it will grow over time. And Doug, I think we've said that we think this is a train a day both ways, ultimately. Is that...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>No, Trace, to answer it, that's the market share that we see out there, and it's going to take a while to get there, and we're going to make some progress. Like I said in my remarks, we are lucky enough to see STG join up on the service, and they started shipping their first loads a couple of weeks ago. It's our first real new, I'll say, third-party person that's come on, and that's great. We're looking forward to more.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ravi Shanker:</emphasis></p><p>Very helpful. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Group:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys and best of luck to you, Ed. So Ghislain, the $0.20 of headwinds in Q3 from fuel and external disruptions, should we just assume that those entirely go away, and that's basically the bridge to your full year guide? And then, as I think about next year, where you stand today, do you think the long-term guide of 10% to 15% earnings growth is achievable next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Thanks, Scott. I can answer the first part of your question, and then I'll turn it over to Tracy for the second part. So you're right. So when you look at the fuel surcharge headwind that we had in the quarter, it's $0.20 year-over-year. It's $0.10 this year. And if you remember, Scott, last year, we had a favorable fuel surcharge of $0.10. So year-over-year, it's $0.20. And then, there's another $0.10 of year-over-year disruptions that we quantified for you. So that's what we have to go through in the quarter. And despite all of this, we delivered a 62% OR, which we're quite proud and pleased about it. And then, I'll turn it over to you, Tracy, for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. As far as the guidance that we gave at Investor Day on the CAGR of 10% to 15% EPS, we are sticking to that. We see that, without a doubt, this railroad is running very well, continues to do so through all the shocks that it's gone through this year, a testament to the team. I'm impressed every day. We laid out a growth plan for you. Now, that was based on kind of this presumption of what Ghislain calls a supportive economy. We haven't seen that much this year, but we are starting to feel it come back. And that growth plan was a combination of two things. It was a piece of growth that is we're going to capitalize on as the economy -- coming from the strength of the economy. And then there's some very specific customer initiatives that we're working through. That list is growing that we're progressing without -- they're not tied to the strength of the economy. And those are coming on plan, or in some cases, Doug has bringing them in ahead of plan, as is the case for the Prince Rupert corridor. So we think that this plan stands. And the risk to it would be that underlying strength in the economy, but we're feeling pretty good about it as we sit here today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Group:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Scott Vernon:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, guys. Thanks. So, Tracy, I just want to push on that a little bit. Obviously, we're coming in a little bit weaker than we might have thought for 2023. As you think about that three-year envelope of 10% to 15%, with some of the growth initiatives starting to pay off, should we maybe be doing a little bit better than the lower end of the range? Or how should we be thinking about the contouring of that 10% to 15% over the three years? Is it more back-end loaded, middle loaded, front loaded?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>I think it is going to shift as far as in its timing. We're feeling pretty positive about the specific customer initiatives. What remains to be seen is exactly what the pace the -- the strength of the economy returning. So we'll give you a little bit more color on that in January, exactly what we're seeing. But right now, we're feeling good about our guidance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Scott Vernon:</emphasis></p><p>And then just on -- maybe just real quickly the capex side of that, there was a lot of concern, I think, when you had your Investor Day around the level of spend. Are you thinking about regulating that spend still in line with the volume anticipation?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Yes. We have these customer initiatives. If these customer initiatives, some of them fall off the table or some of them happen later, then obviously, we will regulate our capex accordingly. The capital envelope is a living thing. It's a dynamic thing. We look at it on a regular basis. So obviously, absolutely, we will look at our capex in light of those opportunities coming on board.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Scott Vernon:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Konark Gupta from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations to Ed, Patrick and Derek. Perhaps on international intermodal side, I want to figure out what's your visibility on timing for when the container traffic fully returns back to Canada from the U.S.? And then, as a follow-up on domestic intermodal, can you talk about the RFPs you're expecting in terms of size or nature for Falcon Premium? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, Konark. So on the international side, our customers are telling us they see a gradual ramp-up over the next year or so. So we're expecting that. That's what's in our forecast and our outlook moving forward. And that's the best visibility we have in the market. So we're depending upon them, and we think it's right. On the domestic side, outside of -- so, on the domestic Canadian side, things are going very well. We're actually seeing increases there year-over-year, which is fantastic. So, that market has come back -- coming back nicely. We see some green shoots there. On the Falcon, we're seeing RFPs on a regular basis. Now, customers have to be able to trust us and do it. So we're out there getting trials with them and things like that. It's going to take a while to build this off the road. At the same time, we know truck rates in the U.S. have been depressed over the last year, and we're competing against those as we move forward. We do have a great product, and we know we're going to win as time moves on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Fadi Chamoun from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fadi Chamoun:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Ed, Pat and Derek, congrats on the roles. And Ed, if this is truly your last retirement, all the best, and thanks for all the advice over the years. Maybe, Doug, on the fourth quarter, if you can give us -- what are you assuming for volume in the fourth quarter in terms of growth year-on-year or sequentially, just to kind of help us track your progress on that front? And my question on the cost per headcount, per employee, like how should we think about this sequentially into Q4? And I know you have some labor negotiations coming up here. And how do you think about kind of the best way for us to think about that cost per headcount in 2024?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Listen, Fadi, I'm going to take the first one, and I'll hand it off to Ghis for the second one. So, as we're looking at volumes kind of week over week and month over month, we're seeing that sequential strength. And right now, we're looking at sequential growth in all but kind of the international -- even in the international volumes sequentially, though we're seeing real strength coming from most, if not all of our business lines as you look at it sequentially over time. So we've mapped that out. Doug is pretty close to his customers and what they're planning over the course of this year. So it's on that basis that our confidence remains on our guidance. And if you look at industrial production as well, we've said that we were going to do better than industrial production. Industrial production is strengthening. And I think that -- Doug, what do you think you'll see us do that on everything, maybe except the international lines, would that be the case?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>No, I agree with that 100%, Tracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you. Ghis?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So Fadi, on the average comp per employee, when you look at it sequentially, it's up 2% in Q3 versus Q2, and that's mostly due to a 4% wage increase on our U.S. employees that started in July 2023. And for next year, again, I would continue to assume regular wage increases, and we're just replacing employees for attrition, and that's about it. So that's the answer to that question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fadi Chamoun:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>Great, good afternoon. Ed, I'll stick to it. Congrats on your last call and your attempt on the fifth retirement. And congrats to Derek and Pat, which is great, as Tracy said, they have no mic. So Tracy, you can really talk about them now. I guess, just a numbers question real quick and then a long-term one. The casualty costs, they ramped up in the quarter. I just want to understand, is that sticky? Or is that just because -- I think it was mentioned there were a couple of extra accidents in the quarter. But long term, my question would be just -- I know you've talked a little bit about the 10% to 15%. I know that's not linear. But how should we think about that as you start to rebound? And maybe give us upside downside? Is it just the volume? Because Doug sounds like you've got a lot of confidence that we passed the bottom. So, is that just moving past the storms and the U.S. grain crop bouncing up? Maybe talk about the upside, downside on that range for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, Ken, maybe the first -- your first question on the casualty cost, I'm looking at my notes here. C&amp;O, casualty and other is mostly flat on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So I'm not sure what number you're looking at.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>I just looked at -- it was just up sequentially, right? So I know it year-over-year. Is that seasonal in terms of the accidents at [Indecipherable]?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. On -- sequentially, it's -- again, it's just up about 6%, 7%, and it's really lower horsepower -- high horsepower income. This is tough to say for a French guy. So it's just mostly lower high horsepower income in Q3 versus Q2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Yes. If it's not a trend, that's fine. I just want to make sure...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>No, it's not.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>That was nothing that was sticky based on...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>We true-up on our horsepower every quarter. So you have some ups and downs depending on how we interchange our trains with other roads and so on and so forth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>And on the volume question, so you're right, we don't see this as being linear. And what we did put together was kind of -- last year was kind of a 10-year view on what our growth would look at. What we put in front of you guys in -- earlier this year was the three-year view on that. And so, a good chunk of that, as we've said, are a number of customer initiatives that Doug is working, and that's not a static list. It moves around a lot. And I'm excited about some of the new ones that are coming out of that list. What remains uncertain is the other part of it, which is the volume growth that's going to come with our customers and our partners on just the economic strength. And so, we're modeling in kind of what we've talked to you about. Next year, we'll give you a little bit kind of related to industrial production. We'll give you a little bit more color on that in January when we talk to you next. But I would say that, that would be the biggest risk for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>It is the volume side?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. On the economic, that volume, which is tied to economic strength as opposed to the specific customer initiatives that we're working. Thanks for your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kenneth Scott Hoexter:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Benoit Poirier from Desjardins. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benoit Poirier:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. [Foreign Speech] and happy retirement, Ed. And congrats to Pat and Derek for their new roles. If we move to Eastern ports, there's a labor agreement up for renewal with the dock workers at the Port of Montreal, and there's also the potential strikes with the St. Lawrence Seaway. So just wondering if you have seen any cargo diversions so far and kind of the actions that are taken so far to mitigate the potential impact of those labor agreements?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, Benoit. I'll take that. It's Doug. So, on the St. Lawrence, obviously, it's brand new. The products that move on the St. Laurence that really, I'll say, are complementary to the rail, really grain is the main one. So right now, there's enough elevation capacity in Thunder Bay for this week and probably most of next week. And if the strike lasts post that, then we have offered a train package to our customers to be able to move product into the East from Western Canada. So it would be -- we'll start to look at some business there. You also have the iron ore that tends to move export via Quebec City from the Minnesota area. So we may -- there may be some opportunities there as well, but most of that should just move to the dock like normal. So I don't see a lot of changes for us overall as this moves forward. When you look at the Port of Montreal, we have prepared for that. We've put a package together to actually move a lot of our customers' freight over the Port of Halifax. We're only in the process now of going out to the market with that so that they know what's available, and we're just starting that planning now. But we do have the operational plan already in place.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benoit Poirier:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And just a follow-up on Contrecoeur. We've seen a great announcement over the last few weeks. What would be the next milestone to monitor, Doug?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>So Contrecoeur, the next one will be really, I think, you will see a new RFP for a port operator, that will be the next big milestone for what they're telling us. They're going to start work on the dock as it is today or the waterfront as they call it. So that's where that money is going, Benoit. So they're going to start there without a port operator being named. And then, the port operator will be the next big milestone. So we're looking forward to that as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benoit Poirier:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much for the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Wetherbee:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, I wanted to ask about headcount and resources maybe in general. As you think about kind of reaccelerating the growth and this line of sight that you have to volume growth as we move forward into 2024, where do you think you are in resources? I guess, maybe asked another way, do you think that there's a certain amount of volume growth that you can absorb with the headcount and sort of the overall resource base that you have today? Or do you think you'll need to be adding incrementally as we move forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for that question, Chris. So let's think about it this way. We are resourced right now to move the volume that we have, but the resourcing decisions that we make are based on six or nine months from now. So we're planning now for what we need out there. And as we think about it, think about the bulk business, that business is moving now. As that -- if and as that grows, that's new incremental train starts, we'll need kind of the resources for them. If you think about the merchandise business, however, that has some quite significant room. If we think about -- even in this quarter, our volumes were down, for example, 5%. Our train starts are down 2%. So in running the scheduled operation, we're maintaining the integrity and the discipline of that schedule, which means that our trains are running a little short. So the first lift in volumes, particularly in merchandise, is going to go on to the end of those existing trains. And there's a tremendous amount of leverage there. And of course, that's done with the existing crew base. On the international side, as that starts to ramp up, that also will be incremental kind of train starts. So we're doing this planning now for next year, and we've got some hard to hire locations that we're still working on. But other than that, I think we're in great shape.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Wetherbee:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And 4Q should be roughly flattish or slightly higher than where we are from a heads perspective?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>I think that's pretty much baked right now. So yes, it should be about what we are now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Wetherbee:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for your time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the question, Chris.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Steve Hansen from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, thank you for the time. I'll stick to one question as instructed. It seems like everyone on this call doesn't understand what that means. But in any case, a question for Doug or Tracy. Grain has been one of your biggest tailwinds year-to-date piggybacking off last year's harvest. At this juncture, I think it's fairly well known that this year's harvest was anything but superior. I understand you've got a couple of weeks of tailwinds from an early harvest, but I'm surprised your comments on the outlook were more balanced or cautious. You suggest that it was quite bullish. And I'm just trying to square the two given the harvest backdrop. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So listen, the grain crop this year wasn't a bad crop, I can tell you, but it was smaller without a doubt last year, our lines in the North, and the drought was a little bit -- we didn't have the same kind of drought conditions. And we're moving a lot of grain right now. What it does mean, as Doug has said in the past, is that it can -- we can run out of grain to move a little bit earlier in the year next year, and that may be an issue in Q2, I guess, Doug. But we've got -- on the offsetting, we've got a number of customer initiatives that are going to -- that are starting to produce volume now that we think is going to be -- give us a -- it's going to be a good offset to that. Doug, anything else?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>No, you covered the Canadian grain really well. And on the U.S. grain, we're seeing some strong volumes right now because of the Mississippi being so low. But a lot of that's going to be tempered by overall demand with China and other countries. So we're moving good volumes right now. The team is doing a great job at that. We're really sold out in the U.S. market. We're going to see how the rest of the year plays out here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>Appreciate your time</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the one question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Justin Trennon Long:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could comment on your expectation for the sequential progression of yields on a cents per RTM basis as we move into the fourth quarter? And maybe along with that, give a little bit more color on the core pricing trends you're seeing. I heard you say that they remain above inflation. But I'm curious if pricing is getting better, worse or about the same on a year-over-year basis. Yes. Let me start with that one, and then I'll hand it over to Ghis. But I would say that pricing can be difficult to see based on the revenue line. So the revenue line includes a bit of noise around storage fees that were higher last year than this year. There's some fuel surcharge noise in there. There's the currency noise in there, and there's -- so there's a -- it's hard to see the pricing through it. But I can tell you this, we've given Doug a mandate on the backs of the service that the guys have been able to provide for our customers to come in above our inflation level. And he is consistently doing that on the contract renewals, and we have mechanisms in the multiyear contracts that are providing that for us as well. So the underlying pricing is doing well. And Ghis, I don't remember the first question, but...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ghislain Houle:</emphasis></p><p>You covered it. When you look at either cents per RTM or revenue per RTM, as we've always told you guys not to look at this as a proxy for yield because it's a lot of moving parts. There's FX in there. There's the auxiliary [Phonetic] charges that you talked about, Tracy. There's also the fuel surcharge. So -- and I know that you're looking -- you're trying to find metrics for yield, but this has got a lot of noise, but we're very confident. And Doug made the point that our pricing is above our rail inflation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you for the question. And I think one more question, and then we're out of time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Certainly. The last question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Chiang:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for squeezing me in here. Congrats Ed, Patrick and Derek. Maybe just turning to automotive, when I think back to your Investor Day, you laid out a number of opportunities related to the EV supply chain. It does feel like that we might be slowing down here in terms of EV adoption. At least that's we're hearing from the OEMs. Just wondering any changes to your long-term potential growth opportunity there, the volume capture opportunity, just given what some of the OEMs are doing as they adjust production around their EV portfolio?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug MacDonald:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Kevin. So, it's a great question. So EV, it starts really back at the battery, so all the minerals that go into it. So we've started moving some of the raw lithium. Listen, on our network, we're now up to -- well, it was five, but it's just got to six plants located on our network, really all in Eastern Canada, for construction, either of the batteries themselves or for some of the parts that go into the batteries or for the refining of the raw lithium and other metals. So we're starting to build that supply chain up. And we knew it wasn't going to be right away. These plants take a while to get built. In the interim, we're still seeing the EV production schedules moving forward at most of the Big three. Now, we know GM just came and pushed theirs back by about a year, but that's okay, right? There's still lots of other products that move in the automotive side, and that will give us time to actually have all these plants constructed in Eastern Canada, where we can actually haul those batteries down and the other parts, too. So it's moving along quite well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Chiang:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. Great color. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. It's just -- go ahead, operator.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Tracy Robinson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tracy Robinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. I jumped the gun a little there. Listen, I just want to echo, Ed, the comments on the call today. Thank you for what you've done here and for ending the long, very impressive run with us. It's a privilege and it's been a lot of fun working with you and watching you. And they're not miked up, but let me say this about the guys at the end of the table here, Derek and Pat, very much looking forward to working with you. But the truth is, as we all know, this plan was implemented a number of months ago. And so, you have this place running really, really well. We're excited about where we're headed. This is all about executing our plan and the plan we laid out at Investor Day. The pieces are all in place. The core engine is performing well. And we're ready and really eager for that rebound. So, thanks for joining us today, and we'll talk to you all early in the year. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-74b7c740825b5f86a735bd2a03070667</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB8-WVJ3-RSHD-T46P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 AlphaStreet Inc.

Welcome to CN's Third Quarter 2023 Financial and Operating Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>I would now like to turn the call over to Stacy Alderson, Assistant Vice President, Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Alderson.</p><p>STACY ALDERSON: Thank you, operator. (foreign language) Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CN's Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call.</p><p>Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statements and additional legal information available at the beginning of the presentation. As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. and Canadian securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. They are more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements in our presentation.</p><p>After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a Q&amp;A session. I do want to remind you to please limit yourself to one question. As usual, the IR team will be available after the call for any follow-up questions.</p><p>Joining us on the call today are Tracy Robinson, our President and CEO; Doug MacDonald, our Chief Marketing Officer; Ghislain Houle, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Harris, our Chief Operating Officer.</p><p>It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Tracy Robinson.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY: (foreign language) I want to start today by saying a few words about the evolution of our operation structure. We were very pleased last week to announce the appointment of Derek Taylor to Executive Vice President and Chief Field Operating Officer; and Pat Whitehead to Executive Vice President and Chief Network Operating Officer. And you've all met both Pat and Derek. They are both accomplished and experienced operating officers, and they will both play prominent roles in CN's future and our success. Now, this isn't splitting Ed's roll into 2. We're making this bigger, and we'll be focusing on work that we haven't done before. Now, the structure we're creating will strengthen the competencies that are core to our future of driving profitable growth. It recognizes the equal importance and the distinct nature of competencies around building the plan and running the plan.</p><p>Now, Derek and his field team will focus on continuing to improve the daily execution of our scheduled operating plan across our 3 operating regions and our intermodal terminal. They will drive on-time performance, along with continued improvement in dwell and in first-mile/last-mile delivery to our customers. Pat and his network team own the plan, and their focus will be on 2 things: continuing to refine the plan to optimize to our volumes and to improve velocity and to drive a more focused longer-term plan, including resourcing and the development and execution of the capital plan to both maintain our network on a lower cost per unit basis and expand it for growth where necessary in a more cost-effective manner. Now, this structure splits the critical day-to-day focus of running the operation from the very specific work we need to do to ensure that we continually -- continue, rather, to operate well while we grow. I'm looking forward to working with Pat and Derek as we continue to refine this model and excited about the performance and the innovation that they will deliver in this next chapter.</p><p>Now, they're both in the room with us today. They don't have speaking roles and they're not miked up, but they are here with us. It's Ed who, of course, will carry the operations dialogue on this call, and he is here and he is miked up and ready to go. You'll be hearing from him shortly. But before he gets to speak, let me just say how much, Ed, I have appreciated your willingness to step back in. I've appreciated your partnership in creating our path forward and your leadership in ensuring that we've got the right kind of winning conditions in place with our operations team for this transition. You've made a real difference, and I know that's exactly what you wanted to do. Now, before I hand it over to you, though, I have some comments on the business and on the quarter.</p><p>Our railroad continues to run very well. It is the test of our operating plan that we can maintain our fluidity, our velocity and our customer service levels through different and challenging conditions. We've demonstrated that over these past few quarters. Now, through the forest fire season this spring and summer, which was the worst in Canada's history, the flood conditions in the East and West, and the West Coast port strikes, our operational performance remained strong and consistent, and we've demonstrated the ability to recover quickly. Our on-time train performance and our velocity have remained steady. Now, this is exactly what we're looking for. And our last-mile services improved. We've been consistently over 90% for the last 2 quarters versus about 80% last year. This is the performance and the resiliency that we're looking for as the foundation of our growth plan moving forward.</p><p>Now, on volumes, we have a tale of different market segments. You'll hear from Doug a little more on this. Our bulk business, so think grain, coal, potash, frac sand, has been strong all year. Our merchandise business is continuing to firm up. And for instance, we've seen an inflection in chemicals and plastics starting in August. In our consumer-related business, particularly the intermodal business, continues to be murky.</p><p>Our domestic intermodal volumes are holding up relatively well, thanks to initiatives like the [EMP] and the Falcon service. However, the international intermodal has been affected by 2 things: destocking over overall consumer consumption, which has impacted port volumes across the continent for everyone; and then the West Coast port strike. Now, coming out of the port strike, our Canadian destined volumes have returned. Our U.S. destined volumes moved to U.S. ports during the strike have not come back fully as yet. This is a temporary situation. We're confident in the value proposition that the Canadian ports offer in both service and cost, and we continue to work to get those volumes back to the Northern gateway.</p><p>Now, I believe we've seen the bottom on volumes. We've started a controlled ramp-up of the operation to support growth. The growth plan we laid out earlier this year is continuing to progress. It's a mix of growth tied to economic strength and growth tied to specific customer initiatives. Now, the volume growth tied to the economy will come as the economy [lifts]. The benefits of our customer-specific initiatives are unfolding pretty much on plan. In both cases, we will see considerable margin leverage as volumes increase. I'm a big believer in the resiliency of the North American economy. This team has managed extremely well to the softer volumes, and what we can control continues to go very well, faster and better than plan, in fact. And we're ready as the volumes turn up. We've got a lot of confidence in this team, in this network and in this plan.</p><p>Now, turning to our third quarter results, I'll keep it to just a few highlights. Our third quarter EPS was 21% lower than last year, and our operating ratio of 62% was higher than last year but remains at or near best in the industry. I am extremely proud that our customer service and operational efficiency have been top tier for 6 quarters now.</p><p>The team will take you through the details in the quarter. I'll turn it over to them now, starting with Ed. Now, Ed, I said a few nice things earlier, but I need now to mention that this is your last quarterly call with CN. Thank you, and let's make it a good one.</p><p>EDMOND L. HARRIS, CONSULTANT, CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY: Thank you, Tracy. Thanks for the kind words, I think. Before I jump into the quarter, I just want to take a minute to talk about these 2 guys, Derek and Pat. I've really gotten to know them over the past year, and they are among the finest operators I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Investors got to see a bit of their great chemistry and relationship back in May at Investor Day and how they work together. The entire network benefits from how well these guys operate every day. I can't tell you how confident I am in the future of the operation and the company with these 2 working as one, while expanding their responsibilities and pushing the team to be better every day.</p><p>In fact, this quarter has been a great example of how well they work together because it was tough operating out there in quarter 3. We started out by dealing with a 2-week port strike on the West Coast and then faced constant disruptions from forest fires and flooding until September. Running to a plan makes all the difference. For instance, we had a 2-day outage on our mainline east of Edmonton in the quarter. In the past, that would have taken us up to a week or more to get operations back in sync. This one took 2 days. The team really took it up a notch in September, though, with improvements in car velocity, train speed, through dwell, and origin and destination train performance. We told you how we decided not to furlough train crews earlier in the year. Now, with grain coming on strong, we're seeing the benefit of that decision. All in all, we're set up well for a strong fourth quarter. I'm very proud of the whole operating team this quarter and especially the leadership provided by Pat and Derek.</p><p>So how did the quarter shape up? Car velocity averaged 209 miles per day, which was down 1% compared to last year. Some of the other metrics we look at every day like train speed and train length were also down slightly. But when I think about the disruptions this quarter, I don't think we went a single week in July or August without a major network disruption. Stats that could tell you a lot about the quality of the people operating the network and the resiliency of running to a plan. And as well as the network ran this quarter, our yards were in even better shape. Our origin train departure improved to 89% in quarter 3, which is right in the sweet spot that we targeted. This is one of the keys to delivering for our customers, and as Tracy has already covered our great local performance.</p><p>Finally, on safety, we had 6 more reportable injuries and 2 more reportable FRA accidents than the third quarter of last year, which put some pressure on our quarterly metrics. But our year-to-date injury frequency ratio is still 11% better than 2022, our best-ever quarter 3 year-to-date performance. And our year-to-date accident ratio is also on track at 16% better than last year.</p><p>Now, Tracy said it, this will be my last call as Chief Operating Officer. I'm going to hang around for the winter to give the team some support through the transition, but I officially hand over the reins to Derek and Pat on November 15. And like I said before, I have complete confidence in these guys and in this team. Tracy gave me 2 priorities when I came out of retirement last year, get this place running well again, coach and mentor the next generation of operating talent. As I head off to my fifth retirement, I'll sleep well at night knowing we knocked it out of the park on both counts. This place is running as well as I've ever seen it run, and the next generation is ready. And finally, on a personal note to the team around the table here today, it's been an honor and pleasure to come back to where I started and finish a career that I started over 50 years ago. It certainly has been my honor to be able to make that happen.</p><p>Thank you. Now, it's Doug's turn to talk about top line performance and market outlook.</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CMO, CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY: Thanks, Ed, and all the best on your well-deserved retirement. Also, congratulations to Pat and Derek. I look forward to working even closer with you as we deliver for our customers together.</p><p>We said it on the Q2 call that our commitment to our customers is to provide industry-leading service, and we continue to deliver on our promise. As for volumes, we believe the worst is behind us. They hit the bottom in July. We saw improvement in August and September. Through the rest of the year, we expect this trend to continue, and I'll give some more details in a moment.</p><p>We continue to deliver core pricing ahead of CN inflation. The pricing environment remains robust, and our service levels are facilitating pricing conversations with our customers. We started the quarter in a bit of a hole with the port strike on the West Coast. This impacted international intermodal more than any other business segment. And as Tracy mentioned, we continue to see a hangover effect from cargo diversions to U.S. gateways. We ended the quarter with UAW strike starting at the Detroit Big 3. Fortunately, this only had a limited impact on our volumes in Q3.</p><p>Turning to Slide 9 now, third quarter revenues were nearly $4 billion, down 12% versus last year on lower fuel surcharge rates, lower volumes, but partially offset by solid pricing. RTMs were down 5%, but excluding overseas, were up 1% for the quarter as we see a continuing recovery across the other business lines. For merchandise, metals and minerals, finished with the best quarter so far this year, supported by increased drilling programs in Western Canada driving strong sand shipments. Demand for forest products remains below pre-COVID levels due to a challenging macro environment. Lower petroleum volumes in the quarter were mostly due to spot crude unit trains that we moved last year. We should lap that tougher comp in the fourth quarter. Plastics and chemicals sequentially strengthened in the quarter, which is a leading indicator of industrial production. Automotive continued to benefit from strong pent-up demand with limited strike impact.</p><p>Turning to intermodal, I will remind you that storage revenues were normalized this year following last year's supply chain issues, which represents an impact of about $100 million in the quarter. In domestic intermodal, we saw the monthly year-over-year numbers turn positive in Q3, in part because of our Falcon service between Canada, Detroit and Mexico. International intermodal continues to be weak, but we were impacted -- and we're impacted by the West Coast port strike. We continue to see lighter U.S. discharge at Rupert and Vancouver, and we're working hard with our customers to get that volume back.</p><p>Our bulk business has been outperforming since the start of the year. Starting with grain, we saw a strong weekly ramp-up in Canadian grain in September with the crops coming off the field about 3 weeks earlier than last year. Building on our strong service from the last crop year, grain is now rolling, and we expect strong volumes until at least next spring. We handled record potash volumes in the third quarter to export markets and the U.S. market. The operating team is providing outstanding service to our customers for this incremental volume, but we are being careful not to oversell the network. Finally, the West Coast strike and subsequent terminal outage had a minor impact on met coal in the quarter, but commodity prices are still supportive of ongoing export volumes.</p><p>Looking ahead to the balance of the year on Slide 10, we're seeing lots of momentum across almost all of our markets. With bulk leading the charge, Canadian grain is running full out. U.S. grain will also be strong, and similar to 2022, benefiting from record low water levels on the Mississippi and limited barge capacity, but tempered by demand in China. We expect solid potash demand in line with the Q3 run rate, and there could be additional upside with a robust export market. Canadian met coal should be strong for the rest of the year, and we have set an annual export record already with one of our largest customers. For overseas intermodal, we are seeing clear indicators of positive trends. Destocking appears to be nearing an end, but wholesale inventory to sales ratios remain elevated. We are forecasting a gradual improvement throughout 2024. On the domestic side, both retail and wholesale are tracking favorably over last year. As Tracy said, domestic is also helped by some growth initiatives.</p><p>Rounding out with merchandise, we have a strong outlook for drilling with frac sand demand, aided by our network capacity enhancements in Northern BC. We expect automotive to outperform with continued pent-up demand contingent on how long the UAW strike goes on. And we expect a continued positive trend in chemicals, plastics and metals, and stable forest products. October is off to a good start and in line with how we have been modeling the quarter.</p><p>Before I hand it over to Ghislain, I want to review on some of the unique growth initiatives we laid out at Investor Day. We announced our new long-term agreement with AltaGas yesterday, which will drive an increase in LPG export carloads through Prince Rupert and Ferndale, Washington. CN, along with our customers and supply chain partners, continue to invest and develop the Rupert gateway, which we highlighted at our May Investor Day.</p><p>On the Falcon product, we've been building up this service since its launch in May. It's now a solid and consistent product. In line with truck transits, we saw our first loads with STG Logistics a couple of weeks ago, and we continue to actively pursue opportunities to build density to and from Mexico as major RFPs come up for bid.</p><p>CN's Eastern fuel strategy is progressing with the new distribution terminal in Toronto, ready to start receiving cars in December. In line with what we projected at Investor Day, we expect volumes to build over 2024. We continue to work with our customers on building up the electric vehicle supply chain. We now have 5 announced projects on our network in Eastern Canada. It's going to take a few years to fully develop this opportunity, but we're pleased to already see the first shipments of raw lithium moving on CN for export at Quebec City. Our Northern BC strategy is also progressing, as we finished the first capacity project in the area this month. This will allow CN to add additional frac sand and propane shipments to the network.</p><p>To finish, I'm really excited about the next year and will have more to report on these opportunities in January. Over to you, Ghislain.</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY: (foreign language) But before I do that, I want to thank Ed for everything he has done this past year. I've known Ed a long time, and I'd like to wish him and his family a long, healthy retirement. And frankly, now I hope he stays in retirement. (foreign language) to Derek and Pat on their appointments.</p><p>Now, I will talk to Slide 12 of the presentation, which will provide more visibility on our third quarter performance. Volumes in terms of RTMs were lower by 5% on a year-over-year basis, including the impact of the external disruptions that Ed talked about earlier. We delivered operating income of around $1.5 billion, 21% lower than last year. Our operating ratio came in at 62%, up 480 basis points versus the operating ratio for the same period last year, but is only slightly higher year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. EPS for the quarter finished at $1.69, 21% lower than last year. The estimated impact of external disruptions on our network this quarter was unfavorable to EPS by $0.10 and dilutive to the OR by 130 basis points.</p><p>In terms of expenses, labor was essentially flat versus last year, driven by 6% higher average headcount and general wage increases, offset by the U.S. wage accrual true-up related to new labor agreements in 2022 and lower incentive compensation this year. We have slowed and, in certain cases, stopped the pace of new hires through the quarter. Fuel expense was more than $175 million lower than in the same period last year, mostly due to a 20% decrease in price and a 6% lower workload in terms of GTMs. With rising fuel prices, we had an unfavorable fuel surcharge lag, which had a $0.10 impact on EPS in the quarter or $0.20 of EPS on a year-over-year basis.</p><p>We generated close to $2.3 billion of free cash flow through the end of September. We are investing in our railcar fleet and continue to invest steadily in track maintenance as well as capacity expansions with a view to capital efficiency, so we can be ready for the rebound.</p><p>Moving to Slide 13, let me provide some visibility to the full year. Despite uncertainty in sectors related to consumer consumption, most other areas are demonstrating signs of strength. The bulk segment of our business continues to perform very well. We believe the worst is behind us, and you should expect operating leverage to improve as volumes come back. We are still calling for a gradual recovery in consumer-related freight demand in 2024. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of flat to slightly negative EPS growth in 2023 versus 2022. We assume that for the balance of the year, foreign exchange will be in the range of $0.70 to $0.75 and WTI in the range of USD 80 to USD 90 per barrel. However, full year assumptions continue to be $0.75 for foreign exchange and WTI at USD 80 per barrel.</p><p>We remain committed to shareholder distributions. We are confident in our long-term growth story and have increased the budget of our current share repurchase program, which runs through January 31, 2024, to approximately $4.5 billion, up from the previous budget of approximately $4 billion. Under this program, we have repurchased nearly 20 million shares for just over $3 billion through the end of September.</p><p>In conclusion, let me reiterate a few points. The team is committed to the scheduled railroad model, which provides reliable service for our customers. Apart from international intermodal, we are seeing strength in many segments, and volumes continue to sequentially improve. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our full year 2023 guidance. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us financial flexibility, and we will allocate our capital in a manner that drives long-term value for our shareholders.</p><p>Let me pass it back to Tracy.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Thanks, Ghis. Operator, I think we're ready to take some questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>JAMES MCGARRAGLE, ASSOCIATE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is James McGarragle. I am on for Walter this morning. We've been tracking some TEU trends out of Prince Rupert, and some of the weakness that occurred as a result of the port strike in July looks to be extended into August and more recently, September. And I guess, my question relates to the extent this might be structural versus temporary. I know you addressed this in your opening comments, but can you speak more specifically to some of the service and cost benefits you have versus U.S. alternatives and the confidence you have in that volume coming back? And any update on your conversations with the shipping lines? And how quickly do you think we could see that come back?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Yes, as we said earlier, we think this is a temporary issue. There are similar structural advantages to Rupert in particular, both, as you noted, economic and service. So we have set Principe up with a premium kind of container service into the U.S. markets, and that kind of strategy has been working. And as you noted, when the strike occurred, it's that business that started to move through the U.S. ports, but that structural advantage continues.</p><p>And we're 2 days faster from China in Chicago than the other alternatives, and there are some economic advantages based partly on the currency, the Canadian currency and other that we think they stand even as we look into the future. So we think this business is going to come back. We're working with our customers on it. Our call is that it will come back gradually. We've lost a little confidence in the West Coast ports. It will come back gradually unless the volume really starts to pick up, and then it will come back more quickly. In the meantime, up at Rupert, we're continuing to lean into an increasing structural advantage. If you think about the import transload, it's now under construction.</p><p>The port announced [really] an export logistics park that's been approved and is going forward. So all of that, I think, is very supportive on the container side. And even outside of containers, Doug mentioned our AltaGas deal. We very much appreciate the business and the partnership with AltaGas. But that new agreement is going to drive considerable growth in that quarter. So we are actually -- if you think about the growth that we laid out for you at Investor Day on the Rupert corridor, we are ahead of that plan. So we're feeling pretty good about it and very strong about the structural advantage of Rupert.</p><p>JAMES MCGARRAGLE: I appreciate it. And just a quick one on Bill C-47 and interswitching. I've seen some of the companies post about this on LinkedIn. But have you seen any customer uptick on interswitching? And any early commentary you can provide on the matter? And I'll turn it over.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Yes. I would say that what we are focused on is driving the highest performance out of our supply chains in the country and in the continent. And we are prepared to continue to invest in capacity and that performance. The interswitching provisions and the concept of it is not at all supportive of supply chains that perform at high level. It slows cars down, slows service down, and it is not supportive of continued investment. And so, on that basis, we've objected to this. Having said that, we haven't seen a significant impact as of yet, but it's really good.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.</p><p>BRANDON ROBERT OGLENSKI, VP &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: And sorry if this is a little bit near-term focus, but Ghislain, can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces of your implied 4Q guide? Because I think it suggests that OR should improve sequentially. And obviously, you had some issues in the third quarter. But can you talk through the moving pieces here on how to get to the full year guide from where you are?</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Thanks, Brandon. Well, I think as we said in our opening remarks, I think there's -- we see definitely improvement in volumes on a sequential basis. Just when you look at our volumes sequentially, in October versus September, were up 7%. So I think you can expect volumes to improve sequentially. And as volumes come in, I think that we are very comfortable that we will deliver some operating leverage. And maybe I'll pass it on to Tracy. Do you want to add anything, Tracy?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Sure. I think the other way to think about it, we are seeing the strength in volumes that Ghis is talking about. Our pricing is coming in exactly as the mandate that we gave Doug. And I am really pleased with the margins that this system is providing and this team is providing. I think we've had the best margins in the industry for the past, what, 5, 6 quarters. And we've got -- we know that there's leverage there, particularly in the manifest business on the merchandise side as the volumes start to lift again. We're eager for that to happen, and it looks like it's starting to happen now.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Cowen.</p><p>CHERILYN RADBOURNE, ANALYST, TD SECURITIES EQUITY RESEARCH: I wanted to pick up on some of the new interchange relationships that you've negotiated with your rail peers. What do you think needs to happen to make these partnerships work better than they have in the past? And do you think that the willingness to cooperate will extend to include trickier situations where perhaps one of the key carriers has to accept a shorter length of haul?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Yes, Cherilyn, thanks for that question. It is -- I think it is a change that we're seeing in the industry, right, for various reasons. And as we have our discussion, I would tell you that we are open for business and very eager to work with our partners and the other carriers to provide and design and provide the services that make sense for our customers. And the one that you've seen at least us step into most recently are really targeting getting truck traffic off the road. And things like the Falcon service, Doug is working as well on our new service with the NS, these are -- working with FXE in the case of Falcon and UP. We have a product in place now that's consistently delivering at very truck-like transits, and that's pretty remarkable. I think you're going to see more of this. And I would say that the nature of the dialogues that we've had so far with all of the carriers is that we'll conduct ourselves in a way as though we were a single carrier, right? And that may mean, in some cases, it's advantageous to one, and in other cases, advantageous to the other. But that's a principle that I think needs to underscore these relationships as we go forward.</p><p>Doug, do you have anything to add to that?</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: The only thing I'll add, Cherilyn, is that it's all about service. So the quickest transit times to compete against truck is really what the operating teams between the railways are really focused on. And we don't really care how long the haul is, right? It's all about -- we need to get it there as fast as truck. All the teams are -- have been greatly focused on that. They've come up with some great products where we think we are truck competitive in all these corridors, and they're major truck lanes. So I assume that we're going to take our time. We're going to start to build this as we build momentum. It's going to take a while to pull trucks off the road, but we're pretty happy with the product so far, and we think we'll be successful.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>RAVI SHANKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ed, congratulations and good luck with your retirement and congrats to the new incoming team as well. Maybe one kind of parting question for you. Kind of as you joined the team, was this transition kind of timing, what you had planned when you joined? Or is it something that you brought forward just given some of the traction that you've had with implementing the plan?</p><p>EDMOND L. HARRIS: When I came on board -- don't forget I consulted here for quite a few months before I came on board. And our evaluation of both Derek and Pat was almost immediate. Tracy and I were in agreement and in lockstep with what the future of this operating department was going to look like. And both of these individuals have stepped up to the plate.</p><p>Quite frankly, they've been running the show for the last couple of months, just getting ready. And I'm extremely, extremely proud of what they've been able to do. And there's a testament to their (inaudible). Our third quarter was tough, as I said in my speech. It was rough operating out there. And our metrics were only off a small percentage in car velocity, train speed cycles. We were doing everything right. And just to add on to what Doug just talked about between the carriers, just think of what this industry can do, if we take a day out of the cycle, all carriers do that, we get the traffic off trucks, and that's what it's about. So thanks for the nice comments. I appreciate it. I'll miss all of you, maybe. But it's been a lot of fun for me, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks.</p><p>RAVI SHANKER: And then, maybe as a follow-up, Tracy, can you share what the initial success has been like selling your Falcon service to your customers? Obviously, your peer has a bit of a speed advantage still. But kind of where are your customers sitting here in terms of their preference for speed versus value? Or kind of what are they looking for from that intermodal service?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Well, I would tell you that whether it's an intermodal service or any service, table stakes is the consistency of the service that we provide. In the case of going after the truck traffic like the Falcon service does, we know that means we also have to be fast. And I'm really impressed with the way the 3 organizations are working together to create a service and continually challenge it to where we can get time out. And you've seen that happen. And then to -- that's one thing, but to deliver it consistently every day is another thing completely. And we're doing that. And so as Doug said, this is a proof of concept, a model that we've got to prove to our customers, and it's going to grow over time. We expect it to start small, which it is, and it will grow over time. And Doug, I think we've said that we think this is a train a day both ways, ultimately. Is that...</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: No, Trace, to answer it, that's the market share that we see out there, and it's going to take a while to get there, and we're going to make some progress. Like I said in my remarks, we are lucky enough to see STG join up on the service, and they started shipping their first loads a couple of weeks ago. It's our first real new, I'll say, third-party person that's come on, and that's great. We're looking forward to more.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.</p><p>SCOTT H. GROUP, MD &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: Best of luck to you, Ed. So Ghislain, the $0.20 of headwinds in Q3 from fuel and external disruptions, should we just assume that those entirely go away, and that's basically the bridge to your full year guide? And then, as I think about next year, where you stand today, do you think the long-term guide of 10% to 15% earnings growth is achievable next year?</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Yes. Thanks, Scott. I can answer the first part of your question, and then I'll turn it over to Tracy for the second part. So you're right. So when you look at the fuel surcharge headwind that we had in the quarter, it's $0.20 year-over-year. It's $0.10 this year. And if you remember, Scott, last year, we had a favorable fuel surcharge of $0.10. So year-over-year, it's $0.20. And then, there's another $0.10 of year-over-year disruptions that we quantified for you. So that's what we have to go through in the quarter. And despite all of this, we delivered a 62% OR, which we're quite proud and pleased about it.</p><p>And then, I'll turn it over to you, Tracy, for next year.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Sure. As far as the guidance that we gave at Investor Day on the CAGR of 10% to 15% EPS, we are sticking to that. We see that, without a doubt, this railroad is running very well, continues to do so through all the shocks that it's gone through this year, a testament to the team. I'm impressed every day. We laid out a growth plan for you. Now, that was based on kind of this presumption of what Ghislain calls a supportive economy.</p><p>We haven't seen that much this year, but we are starting to feel it come back. And that growth plan was a combination of 2 things. It was a piece of growth that is we're going to capitalize on as the economy -- coming from the strength of the economy. And then there's some very specific customer initiatives that we're working through. That list is growing that we're progressing without -- they're not tied to the strength of the economy. And those are coming on plan, or in some cases, Doug has bringing them in ahead of plan, as is the case for the Prince Rupert corridor. So we think that this plan stands. And the risk to it would be that underlying strength in the economy, but we're feeling pretty good about it as we sit here today.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.</p><p>DAVID SCOTT VERNON, SENIOR ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So, Tracy, I just want to push on that a little bit. Obviously, we're coming in a little bit weaker than we might have thought for 2023. As you think about that 3-year envelope of 10% to 15%, with some of the growth initiatives starting to pay off, should we maybe be doing a little bit better than the lower end of the range? Or how should we be thinking about the contouring of that 10% to 15% over the 3 years? Is it more back-end loaded, middle loaded, front loaded?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: I think it is going to shift as far as in its timing. We're feeling pretty positive about the specific customer initiatives. What remains to be seen is exactly what the pace the -- the strength of the economy returning. So we'll give you a little bit more color on that in January, exactly what we're seeing. But right now, we're feeling good about our guidance.</p><p>DAVID SCOTT VERNON: And then just on -- maybe just real quickly the CapEx side of that, there was a lot of concern, I think, when you had your Investor Day around the level of spend. Are you thinking about regulating that spend still in line with the volume anticipation?</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Thanks. Yes. We have these customer initiatives. If these customer initiatives, some of them fall off the table or some of them happen later, then obviously, we will regulate our CapEx accordingly. The capital envelope is a living thing. It's a dynamic thing. We look at it on a regular basis. So obviously, absolutely, we will look at our CapEx in light of those opportunities coming on board.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Konark Gupta from Scotiabank.</p><p>KONARK GUPTA, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations to Patrick and Derek. Perhaps on international intermodal side, I want to figure out what's your visibility on timing for when the container traffic fully returns back to Canada from the U.S.? And then, as a follow-up on domestic intermodal, can you talk about the RFPs you're expecting in terms of size or nature for Falcon Premium?</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: Okay. Thanks, Konark. So on the international side, our customers are telling us they see a gradual ramp-up over the next year or so. So we're expecting that. That's what's in our forecast and our outlook moving forward. And that's the best visibility we have in the market. So we're depending upon them, and we think it's right. On the domestic side, outside of -- so, on the domestic Canadian side, things are going very well. We're actually seeing increases there year-over-year, which is fantastic. So, that market has come back -- coming back nicely. We see some green shoots there. On the Falcon, we're seeing RFPs on a regular basis. Now, customers have to be able to trust us and do it. So we're out there getting trials with them and things like that. It's going to take a while to build this off the road. At the same time, we know truck rates in the U.S. have been depressed over the last year, and we're competing against those as we move forward. We do have a great product, and we know we're going to win as time moves on.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Fadi Chamoun from BMO.</p><p>FADI CHAMOUN, MD &amp; TRANSPORTATION ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Ed, Pat and Derek, congrats on the roles. And Ed, if this is truly your last retirement, all the best, and thanks for all the advice over the years. Maybe, Doug, on the fourth quarter, if you can give us -- what are you assuming for volume in the fourth quarter in terms of growth year-on-year or sequentially, just to kind of help us track your progress on that front? And my question on the cost per headcount, per employee, like how should we think about this sequentially into Q4? And I know you have some labor negotiations coming up here. And how do you think about kind of the best way for us to think about that cost per headcount in 2024?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Listen, Fadi, I'm going to take the first one, and I'll hand it off to Ghis for the second one. So, as we're looking at volumes kind of week over week and month over month, we're seeing that sequential strength. And right now, we're looking at sequential growth in all but kind of the international -- even in the international volumes sequentially, though we're seeing real strength coming from most, if not all of our business lines as you look at it sequentially over time. So we've mapped that out. [Doug is] pretty close to his customers and what they're planning over the course of this year. So it's on that basis that our confidence remains on our guidance. And if you look at industrial production as well, we've said that we were going to do better than industrial production. Industrial production is strengthening. And I think that -- Doug, what do you think you'll see us do that on everything, maybe except the international lines, would that be the case?</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: No, I agree with that 100%, Tracy.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Okay. Thank you. Ghis?</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Yes. So Fadi, on the average comp per employee, when you look at it sequentially, it's up 2% in Q3 versus Q2, and that's mostly due to a 4% wage increase on our U.S. employees that started in July 2023. And for next year, again, I would continue to assume regular wage increases, and we're just replacing employees for attrition, and that's about it. So that's the answer to that question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America.</p><p>KENNETH SCOTT HOEXTER, MD &amp; CO-HEAD OF INDUSTRIALS AND BASIC MATERIALS, BOFA SECURITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ed, I'll stick to it. Congrats on your last call and your attempt on the fifth retirement. And congrats to Derek and Pat, which is great, as Tracy said, they have no mic. So Tracy, you can really talk about them now. I guess, just a numbers question real quick and then a long-term one. The casualty costs, they ramped up in the quarter. I just want to understand, is that sticky? Or is that just because -- I think it was mentioned there were a couple of extra accidents in the quarter. But long term, my question would be just -- I know you've talked a little bit about the 10% to 15%. I know that's not linear. But how should we think about that as you start to rebound? And maybe give us upside downside? Is it just the volume? Because Doug sounds like you've got a lot of confidence that we passed the bottom. So, is that just moving past the storms and the U.S. grain crop bouncing up? Maybe talk about the upside, downside on that range for next year.</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Yes, Ken, maybe the first -- your first question on the casualty cost, I'm looking at my notes here. C&amp;O, casualty and other is mostly flat on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So I'm not sure what number you're looking at.</p><p>KENNETH SCOTT HOEXTER: I just looked at -- it was just up sequentially, right? So I know it year-over-year. Is that seasonal in terms of the accidents at (inaudible)</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Okay. On -- sequentially, it's -- again, it's just up about 6%, 7%, and it's really lower horsepower -- high horsepower income. This is tough to say for a French guy. So it's just mostly lower high horsepower income in Q3 versus Q2.</p><p>KENNETH SCOTT HOEXTER: Okay. Yes. If it's not a trend, that's fine. I just want to make sure...</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: No, it's not.</p><p>KENNETH SCOTT HOEXTER: That was nothing that was sticky based on...</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: We true-up on our horsepower every quarter. So you have some ups and downs depending on how we interchange our trains with other roads and so on and so forth.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: And on the volume question, so you're right, we don't see this as being linear. And what we did put together was kind of -- last year was kind of a 10-year view on what our growth would look at. What we put in front of you guys in -- earlier this year was the 3-year view on that. And so, a good chunk of that, as we've said, are a number of customer initiatives that Doug is working, and that's not a static list. It moves around a lot. And I'm excited about some of the new ones that are coming out of that list. What remains uncertain is the other part of it, which is the volume growth that's going to come with our customers and our partners on just the economic strength. And so, we're modeling in kind of what we've talked to you about. Next year, we'll give you a little bit kind of related to industrial production. We'll give you a little bit more color on that in January when we talk to you next. But I would say that, that would be the biggest risk for next year.</p><p>KENNETH SCOTT HOEXTER: It is the volume side?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Yes. On the economic, that volume, which is tied to economic strength as opposed to the specific customer initiatives that we're working. Thanks for your question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Benoit Poirier from Desjardins.</p><p>BENOIT POIRIER, VP AND INDUSTRIALS, TRANSPORTATION, AEROSPACE, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS &amp; SPECIAL SITUATION ANALYST, DESJARDINS SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. (foreign language) and happy retirement, Ed. And congrats to Pat and Derek for their new roles. If we move to Eastern ports, there's a labor agreement up for renewal with the dock workers at the Port of Montreal, and there's also the potential strikes with the St. Lawrence Seaway. So just wondering if you have seen any cargo diversions so far and kind of the actions that are taken so far to mitigate the potential impact of those labor agreements?</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: Okay. Thanks, Benoit. I'll take that. It's Doug. So, on the St. Lawrence, obviously, it's brand new. The products that move on the St. Lawrence that really, I'll say, are complementary to the rail, really grain is the main one. So right now, there's enough elevation capacity in Thunder Bay for this week and probably most of next week. And if the strike lasts post that, then we have offered a train package to our customers to be able to move product into the East from Western Canada. So it would be -- we'll start to look at some business there. You also have the iron ore that tends to move export via Quebec City from the Minnesota area. So we may -- there may be some opportunities there as well, but most of that should just move to the dock like normal. So I don't see a lot of changes for us overall as this moves forward. When you look at the Port of Montreal, we have prepared for that. We've put a package together to actually move a lot of our customers' freight over the Port of Halifax. We're only in the process now of going out to the market with that so that they know what's available, and we're just starting that planning now. But we do have the operational plan already in place.</p><p>BENOIT POIRIER: Okay. And just a follow-up on Contrecoeur. We've seen a great announcement over the last few weeks. What would be the next milestone to monitor, Doug?</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: So Contrecoeur, the next one will be really, I think, you will see a new RFP for a port operator. That will be the next big milestone for what they're telling us. They're going to start work on the dock as it is today or the waterfront as they call it. So that's where that money is going, Benoit. So they're going to start there without a port operator being named. And then, the port operator will be the next big milestone. So we're looking forward to that as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup.</p><p>CHRISTIAN F. WETHERBEE, MD &amp; LEAD ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I guess, I wanted to ask about headcount and resources maybe in general. As you think about kind of reaccelerating the growth and this line of sight that you have to volume growth as we move forward into 2024, where do you think you are in resources? I guess, maybe asked another way, do you think that there's a certain amount of volume growth that you can absorb with the headcount and sort of the overall resource base that you have today? Or do you think you'll need to be adding incrementally as we move forward?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Thanks for that question, Chris. So let's think about it this way. We are resourced right now to move the volume that we have, but the resourcing decisions that we make are based on 6 or 9 months from now. So we're planning now for what we need out there. And as we think about it, think about the bulk business, that business is moving now. As that -- if and as that grows, that's new incremental train starts, we'll need kind of the resources for them. If you think about the merchandise business, however, that has some quite significant room. If we think about -- even in this quarter, our volumes were down, for example, 5%.</p><p>Our train starts are down 2%. So in running the scheduled operation, we're maintaining the integrity and the discipline of that schedule, which means that our trains are running a little short. So the first lift in volumes, particularly in merchandise, is going to go on to the end of those existing trains. And there's a tremendous amount of leverage there. And of course, that's done with the existing crew base. On the international side, as that starts to ramp up, that also will be incremental kind of train starts. So we're doing this planning now for next year, and we've got some hard to hire locations that we're still working on. But other than that, I think we're in great shape.</p><p>CHRISTIAN F. WETHERBEE: Okay. And 4Q should be roughly flattish or slightly higher than where we are from a heads perspective?</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: I think that's pretty much baked right now. So yes, it should be about what we are now.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Hansen from Raymond James.</p><p>STEVEN P. HANSEN, MD &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: I'll stick to one question as instructed. It seems like everyone on this call doesn't understand what that means. But in any case, a question for Doug or Tracy. Grain has been one of your biggest tailwinds year-to-date piggybacking off last year's harvest. At this juncture, I think it's fairly well known that this year's harvest was anything but superior. I understand you've got a couple of weeks of tailwinds from an early harvest, but I'm surprised your comments on the outlook were more balanced or cautious. You suggest that it was quite bullish. And I'm just trying to square the 2 given the harvest backdrop.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Yes. So listen, the grain crop this year wasn't a bad crop, I can tell you, but it was smaller without a doubt last year, our lines in the North, and the drought was a little bit -- we didn't have the same kind of drought conditions. And we're moving a lot of grain right now. What it does mean, as Doug has said in the past, is that it can -- we can run out of grain to move a little bit earlier in the year next year, and that may be an issue in Q2, I guess, Doug. But we've got -- on the offsetting, we've got a number of customer initiatives that are going to -- that are starting to produce volume now that we think is going to be -- give us a -- it's going to be a good offset to that.</p><p>Doug, anything else?</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: No, you covered the Canadian grain really well. And on the U.S. grain, we're seeing some strong volumes right now because of the Mississippi being so low. But a lot of that's going to be tempered by overall demand with China and other countries. So we're moving good volumes right now. The team is doing a great job at that. We're really sold out in the U.S. market. We're going to see how the rest of the year plays out here.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens.</p><p>JUSTIN TRENNON LONG, MD &amp; RESEARCH ANALYST, STEPHENS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I was wondering if you could comment on your expectation for the sequential progression of yields on a cents per RTM basis as we move into the fourth quarter? And maybe along with that, give a little bit more color on the core pricing trends you're seeing. I heard you say that they remain above inflation. But I'm curious if pricing is getting better, worse or about the same on a year-over-year basis.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Yes. Let me start with that one, and then I'll hand it over to Ghis. But I would say that pricing can be difficult to see based on the revenue line. So the revenue line includes a bit of noise around storage fees that were higher last year than this year. There's some fuel surcharge noise in there. There's the currency noise in there, and there's -- so there's a -- it's hard to see the pricing through it. But I can tell you this, we've given Doug a mandate on the backs of the service that the guys have been able to provide for our customers to come in above our inflation level. And he is consistently doing that on the contract renewals, and we have mechanisms in the multiyear contracts that are providing that for us as well. So the underlying pricing is doing well.</p><p>And Ghis, I don't remember the first question, but...</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: You covered it. When you look at either cents per RTM or revenue per RTM, as we've always told you guys not to look at this as a proxy for yield because it's a lot of moving parts. There's FX in there. There's the [auxiliary] charges that you talked about, Tracy. There's also the fuel surcharge. So -- and I know that you're looking -- you're trying to find metrics for yield, but this has got a lot of noise, but we're very confident. And Doug made the point that our pricing is above our rail inflation.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Thank you for the question. And I think one more question, and then we're out of time.</p><p>OPERATOR: Certainly. The last question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC.</p><p>KEVIN CHIANG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; ANALYST, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats Ed, Patrick and Derek. Maybe just turning to automotive, when I think back to your Investor Day, you laid out a number of opportunities related to the EV supply chain. It does feel like that we might be slowing down here in terms of EV adoption. At least that's we're hearing from the OEMs. Just wondering any changes to your long-term potential growth opportunity there, the volume capture opportunity, just given what some of the OEMs are doing as they adjust production around their EV portfolio?</p><p>DOUG MACDONALD: Thanks, Kevin. So, it's a great question. So EV, it starts really back at the battery, so all the minerals that go into it. So we've started moving some of the raw lithium. Listen, on our network, we're now up to -- well, it was 5, but it's just got to 6 plants located on our network, really all in Eastern Canada, for construction, either of the batteries themselves or for some of the parts that go into the batteries or for the refining of the raw lithium and other metals. So we're starting to build that supply chain up. And we knew it wasn't going to be right away. These plants take a while to get built. In the interim, we're still seeing the EV production schedules moving forward at most of the Big 3. Now, we know GM just came and pushed theirs back by about a year, but that's okay, right? There's still lots of other products that move in the automotive side, and that will give us time to actually have all these plants constructed in Eastern Canada, where we can actually haul those batteries down and the other parts, too. So it's moving along quite well.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Okay. It's just -- go ahead, operator.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Tracy Robinson.</p><p>TRACY A. ROBINSON: Thank you. I jumped the gun a little there. Listen, I just want to echo, Ed, the comments on the call today. Thank you for what you've done here and for ending the long, very impressive run with us. It's a privilege and it's been a lot of fun working with you and watching you. And they're not miked up, but let me say this about the guys at the end of the table here, Derek and Pat, very much looking forward to working with you. But the truth is, as we all know, this plan was implemented a number of months ago. And so, you have this place running really, really well. We're excited about where we're headed. This is all about executing our plan and the plan we laid out at Investor Day. The pieces are all in place. The core engine is performing well. And we're ready and really eager for that rebound.</p><p>So, thanks for joining us today, and we'll talk to you all early in the year. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: The conference call has now ended.

Amazon wants to use its in-house voice assistant to help the environment. Now, you can use Alexa[1] to plant trees in different locations. </p><p><br/>According to an announcement[2] by the company, Amazon[3] partnered with One Tree Planted to help reforest parts of the world. Through this partnership, Amazon will plant trees at the behest of Alexa users. By simply summoning Alexa and saying something like 'Alexa grow a tree', you'll be able to donate $1 to plant a tree. After your donation is made, One Tree Planted will plant a tree for you. <br/>Amazon didn't mention any sort of limit to the number of trees that you can plant, so you can be generous and plant as many of them as you want. If you want to keep track of how many trees you've planted, you can do so on your Amazon account. <br/>Folks can plant trees with Alexa, but it doesn't stop there <br/>Along with this program, Amazon is also donating $1 million to One Tree Planted as a whole. This is to help the nonprofit plant a million trees between now and December 2022. While you can plant as many trees as you want via Alexa, you're not likely to say 'Alexa, plant one million trees'; thankfully, Amazon has got you covered. This initiative will help with reforestation and forest fire prevention in four locations. <br/>The first location is Centre County, Pennsylvania. The companies hope to reforest about 34 acres of land in the county, as the area is unable to regrow its own. <br/>The next location is California. With the raging forest fires in 2018, the funds will help foresters prepare for and prevent forest fires and floods in the future. <br/>Over in India, the funds will help plant fruit trees to fight hunger in marginalized states. This includes the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Odisha, and West Bengal. <br/>Lastly, the funds will help plant trees along the pacific northwest. These trees will house salmon which is a primary source of food for orca. <br/>The post You Can Now Plant Trees By Using Alexa[4] appeared first on Android Headlines[5]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/amazon-echo-dot-smart-speaker-alexa-sale-deal\">https://www.androidheadlines.com/amazon-echo-dot-smart-speaker-alexa-sale-deal</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-grow-a-tree\">https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-grow-a-tree</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/04/prime-members-will-start-paying-more-for-amazon-music-in-may.html\">https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/04/prime-members-will-start-paying-more-for-amazon-music-in-may.html</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/04/alexa-plant-trees-amazon-environment.html\">https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/04/alexa-plant-trees-amazon-environment.html</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com\">https://www.androidheadlines.com</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The comment was written on April 29, 2021, and posted on June 1, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Request for Public Comment on the Executive Order Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (the Request) by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)./1</p><p>We appreciate that the focus of this request is forestry, as we believe the USDA and other federal agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), should work in concert together to take immediate action to maximize this industry's capabilities to contribute to climate change and forest fire mitigation goals, while also positively impacting rural development.</p><p>Ensyn is a U.S. corporation that produces low carbon cellulosic fuel oil, gasoline and diesel from forest residues. The recovery of these forest residues is incidental during the conduct of routine forest harvest activities that comply with U.S. Forest Service and industry practice guidelines and best practices. Furthermore, it does not increase harvesting intensity and is consistent with sustainable and responsible forest stewardship.</p><p>One immediate way to achieve the goals set out in the Request would be for the USDA to continue, and strengthen, its Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program,/2 while working with its partners at the EPA to ensure consistency between the agencies regarding the interpretation of forestry terms. In particular, the interpretation of the term Slash should be consistent throughout the Administration so that producers like Ensyn may successfully register under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program to produce fuel that generates Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs).</p><p>Currently, USDA and the forestry industry interpret Slash to include all residues left on the ground during logging, including unused cull logs./3</p><p>EPA has recently expressed that it does not consider unused cull logs to be included in Slash under its interpretation of the term. The volume of RFS qualifying feedstock in the U.S. has been severely limited as a result of EPA's current narrow interpretation of Slash, which is inconsistent with the interpretation held by USDA and forestry industry common and best practices. This outlier interpretation by EPA has closed off a valuable source of cellulosic biofuels that would contribute to the annual RFS renewable volume obligations (RVOs), the Administration's climate mitigation goals, forest fire mitigation efforts and rural development work. For instance, Ensyn's fuel made from Slash is cellulosic, which by definition under the RFS, represents at least a 60 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction over the 2005 petroleum baseline./4</p><p>Put simply, our renewable fuel would displace fuel with more significant GHG emissions.</p><p>It is well-established that residues left on the forest floor after logging can contribute to wildfire risk./5</p><p>If Ensyn and similar producers can start using those forest residues, including unused cull logs, as feedstocks for biofuels as a value-added agriculture economic stream, there would be sufficient incentive for forest residues to largely be removed, thereby reducing a significant source of wildfire risk.</p><p>Should the Administration adopt a consistent interpretation of Slash among all federal agencies that would enable the use of that feedstock under the RFS, and the USDA should also expect to see positive rural economic impacts in forestry communities throughout the country. We would expect these impacts to be similar to those which rural farming communities experienced following implementation of the RFS program and their associated, and significant, increase in the production and use of ethanol and biodiesel made from corn and soybeans.</p><p>Thank you for considering these comments.

This is the case for most land regions, and has been confirmed by the UN's global panel of climate scientists (IPCC).</p><p>Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have heated the planet by about 1.2 Celsius since pre-industrial times. That warmer baseline means higher temperatures can be reached during extreme heat events.</p><p>\"Every heatwave that what we are experiencing today has been made hotter and more frequent because of climate change,\" said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, who also co-leads the World Weather Attribution research collaboration.</p><p>But other conditions affect heatwaves too. In Europe, atmospheric circulation is an important factor.</p><p>A study in the journal Nature this month found that heatwaves in Europe have increased three-to-four times faster than in other northern mid-latitudes such as the United States. The authors linked this to changes in the jet stream -- a fast west-to-east air current in the northern hemisphere.</p><p>To find out exactly how much climate change affected a specific heat wave, scientists conduct \"attribution studies.\" Since 2004, more than 400 such studies have been done for extreme weather events, including heat, floods and drought -- calculating how much of a role climate change played in each.</p><p>This involves simulating the modern climate hundreds of times and comparing it to simulations of a climate without human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>For example, scientists with World Weather Attribution determined that a record-breaking heat wave in western Europe in June 2019 was 100 times more likely to occur now in France and the Netherlands than if humans had not changed the climate.</p><p>Heatwaves will still get worse</p><p>Global warming is already driving extreme heat events.</p><p>\"On average on land, heat extremes that would have happened once every 10 years without human influence on the climate are now three times more frequent,\" said ETH Zurich climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne.</p><p>Temperatures will only cease rising if humans stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Until then, heatwaves are set to worsen. A failure to tackle climate change would see heat extremes escalate even more dangerously.</p><p>Countries agreed under the global 2015 Paris Agreement to cut emissions fast enough to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C, and aim for 1.5\u00b0C, to avoid its most dangerous impacts. Current policies would not cut emissions fast enough to meet either goal.</p><p>A heat wave that occurred once per decade in the pre-industrial era would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5\u00b0C of warming, and 5.6 times at 2\u00b0C, the IPCC says.</p><p>Letting warming pass 1.5\u00b0C means that most years \"will be affected by hot extremes in the future,\" Seneviratne said.</p><p>Climate change drives wildfires</p><p>Climate change increases hot and dry conditions that help fires spread faster, burn longer and rage more intensely.</p><p>In the Mediterranean, that has contributed to the fire season starting earlier and burning more land. Last year, more than half a million hectares burned in the European Union, making it the bloc's second-worst forest fire season on record after 2017.</p><p>Hotter weather also saps moisture from vegetation, turning it into dry fuel that helps fires to spread.</p><p>\"The hotter, drier conditions right now, it just makes [fires] far more dangerous,\" Copernicus senior scientist Mark Parrington said.</p><p>Countries such as Portugal and Greece experience fires most summers, and have infrastructure to try to manage them -- though both have received emergency EU help this summer. But hotter temperatures are also pushing wildfires into regions not used to them, and thus less prepared to cope.</p><p>Forest management and ignition sources are also important factors. In Europe, more than nine out of 10 fires are ignited by human activities, like arson, disposable barbeques, electricity lines, or littered glass, according to EU data. But the climate crisis typically creates conditions that make the impacts of these fires much worse.</p><p>Countries, including Spain, face the challenge of shrinking populations in rural areas, as people move to cities, leaving smaller workforces to clear vegetation and avoid \"fuel\" for forest fires building up.</p><p>Some actions can help to limit severe blazes, such as setting controlled fires that mimic the low-intensity fires in natural ecosystem cycles, or introducing gaps within forests to stop blazes rapidly spreading over large areas.</p><p>But scientists concur that without steep cuts to the greenhouse gases causing climate change, heat waves, wildfires, flooding and drought will significantly worsen.</p><p>\"When we look back on the current fire season in one or two decades' time, it will probably seem mild by comparison,\" said Victor Resco de Dios, professor of forest engineering at Spain's Lleida University.         </p><p>             Story by Reuters</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Wildfire Caused $1 Billion in Insured Losses</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wildfire that ignited on Dec. 30 in Boulder County, Colorado destroyed 1,000 structures and caused insured losses of about $1 billion, catastrophe modeler Karen Clark &amp; Co. said Wednesday.</p><p>The blaze, called the Marshall Fire because it it started off of Marshall Road, was contained after the area received about 10 inches of snow on Dec. 31. But by that time the inferno had become the most destructive wildfire in Colorado history, KC&amp;C said.</p><p>The previous record belonged the East Troublesome Fire of October 2020, which destroyed over 500 structures and cost nearly $500 million in insured losses.</p><p>KC&amp;C said Colorado has experienced seven major loss producing fires since 2010. Other notable destructive fires include the Waldo Canyon Fire in 2012, which resulted in around $450 million in insured losses, and the Black Forest Fire of 2013, which resulted in nearly $400 million in insured losses.</p><p>\"Months of unusually warm and dry weather along the Colorado Front Range primed the environment for the fast-spreading Marshall Fire,\" KC&amp;C said. \"Precipitation had been at record lows in the region since July, and Denver had just experienced its second warmest fall season on record. The unseasonably hot and dry weather led to desiccated vegetation throughout the state, which can easily ignite and spread fire.\"</p><p>The exact cause of the Marshall Fire is still under investigation, but KC&amp;C said an intense, downslope wind event that impacted the Colorado Front Range assisted the fast rate of spread. On the morning of Dec. 30, strong winds were flowing nearly due east across the high peaks of the Colorado Rockies in the mid-levels of the atmosphere. By midday, an amplified mountain wave had developed over the Front Range and began to bring those strong mid-level winds to the surface, where gusts of over 100 mph were reported.</p><p>Downslope wind events of that magnitude are uncommon, but not unprecedented, in Colorado. In fact, a 110 mph wind gust had been recorded in Boulder County during another downslope wind event less than a week before the Marshall Fire, KC&amp;C said. As is typical of downslope winds, the air flowing into Boulder County from the mountains during this event was hot and dry, enhancing the potential for rapid fire spread.</p><p>The wildfire season does not typically extend into the winter in Colorado because of the usual snow cover and cold temperatures. But KC&amp;C said the Marshall Fire is part of a general trend of a lengthening fire season and drier fuels in the Western United States due to global warming.</p><p>The Marshall fire burned approximately 6,000 acres and devastated entire subdivisions throughout Superior, Louisville, and unincorporated Boulder County, Colorado, the catastrophe modeler said.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the destruction, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Louisville: 553 destroyed, 45 damaged.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Superior: 332 destroyed, 60 damaged.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Unincorporated Boulder County: 106 destroyed, 22 damaged.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>In Louisville, a suburban area about 20 miles northwest of Denver, hundreds of homes and a large commercial area, including a shopping center and a hotel, were among the destroyed structures.</p><p>Source: Karen Clark &amp; Co.</p><p>About the photo: Ron Damario peers into what remains of his charred safe, Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, in Louisville, Colo.

Silvies 7 is south of National Forest System (NFS) road 31.</p><p>* Prairie City Ranger District crews continue to monitor for smoke and hot spots on Elk 16 units C and Qa. Crews are beginning prep work on Unit FB, there is not set date for ignitions on this unit as of now.</p><p>* Blue Mountain Ranger District crews will continue to patrol Galena 30 and Murderers Creek 6 this week.</p><p>For the safety of firefighters and the public, roads and areas of prescribed fire activity will be signed. Please avoid these areas so as not to interfere with ongoing operations. For safety, roads, trails and areas may need to close temporarily as firefighter operations are taking place. Smoky conditions may also reduce visibility to a level that would require additional temporary closures. During prescribed fire operations, there is potential for impacts to camping and hunting. Hunters are advised to plan ahead, for their safety they should not camp in or near an area of prescribed fire activity.</p><p>Spring operations reduce surface fuels, increase height of some canopy, reduce small tree densities, and help promote fire resilient trees, thereby improving our ability to protect communities from wildfire. Additionally, these prescribed fires improve wildlife habitat, promote long-term ecosystem integrity and sustainability by reducing the risk of high-severity wildland fire.</p><p>All prescribed burn activity is weather and condition dependent.</p><p>With the potential for smoke to settle in certain areas during active operations, the public can monitor the smoke and air quality in our area and across the state by visiting, <url normalizedValue=\"http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/\">http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/</url>.

And Ginger, we are both the moms to young kids, so this is a little bit scary, what you're learning now about how every child is affected by climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GINGER ZEE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Yes. Rhiannon, the expert that we spoke to said that every child is impacted by climate change, obviously some a whole lot more than others, and it's all about their health. Bottom line, children five and under are taking the brunt of climate change.</p><p>GRAPHICS: CLIMATE IN CRISIS</p><p>GRAPHICS: EXTREME WEATHER ADVERSELY IMPACTING CHILDREN'S HEALTH</p><p>GINGER ZEE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) Jennifer Cantley is a busy mom with three energetic kids.</p><p>JENNIFER CANTLEY (CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY)</p><p>They love to play soccer, they love to sing, they love to just be fun little boys.</p><p>GINGER ZEE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) They live in Carson City, Nevada, next to the picturesque Sierra Nevada Mountains, but they can't always enjoy the outdoors. She and two of her sons have asthma, and the air quality here is far from perfect.</p><p>JENNIFER CANTLEY (CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY)</p><p>So a day like today, I can see the smoke in the air. I can feel it, you can even hear it in my voice a little bit.</p><p>JENNIFER CANTLEY (CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY)</p><p>We'll let you guys stay.</p><p>GINGER ZEE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) Jennifer is a member of the Moms Clean Air Force, a group of more than a million parents united against air and climate pollution nationwide. Jennifer says wildfires and soaring heat are just so frequent, she regularly has to check the air quality before she and her boys can play outside.</p><p>JENNIFER CANTLEY (CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY)</p><p>When the smoke comes in, and we start seeing these beautiful Sierra Mountains behind me disappearing, first of all, it's really hard 'cause we're getting our beautiful view taken away from us. But at the same time, now that means we're gonna be back indoors and we can't leave for, sometimes it's a whole month.</p><p>GINGER ZEE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) While being forced to stay inside can be frustrating, going outside can become downright dangerous when their asthma flares.</p><p>JOEY SABA (JENNIFER'S SON)</p><p>When you get an asthma attack, it's just like, it's hard to breathe so your lungs feel like somebody's like just grabbing them.</p><p>JENNIFER CANTLEY (CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY)</p><p>One of the scariest days of my life was waking up at 3:00 in the morning, and hear him, like, he could not breathe.</p><p>GRAPHICS: IPSOS ABC NEWS POLL U.S. ADULTS 18-45</p><p>GRAPHICS: 56% WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL HEALTH</p><p>GRAPHICS: 71% OF PARENTS WITH CHILDREN UNDER 18 CONCERNED</p><p>GRAPHICS: MAP OF WESTERN USA</p><p>GRAPHICS: 24% IN THE WEST</p><p>DOCTOR JENNIFER ASHTON (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) Millions of Americans are concerned about the effect of climate change on their children. According to our ABC News/IPSOS poll of US adults ages 18 to 45, 56% are worried about the effects of climate change on children's physical health. But among parents with children under the age of 18, 71% are concerned about the impact climate change will have on their children. But in the West, that number rises to nearly 80%. Frederica Perera, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University, is a leading expert in this field and has written a book on the subject.</p><p>FREDERICA PERERA (PROF. ENVIRO. HEALTH SCIENCES AT COLUMBIA UNIV)</p><p>As a result of climate change, children are suffering more heat-related illness, more asthma attacks from breathing forest fire smoke. They're suffering more physical injury and psychological trauma from severe storms and floods. And we're seeing more infectious diseases that are carried by ticks and malaria that have moved to new areas due to climate change. Also from air pollution.</p><p>DOCTOR JENNIFER ASHTON (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) When I was pregnant, walking around the streets of New York City, I certainly thought much less about the air pollution getting to my child, but in utero is where air pollution starts impacting a child?</p><p>FREDERICA PERERA (PROF. ENVIRO. HEALTH SCIENCES AT COLUMBIA UNIV)</p><p>That's correct. We used to think the placenta was a perfect barrier and the baby was literally in a cocoon, and that's not true. Air pollution is capable of traversing, moving across the placenta into the fetus. Air pollution is adding to the toll of preterm birth, infant deaths, asthma, and also effects on early brain development.</p><p>DOCTOR JENNIFER ASHTON (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) What can we do?</p><p>GRAPHICS: HYDRATE AND KEEP COOL</p><p>GRAPHICS: STAY INDOORS DURING DANGEROUS AIR QUALITY</p><p>FREDERICA PERERA (PROF. ENVIRO. HEALTH SCIENCES AT COLUMBIA UNIV)</p><p>Well, let's talk about what all parents can do. They can make sure that children are hydrated and have access to cool and shady places during heat waves. That's number one. Number two, during an episode of high air pollution, they can keep the child indoors because that air pollution episode could trigger an asthma attack.</p><p>DOCTOR JENNIFER ASHTON (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Voiceover) For her part, Jennifer has helped encourage local legislators to install an air quality monitor in her community.</p><p>JENNIFER CANTLEY (CONCERNED ABOUT AIR QUALITY)</p><p>My number one goal is making sure not only my children, but the future generations have clean air, clean water, and public lands.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) All right. Let's bring Ginger back in. Ginger, any good news? Any hope for the future?</p><p>GINGER ZEE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Well, hope, I've just recently learned, is a verb, and that means it takes action. It also takes being realistic, right? Wildfires would have happened naturally, but human induced climate change have amplified that. So feeling motivated to do our part is one big part. And just to give you an example, in the last couple of weeks, the Los Angeles city council has voted unanimously to stop future drilling of oil and gas.</p><p>GINGER ZEE (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) They've also voted to shut down the wells, which one move that impacts so many people's health directly around there. And not only did this happen because people just got loud and their voices certainly were heard, but because they voted and we can also vote with our dollar. Cornell University just last week showed us that new research shows, as the sales of electric vehicles goes up, the decrease in deaths in most major cities is pretty astounding. So we will see major impact with air pollution as we start changing our ways, and then the impact to children lessens as well.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Ginger is right. Hope is a verb. It takes action.</p><p>RHIANNON ALLY (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Yes. Good news. We have work to do, Ginger. Thank you.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) All right, Ginger. Thank you. Yeah.</p><p>RHIANNON ALLY (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Just ahead here on \"GMA3,\" some fresh and fun ideas for wrapping your holiday gifts.

But the hummingbird, one beak full of water at a time worked hard to help put the fire out.</p><p>\"The hummingbird said 'No matter how small it is, I'm going to do my part,'\" he said. \"So all the animals took their cues from the hummingbird and eventually started each doing their part to put the fire out. If we can learn from the animals and each do our part, no matter how small it might seem at the time, it will make a difference in the world.\"</p><p>Frison then told a handful of stories about different birds, paralleling them with good leadership and sticking together as a group to make positive changes.</p><p>After Frison concluded his storytelling, 9-year-old Adele Reopelle read the poem \"Hey Black Child\" by Countee Cullen aloud to the attendees.</p><p>Described as a poem of inspiration and hope, it was written during the Harlem Renaissance when Black people moved north after World War I in search of better opportunities.</p><p>After migrating, new opportunities became available to them in cities such as Chicago, New York, and Harlem. The city of Harlem was mostly populated with African Americans, and poets such as Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen and Gwendolyn Brooks made the Harlem Renaissance what it was,</p><p>according to an article about the poem's history.</p><p>After the poem reading, Project for Change board member Juanita Reopelle sang \"We Shall Overcome.\"</p><p>\"In the spirit of hope, I'm going to sing an old Negro spiritual and if you know it sing it with me,\" she said before she began to sing and others joined in.</p><p>Organizers then gathered together an assortment of door prizes, including some donated gift cards and items from Starbucks and Papa Murphy's in Bemidji, along with several gift baskets, T-shirts, towels and wall hangings.</p><p>One by one, tickets were drawn and people stepped up to claim their prizes.</p><p>Though the handing out of the prizes concluded the event's planned activities, attendees continued to mingle and visit with one another enjoying ice cream and other cool snacks to try to fend off the intense heat of the hot summer day.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Bemidji Pioneer (Bemidji, Minn.)

It was his first visit since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here`s part of what the president had to say about this trip:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv. One year later, Kyiv stands, and Ukraine stands, democracy stands. The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WIRE: Now, there is a long history of American presidents visiting war zones. This trip was unprecedented in modern history however because the American president traveled to an active war zone without a large U.S. military presence. President Biden said his trip was to reaffirm the, quote, unwavering support that the United States holds for Ukraine.</p><p>But, earlier this month, the United States said Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. That was an escalation of what they`d said previously. Russia called the accusation an excuse for Washington to further the conflict.</p><p>During his trip, President Biden also announced new military assistance for Ukraine and incoming sanctions against Moscow. We`ll keep you informed on any more updates from the president`s trip as well as new information on the ongoing war overseas.</p><p>And over the weekend, the secretive nation of North Korea launched a series of missile tests off the coast of the Korean peninsula. The country says the missiles have enough range to hit the United States. But the U.S. has said this weekend`s events, they don`t pose any immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory.</p><p>The tests do however highlight the destabilizing impact of North Korea`s illegal missile program. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un`s sister warned of more threats to come unless the United States halts military drills with South Korea.</p><p>More now from Paula Hancocks, CNN international correspondent based in Seoul, South Korea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It has been a busy few days on the Korean peninsula. North Korea on Saturday launching a significant missile. On Sunday and Monday, we have seen tit-for-tat retaliation from both sides -- North Korea, and also the U.S. and South Korea on the other side.</p><p>So what we saw on Saturday, Pyongyang admitted a day later, was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now these they claim can hit mainland United States and they are the ones that do concern Washington. We heard from Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un`s sister, that this actually shows that they have missile re-entry technology.</p><p>Now, it`s very difficult to know if that is in fact the case, but that is what Pyongyang is claiming at this point. So what we saw on Sunday then just one day later was a concerted show of force by the U.S. and South Korean air force, air forces. They flew sorties over the Korean peninsula, including at least one B-1 bomber, escorted by South Korean fighter jets and then in response to that, we saw this Monday morning from Pyongyang two launches.</p><p>Now they say that it was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise in retaliation for what they saw the day before. So this is really a latest cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation, but certainly, the Saturday launch was the significant one. But we`re not expecting the tensions or this tit for tat retaliation to diminish anytime soon, because Pyongyang says it is doing so because the U.S. and South Korea are carrying out joint military drills, and if they continue to do that, then they will continue to respond.</p><p>Now we know that this week at the Pentagon, there will be a nuclear tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korea, and then next month, there will be a larger joint military drill between the two countries.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WIRE: Up next, we`re traveling to Canada in search of zombies but not the type of zombies you`d typically think of. Ever heard of zombie fires, I had neither until now.</p><p>They`re essentially fires that were never totally put out at the end of a fire season and they burn underground threatening to come back from beneath the surface at any moment to wreak havoc once more. We`ll hear more now from an international team of researchers who are on the hunt for the next fire that could be lurking beneath the earth`s surface.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REPORTER: In the remote boreal forests of Canada`s Northwest Territories, and Rebecca Scholten, along with an international team of researchers, is on the hunt for signs of a rare and destructive phenomenon.</p><p>REBECCA SCHOLTEN, PHD STUDENT, VU AMSTERDAM: So the first thing you notice when you get to a site that has had a zombie fire is that a lot of these trees have fallen over and that is because of the underground burning that is happening.</p><p>REPORTER: In 2015, this region of boreal forest was the scene of an overwintering fire also known as a zombie fire. These are rare so we don`t have any footage of them but they can look just like these regular forest fires, except they`re back from the dead.</p><p>SCHOLTEN: So these are fires that are not extinguished at the end of a fire season but instead, they smoldered deep into the organic soil layer and when the snow comes the snow kind of protects them from the adverse winter conditions and that makes it possible for them to smolder or throughout winter and when the snow melts and there`s dry fuels available again these fires come up to the surface again and start a new flaming forest fire.</p><p>REPORTER: In 2021, Scholten published the first ever scientific study to detect zombie fires using satellites and reports from local fire managers as part of her PhD.</p><p>For example, in the summer of 2015, a fire in southwest Alaska blazed across 26 square miles. Winter came and snow covered the fire site. But the following spring, the fire returned along the old burn scar, evidence Scholten says of a zombie fire.</p><p>By burning through the soil and the roots, zombie fires can be more damaging to the forest than regular fires, making it harder for them to recover. But that`s not all, these boreal soils store huge amounts of carbon, so burning them releases it as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p><p>Zombie fires are rare but Scholten found that they are increasing due to climate change.</p><p>SCHOLTEN: So I think zombie fires a very good poster child for what is happening to arctic wildfires in general. So we see fire regimes are intensifying and this has very important impact on the ecosystems that of course has an impact on our climate. And that is why I think everyone in the world should care about these fires.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WIRE: Ten-second trivia:</p><p>Which of these words comes from a Latin term that described a wind from the north?</p><p>Zephyr, bluster, boreal, or arboreal?</p><p>Zephyr was a west wind but when you`re talking about a north wind, you`re speaking in boreal terms.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yeah, it`s going all the way. Oh, yeah, right above, wow look at how bright that is.</p><p>SUBTITLE: This erupting aurora was caught on camera in Alaska.</p><p>Particles from explosions on the sun interact with atmospheric gases, creating the mesmerizing light displays.</p><p>Vincent Ledvina, a doctoral student in space physics, has been photographic polar lights for years.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WIRE: All right. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a shark attack, only this time, it`s the shark getting attacked by a dog. That`s right, a big old hammerhead shark. One boater said it was probably about feet long, just minding this business in the Bahamas until a dog spots the monster cruising beneath the surface and cannonball, the dog jumps into the water and starts chasing the shark away. The people on the tour boat were screaming in disbelief in horror the dog is the pet of the caretaker who manages the private island.</p><p>Pardon my sarcasm little doggy, but something tells me year one jawsitively lucky pup. The boaters were relieved when the dog safely swam back to the shore unharmed.</p><p>Fun fact for the day: did you know that baby sharks are called pups? Learn something new every day.</p><p>Shout out time now. Hudsonville High School in Hudsonville, Michigan, we see you.</p><p>Also shout out to Mr. Ben Lewis at Brenham Middle School in Brenham, Texas. He challenged his students to interview a military veteran an immigrant and an American citizen over 60 years old. To learn about different perspectives and to gain better understanding of what it means to be an American, he turned the interviews into this book. Proceeds are going to help deserving military veterans.</p><p>We salute you, Mr. Lewis, and to all of the students who sent me a lovely note with all these signatures, you totally rocked it out.</p><p>We`ll see you tomorrow, everyone.

(Basins are areas of land where precipitation collects and drains into a common outlet.) All of the areas were located in the western U.S., and all had been affected by forest fires between 1984 and 2020.</p><p>Using a mathematical model they developed, the scientists discovered that streamflow in the years after a fire tended to be higher than scientists would expect based solely on climate conditions, and that larger fires tended to be followed by larger increases in streamflow.</p><p>In basins where over 20% of the forest had burned, streamflow was 30% greater than expected based on climate conditions, on average, for an average of six years.</p><p>Park Williams, a UCLA associate professor of geography and the studys lead author, said forest fires enhance streamflow because they burn away vegetation that would otherwise draw water from soil and block precipitation before it ever reached the soil. Intense forest fires can also cook soils, making them temporarily water repellent.</p><p>From 1984 through 2020, the amount of forested area burned each year in the West increased elevenfold, and that trend is expected to continue or even accelerate due to climate change.</p><p>As a result, were starting to see sequences of years when large portions of forest are burned across some very important hydrological basins such as those in Californias Sierra Nevada, Williams said.</p><p>The studys findings suggest that wildfires will soon become yet another important consideration for those in charge of the supply and distribution of water resources. Each year, the regions water managers must carefully calculate how much water will be available and determine how to conserve and allocate it.</p><p>In one sense, the increase in streamflow from forest fires may be beneficial, Williams said.</p><p>This could come as good news to dry cities like Los Angeles, because it could actually enhance water availability, Williams said.</p><p>But other outcomes could be troubling. For example, in the coming decades, too much water could overwhelm reservoirs and other infrastructure, and could increase the risk for catastrophic flooding and landslides in and around burn areas.</p><p>To adapt to increasing flood risks, Williams said, water managers in California may have to lower the water levels in reservoirs in the fall and winter to make room for excess water from major rainfall and snowstorms. Such a strategy could avoid disastrous flooding in some cases, but it could also put communities at risk for having too little water during the states increasingly hot, dry summers.</p><p>Water after a forest fire also tends to be heavily polluted, carrying mud, debris and large sediment loads. So even if the quantity of available water increases after a large fire, its likely that water quality will worsen.</p><p>Williams said he hopes the findings help water managers and climate scientists make better predictions about water availability and flood risk.</p><p>Water is a really heavy and destructive thing, Williams said. It's great when it comes to us in the expected amount. It is catastrophic when it shows up unexpectedly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125038615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64V9-BS91-DYTH-G07F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Nearly 6% of forests in the Sierra Nevada are at risk of conversion - a process where grassland or invasive species take over previously forested land, and somewhere between 1.6%-15.1% are threatened in the Intermountain West according to a paper published in BioScience. Warming temperatures and the advent of \"wildfire season\" has meant transitioning landscapes and an uncertain future for the West's forests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But with the anxiety and days of smoke filled skies imminent, a signal of hope has emerged from research that's been taking place over several decades in the Bitterroot National Forest of Montana.\u00a0</p><p>Research in the Lick Creek forest started in the 1980s after scientists started conducting prescribed burns and thinning. The area was not pristine - logging and decades of fire suppression had taken their toll. After the initial restoration work in the early 1980s, researchers continued monitoring the land and found that not only did the prescribed burns help prevent high severity fires, but had wide ranging benefits that increased the forest's resilience to drought and bark beetles.\u00a0</p><p>Researchers with the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Montana wrote in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change last summer that the Lick Creek forest supported previous research that found \"fuel reduction and restoration treatments are most successful with a combination of cutting and burning strategies, but also show that fuel treatments in low-elevation dry forests will likely not remain effective for much longer.\"</p><p>There was a time that fire wasn't considered crucial to healthy forests in the West. In fact, preventing any type of forest fire in last half of the 20th century became the practice and policy of government land management.</p><p>With rapid settlement of the region came the end of the low severity fires that scientists now understand (and indigenous communities already knew) are crucial to the health of many types of forests - especially those like the low elevation ponderosa pine forests that are now threatened with hotter, bigger fires that destroy rather than fortify the trees.\u00a0</p><p>Ponderosa pine trees are naturally adapted to some fire, releasing seeds in temperatures between 113 to 122 degrees. These frequent, low severity fires spur growth by clearing out so-called ladder fuels of brush and saplings.</p><p>When a low severity fire goes through a ponderosa pine forest, it's like the trees get a kind of \"boost\" to their immune systems, explained Sharon Hood, a co-author of the study and research ecologist with the Forest Service who has been working at Lick Creek Demonstration-Research Forest.\u00a0</p><p>The trees become stronger, better adapted to harsher environments - from warming temperatures to drought. Ponderosa pines even start producing more resin, which acts as a poison to pernicious bark beetles. \"Plants are much more an active participant in their environment than we give them credit for,\" Hood said.\u00a0</p><p>But when fire suppression lets ladder fuels build up, fires become larger, hotter and destroy well established trees.</p><p>Researchers found that forests that were cut and burned had a lower mortality rate from bark beetle invasions than those that did not receive the treatment. Clearing brush and thinning forests also meant less competition for water, making ponderosa pines better adapted to years of less rain.\u00a0</p><p>These findings are critically important as the West contends with a shifting climate and decades of poor forest management that have resulted in the loss of many forests that may not grow back.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's not a question of if the fires are going to occur, but when,\" Hood said. And not just fire, but drought and bark beetle invasions as well.\u00a0</p><p>Prescribed burns must start sooner rather than later, she explained, and it must be consistent.\u00a0</p><p>In the Lick Creek forest, fire historically burned through the area every 3 to 30 years. Researchers are hoping to go back this spring and conduct another prescribed burn after a little more than 20 years - some Douglas Firs have already grown so tall though that there is some fear about controlling the fire. \"Ideally these forests would have been burned 10 years ago,\" Hood said. Prescribed burns are not a one time fix, but they are an important tool.\u00a0</p><p>Population density and development near forests make it unlikely that forest fires will be allowed to burn unchecked again, but allowing lower severity fires to burn in more controlled ways could hold the key to making forests healthy again.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's a shift to realizing that fire is part of our Western forests,\" Hood said. \"We're learning how to better live with that reality so we can have fire more on our own terms.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-57055450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FR-8X01-JBRG-X18M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 16, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

One of several wildfires has raged out of control on Greece's second-largest island.High early summer temperatures and stronger winds reached the eastern states of Germany on Sunday, fanning a wildfire in an area southwest of the capital, Berlin. </p><p><br/>The country's national weather agency said the mercury topped 38 Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit) at some measuring stations in the east after reaching similar temperatures in the west of the country a day earlier. <br/>Residents of about 20 villages were ordered to evacuate as a forest fire, that has been burning since Friday, approached their homes. Others were told to prepare to leave in the next few hours. <br/>Earlier, a fire brigade spokesperson said the wildfire's area had spread to \"around 100 to 110 hectares,\" about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Berlin. <br/>A military helicopter was deployed to help in the firefighting operation. <br/>Emergency teams have so far managed to prevent the flames from crossing a major road, the B102, which has been closed to traffic. <br/>The local town hall in Treuenbrietzen in the state of Brandenburg is serving as an emergency shelter for those being evacuated. <br/>Germany has seen numerous wildfires in recent days following a period of intense heat and little rain. <br/>However, forecasters said thunderstorms would likely bring cooler weather in from the west by Sunday evening. <br/>Greek island hit by fire <br/>Also on Sunday, a wildfire continued to rage out of control in central Evia, Greece's second-largest island. <br/>Fanned by strong winds, the blaze spread across the slopes of a mountainous forest in Gaia. <br/>Authorities ordered the evacuation of the village of Kremastos as a precaution as the blaze got as close as 800 meters (roughly 2,600 feet) from some homes. <br/>About 70 firefighters were battling the blaze on the ground, assisted by nine fire dousing planes and four helicopters. <br/>Evia suffered devastating forest fires last summer that destroyed about a third of its forest cover. <br/>Meanwhile, firefighters in Spain struggled to contain wildfires that have raged for several days as a result of the heat wave that brought record temperatures for June. <br/>Thermometers have risen above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many Spanish cities this week \u2014 temperatures more typically seen in August. <br/>The worst damage has been in the northwestern province of Zamora, where over 25,000 hectares (61,000 acres) of land have been scorched, regional authorities said., <br/>The fire was started by a strike from an electrical storm on Wednesday, although a lack of rainfall and gusting winds created the conditions for the blaze to thrive. <br/>Temperature drops across Spain<br/>Spanish authorities said temperatures dropped on Sunday morning, giving some respite to the 650 emergency workers battling the burning vegetation. <br/>Supported by water-dumping aircraft, they were able to establish a perimeter around the fire that started in Zamora's Sierra de la Culebra, while 18 villages have been evacuated. <br/>Wildfires were also active in three parts of northeastern Catalonia: in Lleida, in Tarragona and in a nature park in Garraf, just south of Barcelona. <br/>Firefighters said they have responded to over 200 different wildfires just in Catalonia over the past week. <br/>Experts have warned the high temperatures were caused by worrying climate change trends.  <br/>\"What we're witnessing today is, unfortunately, a foretaste of the future,\" said Clare Nullis, a spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva. <br/>She said summers were likely to be hotter if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continued to rise and push global warming toward 2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels. <br/>mm/msh (AFP, AP, dpa) <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Himachal native Abhinav Talwar, who founded Vasshin Composites in 2019 with Maithri V, says the startup collects the region's abundant fallen pine needles to produce face shields, spoons, mugs, plates, and bowls. Local workers collect the pine needles, which are sent to production plants in Bengaluru, Mysuru and Baroda. To date, the company has sold over 100,000 face shields. 'Every year the forest fires cause considerable damage to the environment, especially with the heavy emissions of harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide,' Abhinav tells The Better India. 'The summer season is especially bothersome, as these trees shed their highly inflammable needles. They easily catch on fire, causing unaccountable damage to the environment,' Abhinav says. 'Plus, the needles hinder the growth of any flora on the forest floor, due to their antimicrobial properties.'

Meteorologists say the unusually early heat wave is a sign of what's to come as global warming continues, moving up in the calendar the extreme temperatures that Europe would previously have seen only in July and August. \"In some parts of Spain and France, temperatures are more than 10 degrees higher - that's huge - than the average for this time of year,\" said Clare Nullis, a spokesperson for the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva. In France, some 18 million people woke to heat wave alerts affecting about a third of the country today. </p><p>Forest fire warnings were issued from the Pyrenees in the south to the Paris region. Tourists dunked their feet in fountains near the Eiffel Tower or sought relief in the Mediterranean. A restaurant server rested under a lonely tree as the heat baked the port city of Marseille in southern France. France has introduced numerous measures to cope with extreme summer temperatures following a deadly heat wave in 2003 that killed about 15,000 people. Schoolchildren were allowed to stay home today in the 12 French regions in the southwest and west that were under the highest alert. The government stepped up efforts to ensure nursing home residents and other vulnerable populations could stay hydrated. Temperatures in France have mounted all week and were expected to hit over 104 F in the country's southwest today, and in the Paris region tomorrow. Nighttime temperatures are also unusually high, and the heat is stretching to normally cooler regions in Brittany and Normandy on the Atlantic Coast. Matthieu Sorel, a climatologist at national weather service Meteo France, told public broadcaster France-Info that temperatures are expected to break several records. He called the exceptionally early long stretch of hot weather a \"marker of climate change.\" Britain recorded its hottest day of the year so far, with the temperature reaching 82 F at Heathrow Airport near London just after midday. The Met Office weather service said the mercury could hit 93 F in southern England before a cooler, rainy weekend. The heat wave prompted organizers of the Royal Ascot horse racing event to relax their famously strict dress code, with men allowed remove their jackets and ties once the traditional carriage procession by members of the royal family had ended. Britain's Met Office said global warming has increased the average temperature of U.K. summers - and the likelihood of more extreme temperatures during hot spells and heat waves. \"Reaching 34 C during June is a rare, but not unprecedented, event in the historical climate records for the U.K.,\" said Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. \"But if it should happen this week, it would be notable that it would have occurred on three days during the last six Junes.\" Before 2017, the last three times the U.K. recorded June temperatures of 93.2 F or higher were in 1947, 1957 and 1976. In the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, people ran to reach trains heading for the nearest North Sea beach early Friday afternoon while others sought to cool off in boats and on stand-up paddle boards on one of the city's historic ring of canals. Germany's national weather service DWD predicted that the big sweat would continue over the weekend, as the heat moves eastward into central and Eastern Europe. The hot weather follows an unusually dry spring in Western Europe, with authorities ordering water to be rationed in northern Italy and parts of France and Germany. Experts say that climate change is already affecting rainfall patterns and evaporation rates across the region, with knock-on effects for agriculture, industry and wildlife. \"Heat waves are starting earlier,\" said Nullis, the U.N. weather agency spokesperson. \"They're becoming more frequent and more severe because of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are at record level. What we're witnessing today is, unfortunately, a foretaste of the future.\" She noted that extreme temperatures hit other parts of the globe in recent weeks. Nearly a third of Americans were under some form of heat advisory this week. During months of scorching temperatures, India and Pakistan saw the mercury scrape past 122 F in some places. The current heat wave in Europe started almost a week ago in Spain, where temperatures reached up to 109.4 F. Spanish authorities hope the weather will begin to cool again Sunday. The intense temperatures and a lack of rain has helped fuel wildfires across Spain, taxing firefighting capacity. The heat made itself felt also at a meeting in Madrid, where experts and policymakers gathered to discuss ways to tackle drought and the increasing spread of deserts across the globe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001817207d61bad8176af2b450000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65XT-NM41-DY7N-F0H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 17, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is clearly, you're there in Jerusalem, this is a rapidly developing situation. I understand even some rockets landed not far from where you are in Jerusalem, Israel's capital. Tell our viewers what's happening now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, this is an unprecedented surprise attack on Israel that the likes of which this country has not seen since the Yom Kippur War that happened 50 years ago almost to the day also happening on a Jewish holiday, the Simchat Torah today, it is Shabbat as well. But since 6:30 this morning, sirens have been blaring across Israel, including here in Jerusalem, we had our fair share of air raid sirens going off alerting of incoming rockets. We've heard of -- we heard several explosions, ourselves overhead of either interceptions or rockets making impact. You know, there were certainly some impacts made around Jerusalem. Sirens going off as far as Tel Aviv.</p><p>Now, it's been quieter in the last few hours. But just to give you a sense of the scale of the numbers, we hear from the Israeli military, at least 3,000 rockets have been fired so far today. This is we're approaching, I think hour 10 of this conflict, that 2021 war that lasted 11 days between Israel and the Hamas militants. But there were some 4300 rockets fired just in those 11 days. So we are approaching that number just in 12 hours or so.</p><p>And as we speak, I'm continuing to get alerts of sirens going off mostly in southern Israel. But what is more concerning, as you noted, is these infiltrations of militants. And as we speak, firefights are continuing on the streets in certain towns and villages, especially in southern Israel. We also understand from the Israeli military that certain bases were infiltrated as well as the border crossing. Army bases, we're talking about at least two army bases had militants infiltrating.</p><p>We are hearing harrowing reports from Israeli civilians who have been barricaded themselves in their bomb shelters, in their safe rooms, in their houses in southern Israel, as they believe there are militants firing right outside their door or even entering their apartments. These civilians have been going on the airwaves calling, pleading, begging for help. We, as you know, know that there are at least 40 Israelis who have been killed, more than 779 wounded. This is from a combination of rockets, rocket shrapnel, as well as from gunfire from that very graphic video that we saw that you shared. We also have claims from Hamas that they have captured a number of Israeli soldiers. There also some reports civilians have been captured as well.</p><p>We have no official confirmation of that from the Israeli officials. They have said nothing so far. But we have seen videos of what appears to be at least one Israeli soldier being pulled out of a tank by militants. We don't know the status of that Israeli soldier. The Israeli military already responding with multiple airstrikes targeting the Gaza Strip.</p><p>We do not yet know -- I have a confirmation of Palestinian casualties in the Gaza Strip. We also know the Israeli military is calling up 10s of 1000s of reservists because this is not just going to be the typical scenarios, you know airstrikes that we've seen on Gaza. They say that they're going to be sending soldiers to Israeli towns and villages in order to try to protect them from this militant infiltration. Hamas has called this operation the storm of Al-Aqsa, this is a reference of course to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, is also known as Temple Mount a place so holy to both Jews and Muslims here in Jerusalem.</p><p>But Wolf, what's really interesting about this, that there wasn't sort of a specific trigger point. Typically, before these sorts of conflicts, there's been a major raid potentially police entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, there's been a major capture of a militant, a high ranking militant of some kind. There has been rising levels of tensions here over the past, you could say year and a half, especially across the occupied West Bank, there have been some incidences at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. There's been some incidences along the separation fence between Gaza and Israel. But there was not a trigger point and that's why this is being seen as such an intelligence and security failure on behalf of Israel to not have seen this coming.</p><p>And just the fact that militants entered Israel, Wolf, by things like paragliding into Israel by land, by sea, and they are still on the ground in Israel engaging in firefights with Israeli soldiers as we speak. Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Hadas, all of us who have covered these respective conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, especially the last one, and I was there, are very familiar with Israel's very sophisticated air defense system, including the of course the Iron Dome, which has prevented a lot of these rockets and missiles from actually entering Israel and causing much damage. What happened to that system? Is it not working effectively today?</p><p>GOLD: It's working effectively. From what we understand, it is still working effectively. And several of the explosions that we heard here in Jerusalem were likely interceptions. But the thing is, people can still be injured by the shrapnel. Because what happens is, you know, a rocket comes in from Gaza, the Iron Dome launches its own rocket and they meet in the sky. And now obviously, the shrapnel coming from that will cause less damage than a direct rocket impact. But you can still get damaged to, you know, to people, to buildings as a result of that shrapnel. We don't have specific numbers on the eye Iron Dome and how it's doing. We've heard from the Israeli military that they are deploying more Iron Dome batteries across the country.</p><p>[09:05:05]</p><p>And to give you an idea of how Israel sees where it is right now. We have Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Israel is now in a state of war. And across the country, not just, you know, in Tel Aviv and south or the southern community, including in the north, schools, all educational institutions have been canceled tomorrow. Sunday for Israelis is a workday, all schools have been canceled, people are being ordered to stay alert, especially if you're within 80 kilometers or so of the border with Gaza to stay close to your bomb shelters. This is an unprecedented situation Israel is finding itself in, like we've been saying the likes, which they have not seen in 50 or so years.</p><p>There are also major concerns, Wolf, that there -- we could see further militant attacks across other parts of the country, because Hamas has called on all Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, across Jerusalem, even those who are citizens of Israel, Palestinian citizens of Israel, to take up arms against Israel. So far an important aspect of this the northern border, there are major concerns that Hezbollah or other militant groups who are aligned with Hamas may want to get involved. So far, that has stayed quiet. But the Israeli military saying they're preparing for that possibility.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, Hadas, stay safe over there, we will be in touch with you, obviously, throughout the day.</p><p>I want to go to CNN's Sam Kiley right now. He's joining us from London.</p><p>Sam, like me, you spent a lot of time reporting from Israel. Let's talk a little bit more about this fighting on the ground in southern Israel right now, just outside of Gaza, the border from Gaza into Israel is, as we all know, heavily protected. And this is a very rare development that has occurred. Give us your sense of the scope of this attack.</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is very remarkable. Clearly many months in the planning, Wolf. And indeed this time last year, more or less, I was in Jenin on the northern edge of the West Bank, where militants there was saying that something like this was in the planning, was coming, an event that would, in their hopes, set the flames for a forest fire that they hoped would engulf Israel. Now there hasn't been a response yet on the West Bank or indeed among the Israeli Arab population. But they will all be looking very closely, particularly at Arab media showing the battles that these Hamas militants have been able to engage with Israelis on Israeli territory, not occupied territory, but Israel proper, if you like. Now, this is very significant, indeed. Now they were bold. They came across in paragliders. They came across using the sea, according to the IDF. And of course, they probably tunneled in.</p><p>And we've seen video footage of them literally pouring through gaps in the fence. And on top of that, as Hadas mentioned there, they've even knocked out a merc of a tank, among the more formidable tanks on the planet, frankly, using a drone strike of this all. We've seen pioneered by the Ukrainians against Russian invaders in their war. Now, all of this adds up to a highly complex, highly coordinated campaign by Hamas, targeted, obviously to try to set off a concomitant uprising on the West Bank and perhaps among the IsraeliPalestinian citizens, that is ethnic Palestinians who are citizens of Israel, whom the Knesset said in 2020 had access to some 400,000 weapons according to a government analysis there. So, a potential for a conflagration there.</p><p>No sign of it yet, Wolf, but these infiltrations are catastrophic for Israel. They show a catastrophic failure of intelligence, they show a catastrophic failure of local defense. You and I have been on that fence, we've been across the fence into Gaza, these are heavily militarized set, kibitzers and towns, very heavy military and police presence. All of which seem to have been completely blindsided by this extraordinary attack by Hamas able to penetrate and get into and are continuing to fight. The Israeli defense forces are stressing here, Wolf, that there are ongoing firefights.</p><p>They even admitting that they've lost contact with one small military base in southern Israel. That is a catastrophic event that will no doubt be used by how Hamas to try to galvanize more violent responses elsewhere among their supporters. So far, of course, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon stayed out of this fight. Very unlikely that they would get involved until they saw a real strategic opportunity because they know the consequences for their country if they were to attack Israel in any significant way. But in the meantime, there'll be a lot of concern in Israel about an uprising on the West Bank and inside Israeli territory, inspired if you like, by these incursions, by effectively infantry.</p><p>Now, this infantry has been attacking a military sites but it's also been shooting random civilians. We've seen harrowing pictures of elderly people who've been gunned down at what appears to be a bus stop allegedly in (inaudible). That is you know, Wolf, is one of the big towns very close to the Gaza Strip. We've seen a civilians coming under fire from Hamas operatives driving around in pickup trucks that they've obviously managed to get hold of.</p><p>[09:10:12]</p><p>We've seen them pouring through the Gaza fence on motorcycles. So the numbers of militants that are in that area and beyond. And I think that's going to be very problematic for the IDF beyond. The smaller pockets that no doubt will have gone further into the Negev desert will be trying to get to targets in the big urban areas, not just up the obvious routes to Ashkelon and Ashdod but perhaps further towards Jerusalem. I think we've seen relatively early stages of what is clearly a very well planned, and very, very ambitious Hamas plot, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: I've been speaking to some of my sources in Israel, Sam, I know you have as well. And what really worries the Israeli military right now as this could escalate dramatically, especially if Hezbollah in southern Lebanon decides to start launching missiles against Haifa and other civilian areas in northern Israel right now. How worried should the Israelis be that this could escalate, not only attacks coming in from Gaza, but also from the occupied West Bank, but especially from Lebanon right now, from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been armed with a lot of missiles from Iran?</p><p>KILEY: Well, Hamas is also backed, as you know, Wolf, by as is the Paralympic Palestinian, Islamic Jihad on the West Bank, which is very powerful force on the West Bank, particularly in the north by Iran. So Iran will have a lot of levers to pull on this one. But and this isn't important but, that the IDF, or whatever they may say in public know in private, that there's essentially a kind of understanding between Hamas and Israel of kind of mutually assured destruction. Hamas does have, thanks to the Iranians, a really vast armory of rockets with which they could threaten every inch now of Israeli territory. The Israelis, of course, have the defense capability, perhaps to deal with a great deal of that.</p><p>And it made it very clear indeed to Hezbollah and its other elements within the Lebanon, that if they do get attacked in any serious way from the Lebanon by Hezbollah, that the Israelis will not hesitate in really returning. And I've used the phrase, it was once used to me by a very senior Israeli officer to the Stone Age, they would take out every single piece of infrastructure in the country. So, that is a very high stakes game. But the concern for the Israelis is the extent to which, as you point out there, it will escalate on the West Bank, and indeed, from Israeli territory itself. We've got large numbers of weapons in the Palestinian community within Israel, that in the recent past has been used in sort of Indonesia (ph) gang warfare, not for political ends but that could turn in theory.</p><p>There's no sign yet, though, of that occurring. It's very interesting too, that Hamas clearly hasn't coordinated this attack. At least doesn't appear to have been coordinated with any of its elements or allies on the West Bank, which is relatively quiet, although largely sealed off from Israeli territory, as we speak. But for now, I think the Israelis keeping a very close eye indeed, on Hezbollah.</p><p>And in all probability, Wolf, as you know, sending private messages in a method by third parties or through their own means of communication to Hezbollah set warning Hezbollah in no uncertain terms of the consequences of getting involved in any way in what is going on in Gaza. But that certainly is the kind of doomsday scenario that they will also be and we know have prepared for exactly that eventualities, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, that's what we're watching. We'll see what happens very closely. Sam Kiley, thank you very much. We'll stay in very close touch with you.</p><p>Right now, I want to bring in CNN Senior White House reporter MJ Lee and CNN National Security Reporter Natasha Bertrand.</p><p>MJ, let me start with you. Give us what the White House reaction has been. What is the White House saying this morning so far?</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, this is the latest from the White House. We know that President Biden was informed of the situation in Israel with -- by his advisors earlier this morning. We are still waiting on more that he has received a full briefing from his top officials. We know also that the President is going to address the situation that is unfolding later today. We don't know exactly in what format that address is going to come.</p><p>But whether it is a paper statement from the President or on camera remarks, we certainly expect that he is going to condemn the violence that is unfolding in the strongest possible terms. Officials also tell us that President Biden is expected to speak with his Israeli counterpart Prime Minister Netanyahu later today. It is impossible really to overstate the diplomatic ramifications here, Wolf, as you know very well over the course of many months, the U.S. and their Israeli counterparts have been working to try to broker some kind of deal, some kind of normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. And as a part of that deal, what was expected were some real concessions to the Palestinians. But right now, given the scene that you are seeing right now on the screen, it is sort of impossible to imagine that those efforts and those talks and the work that that has gone in into those normalization talks, that those would not be affected. It is hard to imagine that the Israelis would be OK with some of those concessions that had been discussed, to the Palestinians.</p><p>[09:15:37]</p><p>Now, I think it is also worth noting here from the White House this morning, that U.S. officials right now are being very, very careful to not weigh in at this moment in time on various specific intelligence that is coming in. Of course, we expect that U.S. officials are keeping a very close eye on the reports, they are in touch with their Israeli counterparts about casualties, about the reports that are coming in, about Israeli soldiers having been captured. But I can tell you here at the White House this morning, U.S. officials, again, are being very careful not to weigh in right now because they are still in the stages of really gathering the information and assessing the situation. And again, that goes for the president too. We expect that we will be told by the White House that he has received a full briefing in moments.</p><p>But for now, what we know is that he was informed of the situation. And sometime later today, we will hear from the President whether that is a paper statement or hearing him speak to the camera.</p><p>BLITZER: Right now there's no indication what time he might make a statement on cameras. Is that right?</p><p>LEE: Wolf, I have to be clear, we do expect to hear from the President but it could be in the form of a paper statement. So this is not necessarily going to be on camera remarks. We are just waiting on the White House to let us know when we will hear from the President. But we absolutely do expect that the President will address this situation. And of course, we'll be condemning the violence that we are seeing here in the strongest possible terms.</p><p>BLITZER: We will stay in very close touch with you MJ as well. Thank you very much.</p><p>I want to go to Natasha Bertrand right now. The U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin just released the statement, a formal statement of what's going on in Israel and Gaza. Tell our viewers what he said.</p><p>NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Wolf, so Secretary Austin, he did convene a meeting of senior leaders this morning, including the commander of U.S. Central Command, which obviously has responsibility for Israel in the region. And he said in his statement that quote, he is \"closely monitoring developments in Israel.\" He said that his commitment in the U.S. has commitment to Israel's right to defend itself remains unwavering. And he extends his condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in this apparent attack on civilians.</p><p>Now, really notably here in his statement, he says, over the coming days, the Department of Defense will work to ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and protect civilians from indiscriminate violence and terrorism. Now, that obviously raises questions about whether the U.S. is going to help replenish Israel's stockpiles of weaponry here, if this conflict does continue to escalate and if it keeps going. Now, in 2014, the U.S. did supply Israel with arms and weapons during a 50 day war in Gaza. And the Pentagon said at the time that Israel would be allowed to tap into local U.S. arms stockpile there to resupply it with grenades, as well as mortar rounds. Now, it should be noted that the U.S. has one of the biggest weapons stockpile and war reserves in Israel.</p><p>So the Israelis could feasibly tap into that if they get permission from the Pentagon from the U.S. here. So it remains to be seen how this is all going to play out. But I think the diplomatic ramifications as well are very serious at this point. As MJ noted, the IsraelSaudi normalization track could be in jeopardy here. And Saudi Arabia actually released a statement just this morning because they have been, of course, the main regional defender of the Palestinian cause, and they said that Saudi Arabia, quote, \"has repeatedly warned of the consequences of the deterioration of the situation as a result of the occupation as well as depriving the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights and of not holding systematic provocations against their holy site.\"</p><p>So clearly, the Saudis very immediately coming out here in support of the Palestinians. Of course, they have called for a cessation of the hostilities writ large. But the kind of -- both sides are kind of becoming trenched in their positions here already we're seeing. And we should note that the U.S. embassy is now sheltering in place. We just got that from the U.S. State Department.</p><p>So it remains to be seen how this continues over the coming hours depending on of course closely watching it. The diplomatic ramifications, those are being closely monitored as well. And again, Israel has access to that U.S. stockpile of weapons if the U.S. tells them that they can do so. The question of course being whether the U.S. is going to try of course to kind of calm the situation rather than fuel it further, Wolf.</p><p>[09:20:01]</p><p>BLITZER: It's interesting that there's a sheltering in place order now for U.S. diplomats and families at the U.S. embassy which is now in Jerusalem, it used to be Tel Aviv. It was moved during the Trump administration to Jerusalem. So clearly they're worried about additional attacks in Jerusalem itself. Is that right?</p><p>BERTRAND: So the State Department released a statement from the U.S. embassy saying that they are closely monitoring the security situation as a result of rockets fired from Gaza across southern and central Israel, including, of course, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and the infiltration of Hamas militants. And they said that the U.S. embassy is aware that there have been casualties, of course, as a result of these incidents. So they are taking all necessary precautions here to make sure of course, that U.S. personnel are safe. And they note, Wolf, in their security alert here that of course, U.S. government personnel continued to be prohibited from any kind of travel to Gaza in areas within seven miles of Gaza.</p><p>But as of right now, they are sheltering in place. Of course, it is a very volatile, unpredictable situation. And the top priority of course for the State Department for the U.S. is the security of its citizens and its personnel there.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, we're told that sirens have been going off throughout all the major populated areas of Israel. So they're obviously watching all of this unfold. Natasha, standby we'll get back to you.</p><p>CNN's breaking news coverage of this unprecedented situation in Israel. We'll continue right after a quick break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:25:13]</p><p>BLITZER: We're continuing our breaking news. Coverage this hour, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is now underscoring U.S. support for Israel after this morning's surprise attack by Hamas that has killed at least 40 people and wounded hundreds of others. Secretary Austin met with top U.S. military officials just a little while ago including the commander of the U.S. military Central Command.</p><p>We're also waiting to hear directly from President Biden. The White House has issued a statement condemning this attack on Israel by Hamas. CNN Military Analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling is joining us right now.</p><p>General Hertling, thanks so much for joining us, sir. We're watching all of this unfold. What's a bit surprising to me, this looks like it was a major surprise that the Israeli military intelligence community was caught off guard. But what's your sense?</p><p>LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I believe that intelligence was certainly lapse this morning, Wolf. It was problematic in terms of the kinds of things that Hamas has been doing with regard to operational security, which is hidden a lot of the intelligence from the Israeli Intel forces, and even from the U.S. as well, this is something that should have been seen. There was a comment issued by the Shah of Iran, I'm sorry, the Supreme Leader of Iran a few days ago saying that Palestinian forces were ready for these kinds of things. This is something that should have been picked up. And given the multi domain operations, we're talking about air, land and sea is, as Israel has reported, and the amount of conventional activity, as well as the reports of denial of services in the cyber community.</p><p>These are the kinds of things that you normally pick up before an operation, and it just wasn't done this time. This is very different than things we've seen Hamas do in the past.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, the Israelis are going to have to do a major look back, a major reassessment of what went wrong, because normally, they would be well prepared for this kind of surprise attack. But clearly, they weren't. This time, we're seeing the destruction in major populated areas of Israel not far from Gaza, whether in Ashkelon or Ashdod or Rehovot. And it looks like the success of these rockets and missiles coming in has caused an extensive and enormous amount of damage and casualties at the same time, which is also surprising as you well know, General Hertling, given Israel's very sophisticated air defense system, right?</p><p>HERTLING: Yes, it's true Wolf. And I've been listening to the commentary about the Iron Dome. And yes, that is a very good weapon system, it's very good at protecting the citizens of Israel. But when you have a massive attack, like we've seen this morning, with anywhere between two and 3000, missiles and rockets coming in, no matter how good your air defense system is, it can't knock down all of them. And as Hadas earlier mentioned, you're not only getting the effects from missiles that strike, but you're also getting the effects from those that are broken up in the air and then come down and cause the kinds of fires like we're seeing on the screen right now.</p><p>But the amazing thing about this attack by Hamas this morning, is the fact that they were able to have so much conventional artillery, ballistic missiles, cyber, air, land and sea, as the Israelis have said, all synchronized into a fight. This is going to cause the Israeli defense forces some real challenges in the next few days. And as other reporters have begun to say, we don't know who else might join in the fight. We've already seen the support by Iran, there had been some combat comments out of Russia saying they support Hamas in these actions. We don't know what Hezbollah in Lebanon is going to do, what's going to happen on the West Bank, or even from inside the State of Israel with the Arab and Palestinian populations that are spread throughout the country. This is going to be different than what Israel has faced in the past. And it's fascinating that it comes on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War of '73.</p><p>BLITZER: And which was a major surprise as well and caused an intelligence failure at that time when Syria and Egypt launched a surprise attack against Israel on Yom Kippur. That was exactly -- almost exactly 50 years ago to the day. And as a result of that, there was a lot of Israeli retaliatory action, and we all know what happened.</p><p>I suspect there's going to be a very significant Israeli military response in Gaza and maybe elsewhere to what's happening right now. Would you agree?</p><p>HERTLING: I certainly would, Wolf. And what comes to my mind is we're -- we've got a conventional Israeli defense force against a complex attack by Hamas. They are taking vehicles.</p><p>[09:30:02]</p><p>They are conducting conventional rocket attacks. So, it reminds me and I studied this, the 1982 Israeli war against Lebanon, where you had a conventional force going against terrorists, against fighters supported by foreign governments.</p><p>So, when you're talking from a military perspective as you see some of these Palestinians climbing on top of the Merkava tank, this is going to be challenging because it's a swarm of activity from various directions against the conventional force. I think Hamas and Iran especially is learning a lot from what Russia has been doing in Ukraine -- conducting not only conventional attacks, but terrorist and rocket attacks against the civilian population. So, this is just the emerging of a new style of warfare that I think Hamas is learning from their partners in Iran who are taking it from the partners in Russia.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. This looks to me like it's only the beginning. This is going to be a prolonged war that is about to take place between Israel and Hamas and Gaza. Maybe if other Palestinian military groups whether in Lebanon or the West Bank get involved, this thing could escalate dramatically causing enormous amounts of casualties on all sides to be sure. But also complicating the U.S. mission in the region right now which in the last several months has been to try normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. That doesn't look like it's going anywhere right now.</p><p>HERTLING: No, it certainly doesn't. And, Wolf, I'll remind you and I know you know this. We do not -- the U.S. does not have an ambassador in Israel right now. There has been one that has been nominated, but he hasn't been approved. So, we have the charge in the embassy in Israel sort of connecting ourselves with this operation.</p><p>Now, the Defense Department has a lot of people there and they will get the information. But given the current situation not only in Israel, but in our own government, we are going to be challenged to react to this given the chaos that's going on in Congress right now. We don't have a leader in Congress to bring things to the floor about what we might do as a nation to support Israel.</p><p>Now, there are certain things in effect that will continue on. But this is going be very challenging not only for the various militaries of the world, but also for the governments that deal with this while we're dealing with several other crisis. I would suggest the timing of this attack by Hamas is certainly not surprising. They know when to take advantage of these kinds of things.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. Certainly -- it certainly looks like that as well. Very strong statements coming in from senior U.S. officials including the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. Let me read that one sentence. He said, \"Our commitment to Israel's right to defend itself remains unwavering, and I extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this abhorrent attack on civilians.\"</p><p>I suspect we're going to be getting more statements like that from senior U.S. officials in the hours ahead. I assume you agree.</p><p>HERTLING: I certainly do agree, Wolf. And what -- I think the American people have to understand too is the size of the Israeli nation. It's certainly not very big. The population is significantly less than the United States.</p><p>So, when we talk about casualties or those who have been abducted it seems like relatively small numbers to U.S. citizens but that's a huge percentage of the Israeli population. When you're talking 40, 50, a hundred deaths and many people being captured that's very significant. It's the equivalent of a 9/11 attack on the United States where we lost thousands of people.</p><p>So, this is certainly a dynamic that we've got to continue to consider and how challenging this is for Israel, the state of Israel with enemies on all sides. And the fact that there are going to be more and more damages and certainly more and more casualties.</p><p>This is going to be a tough one, Wolf. There have been -- as you know, there have been many wars inside of Israel and outside addressing their adversaries. But this one I believe along with you that there is going to be a lot of casualties in this.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. The Israelis are going to retaliate big time. There's no doubt about that. Very quickly before I let you go, General Hertling. In recent years, Israel was brought into the U.S. Military Central Command which deals with all of the countries in the Middle East. In the past a lot of the Arab countries didn't want Israel to be part of the central command, but they have now been brought in to the Military Central Command taken out of the European Command.</p><p>What does that mean? What does that mean practically in a warlike situation like this?</p><p>HERTLING: Well, it's interesting, Wolf, because I was part of European Command when Israel was still part of what we call footprint. So, I made many visits to Israel. We had soldiers in Israel. We supported them at different times with air defense equipment and other troops.</p><p>[09:35:01]</p><p>We had great relationships. When you're talking about a shift, and this was part of the debate, shifting Israel, the nation, from European Command to Central Command, it was during a time when Central Command was pretty busy in other parts of the Middle East and all the countries that are part of that command's footprint. So, you know, there is no permanently stationed forces in the Middle East other than in Kuwait. So, this is one of those kinds of things where if there is a requirement for support from the U.S. military it would be difficult.</p><p>Now certainly the Navy and the Air Force can support any kind of operation if they are requested to. I don't think that's going to happen. But again, it has to do with the footing of the U.S. military in the Middle East and especially in the Levant of Israel and Lebanon.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, it's a whole new world right -- out there in the Middle East right now. We're watching it unfold. Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, thank you very much for your expertise.</p><p>So, we are continuing to monitor all the breaking news developments in Israel right now. We will have a life report from Jerusalem when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:40:14]</p><p>BLITZER: We are continuing to follow the breaking news out of Israel right now. Here in Washington, the Pentagon is vowing to ensure that Israel has -- quote -- \"what it needs to defend itself.\" That in a formal statement from the defense secretary. All of this after Hamas militants from Gaza launched a surprise attack on Israel earlier this morning. At least 40 people, we're told, have been killed. Hundreds have been wounded.</p><p>President Biden has been briefed on the situation. He's expected to speak with the prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu soon.</p><p>In Gaza, some Palestinians are stocking up on supplies and fleeing their homes. The Israeli military is carrying out airstrikes in response to the attack by Hamas. I expect they will escalate in the coming hours.</p><p>We want to get right to CNN's Hadas Gold. She's joining us from Jerusalem right now. Hadas, I am told by some sources I was speaking to earlier in Jerusalem, the sirens went off in Jerusalem probably not far from where you are right now. In the past when there have been attacks from Gaza, they've gone into Ashdod and Ashkelon, Israeli towns not far from Gaza. How unusual is it that there was an attack on Jerusalem itself?</p><p>GOLD: And not just one attack, we had at least five or six rounds of sirens going off and that is very unusual. Because you are right, typically, in these types of conflicts Jerusalem is sort of left out of the equation. In 2021, during that 11-day war, Jerusalem got one or two rounds of sirens and rocket attacks but otherwise nothing because of -- Jerusalem is, of course, the home of the al-Aqsa mosque compound. Also known as Temple Mount to the Jews, a place so holy for so many. But today we had several rounds of air-raid sirens. We heard several explosions in the sky. Those could have been interceptions or impacts by rockets. These were just several of the more than 3,000 rockets that have been fired thus far since 6:30 a.m. this morning. That number is actually probably likely much higher just in the last few hours.</p><p>In comparison in 2021 and the entire 11-day war, Wolf, 4,300 rockets were fired in the span of 11 days. We've had 3,000. We have not even hit 12 hours of this conflict. But even more concerning is those infiltration of Palestinian militants as we speak.</p><p>In addition to the rockets continuing to be fired from Gaza into Israel they are continuing firefights in Israeli villages and towns between Palestinian militants who have made their way into Israel fighting with Israeli security. We also have reports of Israeli soldiers who have been captured. Potentially also Israeli civilians who have been captured.</p><p>No confirmation yet from the Israeli military about any soldiers or civilians being kidnapped or captured. But we have seen videos from Hamas saying that they have, for example, pulled an Israeli soldier out of a tank. We know for fact some Israeli military vehicles have been commandeered and taken into Gaza.</p><p>In terms of death toll, 40 Israelis and potentially others have been killed. More than 770 wounded as a result of combination from rockets as well as militant gunfire. And we are getting new numbers in from the Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza. They are saying as a result of Israeli action 198 deaths and more than 1,600 injuries.</p><p>We do not know yet from those numbers how many were civilians, how many were militants. But we know the Israeli military undertaking airstrikes as we speak against what they say are Hamas targets in Gaza. You know that we've seen civilians in Gaza fleeing their homes, trying to take shelter in U.N. schools.</p><p>Unlike many Israelis who have access to bomb shelters in Gaza, those civilians do not usually have access to fortified bomb shelters. So, they are very much at risk there. And there is this -- the expectation that this will be a very severe response from the Israeli military.</p><p>They are not taking this lightly. They are calling this a state of war. And, Wolf, Israel has not seen such an unprecedented surprise attack in 50 years since the Yom Kippur War 1970 that happened almost 50 years ago to the day. Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Has the Israeli military activated its reserve forces, the reservists? I think that's a significant development. I assume they have but tell us what you know.</p><p>GOLD: They have activated the reservists and the Israeli military telling us that they have called up tens of thousands of reservists. And what's interesting is also those reservists, some of those reservists who said they would not heed the call to serve because of the ongoing protest against judicial overhaul, we've heard from some of those protest organizers saying they will be serving in this case, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: So, they're going to the front lines right now, all those reservists. This is a huge, huge development in Israel right now. Hadas, thank you very much. Stay safe over there. We will have much more in the breaking news in Israel when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:49:05]</p><p>BLITZER: We are continuing to follow the breaking news out of Israel right now. We are standing by as President Biden, we're told, is expected to speak soon with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At least 40 people are dead. Hundred more are wounded in Israel after Hamas launched attacks on Israel earlier this morning.</p><p>A warning, the start of this next video may be very disturbing to some. It's from the Israel Defense Forces which they claim shows counterattacks on Hamas in Gaza. We also just learned minutes ago that the Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 198 Palestinians were killed in Gaza this morning.</p><p>I want to get right to Robin Wright, contributing writer for the \"New Yorker\" magazine, who has also written a number of important books in the Middle East, knows the subject well. Robin, thanks so much for joining us. What's your reaction to the breaking news of this Hamas attack on Israel that was launched earlier today?</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>ROBIN WRIGHT, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORKER: Well, it reflects something that you and I have learned since we both covered the 1973 war 50 years ago. And that is that the greatest challenges to Israel since that last conventional war has been from extremist groups, Islamic extremist groups.</p><p>We have seen in -- not only in Hamas in the West Bank, but we have seen on the border with Israel -- border of Syria and the borders with Lebanon, that the extremist militias have become increasingly well- armed, very ambitious in their challenges to Israel, and that this kind of conflict is not likely to do anything to bring a resolution, peace, in the kind of conflict that has been sporadic between these forces in Israel for a very long time now.</p><p>BLITZER: You know, what jumps out at me, Robin, I'm anxious to get your thoughts, clearly already the Israelis say a few thousand rockets from Gaza have been launched against various targets in Israel. So clearly, they have been preparing for this. They've got a stockpile of rockets and missiles ready to go. So, this operation must have been in the works for some time and it doesn't look like the Israelis tried to pre-empt or do anything in advance. Maybe they weren't aware. But it looks like another intelligence failure which similarly occurred 50 years ago during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.</p><p>WRIGHT: Indeed, it did. I remember being in the Beirut airport and a woman whispering to me, the Egyptians have just crossed the Suez Canal, and the world was stunned. I think the world is stunned again.</p><p>What is really striking about this operation is just how sophisticated and ambitious Hamas is. We've seen these groups come from the underground, going to government jobs, build up arsenals that can fight Israel in real terms and lead to the deaths of hundreds and the injuries of thousands over time.</p><p>This is not likely to end any time soon. And, as I said, the danger is that it doesn't do anything to resolve the basic flash points that have haunted this region for now 80 years.</p><p>BLITZER: Do you think that it is going to escalate, there are going to be attacks from southern Lebanon, from Hezbollah, which is providing -- which gets a lot of weapons from Iran as we all know and maybe even from the West Bank? What do you think?</p><p>WRIGHT: You know, I have doubts at this stage that Hezbollah will get engaged. It has its own agenda. It doesn't really want to get in a war the likes of which it fought in 2006 that lasted 34 days and led to billions in damage and hundreds of deaths.</p><p>So not yet. But it depends on how this plays out. Like what actions Israel takes, what happens to Hamas, the kind of death toll.</p><p>I think they are for now, even though they are both trained, armed, funded by Iran, they are different movements in their own ways. Hezbollah is Shiite. Hamas is Sunni. They are common ideological bedfellows but have different agendas when it comes to Israel. They want to fight their own fights, not each other's at this stage.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, good point. Robin, we will stay in close touch with you. Thank you very much. Robin Wright there with excellent analysis, thank you.</p><p>The U.S. embassy has issued an advisory for all American staff workers in Jerusalem right now, in response to the violence in Israel and Gaza. The response from Washington and it is a significant response, we'll share it with you when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:57:54]</p><p>BLITZER: We're following the breaking news. The U.S. embassy in Jerusalem has now issued a shelter in place for U.S. embassy personnel amid the ongoing violence, the war that is unfolding right now, in Israel, and Gaza. Let's go to CNN's Natasha Bertrand. She is watching all of this unfold. What you are hearing, Natasha?</p><p>NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Wolf. So, the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem is issuing a warning to personnel there. Telling them to shelter in place. Saying that the U.S. embassy there is closely monitoring the security situation as a result of rockets that have been fired from Gaza across southern and central Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and the infiltration of Hamas militants. Obviously, the top priority for the State Department is the safety and security of U.S. personnel and U.S. citizens in the country as all of this unfolds.</p><p>Now, the statement also goes on to say that the U.S. embassy is aware that there have been casualties as a result of these incidents, and says that U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. Now -- as of right now, obviously, this is a very fast-moving situation. It remains unclear just how long the shelter in place is going to remain in effect or if the U.S. embassy is going to try to take steps to remove personnel from Jerusalem. But at this point, they are telling personnel to stay in the embassy, because as we have seen, Wolf, there have been attacks in Jerusalem, which doesn't happen very often, but this is clearly a source of major concern right now for the State Department. Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Has the State Department, Natasha, yet, released a statement, advising Americans to avoid travel to Israel?</p><p>BERTRAND: Well, they say that U.S. government personnel as of now, they continue to be prohibited from travel to Gaza, of course, and areas within seven miles of Gaza. But at this point, we have not seen any kind of security alert come out from the State Department just yet, urging Americans to avoid travel to Israel.</p><p>However, you have to imagine that that is going to come soon. This is a very fast-moving, volatile situation, seeing a lot of violence play out, and it's clear that the situation is not yet contained. So, until it is -- obviously, the U.S. is going to be urging citizens to remain vigilant and to stay out of these areas, if they can, where all of this is unfolding, Wolf.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2023100712CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69BP-YNX1-F072-X18C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 7, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>ST000CUUD</classCode><className>HAMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000CURX</classCode><className>HEZBOLLAH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Terrorist</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hamas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Israel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lebanon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iran</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ukraine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gaza</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Saudi Arabia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lloyd Austin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jerusalem</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Benjamin Netanyahu</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Palestinian</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jerusalem</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ashdod</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ashkelon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Suez Canal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hezbollah</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Shiite</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sunni</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tel Aviv</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

United Kingdom hospitals have warned of a surge in heat-related admissions and train operators have told passengers to expect cancellations. <br/>The highest recorded temperature in Britain was 38.7C (101.7F) recorded in Cambridge on July 25, 2019. <br/>The Irish meteorological office issued a weather warning for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday with 'exceptionally warm weather'. <br/>A high of 32C was possible on Monday, the service said, just short of Ireland's record high 33.3C (92F) set in 1887. <br/>This comes as the worst drought in more than 70 years[2] reduced Italy's longest river, the Po, to little more than a trickle in places, with temperatures expected to rise next week. <br/>Across the Mediterranean, authorities said one person was found dead in northern Morocco as forest fires raged. Authorities also evacuated hundreds of people from more than a dozen villages in northwestern Morocco. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/15/hundreds-evacuated-from-homes-as-wildfires-spread-in-france\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/15/hundreds-evacuated-from-homes-as-wildfires-spread-in-france</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/7/14/farmers-watch-crops-wither-amid-italys-worst-drought-in-70-years\">https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/7/14/farmers-watch-crops-wither-amid-italys-worst-drought-in-70-years</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

They may seem to be places buzzing with activity and full of sounds. But inside the rainforest the animal life may tell a different story of damage to their environment through a quieter soundscape.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the University of Maryland, College Park, investigated how the acoustics of a forest can be a cost-effective indicator of its health.</p><p>Danielle Rappaport, then a doctoral student at the University of Maryland and now co-founder of the Amazon Investor Coalition, led this research beginning in 2016. She and her team combined acoustic data collected under the forest canopy with tree height measurements from aircraft flights and space-based observations of logging or fires from Landsat satellites. Landsat is a long-running partnership between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey.</p><p>In forests that were burned multiple times, recordings of animal noises were quieter than in intact forest locations, leaving gaps in the soundscape and indicating that species that had been present before were now gone. As Rappaport ventured into these previously burned parts of the rainforest to place the recorders for the scientific measurements, she said she could feel the differences.</p><p>\"I've been working with tropical forests all my professional life,\" Rappaport said. \"I've never quite been to a forest that was this devastated. It's something that you can smell, you can hear, it's everywhere.\"</p><p>On the first day of trekking through a forest that had been burned five times throughout the study period, Rappaport's field assistant temporarily quit due to the oppressive nature of the environment. The environment was harsher in forests that had been burned several times, Rappaport said.</p><p>The forest undergrowth was thick and difficult to navigate, and insects such as sweat bees surrounded her. However, these on-the-ground differences in the animal environment aren't observable when forests are measured from space, where the regrown canopy appears almost as green and complete as before the fires.</p><p>Instead of choosing specific times of day to target acoustic signatures of well-known species, Rappaport and her team chose to place and leave recorders in degraded forests for extended periods to gather a fuller, species-inclusive repertoire of sound. When analyzed together, these recordings revealed unique ecological fingerprints, or soundscapes. Species of frogs, insects, birds, and primates each occupy sound space in different ways - ways that enable biodiversity and ecological systems to be analyzed without scientists being physically present.</p><p>\"You can think of the animal soundscape as an orchestra,\" Rappaport said. \"The flutes occupy a different time of day and a different frequency band than the oboes.\"</p><p>Her team developed a new way to quantify forest health by analyzing soundscapes with a network theory approach. This means that by using the digital soundscape as a whole - the orchestral music - Rappaport's team could understand the relationship between the level of impacts and the community of species - the character and quality of the instruments playing - without requiring all the species to be identified.</p><p>\"It's one more step towards understanding the sound community without needing to know which individual species are there because we're starting to listen for them in ways that help us connect the coordinated production of sound, even if we don't know who's making the noise,\" said Doug Morton, an Earth scientist at NASA Goddard and Rappaport's PhD advisor.</p><p>Knowing where to place the recorders, and how to interpret the diversity of soundscapes, required additional data from lidar measurements taken between 2013 and 2016 and the past 33 years of Landsat satellite records.</p><p>\"Our ability to analyze decades of history through the Landsat data record provided a strong backbone to this work,\" Rappaport said.</p><p>The Landsat program, which marked its 50th anniversary in space this July, allowed the scientists to see back in time. The scientists created a timeline of Amazon forest cover for the past three decades, and used the history of forest degradation to determine where to place the recorders. With these data, the team sampled sounds from locations with varying levels of fire and logging activity.</p><p>Lidar measurements explain the diversity of soundscapes by providing a three-dimensional representation of the forest's canopy. Airplanes flew over the forested areas, collecting tree height data that helped determine the layers of the forest between the canopy and the ground.</p><p>\"That three-dimensional picture still carries a memory of some of those historic disturbances,\" Morton said.</p><p>These three quantitative datasets layered together helped Rappaport and her team better understand the ecosystem structure of Amazon forests impacted by human activity.</p><p>They found that repeatedly burned forests had less biodiversity than forests that were logged once. For example, with each additional forest fire, the soundscape becomes quieter. After logging, the forest soundscape suggested a capacity to recover animal diversity.</p><p>Rappaport and her team hope this new technique will open up a new understanding of forest biodiversity that is threatened by fires and logging, and about the relationship between biodiversity and carbon stored in Amazon forests over time. Soundscapes provide a relatively cost-efficient and rapid means of estimating levels of biodiversity in complex and generally species-rich tropical environments.</p><p>\"Sound data add a new dimension to our understanding of the Amazon,\" Morton said. \"I'm fascinated by what we still have to learn.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202208120518052281</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664P-R631-JC3D-Y1DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 12, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>scientists-use-acoustic-soundscapes-and-eo-data-to-assess-health-of-the-amazon</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Lighter winds and cooler temperatures slowed the Fawn Fire as it moves toward the shores of California's largest human-made lake and away from populated areas north of the city of Redding, allowing crews to increase containment to 35 percent, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said in a statement. The fire at one point threatened 9,000 buildings, but the number dropped to 2,340 yesterday. </p><p>Light rain was in the forecast for today. Fire officials said crews will begin taking advantage of the calmer weather to conduct back burns near the lake to expand the control lines, the Record Searchlight reported . \"We're going to hold it. It's going to be done this week,\" Bret Gouvea, chief of Cal Fire's Shasta-Trinity unit, said at a community meeting Saturday night. Initial assessments found that 131 homes and other buildings had burned, Cal Fire said. That number is likely to change as teams go street by street surveying the destruction. Authorities have arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of starting the blaze, which erupted Wednesday and grew explosively in hot and gusty weather in the region about 200 miles northeast of San Francisco. Alexandra Souverneva, of Palo Alto, was charged Friday with felony arson to wildland with an enhancement because of a declared state of emergency in California, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said. Souverneva pleaded not guilty. She is also suspected of starting other fires in Shasta County and throughout the state, Bridgett said. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf. The Fawn Fire has charred more than 13 square miles of heavy timber. It's the latest destructive blaze to send Californians fleeing this year. Fires have burned more than 3,750 square miles so far in 2021, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures. Those fires include a pair of big forest blazes burning for more than two weeks in the heart of giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. More than 1,700 firefighters battled the KNP Complex Fires, which covered 70 square miles by yesterday. Nearby, the Windy Fire grew significantly Saturday as it made uphill runs and winds blew embers that ignited spot fires. The blaze, ignited by lightning on Sept. 9, has scorched 122 square miles of trees and brush on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia National Forest. Containment shrank from 5 percent to 2 percent yesterday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017c2781d47eab7ebfb177030000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63XR-B4W1-DY7N-F186-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 27, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

My name is Tony Cheng. I am the director of the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute (CFRI) and a professor in the Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado.</p><p>CFRI is part of the Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes established by Congress in 2004 through the Southwest Forest Health and Wildfire Prevention Act (PL 108-317), along with sister institutes in Arizona and New Mexico. The Institutes were created in response to large and severe forest wildfires that burned throughout the American West during the 2000 and 2002 fire seasons. Our mission is to work collaboratively with fellow researchers, land managers, their interested and affected stakeholders, and partners to co-develop, transfer, and apply locally-relevant science to increase the resilience of forests to wildfire and other stressors. We work across all land ownerships and management jurisdictions in Colorado and have reach across the Interior West through many collaborative partnerships.</p><p>To preface my testimony, America's forests are a well-spring of values, services and goods.</p><p>Forests are essential to the livelihoods and cultural and spiritual traditions of Indigenous peoples who inhabited and stewarded the land for generations. Forests continue to contribute to the well-being of millions of Americans. The hard numbers tell only part of the story:</p><p>* Forests comprise 765 million acres or over 31% of the total land surface of the U.S. Of this figure, nonfederal lands (Tribal, state and local government, and private) comprise 69%, with federal lands comprising the remaining 31%.1</p><p>* Approximately 125.5 million people in the U.S., nearly 39% of the population, receive their surface drinking water from forest lands2.</p><p>* U.S. forests, wood products and urban trees collectively offset annual CO2 emissions by nearly 15%3.</p><p>* Forests host a rich diversity of species that have co-evolved with forests over millenia that have intrinsic value in and of themselves4.</p><p>* An estimated 3.7 million family forestland owners who collectively own more than 250 million acres of forest lands5.</p><p>* Privately-owned forests support approximately 2.5 million jobs, $99 billion in annual payroll, and $200 billion in annual contribution to Gross Domestic Product. Privatelyowned forests are central economic drivers in many rural communities across the country 6.</p><p>* Forests are vital to an outdoor recreation economy that accounts for approximately $454 billion annually in Gross Domestic Product and approximately 5 million jobs annually7, many of which are in rural communities adjacent to federal public lands.</p><p>Despite the societal and ecological value of America's forests, public investments into forest conservation and stewardship pale in comparison to their value, especially in light of the threats to forests resiliency due to land use change pressures, the legacy of historic forest and fire management approaches, and increasingly prevalent droughts and warming temperatures that are leading to increases in wildfire, insect outbreaks and other forest mortality agents.</p><p>Promoting resilient forests has been a primary goal of the Farm Bill for the past 30 years. I will frame my testimony with an emphasis on the changes in forest resiliency resulting from wildfires in many forests of the Western U.S. Fire is essential to rejuvenating many forest types across the U.S.8 As such, fire is not necessarily an indicator of an unhealthy forest and is also a critical management tool to sustain forest resilience. However, following a global trend, western U.S. forests are experiencing growing frequency, size and severity of wildfires, the many causes of which have been well-documented, such as: drier and hotter conditions that have extended fire seasons to nearly year-round; large increases in human sources of ignitions that can start a fire in more places and at more times of the year; and more available fuel to burn in the form of forest vegetation as well as built infrastructure9.</p><p>Not only have fires become larger and more severe over the past 20 years, but many states are witnessing a growing proportion of their forests being converted to non-forest conditions following fire. This conversion is due in part to the size and severity of these fires that are eliminating living trees with viable seed sources, but also due to increasingly unfavorable climatic conditions that are inhibiting tree regeneration post-fire - and may not return to forest without investments in tree seeding or planting10. The conversion of forests to nonforest condition has cascading effects into everyday life for years to come for people and communities not just within close proximity to the fire, but also those downstream of these fires. This forest conversion is a clear indicator that western forests are facing a resilience debt into the future.</p><p>For example, in Colorado, the headwaters of three major river systems - the Colorado, Platte and Rio Grande - originate from national forest lands. Early indications suggest snow falling on recently burnt forests at risk of converting to nonforest are now melting earlier and more rapidly11,12, impacting the reliability and sustainability of water being delivered to downstream communities and agricultural producers. In the semi-arid West, this situation magnifies ongoing stressors placed on these river systems. Further, summer rains that were previously absorbed by forested hillslopes have potential to generate large debris flows from burned areas, oftentimes many years after the fire and with catastrophic consequences to people and high repair or replace costs to infrastructure, like roads and bridges, that are borne by local 3 governments and communities for many years after the fire13,14. Municipal water providers such as Denver Water continue to spend funds to clear out water intake facilities from sediment produced by forest wildfires that burned over 20 years ago, but have not regrown.</p><p>Investments in and updates to forest management programs and activities to mitigate potential forest loss from fire have not kept pace with changes in fire regimes and the changing vulnerability of forest conditions. As one GAO report from 2015 noted, on-the-ground managers expenditure of limited funds tends to result in so-called \"random acts of mitigation\" that are not always strategically located or not completed due to funding shortfalls and are, therefore, not impactful on altering wildfire outcomes. Some research studies show that incomplete forest fuel reduction projects can make fires worse due to the untreated woody biomass left after the tree thinning component of projects are complete. Furthermore, forest density reduction and woody biomass removal projects are not always connected to wildfire response or with post-fire forest recovery. Fuel reduction, wildfire response and post-fire authorities, programs, and funding evolved independently over time and in response to environmental and socio-economic conditions from the 20th century - some dating back to the 1920's. The result is that programs that need to work together to foster resilient forests and corresponding communities oftentimes operate in silos. A case can be made that these programs and their corresponding investments need updating and brought into closer alignment.</p><p>Drawing upon the ongoing applied work CFRI and the other SWERIs are engaged in and upon research examining the effectiveness of forest and wildland fire policy from colleagues such as Dr. Courtney Schultz and the Public Lands Policy Group at Colorado State University15, I offer four areas where programs could benefit from closer alignment and increased investment.</p><p>First, there is a need and opportunity for plan and execute forest mitigation actions that are explicitly connected to, and reinforce, fire response and post-fire recovery actions. Presently, these program areas are not always clearly connected at the planning or execution stages. Direction, investments, and incentives are lacking for managers - alongside their interested and affected stakeholders, and community-connected partners (i.e., local fire protection districts, municipal and agricultural water supply entities, non-profit watershed councils, etc.) - to collaboratively plan and enact these connected actions across jurisdictions and landownerships as an integrated system for forest wildfire resilience.</p><p>More recent authorities, programs and funding streams provide a ready foundation to promote this integrated system, an example being the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) and the Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Program. While these programs primarily emphasize wildfire mitigation through forest density and woody biomass reduction actions, there is potential to more explicitly connect these actions to wildfire response and post-fire recovery priority areas and actions. These can be accomplished through the application and integration of geospatial analytical and planning tools, such as the Potential Operational Delineations and Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment developed by Forest Service R&amp;D's Rocky Mountain Research Station and deployed by CFRI and other entities.</p><p>Broadening and increasing investment into these programs to incentivize strategic, coordinated planning and implementation linking mitigation, response and recovery actions would represent a more holistic, integrated systems approach to the forest wildfire problem in the western US. Furthermore, expanding the geographic coverage and modifying eligibility requirements of these programs could expand the reach of CFLRP, Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Partnership, and similar competitive funding programs supporting collaborative natural resource stewardship to under-served and rural areas, beyond landscapes with high densities of high property values occurring at the wildland-urban interface. Many of these under-served, rural areas rely on forests that are vulnerable to fire for domestic and agricultural water supplies, and employment, income, and subsistence opportunities associated with forest resources.</p><p>Second, in order to achieve the goals from the first recommendation, investments are necessary to develop and sustain collaborative capacity and resilience. Local collaborative initiatives involving a range of forest and fire managers from across jurisdictions, interested and affected stakeholders, and community-connected partners require their own organizing resources and capacity14. They are often poorly funded and lack necessary staffing, and yet carry the burden of recruiting and keeping a diversity of people and organizations at the table, and making progress15. Establishing and sustaining stand-alone funding for collaborative capacity and community-based stewardship engagement would help overcome these challenges. Especially important would be to structure funding programs that acknowledge the different \"stages of readiness\" across collaborative groups. Current funding programs tend to be biased towards groups already at an advanced stage of readiness and have been successful at procuring and administering funds, coming up with the funds necessary to meet match requirements, and handling complex federal grant accounting and reporting requirements. Scaling funding programs and associated requirements to different stages of readiness could help build a pipeline of local community-based collaboratives gradually increasing in capability to produce meaningful outcomes on the ground and in their communities.</p><p>Third, one of the more effective linkages between forest density and woody biomass reduction, fire response, and reducing post-fire impacts is through the application of prescribed fire. A substantial body of research assessing the effectiveness of forest density and fuel reduction on mitigating fire behavior and outcomes has evolved in the past 20 years. While many details and nuances conspire to defy sweeping generalizations about forest fuel treatment effectiveness, findings from on-the-ground empirical studies demonstrates that when forest density reduction is followed closely by prescribed fire to remove woody biomass, fire intensity and growth are significantly reduced. While prescribed fire is admittedly controversial, it remains an essential method to alter wildfire outcomes. There is a need for increased investment to develop and sustain a full-time prescribed fire workforce adequately staffed and well-distributed across the country, and trained in strategic planning, social dimensions and community engagement, and safe and effective tactical operations of prescribed fire. In addition to hiring more people into this workforce, there is a need to expand existing training and education infrastructure, technology, and human resources in all aspects of prescribed fire so the workforce is professionalized and retain people from initial hiring to retirement. The training and education 5 resources should not be just for federal agencies and Tribal entities, but should also be available to state, local and non-governmental, community-based entities that function as critical partners in promoting forest wildfire resilience.</p><p>The fourth, but certainly not least, area for consideration is the substantial shortfall in investments to address post-fire recovery and restoration. This includes both recovery and restoration of infrastructure critical to the functioning of communities impacted by fire, and the recovery and restoration of watershed and forest resources. There are many facets of federal programs and funding for post-fire recovery that many communities are unfortunately learning about and struggling with that are worthy of further study and problem-solving to better align programs and funding with the growing post-fire recovery needs faced by communities. In particular, in keeping with the theme of keeping forests as forest, the pipeline needed to replant trees in areas that experienced large, severe fire is in need of investment. This includes the human, technological, and physical infrastructure needed to collect seeds, cultivate seedlings in nurseries, and transport, plant, tend to, and monitor seedlings across large areas across the western U.S. There is also a need to conduct both basic and applied research about potential long-term consequences and likelihood of success of planting tree species adapted to drier, hotter climatic conditions in locations where they are not currently present. If there is societal demand for forests to remain forest in the face of a changing climate, answering these unknowns requires investment.</p><p>In sum, there is a need and opportunity to update and align disparate programs for forest wildfire mitigation, wildfire response and post-fire recovery - and increase overall investments into these connected, reinforcing actions - to reduce the potential for forest loss from the compounding effects of wildfire and a drying and warming climate.

These include the forest fires in northern Canada, other ongoing ramp-up issues, and a notable sharp decline in rough diamond prices. While we anticipate improved quarter-over-quarter performance at several of our core producing assets, Renard will continue to be impacted by weak rough diamond prices and, as a result, Osisko is assuming no reportable GEOs from Renard in Q4. As such, we now are guiding towards the low end of our GEO delivery guidance for 2023.\u201d</p><p>Osisko will provide full production and financial details with the release of its third quarter 2023 results after market close on Wednesday, November 8th, 2023 followed by a conference call and webcast on Thursday, November 9th at 10am\u00a0ET.

The majority of the gold produced during the period was sourced from the Barnat pit, with the Canadian Malartic pit having finally been depleted in the second quarter of 2023. Preparations for in-pit tailings disposal have commenced, which is expected to start in the second half of 2024. Notably, gold production from the Odyssey mine via the ramp from Odyssey South in the second quarter of 2023 totaled 6,747 ounces. On June 28th Canadian Malartic reached a milestone by pouring its seven millionth gold ounce since achieving commercial production in 2011. Osisko would like to extend its congratulations to Agnico and the Canadian Malartic team on this remarkable achievement.</p><p>In addition to the results of an internal study on the Odyssey Underground mine released on June 20th (see Figure\u00a01, below), on July 26th, Agnico Eagle also provided key highlights of the 2023 Odyssey Study and work completed in the second quarter.

Further to this, the larger mineable mineral resource extended the mine life to 2042 and increased the forecast gold production for the Odyssey mine by 23%, or 1.7 million ounces of gold, compared to the 2020 Odyssey Study.</p><p>On the exploration front, up to 16 drill rigs were active on the Canadian Malartic property during the second quarter and 32,285 meters of drilling were completed. Drilling targeted several areas that are part of the Odyssey mine, including the infill of the East Gouldie deposit from surface, and of the Odyssey South and Odyssey internal zones from the exploration ramp.</p><p>Exploration drilling also continued to investigate the broader East Gouldie mineralized zone and extended the zone laterally to the east and to the west. Regional exploration drilling totaled 3,000 meters during the second quarter, with work resuming on the Rand Malartic property to test the extension of the Odyssey mine's different zones.</p><p>CSA - Exploration and Operations Update (100% Silver Stream and 3% Copper Stream [Cu Stream Commences June 2024])</p><p>On September 11th, Metals Acquisition Limited (\u201cMAC\u201d) reported July and August 2023 production (the first two full months of MAC\u2019s ownership) of 7,294 tonnes of copper from the CSA Mine (\u201cCSA\u201d). Mill throughput in July 2023 of 118kt of ore was a record and the focus is on increasing ore from the mine to fill the excess plant capacity.</p><p>In addition, and also in the third quarter, on July 31st and September 11th respectively, MAC announced the results from the ongoing resource infill and near mine exploration drill programs at CSA. These results included:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>50.4 meters @ 8.9% Cu and 36 g/t Ag, from 170.6 meters in UDD20134</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>25.5 meters @ 12.7% Cu and 55 g/t Ag, from 150.5 meters in UDD20128</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>20.7 meters @ 14.4% Cu and 61 g/t Ag, from 150.5 meters in UDD20147A</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>28.7 meters @ 10.6% Cu and 41 g/t Ag, from 179.8 meters in UDD20140</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>21.5 meters @ 7.7% Cu and 32 g/t Ag, from 139.7 meters in UDD21049</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Drilling has continued to demonstrate the continuity and high-grade nature of the CSA ore bodies.

(\u201cCapstone\u201d) discussed its progress on the ramp up of the Phase I debottlenecking project at the Mantos Blancos mine (\"Mantos Blancos\"). Capstone has experienced lower mill throughput of late as a result of mill downtime caused by unplanned repair and maintenance of a mill lubrication system, tailings dewatering challenges due to presence of clays in the top benches of Phase 20, and other challenges related to the integration of pre-existing and new equipment. A plan to address the plant stability is underway that includes improved maintenance and optimization of the concentrator. Capstone expects Mantos Blancos to be consistently delivering higher throughput rates in the second half of 2023, and to be fully ramped up to design capacity (~20,000 tpd) by year end.</p><p>Capstone is currently evaluating the potential to further increase throughput of the Mantos Blancos sulphide concentrator plant from 20,000 tpd to 27,000 tpd using idled mill capacity. The Mantos Blancos Phase II debottlenecking project feasibility study is expected to be released in the second half of 2024.</p><p>On September 28th, Capstone announced that the Copper Mark had been awarded to Mantos Blancos, highlighting Capstone\u2019s commitment to responsible operating practices, the environment, employees, local communities and governments. The Copper Mark is a comprehensive assurance framework, developed to ensure that value chain participants demonstrate best practice in responsible production and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Eagle - 2023 Guidance Maintained After Solid Third Quarter and Despite Wildfire Interruptions (5% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On October 4th, Victoria Gold (\u201cVictoria\u201d) announced its third quarter production results. The Eagle Gold mine (\u201cEagle\u201d) produced 41,561 ounces of gold during the period from July 1st to September 30th, 2023. Year-to-date 2023 gold production was 124,749 ounces. Gold production was up by 17% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 while third quarter production decreased 17% year-over-year. Both the quarterly decrease year-over-year and the 9-month year-to-date increase are due to a reduction in seasonality as a result of year-round ore stacking on the heap leach pad, a more even distribution of planned maintenance throughout the year and a growing heap leach pad which moderates quarter-over-quarter gold production. The third quarter quarter-over-quarter decrease in grade was due to mine sequencing. Ore and waste mined, ore stacked on the heap leach pad and gold produced were all negatively impacted during the third quarter of 2023 by an approximate two-week evacuation in early August due to wildfire activity.</p><p>On September 14th, Victoria announced the first analytical results from the 2023 exploration campaign at the Raven deposit. Raven was the primary focus of the exploration efforts with over 13,200 meters of diamond drilling completed. Highlights include 7.80 g/t Au over 6.0 meters from 235.5 meters, and 3.45 g/t Au over 27.5 meters from 239.0 meters. Victoria anticipates releasing an updated Raven Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d) after the completion of the 2023 field season including receipt and analysis of all results.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore - Back Up and Running After Wildfire Evacuation (2.2-3.5% NSR Royalty) </p><p>During Newmont Corporation\u2019s (\u201cNewmont\u201d) second quarter results conference call held on July 20th, Newmont\u2019s management noted at the time that in the second week of June, the company made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate its workforce and place the \u00c9l\u00e9onore gold mine (\u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore\u201d) on care and maintenance to protect the company\u2019s employees and contractors. On July 20th, Newmont added that it was then safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continued to abate. Along with its second quarter results, Newmont noted that \u00c9l\u00e9onore produced 48,000 ounces of gold during the period, and that annual production guidance range was still being maintained at 265,000-295,000 ounces of gold.</p><p>Island Gold - Expecting Stronger Mining and Milling Rates in Second Half of 2023 (1.38%-3% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On July 26th, Alamos Gold Inc. (\u201cAlamos\u201d) reported that Island Gold mine (\u201cIsland Gold\u201d) produced 30,500 ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2023 (vs. 32,900 ounces in the first quarter) reflecting lower tonnes and grades processed. Underground mining rates averaged 1,105 tpd in the second quarter, lower than both annual guidance and the prior year period reflecting unplanned downtime due to smoke from wildfires in Northern Ontario as well as weather related power outages. Stronger mining and milling rates are expected in the second half of the year, the operation therefore remains on track to meet full year production guidance of 120,000-135,000 ounces of gold.</p><p>With respect to Island Gold\u2019s Phase 3+ Expansion, total capital expenditures were US$54.7 million in the second quarter with spending through the period focused on shaft site infrastructure, including the hoist house and headframe. The expanded and accelerated mine plan as part of Phase 3+ also transitions a greater proportion of production towards Osisko\u2019s 2% and 3% NSR royalty boundaries earlier in the mine plan, as opposed to the mineral inventory covered by Osisko\u2019s current 1.38% NSR royalty.</p><p>A total of US$14 million is budgeted for exploration at Island Gold in 2023. For the past several years, the exploration focus has been on adding high-grade mineral resources at depth in advance of the Phase 3+ Expansion study, primarily through surface directional drilling. The underground exploration drilling program has been expanded from 27,500 meters in 2022 to 45,000 meters in 2023 and is focused on defining new Mineral Reserves and Resources in proximity to existing production horizons and infrastructure including along strike, and in the hanging-wall and footwall. These potential high-grade mineral reserve and resource additions would be low-cost to develop and could be incorporated into the mine plan and mined within the next several years.</p><p>Sasa - Steady Third Quarter Operations + Progress on New Infrastructure(100% Silver Stream)</p><p>On October 10th, Central Asia Metals plc (\u201cCAML\u201d) provided a third quarter operations update from its Sasa zinc-lead mine in North Macedonia. During the period, 10,249 tonnes of concentrate containing 50.0% zinc and 9,919 tonnes of concentrate containing 71.0% lead were produced. Payable base metal in concentrate sales for the third quarter 2023 were 4,097 tonnes of zinc and 7,252 tonnes of lead. Sasa noted that it sold 95,044 ounces of payable silver to Osisko Gold Royalties, in accordance with its streaming agreement.</p><p>Phase two of the Central Decline development at depths beneath the 910 metre level is underway and, as at September 30th, the decline had been developed down to 860 metres. While Sasa awaits a component to enable testing of cemented backfill, mining on the 800 metre level that has been prepared for paste fill mining operations has now commenced. Construction of the dry stack tailings plant project has commenced, as has land clearance for the dry stack tailings landform.</p><p>Seabee - Update (3% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On August 2nd, SSR Mining Inc.\u2019s (\u201cSSR Mining\u201d) announced that in the second quarter, underground mining rates rebounded, averaging more than 1,300 tpd reflecting the ongoing success of continuous improvement initiatives at the site. Processed grades improved in July, resulting in 8,000 ounces of gold produced during the month. SSR Mining noted that after the strong July, Seabee is positioned for a stronger second half of 2023.</p><p>SSR Mining continues to advance its near-mine exploration at Seabee, prioritizing mineral resource conversion activities to ensure growth and mine life extensions in the future.</p><p>Lamaque - Update (1% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On October 1st, Eldorado Gold Corporation (\u201cEldorado\u201d) announced that Lamaque produced 42,691 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Third quarter production increased slightly over the first and second quarter. Production was impacted by slower than expected development in the underground as a result of suspended shifts in the second quarter due to the wildfires in the region. In the fourth quarter, Eldorado expects to continue to push development, allowing access to higher grade stopes from the C4 zone.</p><p>The second half of the year is expected to be stronger as both processing rates and grade increase. In 2023, production guidance at Lamaque is forecasted to be 170,000 to 180,000 ounces of gold.</p><p>Eldorado also highlighted that exploration results at Ormaque continue to demonstrate the potential to increase resources. Partial results from resource conversion drilling will be incorporated in a resource update later in 2023 and an inaugural reserve on Ormaque in 2024.</p><p>Gibraltar - Throughput and Production Improve Quarter-Over-Quarter (87.5% Silver Stream)</p><p>On October 4th, Taseko Mines Limited (\u201cTaseko\u201d) announced that during the third quarter of 2023, Gibraltar produced 35 million pounds of copper and 369,000 pounds of molybdenum. The 25% quarter-over-quarter increase in copper production was a result of higher grades, improved recoveries and increased mill throughput. Mining in the Gibraltar pit is progressing on plan and the lower benches are providing the ore quality the company had been expecting. Mining operations are now well established in the lower benches of the Gibraltar pit, which have higher grades and larger, more consistent ore zones. Notably in June and July, Taseko benefited from the softer ore in the Gibraltar pit, and mill throughput averaged well above nameplate capacity. The Gibraltar pit will be the sole source of ore for the remainder of 2023, resulting in the higher production already seen in the third quarter; this is expected to continue through the final quarter of the year.</p><p>Pan - Ongoing Exploration Success (4% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On October 10th, Calibre Mining Corp. (\u201cCalibre\u201d) reported third quarter gold production from Pan of 9,729 ounces, down slightly, but effectively in-line with Calibre\u2019s output in the second quarter. Full year 2023 production guidance from the mine was maintained at 40,000-45,000 ounces of gold.</p><p>On August 1st, Calibre announced additional near surface, resource expansion assay results from its 2023 drill program at Pan. Results at the Dynamite North and Palomino targets located immediately north and south of the current open pit operation, respectively, continue to expand zones with grades higher than Pan\u2019s stated mineral resource grade of 0.4 g/t Au. Currently a small amount of material at Palomino exists in Inferred resources, and recent results come from targets that immediately surround the current open pit operations. The potential now exists to materially increase resource ounces, grade and confidence south of the Pan mine and the Palomino deposit remains open to the southeast and at shallow depths. Some highlight intercepts include 1.23 g/t Au over 38.1 meters, 2.56 g/t Au over 10.7 meters and 1.13 g/t Au over 22.9 meters. All drill targets are located near-surface in oxidized limestone. Given the proximity to the current open pit, and the fact that Palomino is within the permitted area, Calibre has indicated they could start mining at Palomino as early as 2024.</p><p>Renard - Update (9.6% Diamond Stream)</p><p>After a two-week interruption due to forest fires near the mine site, Stornoway Diamonds (Canada) Inc. resumed mining operations on July 1st and the diamond recovery plant restarted on July 4th. As a result of the temporary evacuation, there has been a moderate impact on deliveries from Renard in the third quarter of 2023. More importantly, the diamond market has seen continued softening over the second and third quarter due to low polished stone demand in both the United States and Chinese markets. Further exacerbating the situation for Renard, the Indian diamond industry has called for a voluntary halt on all rough diamond imports for a two-month period (October and November) to alleviate pressures faced by manufacturers holding high levels of polished inventory. Given these headwinds, Renard\u2019s equity shareholders are currently exploring a variety of alternatives which will include providing funding for near-term working capital shortfalls at the operation. Taking into account all of the above, Osisko now expects Renard will provide no reportable GEOs under its diamond stream for at least the remainder of the year.</p><p>Corvette - Maiden CV5 MRE Delivers on Expectations + Subsequent Strategic Investment by Albemarle (2% NSR Royalty on Lithium)</p><p>On July 30th, Patriot Battery Metals Inc. (\u201cPatriot\u201d) announced the inaugural MRE for the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite at its wholly owned Corvette Property, located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Qu\u00e9bec. The CV5 spodumene pegmatite is located approximately 13.5 kilometers south of the regional and all\u2011weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure corridor, and within 50 kilometers of the La-Grande 4 (LG4) hydroelectric dam complex.</p><p>The MRE at CV5 has established it as the largest lithium pegmatite mineral resource in the Americas, returning 109.2 million tonnes at 1.42% Lithium Oxide (\u201cLi2O\u201d) and 160 parts per million (\u201cppm\u201d) Tantalum Pentoxide of Inferred resources, at a cut-off grade of 0.40% Li2O, for a total of 3,835,000 tonnes contained lithium carbonate equivalent. Additionally, and as reported by Patriot, the resource and geological modelling has outlined significant potential for growth at CV5, which remains open at both ends along strike, and to depth along a significant portion of its length.</p><p>Osisko holds a sliding scale NSR royalty of 1.5-3.5% on precious metals, and 2.0% on all other products, including Lithium, at Corvette. Osisko estimates that a large majority (~80-95%) of the CV5 MRE falls on its 2.0% Lithium NSR royalty area (see Figure 3 below). The inaugural MRE includes only the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, and therefore does not include any of the other known spodumene pegmatite clusters on the Property \u2013 CV4, CV8, CV9, CV10, CV12, and CV13; some of which are covered Osisko\u2019s royalty.</p><p>On July 31st, Patriot announced a $109 million strategic equity investment (the \u201cStrategic Investment\u201d) by Albemarle Corporation (\u201cAlbemarle\u201d). Upon closing of the Strategic Investment, Albemarle will own approximately 4.9% of Patriot\u2019s issued and outstanding common shares on a fully-diluted in-the-money basis, or 6.4% on a non-diluted, issued and outstanding basis. The proceeds from the Strategic Investment will be used to accelerate the development activities at Corvette and for general corporate purposes. Osisko believes the strategic investment serves to further underpin the quality of this asset on a global scale.</p><p>On September 24th, Patriot announced drill results confirming extension of the CV5 spodumene pegmatite by 0.65\u00a0kilometers since the MRE to attain a total length of 4.35 kilometers. This is highlighted by several drill intersections of over 90 meters of cumulative core length hosting spodumene bearing pegmatite. Patriot also announced an initial drill campaign on the CV9 pegmatite cluster.</p><p>Figure 3: Map from Patriot\u2019s July 30th, 2023 press release with Osisko\u2019s 2% NSR Lithium Royalty coverage overlayed in a yellow outline.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d1388468-59f2-485b-8ce0-7fd334aca1fdSource:\">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d1388468-59f2-485b-8ce0-7fd334aca1fdSource:</url>Osisko Press Release, August 1st, 2023</p><p>Hermosa - Taylor Development Update (1% NSR Royalty on Taylor and Peake)</p><p>On August 23rd, along with its financial results and outlook for the year ended June 30th, 2023, South32 Ltd. (\u201cSouth32\u201d) provided additional information with respect to its activity and timeline at the Hermosa Taylor zinc-lead-silver development project. South32 highlighted that a final Feasibility Study and final investment decision (FID) is still expected in 2023. South32 is currently optimizing the mine development schedule in accordance with FAST-41 permitting. To qualify for the FAST-41 process, complex critical infrastructure projects must meet rigorous criteria to demonstrate benefit to the United States. Further to this, the company is evaluating the opportunity for an extended mine life of up to ~30 years, at a nameplate processing capacity of 4.3 million tonnes per annum.</p><p>South32 noted that it was commissioning a second water treatment plant to support orebody dewatering, enabling access to the Taylor and Clark deposits. Dewatering wells to support shaft sinking are currently under construction, while the pre-sink shaft and initial site infrastructure development is already underway. Finally, on the exploration front, South32 is continuing to drill the Peake Prospect (see Figure 4, below) following high-grade copper results. Recent Peake drilling returned the best copper results to date, with 139 meters at 2.49% copper equivalent (\u201cCuEq\u201d) including 58.2 meters at 3.84% CuEq.</p><p>Figure 4: South32 Recent Drilling at Peake Target</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f8ec2f84-5c23-453c-bde2-0a3efe25b7a6Source:\">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f8ec2f84-5c23-453c-bde2-0a3efe25b7a6Source:</url> South32 Corporate Presentation, August 23, 2023</p><p>Costa Fuego - Project Footprint Set to Grow &amp; Updated Resource Drilling Commences (1% NSR Royalty on Copper and 3% NSR Royalty on Gold)</p><p>On August 28th, Hot Chili Limited\u2019s (\u201cHot Chili\u201d) announced that it had entered into a binding letter of intent with Bastion Minerals Limited (\u201cBastion\u201d) for the grant to Hot Chili of an option to acquire 100% of Bastion\u2019s Cometa Project in Chile (\u201cCometa\u201d), located near Hot Chili\u2019s Costa Fuego Copper-Gold Project (\u201cCosta Fuego\u201d) in the coastal range of the Atacama Region, Chile. Cometa consists of exploration and mining concessions covering approximately 56 square kilometers in area located approximately 15 kilometers southeast of Costa Fuego\u2019s planned operating center and contiguous with Hot Chili\u2019s landholdings in the region. This option is another step in Hot Chili\u2019s consolidation strategy for the Costa Fuego copper project.</p><p>On August 3rd, Hot Chili announced that drilling has re-commenced across the western extension of the Cortadera porphyry resource. Drilling operations have been underway since late July with one reverse circulation rig in operation and further diamond drill rigs to be added as Hot Chili ramps up its fully funded 30,000-meter expansion drilling program across Costa Fuego. An updated resource is scheduled for late 2023 and will serve as the basis for a Pre-Feasibility Study, scheduled for completion in the second half of 2024.</p><p>Costa Fuego is one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped copper projects, not currently controlled by a major mining company. It hosts an NI 43-101 Indicated resource including both the open pit and underground portions of the Cortadera and Productora deposits, of 725 million tonnes grading 0.47% CuEq, grading 0.38% copper, 0.11 g/t Au, 0.45 g/t Ag and 93 ppm Molybdenum and an Inferred resource of 202 million tonnes grading 0.30% Cu and 0.06 g/t Au. The June 2023 Preliminary Economic Assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) projects a 16-year mine life with average annual production of 95,000 tonnes of copper and 49,000 ounces of gold in the first 14 years. Costa Fuego is situated at low altitude and is near all key infrastructure requirements.</p><p>Osisko Development - Asset Updates for Cariboo, Trixie/Tintic and San Antonio(5% NSR Royalty on Cariboo)(2.5% Metals Stream on Tintic)(15% Gold-Silver Stream on San Antonio)</p><p>On October 10th, Osisko Development Corp.

It is currently almost 300,000 acres of protected, mostly forested land that we all benefit from and enjoy in different ways. But I think it's a fair bet that many people don't understand or could use a refresher on everything from how the whole thing got started to how it works. </p><p>So, for the past several weeks I've been taking to a deep dive on the \u2018why's and \u2018how's of the Shawnee National Forest. This week I'm writing about the Forest Service's use of prescribed fire as a forest management technique on the Shawnee. Likely, you are familiar with Smokey Bear. Smokey became the Forest Service mascot in 1944 and informed several generations that \"Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires.\" Certainly, shortly after the Shawnee was designated as a National Forest in 1939, the goal was to protect the regenerating forest and the thousands of acres of recently planted pines and Smokey's message was spread far and wide. But, in 2001, the slogan changed to \"Only You Can Prevent Wildfires\" The change was intended to clarify that Smokey was promoting the prevention of unplanned outdoor fires and not prescribed fires. A prescribed fire is a planned fire that is overseen by professionals. Prescribed fires are carried out only under specific weather conditions and are designed to mimic fire that historically occurred in the forest. The ecological value and importance of fire in many forested ecosystems has become much better understood and appreciated in the last several decades. In general, many forests are dependent on fire to maintain a specific mix of forest trees and other plants. Without fire the forest composition changes and that impacts all the animals. Fire is particularly important to the regeneration of oak trees, which are the dominant trees in southern Illinois forests. If you've never seen a prescribed fire \u2018in action', they slowly creep along the forest floor making them generally pretty easy to control. Additionally, the prescribed fire seasons is October to April, a time when most of the forest wildlife has either migrated south or is hibernating. Specific to the Shawnee National Forest, planning for a prescribed fire begins months or sometimes years before it happens. Burn plans are written, reviewed, and approved by personnel with years of firefighting and risk management experience. Then, during the fire season, fire managers monitor weather and fuel conditions closely, and when the conditions are favorable, they gather the required personnel and equipment to implement a burn. In addition, the forest service can assist landowners with property adjacent to the Shawnee who wish to have prescribed burns conducted on their private land. Wildland fire specialists will provide a consultation and typically a Forest Stewardship Plan is developed for the landowner. If you own property adjacent to state or federal land and you are interested in the benefits that prescribed fire provides as a management tool, contact the Shawnee National Forest, Fire Management Officer at 618-253-7114. * Mike Baltz has a doctorate in biology and writes about changing the world from his home in Carbondale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>U.S. Forest Service Prescribed fires are usually slow-moving fires that \u2018clean' the forest floor and are easy to control.

Because the U.N. has identified animal-based agriculture as a leading cause of greenhouse-gas emissions, the shelf-stable kits contain a block of tofu, seeds to grow soybeans (100 calories of soybeans have 13 grams more protein than 100 calories of beef), nondairy creamer, recipes, and PETA's vegan starter kitenough to start anyone on the road to environmentally positive living and healthy, humane eating.</p><p>\"The U.N. report, like the one before it, shows that human diets are a major source of greenhouse gases because of belching animals and deforestation caused by growing crops to feed them,\" says PETA President Ingrid Newkirk. \"PETA's Methane Offset Starter Kit shows how simple it can be to switch to vegan meals now, because the Earth can't wait any longer.\"</p><p>The U.N. has reported that a global shift to vegan eating is required to combat the worst effects of climate change, with animal agriculture alone responsible for nearly one-fifth of all human-induced greenhouse-gas emissions. Clearing land to raise animals and grow crops to feed them is a leading cause of deforestation, including in the Amazon, and animal agriculture uses a massive amount of water, contributing to droughts and the spread of wildfires.</p><p>The cities receiving the kits include Corpus Christi, Texas, and Jacksonville, Florida, both expected to face increased flooding; Charleston, South Carolina, where experts predict hotter days, more rain, and more floods; and Tucson, Arizona, where hotter weather is expected to reduce dwindling groundwater supplies.

Here's your round-up, written by Abubakr Al-Shamahi, Al Jazeera Digital's Middle East and North Africa editor. </p><p><br/>There are many who'll tell you that politics and sport don't mix. But come on, this is Iran against the USA that we're talking about - the political undertones to this World Cup game were always going to be there. A roll call of some of the world's major events[1] of the last 70 years explains why: a CIA-backed coup against a democratically elected Iranian leader, the 1979 Islamic revolution, the Iran hostage crisis, the Iran-Iraq war, the Lebanese civil war and the Iraq war - all the way through to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and then the subsequent withdrawal from it by the Americans. <br/>And, if you need more? Well, look at how domestic events in Iran have affected this tournament. The Iranian team didn't sing the national anthem in their first game, a sign the country'santi-government protesters[2]took as tacit approval for the protest movement. The team then proceeded to sing in the next two, with some speculating there may have been government pressure \u2014 especially following the arrest of aformer national team player[3]for supporting the protests. And in the stands, pro- and anti-government Iranians were both present, leading to tense situations at times, with someprotest supporters[4]even ordered to remove anti-government symbols by Qatari security. <br/>[PHOTOS: The troubled history of US-Iranian relations][5] <br/>The Americans themselves got involved in the act. A US Soccer social media account used an altered version of the Iranian flag to 'support women in Iran'. That was not well-received by the Iranian Football Association, who demanded that the US be thrown out of the tournament. <br/>As for the actual football, well, it was essentially a play-off for qualification to the knockout stages. The Iranians didn't really turn up, at least not until the latter stages of the game, and theUS won 1-0[6], sending Iran home. <br/>Turkey, Syria and the operation that may not happen <br/>A few days ago, it appeared that the Turkish military was on the verge of launching a much-threatened ground offensive against the Kurdish-dominated YPG in northern Syria. Turkish journalists headed to the border, and statements from both Turkey and the SDF (which is largely made up of the YPG) indicated that a battle was imminent. <br/>So far, however, the fighting has been restricted to air attacks and shelling that were already underway.According to Turkish sources[7] who spoke to Al Jazeera, Turkey is negotiating with Russia, and has given time for its demands to be met. This one is far from over. <br/>Algeria sentences 49 people to death <br/>It was a horrible event, reported last August. It began when a 38-year-old good Samaritan had gone to help out as deadly wildfires raged through northern Algeria. But Djamel Ben Ismail found himself falsely accused by locals in Tizi Ouzou of actually starting the fires, and a mob beat him to death. An Algerian court found 49 of the people involved guilty of the lynching, andsentenced them to death[8]. <br/>And Now for Something Different <br/>Sub-Saharan Africans make up roughly 6 percent of Qatar's population. One of them, a Kenyan by the name of Bernard Wanjiku, initially worked as a taxi driver. But after constant questions from fellow Africans about beauty products, he ditched the cab, and opened up anAfrican beauty store[9]that has turned into a hub for the African community, especially during the World Cup. <br/>In Brief <br/>Saudi fan culture[10], with all its paraphernalia, shines at the World Cup - QatarEnergy tosupply Germany with gas[11]for at least 15 years in new deal - Two brothersamong five Palestinians[12]killed by Israel in one day -Cocaine 'super-cartel' raided[13]in Dubai and Europe - Iran saysit won't cooperate[14]with UN investigation into anti-government protests - Arab teams turn Qatar World Cupinto a home tournament[15]- US military reportsrocket attacks on base in Syria[16]- Far-right Itamar Ben-Gvirto be police minister[17]in new Israeli government - Yemenisdivided over support[18]for Saudi Arabia in World Cup <br/>Quote of the Week <br/>'A lot of people say: How can I choose between my father and my mother?'-Fatima Zibouh, a Belgian citizen of Moroccan origin, onwhether Belgian-Moroccans would support Belgium or Morocco[19] ahead of the latter's 2-0 victory in the World Cup. The question of identity has coe up a lot in this World Cup, with many teams featuring players born in different countries, and ethnic minorities divided between support for their country of origin, or the country they were born in or live in. <br/> [ 1]: <url
