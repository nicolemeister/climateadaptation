According to news reporting out of Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are major disturbances in forest ecosystems. The rapid detection of the spatial and temporal characteristics of fires is essential for formulating targeted post-fire vegetation restoration measures and assessing fire-induced carbon emissions.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Natural Science Foundation of China; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"We propose an accurate and efficient framework for extracting the spatiotemporal characteristics of fires using vegetation change tracker (VCT) products and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The VCT was used to extract areas of persistent forest and forest disturbance patches from Landsat images of Xichang and Muli, Liangshan prefecture, Sichuan province in southwestern China and Huma, Heilongjiang province, in northeastern China. All available Landsat images in the GEE platform in a year were normalized using the VCT-derived persisting forest mask to derive three standardized vegetation indices (normalized burn ratio (NBRr), normalized difference moisture index (NDMIr), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIr)). Historical forest disturbance events in Xichang were used to train two decision trees using the C4.5 data mining tool. The differenced NBRr, NDMIr, and NDVIr (dNBRr, dNDMIr, and dNDVIr) were obtained by calculating the difference in the index values between two temporally adjacent images. The occurrence time of disturbance events were extracted using the thresholds identified by decision tree 1. The use of all available images in GEE narrowed the disturbance occurrence time down to 16 days. This period was extended if images were not available or had cloud cover. Fire disturbances were distinguished from other disturbances by comparing the dNBRr, dNDMIr, and dNDVIr values with the thresholds identified by decision tree 2. The results showed that the proposed framework performed well in three study areas. The temporal accuracy for detecting disturbances in the three areas was 94.33%, 90.33%, and 89.67%, the classification accuracy of fire and non-fire disturbances was 85.33%, 89.67%, and 83.67%, and the Kappa coefficients were 0.71, 0.74, and 0.67, respectively.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The proposed framework enables the efficient and rapid extraction of the spatiotemporal characteristics of forest fire disturbances using frequent Landsat time-series data, GEE, and VCT products. The results can be used in forest fire disturbance databases and to implement targeted post-disturbance vegetation restoration practices.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A New Method for the Rapid Determination of Fire Disturbance Events Using GEE and the VCT Algorithm-A Case Study in Southwestern and Northeastern China.

While operating earnings for Berkshire's railroad and energy businesses were lower in 2023 than 2022, insurance and reinsurance underwriting income of $6.9 billion pretax, or $5.4 billion after taxes, reversed losses in the millions ($22 million pretax and $30 million after taxes) in 2022. Insurance investment income came in nearly 50 percent higher in 2023, adding another $10 billion to after-tax operating income.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">P/C insurance \"provides the core of Berkshire's well-being and growth,\" Buffett wrote. \"We have been in the business for 57 years, and despite our nearly <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5,000-fold</emphasis> increase in volume-from $17 million to $83 billion-we have much room to grow,\" he said. (Note, the chart below excludes $5 billion of life reinsurance premiums)</p><p>Buffett's much-reported comment that Berkshire Hathaway has \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2024/02/25/259040.htm\">no possibility for eye-popping performance</url>\" for shareholders came early in the letter as he compared the net worth of Berkshire ($561.3 billion) in shareholders equity-\"the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American business\"-to the roughly $9 trillion in GAAP net worth of the rest of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Related article: \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2024/02/25/259040.htm\">Buffett Says Berkshire 'Built to Last'</url>\"</p><p>\"By this measure, Berkshire now occupies nearly 6 percent of the universe in which it operates. Doubling our huge base is simply not possible within, say, a five-year period,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,\" he said, describing his criteria for acquisitions that could bring some pop to Berkshire's stock price.</p><p>GEICO: Losses and Staff Numbers Tumble </p><p>While Berkshire's most recent acquisition in the P/C insurance and reinsurance world, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2022/04/15/235052.htm\">$11.6 billion deal for Alleghany Corporation</url> (which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alleghany.com/about-alleghany/Press-Releases/press-release-details/2022/Berkshire-Hathaway-Completes-Acquisition-of-Alleghany-Corporation/default.aspx\"> closed in October 2022</url>), provided jolts to premium volume totals for Berkshire Hathaway's primary commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses (discussed below), it was the turnaround of Berkshire's personal lines insurance operation, GEICO, that really moved the needle-pushing overall insurance and reinsurance underwriting figures from red to black.</p><p>GEICO's $3.6 billion pretax underwriting profit translates to a 90.7 combined ratio, more than 14 points below the 104.8 recorded in 2022. The only better year of underwriting performance at GEICO in the last 10 was 2020, when COVID shutdowns kept drivers off the roads. In 2020, GEICO's combined ratio landed at 90.2, fueling a $3.4 billion pretax underwriting profit.</p><p>GEICO's combined ratio improvement in 2023 looks stunning against competitors Progressive and Allstate, which both posted double-digit premium jumps in 2023 but smaller improvements in their personal auto combined ratios. (Editor's Note: State Farm has not reported earnings yet).</p><p>At GEICO, earned premiums grew less than 1 percent in 2023, and written premiums grew just under 2 percent.</p><p>In the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the annual report published Saturday, Berkshire reveals that 12.4 points of GEICO's combined ratio improvement came from a $4.5 billion decline in loss and loss adjustment expenses, while the other two points came from $752 million in expense cuts. The report attributes the 12.4 percent drop in loss and loss adjustment expenses to lower claims frequencies and increased favorable loss reserve development for prior accident years, partially offset by increases in average claims severities. Also noted is the fact that while rate hikes pushed average premiums per policy up 16.8 percent, policies in force declined 9.8 percent, impacting overall premium growth for the year.</p><p>Providing details of the loss drivers, the report reveals that:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Prior-year reserve takedowns amounted to $1.5 billion in 2023, compared to $653 billion in 2022.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Results for 2022 also included the impact of $400 million in losses from Hurricane Ian.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Property damage and collision claims frequencies dropped 7-8 percent last year, while average claim severities for all coverages rose in the 14-16 percent range.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Beyond the 12 percent drop in auto insurance losses, another eye-popping figure for GEICO is 20 percent drop in staffing-a loss of 7,700 employees-that become evident to anyone comparing a page in the report's appendix to a similar page in last year's report.</p><p>An employee count for all of Berkshire Hathaway's operating entities (insurance and non-insurance) is a regular feature of the conglomerate's annual report. This year, page 149 of the 152-page annual report lists GEICO's employee count as 30,584, compared to a 38,285 figure reported last year.</p><p>If the latest staffing figure has been accurately reported, then GEICO's employee count has fallen below the level reported 10 years ago in 2014, and the 2023 drop marks three straight years of workforce reductions (2.7 percent in 2021, 6.6 percent in 2022 and 20.1 percent in 2023). The declines came after successive increases for at least eight years (the period for which Carrier Management has tracked the reported figures).</p><p>Notably, while the downward change in employee counts for 2023 likely encompasses a 6 percent reduction in force from a layoff notice <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2023/10/20/254662.htm\">widely reported by media outlets in October</url>, there are 5,700 remaining positions gone that are not explained by the layoff.</p><p>(Carrier Management was not able to confirm the accuracy of the employee counts at press time but has reached out to GEICO for information on the reported figures.)</p><p>The report's discussion of GEICO's results cites lower employee-related costs as one of the drivers of a nearly 3.0 point improvement in its expense ratio in 2022 but doesn't specifically flag employee costs as a driver of the further 2.0-point improvement in 2023. The report attributes last year's improvement to \"reduced advertising expense and improved operating leverage.\"</p><p>Reinsurance and Primary Ops: Record Profits </p><p>The remaining insurance and reinsurance operations generally added to their workforces, according to figures in the 2022 and 2023 reports, also taking premiums and underwriting profits to record levels.</p><p>The primary insurance operations, writing mainly commercial lines, recorded $1.4 billion in underwriting profits on $3.5 billion of written premiums. The MD&amp;A discloses that a 24.1 percent jump in premiums in 2023 was primarily attributable to Alleghany operations RSUI and CapSpecialty ($2.1 billion). Other larger jumps (amounts undisclosed) came from the Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance and Berkshire Hathaway Direct operations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Side note: Buffett's discussion of challenges for Berkshire Hathaway Energy refers to the impacts of an unstable regulatory environment on projected profits as well as worries about climate change. He specifically refers to loss estimates for costs arising from forest fires, \"whose frequency and intensity have increased-and will likely continue to increase-if convective storms become more frequent.\"</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">After a year that saw insurance carriers retreat from states where they had been burned in past years by wildfire losses, Buffett said fires weigh on decisions of leaders of Berkshire's energy businesses to invest in those states too. \"It will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE's forest-fire losses and can intelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western states,\" he wrote.</emphasis></p><p>While earned premiums grew about 25 percent for all the primary ops taken together, their losses increased by 13.5 percent, driving over 6 points of improvement in the loss ratio for the group of companies. The report notes that lower amounts of catastrophe losses ($37 million in 2023 vs. $641 million in 2022) and changes in business mix helped bring down the loss ratio.</p><p>The P/C reinsurance operations recorded a 32 percent jump in written premiums to $22.4 billion, including Alleghany's TransRe Group. Excluding TransRe, the jump was still sizable, coming in at 17.1 percent, as Berkshire leaned into higher-priced property reinsurance business last year.</p><p>Overall, the loss ratio for the P/C reinsurance operations dropped 6.4 points in 2023, with a lower level of catastrophes helping to improve the result. The reinsurance cat losses came in at $900 million in 2023, compared to $2.0 billion in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Editor's Note: Charts included earlier in this article include results for life reinsurance and retroactive reinsurance operations.</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRMNGT-cm259036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRMNGT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BDR-G9P1-DY07-D000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465779</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2024 Wells Media Group, Inc.

Mike Parson attended the meeting, which was the fourth gathering of the group since July.</p><p>\"We are a long way from getting out of this drought,\" Parson said, adding that his cattle farm in Bolivar has felt the effects of the extended dry period. \"Winter is going to be tough. Whether you are on a farm or not, it's going to affect you.\"</p><p>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, areas in central and western Missouri, south of the Missouri River, are in extreme drought. St. Louis is listed as \"abnormally dry.\"</p><p>The monitor notes that an estimated 2.1 million Missourians reside in areas affected by the lack of precipitation.</p><p>Mark Fuchs of the National Weather Service said predictions show there will be some rain in the state in the coming week, but it won't be enough to overcome months of shortfalls.</p><p>\"We'll take what we can get, but we need more than that,\" Fuchs said.</p><p>Zack Leasor of the University of Missouri Extension told the panel that Missouri could face a higher forest fire risk this fall because of dry days, low humidity and dry conditions on the ground.</p><p>Chance Bitner of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, raised concern about low flow levels on the Missouri River affecting water intake lines for the Callaway Nuclear Generating Station north of Jefferson City and Ameren's coal-fired power plant in Labadie, located east of Washington.</p><p>Davor Karic of the Corps' St. Louis office predicted a \"slow fall\" in water levels on the Mississippi River, potentially affecting shipping costs for farmers.</p><p>Last year, the Mississippi plummeted to low depths, affecting barge traffic on one of the major arteries for moving coal, oil, natural gas, chemicals and commodities in the U.S.</p><p>This year, dredging is underway on a section of the Mississippi south of St. Louis to give barges some extra depth if water levels continue to slip.</p><p>Rep. Tim Taylor, R-Bunceton, told the committee that he is concerned the prolonged drought could begin to affect topsoil similar to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s. He said Cooper County, located west of Columbia, has been hit hard by the lack of rain.</p><p>\"My home county is suffering,\" Taylor said.</p><p>It is not clear when Parson may formally extend his executive order. The governor leaves for a trade mission to Japan on Friday.</p><p>\"Every day this goes on it's going to have an impact on the economy,\" Parson said. \"We just have to hold things together until we get some rain.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Cattle gather in a nearly dry pond on a farm in Marion County, in northeast Missouri, in July 2023.\u00a0  On a farm in southwest Missouri, drought conditions caused a farmer to resort to cutting corn that will not make grain to sell, in July 2023.\u00a0  Photographs from St. Louis Post-Dispatch staff and freelancers for the week beginning Sept. 24, 2023.

The fire, boosted by strong winds, was within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of Yellowknife's northern edge, and people in the four areas at highest risk were told to leave as soon as possible, Fire Information Officer Mike Westwick said. Officials worried that winds could push the flames toward the only highway leading away from the fire as long caravans of cars evacuated the city of 20,000, and although some rain was forecast, first responders were taking no chances. </p><p>Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon Friday. \"I want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there's a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\" Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. \"Without rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\" Evacuating such a large number of people is \"going to be tough,\" but people were cooperating and staying calm, Westwick said. Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year \u2014 contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. \u2014 with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control. In the Northwest Territories alone, 268 wildfires have already burned more than 8,100 square miles. Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta. \"It's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later,\" because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community. Resident Angela Canning was packing up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities and leaving with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker. \"I'm really anxious and I'm scared. I'm emotional ... I'm in shock,\" she told The Canadian Press. \"I don't know what I'm coming home to or if I'm coming home. There's just so much unknowns here.\" At the Big River Service Station about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was \"phenomenal,\" employee Linda Croft said. \"You can't see the end of it.\" About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive. A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told the CBC that their car began to melt as they drove through embers and the front window cracked.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press People without vehicles line up to register Thursday for a flight to Calgary, Alberta, in Yellowknife.

The kayakers had spotted a blaze in the woods along their location on the Mullica River in the sprawling Wharton State Forest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Raudy had no idea whether the kayakers spotted a true forest fire, or maybe a large campfire. Pinelands Adventures organizes trips, rents boats, and offers guided tours and Raudy had a group camping overnight at the Mullica River Campground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just prior to the time of the text, a crew member of the Forest Fire Service in the Batsto Fire Tower had also spotted smoke and flames nearly 8 miles away.</p><p>New Jersey's largest blaze in 15 years had just been ignited at an illegal campsite and was racing toward key areas used by Pinelands Adventures and its customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'We just had to evacuate'</emphasis></p><p>\"The [New Jersey] Forest Fire Service hadn't called us yet,\" Raudy said. \"And we had no idea how far south it was spreading, or what direction it was traveling ... As far as we knew, we just had to evacuate those people.\"</p><p>Raudy and her staff called an emergency line to the fire service, jumped in trucks or buses and drove off to find the paddlers and campers - not a quick task considering the miles of meandering river that runs through dense brush, and the twisting, bumpy sand roads that lace the 123,000-acre forest.</p><p>The staff managed to extract all the customers safely in what ultimately roared into a 13,500 acre, multiday blaze that is still burning in small hot spots weeks later, but is 95% contained. Fire officials believe it was caused by an illegal campfire, but have not released its location. Hot, breezy conditions combined with extraordinary low humidity helped the fire spread quickly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Canceled trips</emphasis></p><p>The conflagration was mostly confined to Wharton State Forest, which lies within the much larger Pinelands National Reserve, and contains some of the Pine Barrens' most visited areas, such as Batsto Village, Atsion Recreation Area, Apple Pie Hill, and Carranza Memorial. The Mullica, Batsto and Oswego Rivers also run through it.</p><p>All of 18 structures, including some that are historical, survived.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service and Wharton State Forest staff cleared at least 50 trees that fell across a 4.6-mile stretch of the Mullica River from Constable Bridge to Lock's Bridge, a key area for Pinelands Adventures trips. Felled trees also blocked key portions of the Batsto River.</p><p>The state's Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the forest, started opening popular trails last weekend, such as the Batona, Tom's Pond, Mullica River, and the Batsto Red, White and Blue Trails - though Wharton State Forest officials note there is still some potential for trees to fall. And all trails from Atsion to Batsto, including mountain biking trails, remain closed as hot spots continue to burn. The Mullica River Campground will remain closed through July 15.</p><p>The fire forced Pinelands Adventures to close operations for two weeks until it reopened July</p><p>2. Overall, the outfitter had to cancel trips for 850 people. And many would-be customers have postponed trips, Raudy said, fearing they'd be kayaking through a barren, charred wilderness - which she says is not the case.</p><p>Pinelands Adventures is owned by the nonprofit Pinelands Preservation Alliance (PPA), an environmental group singled out by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service for helping restore trails and waterways after the blaze. The Outdoor Club of South Jersey, and the Jersey Off Road Bicycling Association also helped. All the groups depend on volunteers.</p><p>\"It really shut down people's ability to explore and enjoy the forest for almost two weeks,\" said Carleton Montgomery, the longtime director of the PPA. \"And that took away a big chunk of work for us. We were we were not able to take people canoeing and kayaking on the Batsto and Mullica Rivers. That was a blow to Pinelands Adventures. We lost a lot of customers.\"</p><p>PPA went to work helping the Forest Fire Service, though they didn't participate in firefighting.</p><p>\"Our staff helped to go out and identify small places where the fire will keep burning because the fire gets underground and among turf and root,\" Montgomery said. \"And we were given permission to work on the Batsto River to clear obstacles so that people can start enjoying it again.\"</p><p>Montgomery said the fire burned in what's known as a mosaic pattern - patches of blackened trees and ground alternating with areas still abundantly green.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Eerie and quiet'</emphasis></p><p>Rosemary \"Ro\" Mason, a trail maintenance leader for the Outdoor Club of South Jersey, said she was \"pleasantly surprised\" that the fire did less damage than originally feared when 18 structures were threatened, including those at historic Batsto Village, all of which were unscathed.</p><p>\"It was really eerie and quiet, and smoky in places,\" Mason said of the days after the fire when she and other volunteers helped restore a section of the Batona Trail, a 53-mile path that runs through Wharton, the Franklin Parker Preserve and Bass River State Forest. \"I could see little hot spots and thought it was really strange. You would see black, and then green, and then brown, and then black again. It had no rhyme nor reason.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forged in fire</emphasis></p><p>Last Friday, Andy Giles, director of Pinelands Adventures, drove his Land Rover along Quaker Bridge Road, a sand road that dates to the 18th century. He noted how, even among a desolate area of blackened, charred trees and vegetation, new growth is already poking through, including tiny pink oak leaves.</p><p>New Jersey's Pine Barrens are forged in fire, which is largely beneficial unless it threatens firefighters, people and buildings, Giles explained. In fact, Native Americans once burned sections to improve hunting conditions. The pitch pine trees that dominate the forest are highly flammable and depend on fire to release seeds from cones.</p><p>The bark of the pitch pines will char in a fire, but the trees will remain fully alive - unless the heat is extreme, as it was in some areas of the Mullica River blaze.</p><p>Giles pointed to the remains of a pine tree that had burned so badly most of its middle is gone. Those present the biggest danger right now, he said. Giles was walking his dog recently when a tree suddenly toppled in front of them.</p><p>\"Tree collapses might occur for weeks or months after a fire,\" he said. \"And that's why right now Lock's Bridge south on the Mullica River is still closed to paddlers.\"</p><p>+<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>\"FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-PHDN20220712Ar01000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65X3-YN21-DYJT-2323-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 12, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000814</classCode><className>BOATING &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Fisciano, Italy, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The increasing frequency and severity of forest fires necessitate early detection and rapid response to mitigate their impact.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Salerno: \"This project aims to design a cyber-physical system for early detection and rapid response to forest fires using advanced technologies. The system incorporates Internet of Things sensors and autonomous unmanned aerial and ground vehicles controlled by the robot operating system. An IoT-based wildfire detection node continuously monitors environmental conditions, enabling early fire detection. Upon fire detection, a UAV autonomously surveys the area to precisely locate the fire and can deploy an extinguishing payload or provide data for decision-making. The UAV communicates the fire's precise location to a collaborative UGV, which autonomously reaches the designated area to support ground-based firefighters. The CPS includes a ground control station with web-based dashboards for real-time monitoring of system parameters and telemetry data from UAVs and UGVs.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The article demonstrates the real-time fire detection capabilities of the proposed system using simulated forest fire scenarios. The objective is to provide a practical approach using open-source technologies for early detection and extinguishing of forest fires, with potential applications in various industries, surveillance, and precision agriculture.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Cyber-Physical System for Wildfire Detection and Firefighting.

Clavijo said the fire had a nearly 30-kilometer-long (19-mile) perimeter.</p><p>\"This is probably the most complicated blaze we have had on the Canary Islands, if not ever, in at least the last 40 years,\" Clavijo told reporters. Extreme temperatures in the island, he said, added to \"specific meteorological conditions\" caused by the fire that turned the area into a virtual oven.</p><p>The blaze, which started Tuesday night, is centered on a craggy, mountainous area, which is difficult for emergency brigades to access. Spanish authorities said their main goal is to contain the fire and prevent it from reaching more populated areas. The island's main town, Santa Cruz, is 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the flames.</p><p>The wildfire is threatening six municipalities. Some 7,600 residents in the area have either been evacuated or ordered to stay indoors Thursday due to hazardous air quality. Clavijo said firefighters were working day and night but the fire remained \"out of control.\"</p><p>The seven-island archipelago is located off the northwest coast of Africa and southwest of mainland Spain.</p><p>Tenerife is one of Spain's tourist hotspots. Tenerife Tourism office stressed in a statement Thursday afternoon that the main tourist areas and cities of the island are away from the fire. Business continues as usual in accommodation establishments, beaches and other tourist sites located in areas near the coast and in the midlands, the office said.</p><p>But access to the Teide National Park, the most important tourist attraction in Tenerife after the beaches, will be closed to the public from Thursday 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT), said the Canary regional government. All tourist facilities around the Teide volcano area, including accommodation, will be evacuated, alongside the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands` personnel.</p><p>Further evacuations are expected in the coming hours in several neighbourhoods. The wildfire is particularly virulent on its north side.</p><p>Temperatures in the Canary Islands peaked at more than 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in recent days. Temperatures are set to rise again on Saturday.</p><p>The fire could become Spain's worst blaze so far this summer, as the country suffers another year of severe drought.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were evacuated in a wildfire on the nearby La Palma island last month that affected some 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres).</p><p>Wildfires have burned almost 64,000 hectares (158,000 acres) in Spain in the first seven months of the year, according to Spanish government data. That`s the third highest figure in the last decade.</p><p>Spain accounted for almost 40% of the nearly 800,00 hectares (2 million acres) burned in the European Union in 2022, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Top photo: The flames advance through the forest near the town of El Rosario, as wildfire continues to burn on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2023. An out-of-control wildfire on the Spanish Canary island of Tenerife has burned some 2,600 hectares (6,400 acres) of land and forced the evacuation of some 300 people from several small towns, Canary Islands regional president Fernando Clavijo said Thursday.

The unidentified individual is accused by some of using a snowmobile to chase the wolf into submission while legally hunting wolves on Feb. 29 in Sublette County.</p><p>From USA TODAY Network and wire reports</p><p>Savannah: When General William Sherman seized Savannah, the Montmollin Building at City Market was confiscated by the federal government. Once a building where enslaved persons were sold, the building was then given to Savannah's African American community. That move paved the way for the Savannah Educational Association to open one of Savannah's first legal Black schools: the Bryan School, which went on to host as many as 400 students in one session, according to city archives. Now, a historical marker on Barnard Street across from Ellis Square tells the story of tragedy and triumph.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The

They froze in place or flopped to the ground, laughing and panting, as the game continued.</p><p>The group of 7- to 11-year-olds from around the tri-state area was participating in a two-day No Child Left Inside camp, sponsored by Sinsinawa Mound, which continues today.</p><p>Eric Anglada, ecological programming coordinator at Sinsinawa Mound, said the goal of the camp is to get kids connected with nature and build community.</p><p>Over the course of the camp, the children were scheduled to take hikes, play games and learn outdoor skills, including how to start a fire using flint and steel and how to make cordage using the inner bark of a tree.</p><p>\"The learning takes place naturally as we have those experiences,\" Anglada said. \"We try to balance movement and stillness and listening. ... In a society in which so many children are connected to screens for so many hours a day, this is a chance to reconnect with their bodies, reconnect with each other and reconnect with the land.\"</p><p>As the camp began, each student had the chance to select a \"nature name\" for the next two days. Anglada chose the name \"Joe Pye,\" in reference to the purple Joe-Pye weed flower, while other students picked monikers like Bear, Violet, Eagle and Poison Ivy.</p><p>Autumn, who selected the nature name Sunflower, said it was her first year attending No Child Left Inside camp, and she had enjoyed it so far.</p><p>\"I just like hiking and stuff,\" she said. \"I like playing outside, and I like seeing the flowers and being with my friends.\"</p><p>Autumn's friend Callista Berning, 8, of Hazel Green, was returning to the camp for her second year, this time with her younger sister Emery, 7.</p><p>Callista said one of her favorite activities last year was playing a game called \"fox tail tag,\" and she looked forward to spending time with friends this year.</p><p>After completing the first game of \"fire in the forest,\" some of the children began another, while others wandered around, investigating nearby plants and attempting to whistle using blades of grass.</p><p>\"How do I look with orange hair?\" asked 8-year-old Ana Moss-Sanchez, as she balanced a bunch of orange leaves on top of her head.</p><p>Ana, of Mineral Point, said she enjoys spending time outside because of the unique creatures she encounters.</p><p>\"You can find bugs, and I find a lot of toads at my mom's house,\" she said. \"Today (at camp), we're going to go on a hike to the top of a mountain.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-5256194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68W7-7T81-JCDM-J0JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Woodward Communications, Inc.

It is predicting west winds of 10 to 20 miles per hour with gusts of 25 to 35 mph. With minimum humidity levels between 7 and 15%, the combination is ripe for extreme fire conditions.</p><p>\"It's the worst fire weather of the season so far here,\" Kootenai National Forest Fire Manager Officer Dan Rose said. \"We're really concerned about the East Fork Fire and what could happen if the weather predictions are true.\"</p><p>The lightning-caused East Fork Fire grew significantly Wednesday, according to forest officials. It's listed at 1,550 acres with 40% containment. The fire, burning heavy timer and subalpine fir, is located 12 miles south of Trego and has burned into the Tally Ranger District of the Flathead National Forest. There is a closure order on the Fortine Ranger District for roads in the vicinity of the fire. They include Forest Roads 315, 3520, 3512, 3710 and 3729.</p><p>For more information on the East Fork Fire, visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-information/mtknf-east-fork-fire\">https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-information/mtknf-east-fork-fire</url>.</p><p>Rose said the smoke that has enveloped the region is the result of fires burning in Canada, Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>The Montana Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality alert for several counties, including Lincoln, Sanders, Mineral and Flathead.</p><p>The air quality alert is in effect until 12 p.m. on Friday. Particulate levels in Libby and Thompson Falls were listed as unhealthy for sensitive groups.</p><p>The National Weather Service said periods of haze and smoke are likely through at least Friday, possibly degrading air quality at times in western Montana and northcentral Idaho.</p><p>Rose also thanked and urged residents and visitors to continue their vigilance in following stage 2 fire restrictions.</p><p>Forecasters are predicting a 30% chance of rain after midnight Saturday and a chance of rain on Sunday. Temperatures are supposed to moderate Friday with a high in the low 90s and down to the mid 80s from Sunday to Tuesday.</p><p>Locally, fire crews used engine, hand and aerial crews to get two fires extinguished. The Ski Run and Silver Butte Pass fires, both lightning-caused, were one-half acre or less.</p><p>The Gravel Pit Fire, near Silver Butte, is listed at 304 acres and 80% contained on Thursday morning. The evacuation warning for residents in the area was lifted on Aug. 14.</p><p>Western Montana All Hazards Incident Commander Ken Parks wrote that while fire behavior is low with smoldering and creeping, the potential exists for more fire behavior with hot, dry conditions.</p><p>Firefighters are doing the most physical aspects of their work in the morning, due to the hot weather.</p><p>\"To address this, engines will patrol the fire area and seek out any sources of heat,\" Parks wrote. \"Engines and crews will remain ready for initial attack and respond to new fire starts in the area.\"</p><p>___ (c)2023 The Western News (Libby, Mont.)

Evergreen Blvd. She spoke to The Columbian a few weeks ago - just after learning that \"Beaverland\" had reached No. 12 on the Times' list of bestselling trade paperbacks.<br/>\"Astor was brilliant and corrupt and ruthless,\" Philip said. \"He was doing what empire builders have always done, which is the extraction of natural resources. The natural resource he extracted was the beaver. And he made a fortune.\"<br/>\"Beaverland\" details how, on his way to becoming America's first multimillionaire, Astor kept his finger on the geopolitical pulse of competing nations and manipulated President Thomas Jefferson's interest in exploring the continent - all in order to create his personal beaver-trade empire.<br/>\"He did not mean to take for himself some of the wealth to be had from fur,\" Philip writes. \"He meant to have it all.\"<br/>Astor never saw the town that bears his name. But the beaver trade he drove became such big business that the species was extirpated - made locally extinct - on the East Coast by the mid-1800s and nearly extirpated on the West Coast by 1900.<br/>Transformation<br/>These days, Philip writes, Google Earth photography and artificial intelligence are working together to recognize hard-to-see beaver dam complexes from space. Scientists are eager to use that data to enlist free beaver labor on climate-mitigation projects such as restoring lost wetlands and improving water quality and forest-fire resiliency.<br/>\"Beaver wetlands are like speed bumps for fire,\" Philip said.<br/>Even from space, no computers are required to spot the largest animal construction project on Earth. It's a half-mile-long beaver dam - twice the length of the Hoover Dam - stretching along the southern edge of Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta, Canada.<br/>\"What beavers do is incredible,\" Philip said. \"They've done so much heavy lifting and now people are looking to them again, to help us out of the many overlapping messes we've made.\"<br/>One big mess, Philip said, is a May 2023 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that removes federal wetland protections from \"intermittent streams\" - streams that go dry in summer but flow reliably in winter.<br/>\"All over the West, you've got streams systems that dry up for part of the year,\" Philip said from her office in Connecticut where she lives, writes and teaches at the College of the Holy Cross. \"That's where beavers could be doing a lot of good.\"<br/>In Connecticut, Philip said, much woodland that was felled for agriculture centuries ago has regrown. Walking in one such patch of forest a few years ago, she started noticing telltale evidence of resurgent beaver activity in a formerly dry, brown, dead zone.<br/>\"Glinting with water and teeming with life\" is how she described the new pond - complete with one tenacious beaver swimming back and forth, unafraid of Philip and her dog, diligently focusing on the wetland-building work.<br/>\"It was the most incredible transformation I'd ever seen, but I really didn't know what I was witnessing yet,\" Philip said.<br/>The more she looked into the biology, mythology and fall-and-rise of the beaver, the more fascinated she became.<br/>Water managers<br/>Beavers are weird. Just check out their bizarre paddle-like tails, webbed toes, nearly human hands and gator-like swimming.<br/>\"They are this incredible mishmash of animal qualities,\" Philip said.<br/>All of those qualities make them nature's ideal water managers.<br/>\"They literally shaped our continent - the land, the watershed, the geology - over the course of millennia,\" she said. \"It's no exaggeration to say that beavers made America.\"<br/>They may even hold one key to saving America.<br/>A wetland is like a sponge, Philip said. In rainy seasons, that sponge absorbs and stores far more water than we can see - much of it deep below the surface. In dry seasons, the sponge disgorges the water, feeding streams and rivers at a slow pace.<br/>Philip said beavers were integral to building this natural water-management system - until they were driven close to extinction through trapping, hunting and, ultimately, habitat loss. Half of all North American wetlands have been lost to development, Philip said.<br/>\"We've taken away all these sponges,\" she said. \"Instead of all this water being absorbed into the ground where it recharges the groundwater, it's racing through the river system and causing a lot of damage.<br/>\"It's counterintuitive,\" she said. \"Rainstorms are getting more severe, but we have dwindling groundwater.\"<br/>Animals and us<br/>Philip's book isn't just about beavers. Many of its subjects are distinctly old-school outdoorspeople whose hobbies or professions include tracking, trapping and humanely relocating beavers - or killing them and trading their pelts. (When Philip walks into a gathering of such folks, she's immediately spotted and labeled an \"anti.\")<br/>Many such folks profess a spiritual connection to nature. That prompts some sincere soul-searching as Philip considers how removed she is from the tough realities of nature.<br/>\"I'm a journalist and I've learned not to judge,\" she said. \"I'm also an animal lover.\"<br/>In \"Beaverland,\" Philip outlines the unlikely history of wildlife conservation funding in America - which relies not just on license fees paid by hunters, trappers and anglers but excise taxes on gun sales.<br/>\"The entire scheme is weirdly American - and deeply counterintuitive to those who don't hunt, who can't see the logic in conserving wildlife so that hunters can have wildlife to kill, and recoil at the idea that the sale of weaponry helps preserve the lives of animals,\" she writes. \"But the program   has been fantastically successful.\"<br/>Other than beavers themselves, the real heroes in Philip's book are today's \"beaver believers\" - the growing number of people pursuing ecological balance with beavers through legislation, grassroots organizing and partnerships with government.<br/>Oregon recently deleted \"predatory\" from beavers' status and launched programs to restore habitat and encourage coexistence with people, Philip writes. California has taken similar actions.<br/>North-central Washington is the site of one of the first and best beaver-restoration efforts in the nation, Philip said. The Methow Beaver Project started in 2008 to relocate nuisance beavers to a remote landscape where their dam-building labor was welcome. Today, the ongoing Methow project bolsters its local beaver population in many different ways.<br/>Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, has proposed a Developing Alternative Mitigation Systems - DAMS - for Beavers Act, which would direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to fund beaver habitat projects across the nation and use nonlethal means to reduce beaver damage to private property.<br/>\"We urgently need to reset our relationship with the natural world,\" Philip said. \"It's no longer about having hope - it's about hope that leads us to action. We need to be learning from the beavers.\"<br/>Scott Hewitt: 360-735-4525; <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:scott.hewitt@columbian.com\">scott.hewitt@columbian.com</email><br/>IF YOU GO<br/>What: Leila Philip reads from her book \"Beaverland: How One Weird Rodent Made America\"<br/>When: 1 p.m. Saturday<br/>Where: Fort Vancouver Visitor Center, 1501 E.

The fire in the north of the island, which started late Tuesday, has forced the evacuation or confinement of nearly 8,000 people in eight municipalities. Television images and videos posted on social media showed the flames coming down the hill close to houses in small neighborhoods and a massive cloud of smoke rising from the area. </p><p>The fire is located up in a pine wooded mountain area with several municipalities on its flanks, including Arafo and Candelaria to the east, and La Orotava to the west. Army Capt. Rafael San Jos\u00c3\u00a9 told Spanish National Television that some progress had been made overnight in stopping the fire's spread but that rising temperatures during the day would increase difficulties. The Canary Islands have been in drought for most of the past few years, just like most of mainland Spain. The islands have recorded below-average rainfall in recent years, because of changing weather patterns affected by climate change. Canary Islands regional President Fernando Clavijo said late Thursday that the blaze, which has scorched 7,900 acres, was still very virulent but that fortunately, there had been no injuries so far. He said Friday's efforts would be crucial to containing the fire. The north of the island was forecast to have a maximum temperature of 84 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday with light winds at 12 mph, but temperatures were set to rise further over the weekend. The flames cover a perimeter of 25 miles encircling some 10,000 acres of land. Nearly 300 firefighters and Spanish army soldiers are in the area, which is in the northeast of the island, some 12 miles away from its main town, Santa Cruz. Tenerife is one of Europe's main tourist destinations. Its tourism office stressed Thursday that the most important tourist areas are far from the fire. Business continues as usual in accommodation establishments, beaches and other tourist sites near the coast and in the midlands, the office said. But access to the Teide National Park, the most important tourist attraction in Tenerife after the beaches, was closed Thursday evening, and all tourist facilities around the Teide volcano area, including accommodation, were to be evacuated. Clavijo said the fire is the worst in 40 years. He said the combination of extreme temperatures and the fire has turned the area into a virtual oven. The seven-island archipelago is located off the northwest coast of Africa and southwest of mainland Spain. More than 2,000 people were evacuated in a wildfire on the nearby La Palma island last month, which affected some 11,000 acres. Wildfires have burned almost 158,000 acres in Spain in the first seven months of the year, according to Spanish government data. That's the third-highest figure in the last decade. Spain accounted for almost 40 percent of the nearly 2 million acres that were burned in the European Union in 2022, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018a0910db03a3cedb57648d0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695W-7621-DY7N-F00N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 18, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The kayakers had spotted a blaze in the woods along their location on the Mullica River in the sprawling Wharton State Forest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Raudy had no idea whether the kayakers spotted a true forest fire, or maybe a large campfire. Pinelands Adventures organizes trips, rents boats, and offers guided tours and Raudy had a group camping overnight at the Mullica River Campground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just prior to the time of the text, a crew member of the Forest Fire Service in the Batsto Fire Tower had also spotted smoke and flames nearly 8 miles away.</p><p>New Jersey's largest blaze in 15 years had just been ignited at an illegal campsite and was racing toward key areas used by Pinelands Adventures and its customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'We just had to evacuate'</emphasis></p><p>\"The [New Jersey] Forest Fire Service hadn't called us yet,\" Raudy said. \"And we had no idea how far south it was spreading, or what direction it was traveling ... As far as we knew, we just had to evacuate those people.\"</p><p>Raudy and her staff called an emergency line to the fire service, jumped in trucks or buses and drove off to find the paddlers and campers - not a quick task considering the miles of meandering river that runs through dense brush, and the twisting, bumpy sand roads that lace the 123,000-acre forest.</p><p>The staff managed to extract all the customers safely in what ultimately roared into a 13,500 acre, multiday blaze that is still burning in small hot spots weeks later, but is 95% contained. Fire officials believe it was caused by an illegal campfire, but have not released its location. Hot, breezy conditions combined with extraordinary low humidity helped the fire spread quickly.</p><p>The conflagration was mostly confined to Wharton State Forest, which lies within the much larger Pinelands National Reserve, and contains some of the Pine Barrens' most visited areas, such as Batsto Village, Atsion Recreation Area, Apple Pie Hill, and Carranza Memorial. The Mullica, Batsto, and Oswego Rivers also run through it.</p><p>All of 18 structures, including some that are historical, survived.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service and Wharton State Forest staff cleared at least 50 trees that fell across a 4.6-mile stretch of the Mullica River from Constable Bridge to Lock's Bridge, a key area for Pinelands Adventures trips. Felled trees also blocked key portions of the Batsto River.</p><p>The state's Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the forest, started opening popular trails last weekend, such as the Batona, Tom's Pond, Mullica River, and the Batsto Red, White and Blue Trails - though Wharton State Forest officials note there is still some potential for trees to fall. And all trails from Atsion to Batsto, including mountain biking trails, remain closed as hot spots continue to burn. The Mullica River Campground will remain closed through July 15.</p><p>The fire forced Pinelands Adventures to close operations for two weeks until it reopened July</p><p>2. Overall, the outfitter had to cancel trips for 850 people. And many would-be customers have postponed trips, Raudy said, fearing they'd be kayaking through a barren, charred wilderness - which she says is not the case.</p><p>Pinelands Adventures is owned by the nonprofit Pinelands Preservation Alliance (PPA), an environmental group singled out by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service for helping restore trails and waterways after the blaze. The Outdoor Club of South Jersey, and the Jersey Off Road Bicycling Association also helped. All the groups depend on volunteers.</p><p>\"It really shut down people's ability to explore and enjoy the forest for almost two weeks,\" said Carleton Montgomery, the longtime director of the PPA. \"And that took away a big chunk of work for us. We were we were not able to take people canoeing and kayaking on the Batsto and Mullica Rivers. That was a blow to Pinelands Adventures. We lost a lot of customers.\"</p><p>PPA went to work helping the Forest Fire Service, though they didn't participate in firefighting.</p><p>\"Our staff helped to go out and identify small places where the fire will keep burning because the fire gets underground and among turf and root,\" Montgomery said. \"And we were given permission to work on the Batsto River to clear obstacles so that people can start enjoying it again.\"</p><p>Montgomery said the fire burned in what's known as a mosaic pattern - patches of blackened trees and ground alternating with areas still abundantly green.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Eerie and quiet'</emphasis></p><p>Rosemary \"Ro\" Mason, a trail maintenance leader for the Outdoor Club of South Jersey, said she was \"pleasantly surprised\" that the fire did less damage than originally feared when 18 structures were threatened, including those at historic Batsto Village, all of which were unscathed.</p><p>\"It was really eerie and quiet, and smoky in places,\" Mason said of the days after the fire when she and other volunteers helped restore a section of the Batona Trail, a 53-mile path that runs through Wharton, the Franklin Parker Preserve and Bass River State Forest. \"I could see little hot spots and thought it was really strange. You would see black, and then green, and then brown, and then black again. It had no rhyme nor reason.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forged in fire</emphasis></p><p>Last Friday, Andy Giles, director of Pinelands Adventures, drove his Land Rover along Quaker Bridge Road, a sand road that dates to the 18th century. He noted how, even among a desolate area of blackened, charred trees and vegetation, new growth is already poking through, including tiny pink oak leaves.</p><p>New Jersey's Pine Barrens are forged in fire, which is largely beneficial unless it threatens firefighters, people and buildings, Giles explained. In fact, Native Americans once burned sections to improve hunting conditions. The pitch pine trees that dominate the forest are highly flammable and depend on fire to release seeds from cones.</p><p>The bark of the pitch pines will char in a fire, but the trees will remain fully alive - unless the heat is extreme, as it was in some areas of the Mullica River blaze.</p><p>Giles pointed to the remains of a pine tree that had burned so badly most of its middle is gone. Those present the biggest danger right now, he said. Giles was walking his dog recently when a tree suddenly toppled in front of them.</p><p>\"Tree collapses might occur for weeks or months after a fire,\" he said. \"And that's why right now Lock's Bridge south on the Mullica River is still closed to paddlers.\" <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20220712Ar00101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65X3-YN21-DYJT-232N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1140\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 12, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000814</classCode><className>BOATING &amp;

The 2023 drill program to date has focused on the continued expansion of the Hinge Target located immediately west of the Eau Claire Deposit with the goal of updating the Eau Claire Mineral Resource Estimate at the end of the season. Drilling at the Hinge Target continues to return multiple stacked zones of gold mineralization from each drill hole including 5.0 metres (m) of 3.6 g/t Au within a broader interval of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au. </p><p>Additional drill intercepts include 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 1.0m of 10.35 g/t Au. Drill holes 23EC-063 and 23EC-064 have expanded the Hinge Target gold mineralization 50m up-dip and 75m to the west respectively. Drill hole 23EC-064 represents the first of a series of infill drill holes designed to tighten up the spacing of the 2022 Hinge Target drilling to a nominal spacing of 60-80m. Importantly, the broad intercepts of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au continue to show the overall strength of the mineralized system within the Hinge Target. These initial results provide confidence in the modeled sub-vertical geometry of the veining at the Hinge Target as the Company works towards a meaningful update to the currently defined Eau Claire Resource which was last estimated in 2018 at 853,000 ounces gold at an average grade of 6.18 g/t gold in the Measured and Indicated Category and 500,000 oz gold at 6.35 g/t gold in the inferred category. \"Fury is pleased to announce the initial drill results from our 2023 drill program at Eau Claire, as these results further confirm our thesis that the Eau Claire resource is open for significant expansion. Importantly, we have continued to extend the mineralized footprint at the Hinge Target and confirmed our geologic model,\" commented Tim Clark, CEO of Fury. \"The results of the first three 2023 drill holes at Eau Claire are also important as we prepare for our resource update at year-end. As for the impact of the forest fire, we had a four-week hold on operations, but we are now actively drilling at full capacity with a helicopter and two drills turning on the property. Investors should expect a steady flow of news through year-end from Eau Claire, Percival, and a number of strong prospective anomalies to the east. With a recent directors and management site visit behind us, the three takeaways were: the reminder of the incredible infrastructure backdrop that exists in the James Bay region, the visual size and scale of the Eau Claire project today, and the tremendous potential for discovery surrounding the 30 kilometres of the Cannard Deformation Zone.\"|</p><p>COMTEX_437769093/2422/2023-08-03T07:57:02</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-437769093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VN-2SH1-DYRK-84NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><timeReceived>7:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Fly</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 3, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000DR41</classCode><className>FURY GOLD MINES LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS213114 SUPPORT ACTIVITIES FOR METAL MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC1081 METAL MINING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FURY (TSXV)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FURY (NYSEAMEX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Ceo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Expansion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gold</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mining</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Quebec</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Result</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp;

Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon Friday. </p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year -- contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. -- with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control. </p><p>In the Northwest Territories alone, 268 wildfires have already burned more than 8,100 square miles. </p><p>Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta. </p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was convening an urgent meeting with ministers and senior officials Thursday to discuss the evacuation. </p><p>Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close within 24 hours as the Northwest Territories health authority starts to reduce its services. In-patient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital would be moved in the coming days, if required, and most long-term care patients were transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website. </p><p>Officials said evacuations have so far been safe and orderly, and that evacuees from Yellowknife who can't find their own accommodations can get support in three centers in the province of Alberta. The closest of those centers is more than 620 miles by road from Yellowknife. </p><p>Officials in Calgary said they're preparing to take in thousands of evacuees, and are opening a reception center at the Calgary airport, where five evacuation flights were expected to arrive Thursday. A second center has been set up at a hotel for those who drive to the city, said Iain Bushell, the city's director of  emergency management. </p><p>The evacuation order issued Wednesday night applies to the city of Yellowknife and the neighboring First Nations communities of Ndilo and Dettah. </p><p>Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire specialist with Parks Canada, has said the wildfires \"are so dangerous and so fast-moving\" that evacuations increasingly are necessary, which is a challenge in remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all. </p><p>Officials in British Columbia, where about 370 fires were burning, also braced for more evacuations, with the weather forecast for the next few days predicting dry lightning that could spark new blazes and brisk winds that could change direction quickly. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-6487817</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6901-2781-DYG9-60F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 17, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The 2023 drill program to date has focused on the continued expansion of the Hinge Target located immediately west of the Eau Claire Deposit with the goal of updating the Eau Claire Mineral Resource Estimate at the end of the season. Drilling at the Hinge Target continues to return multiple stacked zones of gold mineralization from each drill hole including 5.0 metres (m) of 3.6 g/t Au within a broader interval of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au. </p><p>Additional drill intercepts include 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 1.0m of 10.35 g/t Au. Drill holes 23EC-063 and 23EC-064 have expanded the Hinge Target gold mineralization 50m up-dip and 75m to the west respectively. Drill hole 23EC-064 represents the first of a series of infill drill holes designed to tighten up the spacing of the 2022 Hinge Target drilling to a nominal spacing of 60-80m. Importantly, the broad intercepts of 14.0m of 2.37 g/t Au, 6.0m of 2.77 g/t Au and 6.5m of 2.66 g/t Au continue to show the overall strength of the mineralized system within the Hinge Target. These initial results provide confidence in the modeled sub-vertical geometry of the veining at the Hinge Target as the Company works towards a meaningful update to the currently defined Eau Claire Resource which was last estimated in 2018 at 853,000 ounces gold at an average grade of 6.18 g/t gold in the Measured and Indicated Category and 500,000 oz gold at 6.35 g/t gold in the inferred category. \"Fury is pleased to announce the initial drill results from our 2023 drill program at Eau Claire, as these results further confirm our thesis that the Eau Claire resource is open for significant expansion. Importantly, we have continued to extend the mineralized footprint at the Hinge Target and confirmed our geologic model,\" commented Tim Clark, CEO of Fury. \"The results of the first three 2023 drill holes at Eau Claire are also important as we prepare for our resource update at year-end. As for the impact of the forest fire, we had a four-week hold on operations, but we are now actively drilling at full capacity with a helicopter and two drills turning on the property. Investors should expect a steady flow of news through year-end from Eau Claire, Percival, and a number of strong prospective anomalies to the east. With a recent directors and management site visit behind us, the three takeaways were: the reminder of the incredible infrastructure backdrop that exists in the James Bay region, the visual size and scale of the Eau Claire project today, and the tremendous potential for discovery surrounding the 30 kilometres of the Cannard Deformation Zone.\"|</p><p>COMTEX_437769093/2422/2023-08-03T07:57:02</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-437769093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VM-VB51-DYRK-82CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><timeReceived>7:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Fly</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 3, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000DR41</classCode><className>FURY GOLD MINES LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS213114 SUPPORT ACTIVITIES FOR METAL MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC1081 METAL MINING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FURY (TSXV)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FURY (NYSEAMEX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Ceo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Expansion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gold</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mining</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Quebec</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Result</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp;

Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With passage today in the U.S. House of Representatives, Congress is on track to approve a $467.5 billion 'minibus' appropriations package of six spending bills this week. The first batch of appropriations bills will fund a variety of key federal departments, agencies, and programs. The bills are: Agriculture; Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS); Energy-Water; Interior-Environment; Military Construction-Veterans Affairs (Milcon-VA); and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development (THUD).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Senate Republicans who want to join Democrats in actually governing must act and send this spending package to the President to be signed into law ahead of a March 8 deadline. Then, a second batch of outstanding appropriations bills must be acted on by March 22 to prevent a partial federal government shutdown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Chairman of the Legislative Branch subcommittee, helped include key funding for Rhode Island in the minibus bill. In addition to $122.7 million in federal earmarks for a variety of Rhode Island projects that Reed helped secure, Rhode Island's senior senator says the fiscal year 2024 minibus appropriations package will direct well over $1 billion to the Ocean State.</p><p>\"This legislation makes major investments in America and Rhode Island. It will help grow our economy and support working families. I'm pleased to include funds to upgrade roads and bridges, improve public health and safety, and help increase the supply of housing. The bill also delivers federal dollars to feed the hungry, protect our environment, and more,\" said Senator Reed. \"This is an impactful bill that makes wise investments. I worked with my colleagues to direct federal funds back to the state to strengthen communities and invest in Rhode Island priorities. Now that the House has acted, Senate Republicans must join Democrats to finish the job and work together on a bipartisan basis to help drive our economy forward. I'm committed to getting this bill across the finish line.\"</p><p>On a national scale, the minibus appropriations package makes substantial investments that will impact Rhode Island, including:</p><p>Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Related Agencies: $26.2 billion in total funding</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would receive $22.3 billion and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would get $3.5 billion. In Rhode Island, USDA funding has helped communities with a variety of programs, from assistance for local farms, tree planting, and growing the state's food economy to flood prevention and the purchase of new police cars.</p><p>This section of the bill will provide millions of dollars to the Ocean State for critical nutrition assistance programs, by fulling funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and Child Nutrition Programs--like the School Lunch program, school breakfast program, and the Summer EBT program--to ensure schools can continue to serve healthy meals to all eligible children. It also includes Reed's report language directing USDA to develop a plan to address factors limiting seafood consumption in schools.</p><p>Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies: $68.53 billion in discretionary funding</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) would get $37.52 billion to help keep Americans safe, uphold the rule of law, and invest in lifesaving DOJ grant programs. The U.S. Department of Commerce would receive $10.8 billion to promote and support American businesses and exports, spur economic development nationwide, and manage critical weather and ocean programs. The bill provides over $9 billion for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to promote discovery and American competitiveness and also supports space exploration under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p><p>Rhode Island utilizes CJS funding for a wide variety of priorities, including support for law enforcement, the justice system, and the U.S. Attorney's office, assistance to victims of domestic violence, to research grants for local universities, and economic development grants from the Department of Commerce.</p><p>Senator Reed also included a $5 million set aside for a pilot program based on the Collins-Reed Working Waterfront Preservation Act to provide federal grants for projects that preserve and improve infrastructure for fishing and maritime communities.</p><p>The overall bill also includes Reed's language to renew the Undetectable Firearms Act (UFA) for seven years. The UFA makes it illegal to manufacture, own, or sell a firearm that isn't detectable by a walk-through metal-detection machine and a scanning device.</p><p>Energy and Water Development: $58.19 billion in total funding for the Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and independent agencies</p><p>The bill includes about $50 billion for U.S. Department of Energy programs and over $8.5 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers. Rhode Island utilizes millions of dollars in funding under this section of the bill for a variety of clean energy research and renewable energy initiatives, grid infrastructure, as well as water infrastructure projects and port, harbor, and waterway maintenance.</p><p>Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies: $41.2 billion in total funding</p><p>The bill includes federal funding for the U.S. Department of the Interior, including the National Park Service; the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH); and more.</p><p>In Rhode Island, this translates to funding for things like the state's national wildlife refuges and national parks; the state's Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRFs); beach protection grants; environmental protection measures; Brownfields clean up grants; and forest fire prevention as well as funds for artistic and cultural programs through the NEA and NEH.</p><p>Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies: $135.25 billion in non-defense discretionary funding and $172.5 billion in mandatory funding, to fulfill our nation's obligations to our veterans and to upgrade housing for service members and their families</p><p>This funding goes to help the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) care for veterans, including medical care, mental health, and telehealth services. The bill fully funds veterans' medical care and benefits and delivers historic investments to increase mental health services for veterans, help end veteran homelessness, and support women veterans' health care. The bill also fully funds the Honoring Our PACT Act to assist veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, and provides funding for veterans cemeteries, disability benefits, and education and workforce initiatives.</p><p>The bill also provides funds for the Department of Defense (DOD) for the planning and construction of several military projects, including $30 million for a new National Guard Readiness Center in North Kingstown and up to $1.9 million in planning and design funds for facility upgrades at the Camp Fogarty Training Site. It also helps with cleanup of per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals.</p><p>Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies: $106 billion in total funding for Transportation and $70.07 billion for Housing and Urban Development</p><p>A former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Senator Reed played an important role in crafting key pieces of the bill that will benefit Rhode Island and make critical investments in America's infrastructure. This section of the bill provides critical funding for Rhode Island transportation, housing, and economic development programs. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) and Rhode Island Department of Housing (RIDOH) utilize this federal funding to upgrade the state's infrastructure, improve mobility, and enhance economic opportunity and smart growth.</p><p>On the transportation side, Senator Reed estimates Rhode Island will receive well over $300 million for federal highways, bridge repairs, and transportation safety programs. The bill invests in transportation infrastructure, and, when combined with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) investments, will provide a total of $1.845 billion in RAISE Grants in fiscal year 2024. Last year, Rhode Island won a $25 million RAISE grant to enhance the heavily trafficked Route 37. It also sets aside funding to hire more air traffic controllers and rail safety inspectors. It includes key Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funds to benefit T.F. Green International Airport as well as funds for Amtrak. The bill will also provide critical funding for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority's (RIPTA) capital expenses.</p><p>On the Housing side, the bill protects vital rental assistance to help millions of households keep a roof over their head and invests in key programs to help build more housing. It includes sustained investments in the HOME program and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which give local governments needed resources to develop their communities, support businesses, create jobs, and ensure the availability of decent, affordable housing. Senator Reed also led efforts to include funding to address lead poisoning.</p><p>Notably, the bill also includes an extension of funding for Community Health Centers, National Health Service Corps, Teaching Health Centers, the Special Diabetes Program, and a temporary increase in Medicare physician reimbursement rates, among other Medicare payment policies through December 31, 2024.</p><p>Now that the minibus appropriations bill has been approved by the House, it must also be cleared by the U.S. Senate before it can be sent to President Biden to be signed into law.</p><p>Next, Congress must take up and pass the remaining six appropriations bills, which include: Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Labor-Health, Human Services, and Education (LHHSE); Legislative Branch; and State and Foreign Operations.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-ri-to-receive-over-1-billion-from-initial-minibus-appropriations-package\">https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-ri-to-receive-over-1-billion-from-initial-minibus-appropriations-package</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8518824 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8518824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BH2-HB31-DYG2-R183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1740\"/><timeReceived>6:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 6, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The bills are: Agriculture; Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS); Energy-Water; Interior-Environment; Military Construction-Veterans Affairs (Milcon-VA); and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development (THUD).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Senate Republicans who want to join Democrats in actually governing must act and send this spending package to the President to be signed into law ahead of a March 8 deadline. Then, a second batch of outstanding appropriations bills must be acted on by March 22 to prevent a partial federal government shutdown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Chairman of the Legislative Branch subcommittee, helped include key funding for Rhode Island in the minibus bill. In addition to $122.7 million in federal earmarks for a variety of Rhode Island projects that Reed helped secure, Rhode Island's senior senator says the fiscal year 2024 minibus appropriations package will direct well over $1 billion to the Ocean State.</p><p>\"This legislation makes major investments in America and Rhode Island. It will help grow our economy and support working families. I'm pleased to include funds to upgrade roads and bridges, improve public health and safety, and help increase the supply of housing. The bill also delivers federal dollars to feed the hungry, protect our environment, and more,\" said Senator Reed. \"This is an impactful bill that makes wise investments. I worked with my colleagues to direct federal funds back to the state to strengthen communities and invest in Rhode Island priorities. Now that the House has acted, Senate Republicans must join Democrats to finish the job and work together on a bipartisan basis to help drive our economy forward. I'm committed to getting this bill across the finish line.\"</p><p>On a national scale, the minibus appropriations package makes substantial investments that will impact Rhode Island, including:</p><p>Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Related Agencies: $26.2 billion in total funding</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would receive $22.3 billion and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would get $3.5 billion. In Rhode Island, USDA funding has helped communities with a variety of programs, from assistance for local farms, tree planting, and growing the state's food economy to flood prevention and the purchase ofnew police cars.</p><p>This section of the bill will provide millions of dollars to the Ocean State for critical nutrition assistance programs, by fulling funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and Child Nutrition Programslike the School Lunch program, school breakfast program, and the Summer EBT programto ensure schools can continue to serve healthy meals to all eligible children. It also includes Reed's report language directing USDA to develop a plan to address factors limiting seafood consumption in schools.</p><p>Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies: $68.53 billion in discretionary funding</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) would get $37.52 billion to help keep Americans safe, uphold the rule of law, and invest in lifesaving DOJ grant programs. The U.S. Department of Commerce would receive $10.8 billion to promote and support American businesses and exports, spur economic development nationwide, and manage critical weather and ocean programs. The bill provides over $9 billion for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to promote discovery and American competitiveness and also supports space exploration under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p><p>Rhode Island utilizes CJS funding for a wide variety of priorities, including support for law enforcement, the justice system, and the U.S. Attorney's office, assistance to victims of domestic violence, to research grants for local universities, and economic development grants from the Department of Commerce.</p><p>Senator Reed also included a $5 million set aside for a pilot program based on the Collins-Reed Working Waterfront Preservation Act to provide federal grants for projects that preserve and improve infrastructure for fishing and maritime communities.</p><p>The overall bill also includes Reed's language to renew the Undetectable Firearms Act (UFA) for seven years. The UFA makes it illegal to manufacture, own, or sell a firearm that isn't detectable by a walk-through metal-detection machine and a scanning device.</p><p>Energy and Water Development: $58.19 billion in total funding for the Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and independent agencies</p><p>The bill includes about $50 billion for U.S. Department of Energy programs and over $8.5 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers.

That means that fine particulate matter wafting across the border is looking to be cut nearly in half from a hazy Monday that saw much of the area closer to an AQI of 150 or above.</p><p>When areas are designated orange, that means the air quality is of particular concern for the elderly, young children and people with preexisting respiratory conditions, including COPD, asthma and emphysema. Those vulnerable groups are advised to limit their time spent outside.</p><p>Yellow designations indicate that fine particulate matter is at a concentration that's generally acceptable, but possibly of concern for those with respiratory issues.</p><p>Wildfires continue to blaze across Canada, with 888 active fires reported by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre on Monday - up by 10 new fires in just one day. But while the smoke that saw air quality plummet in Western Pennsylvania in June originated in eastern Canada, largely from Quebec, this time around the pollutants are heading west to east.</p><p>Sunday evening saw Code Reds in Midwestern cities including Chicago.

According to news reporting originating from Split, Croatia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The Internet of Things (IoT) technology with wearable devices provides a promising solution that enables con-tinuous monitoring of health parameters. Non-invasive sensors enable remote health monitoring and improve many aspects of life quality.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Croatian Science Foundation. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of Split, \"The study explores advances in IoT and Wearable Devices through a conceptuali-zation of health monitoring observer networks. The paper proposes an architecture inspired by a formal description of human perception, which has been successfully employed in environmental monitoring and can be adapted to healthcare for better integration and comprehension of patient health data. The proposed architecture involves a three-layer ap-proach Sensors, Integration and Association and Application and Diagnostic, similar to the architecture used in forest fire monitoring. The Sensors layer describes state-of-the-art cutting-edge equip-ment and related sensors for gathering information. The second layer, Integration and Association propose an ontology and a potential solution for integrat-ing sensor information from the device to the cloud. Furthermore, the third layer, Application and Diagnostic gives a review of used machine learning algorithms for detecting and diagnosing various diseases. Finally, a case study of elderly health monitoring using wearable devices is pre-sented, discussing the methodology for economic value calcu-lation to decrease the cost of efficient health management and improve quality of life.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The use of a health monitoring observer network not only improves quality of life, but also reduces the cost of health monitoring, making it more sustainable for the general community.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Iot and Health Monitoring Wearable Devices As Enabling Technologies for Sustainable Enhancement of Life Quality In Smart Environments.

The particles, known as PM2.5, are tiny enough to get deep into the lungs and cause short-term problems like coughing and itchy eyes, and in the long run, can affect the lungs and heart.</p><p>The EPA advises keeping outdoor activities light and short when air quality indexes reach above 150 on the agency's map. On Monday afternoon, cities and regions hitting that mark included Lincoln, Nebraska; Peoria, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Cleveland and Columbus in Ohio; Huntsville, Alabama; Knoxville and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Greensboro, North Carolina; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Syracuse and Utica in New York.</p><p>Sensitive groups, including people with heart and lung disease, older adults, children and pregnant women, should consider staying inside, advisories warn.</p><p>Although air quality was poor in the Chicago region earlier Monday, it has already improved to moderate quality and was expected to continue doing so throughout the day, Biggs said.</p><p>Relief from the smoke crossing the Canadian-U.S. border won't be immediate, experts said. Large fires in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan are likely to keep churning out smoke throughout the summer and possibly into early fall, said Montana Department of Environmental Quality meteorologist Aaron Ofseyer.</p><p>\u201cThe worst is over with this round,\u201d Ofseyer said. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s still a ton of wildfire smoke north of the border. Anytime we get a North wind we\u2019re going to be dealing with Canadian wildfire smoke.\u201d</p><p>Climate change and rising temperatures cause the environment to be more prone to wildfires, and more susceptible for air masses to become stagnant and stationary, explained Dr. Ravi Kalhan, a pulmonologist and professor of medicine and preventative medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canadian-wildfires-chicago-smoke-air-quality-aqi-e120fa48b44e6c8560b13712ba76ee1d\">repeated air quality alerts experienced by the Midwest</url> this summer.</p><p>\u201cWe keep having these events.

Dozens of flyers with pictures of lost animals plaster the walls around him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins school is usually closed this time of the year for the summer holidays, which run from December to February in Chile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But this year, the school is not empty. Instead, its classrooms are a blur of activity, as veterinarians use them to house a makeshift clinic for animals hurt in the country's  .</p><p>More than 130 people   in the blazes, which sparked on February 3. In three short days, the fires spread over 9,215 hectares (22,773 acres) of densely populated land, reducing neighbourhoods in cities like Vi\u00f1a del Mar to ash.</p><p>President Gabriel Boric called it the 'greatest tragedy' the country has endured since a 2010 earthquake left more than 500 people dead. The United Nations<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undrr.org/news/undrr-statement-chile-forest-fires\">noted</url>  it was likely the country's deadliest forest fire on record.</p><p>The neighbourhood of El Olivar in the coastal city of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile, was among those devastated by the wildfires [Charis McGowan/Al Jazeera]</p><p>Gajardo's home was among those consumed by the flames. His parents, brother and sister managed to escape to safety in their car, but their poodle Nala and cat Max fled the house in fear before the family could catch them, running into the chaos of the fiery night.</p><p>Four days later, Nala found her way back to the ashen shell that had once been her home. She was weary, dehydrated and dust-covered, but miraculously uninjured.</p><p>But Max, a ginger cat with white paws, remains missing.</p><p>For Gajardo, finding Max is now of the utmost importance. So much has disappeared in the flames, never to return: family photos, heirlooms, items accumulated over a lifetime.</p><p>But the prospect of recovering Max gives Gajardo hope. He has shared photos of the ginger cat with online groups that popped up after the fire to reconnect lost pets with their owners.</p><p>'Max is a grumpy guy, you can see by his expression,' Gajardo said lovingly, showing Al Jazeera a snapshot of the rumple-faced cat. 'I've missed him. I'd put him around my neck. He'd sleep in our rooms.'</p><p>A glimmer of possibility has brought Gajardo to the O'Higgins school: Earlier in the morning, the clinic had called to tell him they had recovered a cat matching Max's description.</p><p>Gajardo arrived straightaway, anxious to see if it was indeed Max. 'I hope it's him,' he said, waiting patiently in the empty hall.</p><p>Margarita Herrera, left, holds her pitbull Nitro still for an inspection in the hard-hit neighbourhood of El Olivar in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Chile [Charis McGowan/Al Jazeera]</p><p>Addressing the trauma</p><p>To the east of the clinic, on the hillsides overlooking the city, sits the neighbourhood of El Olivar, one of the areas hardest hit by the fires.</p><p>Residents there have had to sweep away piles of debris \u2014 the remains of their former houses \u2014 in order to make space for makeshift tents, made of tarpaulin sheets.</p><p>Margarita Herrera is among them. In the rubble of her home, she stood next to her pet bulldog, Nitro. In the corner of his eye loomed a pink bulb, swollen and sore: His tear duct had become infected since the fire.</p><p>As the swelling grew and grew, Herrera became worried that the toxic ash was making Nitro's infection worse. Last week, she put out a call for help on the social media platform TikTok.</p><p>'He could lose his eye. We can rebuild our house, but we can't bring back his eye,' said Herrera, with Nitro sitting dutifully at her feet.</p><p>Going to a pet clinic was not an option, Herrera explained as she crouched down to pat Nitro's head. If she leaves the area, looters might rummage through her few remaining belongings: 'They'd rob the little we have left.'</p><p>Kelly Donithan, the director of global disaster response for the Humane International Society, an animal welfare nonprofit, was among those who arrived to help Nitro and other animals in the neighbourhood.</p><p>She acknowledged the high death toll from the wildfire \u2014 but she added that helping injured pets is a way of caring for human survivors, too.</p><p>'Responding and helping animals is not mutually exclusive of helping people. We are not taking any resources away from the humanitarian response,' explained Donithan.</p><p>'While it's very important to help these animals just for their own sake, it also supports human resiliency and recovery from trauma.'</p><p>Donithan ultimately put Nitro on a list for surgery at the school clinic. Hearing the news, Herrera broke into a smile, visibly relieved. 'He's our baby,' she said of Nitro.</p><p>Surveys indicate Chile has a relatively high rate of dog ownership compared with other countries worldwide [Charis McGowan/Al Jazeera]</p><p>A haven for dog lovers</p><p>Chile is known for its love of animals. A 2022 poll found that eight out of every 10 Chileans are pet owners, and the country famously has a high dog-to-human ratio.</p><p>In a country of 19.6 million people, there are 8.3 million pet dogs, according to a government ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uc.cl/noticias/veterinaria-uc-existen-12-millones-de-perros-y-gatos-con-duenos-en-chile-y-4-millones-sin-ellos/\">census</url> ' of household animals. Another 3.46 million are strays.</p><p>According to the Financial Times, the market research company Euromonitor even ranked Chile as having the highest percentage of dog ownership in the world, surpassing larger economies like Brazil and the United States in 2017.</p><p>While there are no official statistics on the number of pets injured in this year's fires, Lukas Garcia, a veterinarian born and raised in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, said he and his colleagues have treated more than 120 animals so far.</p><p>Garcia explained he is one of five full-time veterinarians employed by the municipal government to assist with the disaster response. Volunteers from private clinics and veterinary students were also on hand to help.</p><p>He added that the number of animals they've attended is likely to be far lower than the total number hurt. He credited that to one simple reason: Many didn't survive.</p><p>Deputy Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve put the number of houses damaged or destroyed as high as 14,000.</p><p>The fires come less than two years after   scorched the same region in December 2022. Chile is currently experiencing an  , exacerbated by climate change and the higher temperatures brought by the  .</p><p>'Vi\u00f1a has suffered fires before, but never as big as this,' Garcia said.</p><p>Alma Ortega has taken residence in an emergency shelter with her pet dog, whose paws were burned in the fire [Charis McGowan/Al Jazeera]</p><p>Limited shelter options</p><p>As he spoke to Al Jazeera, Garcia tended to pets at the Colombian Republic School in Vi\u00f1a del Mar. There, the government had established an emergency shelter for residents left homeless. It is one of the few shelters that accepts pets.</p><p>Dog owner Alma Ortega had temporarily moved into the school with her partner, child and parents-in-law. They shared a classroom to sleep in with another family.</p><p>Ortega said her house in the Villa Independencia neighbourhood had completely burned down in the fires.</p><p>'It happened in a matter of minutes,' she said. 'We saw ash falling from the sky, and then the house was on fire.'</p><p>She managed to escape the building with her family and two dogs. But one of the dogs, an Akita named Black, wriggled loose and ran back into the smoke.</p><p>'We found him three days later with his paws entirely burned,' Ortega said. 'He was in agony. He couldn't move.'</p><p>She watched as Garcia tenderly changed Black's bandages. It was a trying time for her family: Students will return to classes next week, so the shelters and clinics will have to relocate soon. As of yet, new locations have yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Black lifted his bandaged paw towards Ortega, who gently took it in her hand. Despite the uncertainty, she said she felt hopeful.</p><p>'What's important is that we're all OK,' she said, crouching down to hug her dog.</p><p>Workers at a makeshift animal clinic in the city of Vi\u00f1a del Mar towel off a ginger cat recovered after Chile's wildfires [Charis McGowan/Al Jazeera]</p><p>Searching for Max</p><p>Back at the O'Higgins school, Gajardo waits for a status update, as municipal vets and volunteers check on the ginger cat in their custody.</p><p>A clinic representative finally approaches Gajardo to reveal an unexpected hiccup: The cat is female \u2014 and she is pregnant. It isn't Max after all.</p><p>The unknown cat will stay in the clinic until she safely delivers her babies. Hopefully, the clinic representative explains, the team can locate her owner.</p><p>Gajardo picks up his empty cat carrier and texts his mother the disappointing news. He isn't discouraged, though. He will keep searching until Max is back with the family.</p><p>'We have to stay hopeful,' he said.

The three railroad employees were taken to the hospital. </p><p>Preliminary assessment pointed to a buildup of \"melting ice and debris that washed out part of the railroad track\" as a possible cause of the accident, the Forest Service added. </p><p>Some hazardous materials were on board the train, the agency said, but officials on the scene assessed that they were not at risk of leaking or catching fire. </p><p>C. Doniele Carlson, the director of communications for Canadian Pacific Kansas City, also confirmed the derailment about 15 miles east of Jackman and said the hazardous elements of the train's cargo were not involved in the fire. </p><p>\"Our emergency response teams and hazardous materials experts have responded and continue to conduct a full assessment of the situation,\" Carlson said in a statement. \"There are no evacuations and no threat to public safety.\" </p><p>The fire and rescue department in nearby Rockwood posted a photo of the derailment on its Facebook page and advised residents to stay away from the area.  </p><p>Rockwood, about 90 miles northwest of Bangor, is a village in Somerset County with about 300 residents. Located on the western side of Moosehead Lake, one of the state's largest freshwater bodies, it's a destination for salmon and trout fishing on both the lake and the Moose River. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-6106149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:681J-NJH1-DYCW-C515-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"309\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 15, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

First, whenever there is money and power, there will be corruption. It is sad, but true. And it requires vigilance. Second, whenever people talk about union corruption, if they don't talk about corporate America is infinitely more corrupt, they are also dishonest actors. But damn it, when you see union corruption stamp it out like a spark that can cause a forest fire. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article276082196.html\">As we are seeing with the Boilermakers.</url></p><p>The longtime president of the Boilermakers union, with international headquarters in Kansas City, Kansas, has been ousted by his own executive council, accused of misappropriating union funds for personal use. Newton B. Jones, who has led the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers since his father retired in 2003, was removed from office following a hearing last week. The action came after the union's executive council found he had violated a section of the Boilermaker's constitution dealing with the misuse of funds. Jones was ordered to reimburse the union 'all of the funds which he misspent as reflected in these charges' and to immediately resign from all of his other positions, including serving as a trustee of all funds in which the union participates.</p><p>'The drastic action of removing President Jones immediately and directing other actions is clearly necessary because of the seriousness of these allegations and the harm to our membership,' three executive committee members said in their formal document issued Thursday. 'This misuse is shocking.' The action to remove Jones comes as a federal criminal investigation into union activities is underway, The Star has learned. Several sources confirmed that they have been interviewed by the FBI in recent weeks. The union's executive committee found that Jones ordered the union to pay his wife, Kateryna, more than $100,000 plus benefits 'for apparently no union purpose while she was living in the Ukraine' and spent more than $20,000 in union funds for flights to Ukraine 'to visit his wife and to go to the home which he owns in the Ukraine.' Jones and his wife also turned in about $40,000 in receipts for meals in North Carolina \u2014 some 'quite lavish and expensive' \u2014 with no justification for the expenses.</p><p>Also, union presidencies should never, ever, under any circumstances, be passed down from parent to child (though who am I kidding, it's always father to son).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2023/06/stamping-out-union-corruption\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXLG-LGAM101153168676293522725876100059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LGAM-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G1-9611-JCMN-Y3NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484261</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"413\"/><timeReceived>5:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The particles, known as PM2.5, are tiny enough to get deep into the lungs and cause short-term problems like coughing and itchy eyes, and in the long run, can affect the lungs and heart.</p><p>The EPA advises keeping outdoor activities light and short when air quality indexes reach above 150 on the agency's map. On Monday afternoon, cities and regions hitting that mark included Lincoln, Nebraska; Peoria, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Cleveland and Columbus in Ohio; Huntsville, Alabama; Knoxville and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Greensboro, North Carolina; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Syracuse and Utica in New York.</p><p>Sensitive groups, including people with heart and lung disease, older adults, children and pregnant women, should consider staying inside, advisories warn.</p><p>Although air quality was poor in the Chicago region earlier Monday, it has already improved to moderate quality and was expected to continue doing so throughout the day, Biggs said.</p><p>Relief from the smoke crossing the Canadian-U.S. border won't be immediate, experts said. Large fires in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan are likely to keep churning out smoke throughout the summer and possibly into early fall, said Montana Department of Environmental Quality meteorologist Aaron Ofseyer.</p><p>\u201cThe worst is over with this round,\u201d Ofseyer said. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s still a ton of wildfire smoke north of the border.

Over 5000 wildfires have started in Canada this year, according to the CIFFC.1 </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2023, Canada has seen over 13 million hectares (HA) burned by wildfire \u2013 Almost double the previous high of 7.1 million HA in 1995.1 </p><p>With this increase in wildfires, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reports eye health experts are worried on the long-term impacts the smoke could have on the eye. </p><p>\"There's particulate matter, volatile organic compounds,\" said Marisa Sit, MD, FRSCS, a Toronto ophthalmologist with the University Health Network's Comprehensive Ophthalmology Unit at the Donald K. Johnson Eye Institute. \"These are things [in the smoke] that can irritate our eyes.\" </p><p>According to Vancouver ophthalmologist Briar Sexton, MD, eye symptoms such as dry, itchy, red, painful, watery and gritty eyes can happen before the smoke is even noticeable. </p><p>\"When I first moved to [British Columbia] and started practicing in 2006, we weren't talking about wildfires anywhere near the way that we are now,\" said Sexton. \"The amount of exposure any single individual would get was actually quite minimal compared to [what] they are getting in hot spots these days.\" </p><p>Sexton told the CBC that she has had numerous patients complaining about irritated eyes, and that she is not clear what lasting damage the wildfire smoke could have on the eye. </p><p>CBC spoke with numerous doctors who studied pollutants with similar components to wildfire smoke. These doctors mentioned that cigarette smoke has been found to be a risk factor for macular degeneration and an increased risk of cataracts. </p><p>\"If I had a magic crystal ball, I do think those are things we're unfortunately going to see being linked to wildfire regions in higher incidences in the future,\" Sexton said to the CBC. </p><p>A recent review on the wildfires that swept across Australia in 2020 concluded that \"there is strong evidence that wildfire smoke and other air pollution sources have harmful effects on ocular surface, causing eye symptoms and changes to normal function of the ocular surface.\" However, the same review stressed that \"it is not yet known whether repeated or long-term smoke exposure carries an increased risk long term of ocular surface disease.\"2 </p><p>One of the authors of the review, Suki Jaiswal, MOptom, an optometrist in Sydney, Australia, has decided to conduct further studies on the impact of wildfire smoke on the eyes. </p><p>Jaiswal is looking at the short and long-term impacts wildfire smoke can have on each individual part of the eye and how long recovery takes. She is taking a larger focus on groups like firefighters that are frequently exposed. </p><p>Jaiswal uses a pair of goggles that release small amounts of smoke and wants to identify who is most at risk and whether any of the damage incurred is reversible. </p><p>\"If we don't have a uniform understanding of how we should protect the eyes and how we should manage any eye disease that does occur from wildfire exposure, I think our patients are going to suffer,\" Jaiswal said. </p><p>VSP Vision has listed ways to limit exposure to wildfire smoke and prevent eye irritation:3 </p><p>* Use lubricating eye drops or artificial tears to keep your eyes refreshed and help get rid of dust and particles that can irritate eyes. </p><p>* Don't rub your eyes. You might transfer dust and ash from your hands or face to your eyes and that could scratch or irritate them. It's also helpful to wash your hands regularly. </p><p>* Keep windows and doors closed to keep the air indoors clean. Running your air conditioner may also help but be sure to keep the fresh air intake closed and the filter clean to prevent bringing in additional smoke. However, if it's too warm to stay indoors with the windows and doors closed and you do not have air conditioning, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends seeking shelter elsewhere. </p><p>* The CDC also recommends limiting indoor air pollution by refraining from using anything that burns, like fireplaces, gas stoves and candles. Vacuums can also stir up dust already present in your home. Air filters are also recommended for those with respiratory conditions. </p><p>What makes wildfire smoke so toxic? </p><p>Wildfire smoke comprises of thousands of compounds including solid matter (particles, embers, heavy metals, organic microorganisms), water vapor and a complex mix of gaseous compounds. </p><p>\"Wildfire smoke itself is quite a complex mixture and it's made up of fine particles \u2026 and a number of other gases, which are toxic, mainly due to the fact that wildfires burn everything so more toxic than household fires because everything has been burned,\" Kimberly Humphrey, MD, MPH, a climate change and human health fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told ABC News. </p><p>Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is a key component of wildfire smoke. PM2.5 refers to particles smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm in size and PM10 refers to particles smaller than 10 \u03bcm in size. PM2.5 is considered to be proxy measure for air pollution.2 </p><p>Because these particles are too small to be seen with the naked eye, they can easily enter the nose and throat and can travel to the lungs, with some of the smallest particles even circulating in the bloodstream, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.5 </p><p>A study from California in 2021, found that PM2.5 particles from wildfires can be up to 10 times more harmful than the same type of air pollution coming from combustion activity.4 </p><p>References: </p><p>1.

According to news reporting from Shanghai, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Many remote sensing applications, such as the forest fire monitoring, need to send a large volume of data to the ground with low delay. Therefore, the cooperation transmission, which relies on cooperation among satellites to achieve continuous transmission, emerges as an indispensable technique.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) AI, National Key Research and Development Program of China, Huawei Technologies. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from East China Normal University, \"Most existing work cannot optimize the delay through dynamic cooperation transmission. In this paper, we investigate how to optimize the delay in remote sensing satellite networks based on cooperation transmission, where cooperation hotspots refer to the satellites with ground-satellite links to the Earth Stations (ESs). First, we propose the cooperation capability model to quantify capabilities of cooperation hotspots, based on the joint control of the dynamic topology and time-varying available resources. Then, we uniformly model the inter-satellite routing and satellite-ES transmission scheduling, formulate the satellite cooperation transmission problem and prove its NP-hardness. To solve the problem, we propose the delay-optimal cooperation transmission scheme, including the cooperation routing principle based on topology features, the centralized cooperation transmission (CCT) algorithm based on randomized rounding and the distributed cooperation transmission (DCT) based on local information. Both algorithms take advantage of the cooperation capability model and adapt well to the dynamic topology and time-varying available resources. Finally, we formally analyze the approximation ratios and the time complexities of both the CCT and the DCT algorithms. We also prove that the DCT algorithm always setups loop-free paths.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"NS2-based simulation results demonstrate that our schemes have good scalability, and both CCT and DCT algorithms reduce the end-to-end delay on average by more than 21.77% compared to work in the state-of-the-art, and significantly improve throughput, packet loss rate and flow completion time.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Delay-optimal Cooperation Transmission In Remote Sensing Satellite Networks.

This period of cooler temperatures and lower humidity also signals the start of Kentucky's Forest Fire Hazard Season. From October 1 to December 15, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service encourages visitors to take care to recreate responsibly and reduce their risk of starting a forest fire.</p><p>\"In Kentucky, forest fires are more than 99% human-caused,\" said E.J. Bunzendahl, Daniel Boone National Forest Fire Management Officer. \"That doesn't always mean arson. In the Daniel Boone National Forest, most of our recent forest fire activity has been from abandoned or escaped campfires. Knowing the correct way to set up and extinguish a campfire is a big first step to reducing the risk of a forest fire.\"</p><p>A spark can quickly ignite fallen leaves and flames can move rapidly through drying vegetation in the Forest. To prevent a campfire from causing an accidental forest fire, the Forest Service recommends:</p><p>* Building campfires in existing fire pits or in clear spaces at least 15 feet away from branches or shrubs.</p><p>* Avoiding campfires in windy conditions where sparks can easily be carried to nearby fuels.</p><p>* Never leaving a campfire unattended or letting it grow out of control.</p><p>* Ensuring a campfire is completely extinguished before leaving by covering it with dirt or water, stirring the ashes around, and dousing it again. If the ashes still feel warm to the back of a hand, repeat the process until they are cold.</p><p>Forest visitors should also plan around fire season burning restrictions. From October 1 to December 15, it is illegal under Kentucky state law to burn anything within 150 feet of any woodland or brushland between the daylight hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Additional burning restrictions bans may be put in place as conditions change throughout the season.</p><p>Visitors are encouraged to report abandoned or uncontrolled campfires or burn restriction violations to local law enforcement. Suspicious acts of arson should be directed to the nearest Kentucky State Police post or the Target Arson Hotline at 1-800-27-ARSON.</p><p>\"Fall is a beautiful time to visit the Daniel Boone National Forest,\" said Bunzendahl. \"But it can also be a dangerous time. Following burn restrictions, staying responsible with campfires, and avoiding activities that may create a spark, like idling a vehicle on dry vegetation, help reduce the fire risk to, not only the Forest, but also our surrounding communities.\" For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR3937920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63SW-28P1-JDKC-R4Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><timeReceived>9:42 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 HT Media Ltd.

Over 5000 wildfires have started in Canada this year, according to the CIFFC.1 </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2023, Canada has seen over 13 million hectares (HA) burned by wildfire \u2013 Almost double the previous high of 7.1 million HA in 1995.1 </p><p>With this increase in wildfires, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reports eye health experts are worried on the long-term impacts the smoke could have on the eye. </p><p>\"There's particulate matter, volatile organic compounds,\" said Marisa Sit, MD, FRSCS, a Toronto ophthalmologist with the University Health Network's Comprehensive Ophthalmology Unit at the Donald K. Johnson Eye Institute. \"These are things [in the smoke] that can irritate our eyes.\" </p><p>According to Vancouver ophthalmologist Briar Sexton, MD, eye symptoms such as dry, itchy, red, painful, watery and gritty eyes can happen before the smoke is even noticeable. </p><p>\"When I first moved to [British Columbia] and started practicing in 2006, we weren't talking about wildfires anywhere near the way that we are now,\" said Sexton. \"The amount of exposure any single individual would get was actually quite minimal compared to [what] they are getting in hot spots these days.\" </p><p>Sexton told the CBC that she has had numerous patients complaining about irritated eyes, and that she is not clear what lasting damage the wildfire smoke could have on the eye. </p><p>CBC spoke with numerous doctors who studied pollutants with similar components to wildfire smoke. These doctors mentioned that cigarette smoke has been found to be a risk factor for macular degeneration and an increased risk of cataracts. </p><p>\"If I had a magic crystal ball, I do think those are things we're unfortunately going to see being linked to wildfire regions in higher incidences in the future,\" Sexton said to the CBC. </p><p>A recent review on the wildfires that swept across Australia in 2020 concluded that \"there is strong evidence that wildfire smoke and other air pollution sources have harmful effects on ocular surface, causing eye symptoms and changes to normal function of the ocular surface.\" However, the same review stressed that \"it is not yet known whether repeated or long-term smoke exposure carries an increased risk long term of ocular surface disease.\"2 </p><p>One of the authors of the review, Suki Jaiswal, MOptom, an optometrist in Sydney, Australia, has decided to conduct further studies on the impact of wildfire smoke on the eyes. </p><p>Jaiswal is looking at the short and long-term impacts wildfire smoke can have on each individual part of the eye and how long recovery takes. She is taking a larger focus on groups like firefighters that are frequently exposed. </p><p>Jaiswal uses a pair of goggles that release small amounts of smoke and wants to identify who is most at risk and whether any of the damage incurred is reversible. </p><p>\"If we don't have a uniform understanding of how we should protect the eyes and how we should manage any eye disease that does occur from wildfire exposure, I think our patients are going to suffer,\" Jaiswal said. </p><p>VSP Vision has listed ways to limit exposure to wildfire smoke and prevent eye irritation:3 </p><p>* Use lubricating eye drops or artificial tears to keep your eyes refreshed and help get rid of dust and particles that can irritate eyes. </p><p>* Don't rub your eyes. You might transfer dust and ash from your hands or face to your eyes and that could scratch or irritate them. It's also helpful to wash your hands regularly. </p><p>* Keep windows and doors closed to keep the air indoors clean. Running your air conditioner may also help but be sure to keep the fresh air intake closed and the filter clean to prevent bringing in additional smoke. However, if it's too warm to stay indoors with the windows and doors closed and you do not have air conditioning, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends seeking shelter elsewhere. </p><p>* The CDC also recommends limiting indoor air pollution by refraining from using anything that burns, like fireplaces, gas stoves and candles. Vacuums can also stir up dust already present in your home. Air filters are also recommended for those with respiratory conditions. </p><p>What makes wildfire smoke so toxic? </p><p>Wildfire smoke comprises of thousands of compounds including solid matter (particles, embers, heavy metals, organic microorganisms), water vapor and a complex mix of gaseous compounds. </p><p>\"Wildfire smoke itself is quite a complex mixture and it's made up of fine particles \u2026 and a number of other gases, which are toxic, mainly due to the fact that wildfires burn everything so more toxic than household fires because everything has been burned,\" Kimberly Humphrey, MD, MPH, a climate change and human health fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told ABC News. </p><p>Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is a key component of wildfire smoke. PM2.5 refers to particles smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm in size and PM10 refers to particles smaller than 10 \u03bcm in size. PM2.5 is considered to be proxy measure for air pollution.2 </p><p>Because these particles are too small to be seen with the naked eye, they can easily enter the nose and throat and can travel to the lungs, with some of the smallest particles even circulating in the bloodstream, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.5 </p><p>A study from California in 2021, found that PM2.5 particles from wildfires can be up to 10 times more harmful than the same type of air pollution coming from combustion activity.4 </p><p>References: </p><p>1. </p><p>Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centere Inc.

Why were the fires so bad there?</p><p>In stark contrast to the U.S., it was the worst wildfire season ever recorded in Canada, with a whopping 45.7 million acres burned, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Smoke from the fires spread across the border into the U.S. in the summer, creating hazy, surreal skies across the nation in cities from Chicago to New York.</p><p>The reason for the disastrous fire season there, MacDonald told USA TODAY, is that western Canada and large stretches of the boreal forest (in northern Canada) experienced very dry and hot conditions coming into the wildfire season.</p><p>MacDonald added that the contrast between California and western Canada was particularly striking in June, when \"you saw large areas of western Canada experiencing moderate to severe drought and most of California experiencing non-drought conditions and large persistent snowpacks in the mountains.\"</p><p>Wallmann said that lightning storms helped spark wildfires across Canada, also noting that it was extremely warm and dry early in the season nationwide.</p><p>What happened in Maui?</p><p>The 2023 wildfire season in the U.S. will be most remembered for the catastrophic wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, in August, which killed at least 99 people.</p><p>The fires in Maui and the resulting destruction of much of Lahaina were due to several factors, MacDonald said. The first cause was the abundance of fuel that was present in the form of flammable, fast-growing, invasive grasses around Lahaina.</p><p>Then in May, Maui began to experience a flash drought, which is a rapidly developing and intense drought. That flash drought dried the vegetation and provided dangerous fuel conditions.</p><p>And in August, when Hurricane Dora passed to the south of Maui, despite being some 500 miles away, it produced winds toward Lahaina with gusts up to 60 mph. \"Unfortunately, the fire ignited in the worst of all conditions in terms of fuel and weather, and in a location that led to its spread into Lahaina,\" MacDonald said.</p><p>What does next fire season</p><p>look like?</p><p>The severity of next year's fire season in the West and in Canada will be determined by the amount of winter precipitation and resulting snowpack, and the spring and summer temperatures. \"A large snowpack with a slow melt and cool summer temperatures will dampen down fuel flammability, fire spread and intensity,\" he said.</p><p>Was the season an outlier?</p><p>The amount of acres burned due to wildfires annually in California and the western United States can vary wildly from year to year. For example in 2020 California saw 4 million acres burned, while this year's total thus far is only about 319,000 acres, according to MacDonald.</p><p>\"The variability reflects a number of factors including the seasonal conditions of temperature and precipitation, the timing and location of ignition events, and the weather and winds associated with a fire,\" he said.</p><p>\"However, if we take a long view and look at the overall statistics from 1980 to the present, there is a significant upward trend in annual areas burned,\" he said. Studies show that much of this trend in increasing annual area burned is related to higher temperatures and drier air, and the majority of these changes in climate are attributable to increasing greenhouse gasses due to human activities.</p><p>\"So yes, climate change is increasing wildfire risk,\" MacDonald said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The hall of historic Waiola Church in Lahaina and nearby Lahaina Hongwanji Mission are engulfed in flames Aug. 8 in Lahaina, Hawaii.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Matthew Thayer/AP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-usa2549094192</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69P3-YKX1-DXGX-600P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 21, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (LOS ANGELES)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp;

Dad told me that with all of the freeway construction over the 'Hill,' (a folksy misnomer for that exhausting stretch of granitic High Sierra from the foothills east to summit), it would probably take me well over two hours to land in Truckee, a railroading town just east of Donner Pass, and headquarters for my summer job with the Forest Service.\"<br/><br/>Published by Newman Springs Publishing, Thomas White's electrifying tale follows a young college student named Bill Pengallen. The year is 1960, and Bill has accepted a summer job working on a fire suppression crew in the mountain town of Truckee, California. On the job, Bill befriends a pre-Med student named Mike Cameron who would eventually become an integral part of his life.

'Fox took a small flame and turned it into a forest fire. As the dominant media company among those viewers dissatisfied with the election results, Fox gave these fictions a prominence they otherwise would never have achieved. With Fox's global platform, an audience of hundreds of millions, and the inevitable and extensive republication and dissemination of the falsehoods through social media, these lies deeply damaged Dominion's once-thriving business,' Dominion wrote in a 138-page complaint, with hundreds of more pages of exhibits. </p><p>Earlier this week, Powell tried to fend off the more than $1.3 billion[2] in liabilities against her personally by arguing in a motion to dismiss that 'no reasonable person[3]' would believe that her well-publicized comments about an international plot against former President Donald Trump were 'statements of fact.' Powell appeared as a guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight and Maria Bartiromo's 'Sunday Morning Futures' show, peddling the ideas the lawyer now claims only the reasonable would believe were factual. Dominion claims that Fox knowingly lied to its viewers, who were flocking in droves to networks farther to the right. 'After the November 3, 2020 Presidential Election, viewers began fleeing Fox in favor of media outlets endorsing the lie that massive fraud caused President Trump to lose the election,' the lawsuit states. 'They saw Fox as insufficiently supportive of President Trump, including because Fox was the first network to declare that President Trump lost Arizona. So Fox set out to lure viewers back \u2014 including President Trump himself \u2014 by intentionally and falsely blaming Dominion for President Trump's loss by rigging the election.' According to the lawsuit, the strategy succeeded for Fox. The husband of its host Jeanine Pirro, who pushed stolen-election theories on her show, received an eleventh-hour pardon from Trump. Ratings for Dobbs shot up almost 27 percent, and Bartiromo's went up 23 percent. But Dominion says Fox's blitz was bad for the country, repeatedly referring to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6th. So-called 'zip-tie guy[4]' Eric Gavelek Munchel, who brought tactical restraints into the Senate chamber that day that prosecutors feared could have been used to take hostages, posed with his gun in front of a Fox broadcast, the lawsuit notes.Dominion CEO John Poulos said in a statement that the 'disinformation campaign' waged against the company 'caused us severe damage and undermined trust in American democratic institutions.' 'These lies also have threatened the personal safety of our employees and customers,' Poulos said. 'No amount of money will repair the damage done.' Dominion attorney Tom Clare, partner at Clare Locke LLP, slammed Fox for ignoring official pronouncements that President Joe Biden fairly won the election to advance a destructive narrative: 'Furthermore, multiple U.S. government agencies, third parties, and elected officials across 28 states have conclusively affirmed that no voting system deleted, lost, or changed votes in the 2020 election,' Clare wrote in a statement. 'However, if a viewer watched Fox, they would be none the wiser. The network endorsed, repeated, and broadcast a series of verifiably false, yet devastating, lies about Dominion. Fox's viral disinformation campaign reached over a billion people worldwide and caused enormous harm to Dominion.' Dominion also filed a billion-dollar lawsuit[5] against Rudy Giuliani and in December, sent out 21 letters[6] demanding retractions or record preservation over what has become known as the 'Big Lie' of election fraud. The company has said it has not ruled out the possibility of suing Trump. 'To fan the flames, Fox turned to Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, neither of whom were official White House spokespeople and both of whom were promoting a baseless defamatory campaign against Dominion, claiming that the election had been stolen by vote-flipping algorithms in Dominion machines that had been created in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chvez,' the lawsuit notes. 'As Fox well knew, Powell and Giuliani were facially unreliable sources and their claims were ludicrous, inherently improbable, and technologically impossible. Powell was and is such an obviously unreliable source\u2014and her claims about Dominion were so inherently improbable and outlandish\u2014that those very same lies resulted in Tucker Carlson publicly mocking her for failing to produce evidence to support them.' Tucker Carlson and Mike Lindell on Fox News. (Photo from Dominion's lawsuit) As the lawsuit notes, even Carlson jumped upon the Dominion-bashing bandwagon later in a segment featuring MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who dared the voting machine company to sue him. 'So this is \u2014 it \u2014 you know, they don't want to talk about it,' Lindell claimed of his supposed evidence. 'No they don't,' Carlson appeared to agree. Hit with similar claims by the voting machine company Smartmatic, Fox News filed four motions to dismiss those allegations. '#8216;Fox News Media is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court,' the company said in a statement. Dominion's complaint was filed in Delaware Superior Court. Read the lawsuit below: Dominion v.
