He had an appointment scheduled with the doctor who rebuilt his right hand on May 8, so he decided to do a dry run the day before in case he was cleared to return.</p><p>As the pavement turned to gravel on Crow Road, McDonald said long distances, low population density and poor infrastructure make rural delivery difficult and unprofitable. His point was soon proven. Among the route's first stops were two mailboxes separated by a dilapidated bridge over an irrigation canal.</p><p>Before the bridge was closed, it was a 50-yard trip between them, McDonald said at the first mailbox. He then drove nearly three miles to reach the second.</p><p>Under the universal service obligation, which mandates mail delivery to every address in the country, a rural letter carrier will drive more than 700 miles to serve those two households in a normal year.</p><p>#8216;It's never going to make financial sense,#8217; said McDonald, 61, from the driver's seat of his preferred delivery vehicle, a Dodge Caravan. #8216;But that's a big reason why the universal pricing system was generated.

But it is not supposed to lose money, either, which it has done every year since 2007, according to its annual reports. The inefficiencies inherent to rural delivery are blamed for much of the lost revenue over the past two decades, which totals more than $100 billion, according to annual reports by the Postal Service.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/USPS_Neb_Aerial2.jpg\"> Rural letter carrier Roger McDonald prefers to drive a Dodge Caravan on his rural route, located in Scotts Bluff County, Neb.

I felt more than a little guilty creeping out while my kids were still asleep, but I was trying to draw as little attention as possible to the fact that I was escaping to 12,000 feet, high in the Rocky Mountains. After all, my kids would be okay. They were now back in their own beds after being evacuated to a hotel room for 11 days with me, my husband, and our three cats while the Palisades Fire loomed nearby. We all needed some space. But when my oldest son found out I'd left, he wasn't angry about that-he was mad he didn't get to come. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"But Mom, we ski together.\" </p><p>\"Yes, Max, that's precisely the point.\" </p><p>I headed to Crested Butte, Colorado's Eleven Scarp Ridge Lodge, which runs a snowcat skiing operation out of a ghost town called Irwin. At one point in the 19th century, this former mining town was home to 5,000. Now it's home to a few snowcats' worth of skiers a day and an extensive snow safety team that mitigates potential avalanches with explosives. Thanks to two adjacent peaks that halt clouds in a weather phenomenon called orographic lifting, over 1,000 acres operated by Eleven gets hit with 450 inches of dry, cold-smoke powder a year, two times what the rest of Crested Butte can expect. </p><p>         SKI IN, SKI OUT         The beautifully appointed rooms come complete with bathtubs for soaking tired legs (there's also an indoor heated saltwater pool and two hot tubs-one inside, one out).       </p><p>Even though my solo ski trip had been on the books long before the fires broke out, I probably could have brought my kids as last-minute add-ons: Scarp Ridge Lodge has five en suite bedrooms and a bunk room for little ones (there's also a second building in town called Eleven Sopris House), which means you can either book by the room or do a full-property buyout, as many groups of friends and family do. Next time. I had to remind myself through a fleeting wave of mom guilt that the point of this getaway was to ski as hard as I could, mostly alone. </p><p>Until I went away to high school, I skied competitively-moguls, specifically. I put in 70 days a year, keeping my legs pinned together, my shins pressed against the front of my boots, while I perfected tight turns compulsively. I'm a very good skier. It's probably the thing I do best, and for a minute, I thought about trying to go all the way. But ultimately, it wasn't competing that I loved most. Unless I was following the boys on my ski team out of bounds and into the trees, being pushed beyond my own sense of self-mastery, what I loved most was skiing by myself in a type of moving meditation. </p><p>                    SKI IN, SKI OUT                      The author after her first day of skiing.                </p><p>Like many parents, I had been eager to get my two sons onto skis, not understanding what I was sacrificing in the process: my own freedom to move around the mountain. For the past seven years, I'd been hauling extra skis on my shoulders, shoving little feet into boots, recovering lost mittens, sourcing endless snacks, and marshaling my kids onto lifts-then following them down the jump trails of their choosing and paparazzi'ing them with my phone so they could watch their little tricks over hot cocoa. One day, during the week we get to ski every February, I did the same top-to-bottom cat track with my youngest nine times. My thighs throbbed from snowplowing and my feet were numb from the cold. Yet this trip back home to Montana every winter is something I love. </p><p>In Colorado, though, I only had to look out for myself. I could roll onto the cat ski after a hearty breakfast and some acclimatizing electrolytes and let the Eleven guides do the rest. Parenting can be summarized as weighing and making a vast number of decisions every day and then generating enough momentum to keep everyone in motion until bedtime. Relinquishing control and being told where to go, and when, is a fantasy few moms can afford. As we reached the summit and strapped into our skis, I followed our lead guide, Megan, down little couloirs into spotless aprons of powder; the tail guide, another extraordinary woman, swept from behind, ensuring everyone made it through intact. We did this six, seven, eight times a day-dropping into chutes, navigating through tight patches of forest-stopping only for an hour at lunch to stretch out our legs by the fire in a beautifully restored cabin and feast on chicken Parmesan and elk shepherd's pie. </p><p>         SKI IN, SKI OUT         The entire house is enriched with extra oxygen, making the ascent to the mountain town a little easier for those who live at sea level.       </p><p>Anyone who has lived through a forest fire-watching nature naturing from aerial shots on TV, praying your home will escape the flames' wrath-will acknowledge the fear that can settle in the body from abject powerlessness in the face of something so mighty. As I stood on the mountain the second day, looking down a particularly steep and narrow stretch that required navigating between two small cliffs, I could feel something in me release: a resynchronization, a recalibration. I could let the snow take my fear. Yes, I had an avalanche beacon strapped to my chest, and yes, I was skiing to the edge of my capacity as an out-of-shape 45-year-old who now lives at sea level in Los Angeles, but I could move down this face gracefully, easily, as I'd always known how to do.</p><p>Later that night, as I slipped into the heated pool back at Scarp Ridge Lodge, I let the saltwater hold me-and finally allowed myself to cry. I'd been holding a lot, overfunctioning through anxiety as so many moms know how to do. As I floated around, I knew I was safe-exhausted and yet back in my powerful body. </p><p>The next day, as my plane from Gunnison descended into Denver, we were buffeted by winter turbulence, and the woman next to me reached for a barf bag. My oldest son can't take a car ride longer than 30 minutes without Dramamine, and I carry a kit for him. I knew just how to mother her to the ground. Fresh bag? A wipe? A gently rubbed back? Max would laugh at this payback, as if he'd been with me all along.

Hundreds of miles north, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was battling a blaze in the Wharton State Forest.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>Mandatory evacuations were announced over the weekend in parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles west of Charlotte. The orders were still in place Monday morning for the 165 properties, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon.<br/>Three fires burned at least 7.5 square miles in the county and the two larger blazes are completely uncontained, Cannon said in a social media update Monday morning. The Black Cove Fire, one of the larger ones, was moving toward neighboring Henderson County, Cannon said. Officials there recommended voluntary evacuations in some areas on Sunday night.<br/>A downed power line sparked the Black Cove Fire, but the causes of the other two fires in Polk County were under investigation, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Jeremy Waldrop.<br/>The state Department of Environmental Quality issued air quality warnings in Polk, Rutherford, Henderson and Transylvania counties due to smoke.<br/>The North Carolina Forest Service was responding to wildfires across the state, with the most severe activity in western North Carolina and especially in Polk County, according to spokesperson Philip Jackson.<br/>\"We're seeing several wildfires across the state at this time, which is why it is absolutely paramount that folks respect the statewide ban on all open burning,\" he said.<br/>A statewide outdoor burning ban was issued in South Carolina, too. Much of the Carolinas are abnormally dry or experiencing moderate drought.<br/>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as crews in Pickens County fought the Table Rock Fire in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Winds and difficult mountainous terrain allowed that blaze and the Persimmon Ridge Fire in Greenville County to grow significantly on Sunday, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.<br/>The Table Rock Fire had expanded to more than 2 square miles by Sunday evening, including several hundred acres that firefighters intentionally burned to reduce the possibility of the area burning out of control, the commission said. The Persimmon Ridge Fire, which started Saturday, spread to over 1.25 square miles, the commission said.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8509417</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRK-J723-S526-F53S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Columbian Publishing Co.

The Community Wildfire Prevention Grants will support critical prevention and mitigation efforts, including the creation of a mobile wildfire fuel clean-up unit, installation of campfire spark screens, and programs to clear overgrown plants, brush, or trees.</p><p>\u201cWith wildfires becoming an ever-growing threat across the country, resilience is key to safeguarding homes, farms, and businesses,\u201d said Jackie De Pape Hornick, Director of Communications &amp; Community Impact at Wawanesa. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner with these local organizations, helping them to take proactive steps to make the places they live and work safer. After all, as a Canadian owned and operated mutual insurer, we don\u2019t just serve these communities \u2013 we\u2019re part of them.\u201d</p><p>This marks the third straight year Wawanesa has provided Community Wildfire Prevention Grants, which were developed in collaboration with FireSmart\u2122\u00a0Canada and the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction.</p><p>\u201cCommunity involvement is the cornerstone of implementing FireSmart principles,\u201d said Lisa Walker, Director of Resiliency and Partnerships at the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which operates FireSmart Canada. \u201cActions taken at both the individual and community level will help reduce wildland fire risk for yourself, your family, and your neighbours. No task is too large when communities work together to reduce their shared wildland fire risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast year saw the loss of about one-third of the town of Jasper in an aggressive, fast-moving wildfire,\u201d said Paul Kovacs, Executive Director of ICLR. \u201cMany Canadian communities that are at risk of a similar fate are small and have few resources to be able to address the risk effectively. Wawanesa\u2019s Community Wildfire Prevention Grants has helped many of these communities over the last three years deal with this risk by helping to fund key fire mitigation projects.\u201d</p><p>A complete list of Community Wildfire Prevention Grants recipients and their projects can be found on wawanesa.com.</p><p>About The Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company The Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company, founded in 1896, is one of Canada\u2019s largest mutual insurers, with over $3.5 billion in annual revenue and assets of $10 billion.

Hundreds of miles north, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was battling a blaze in the Wharton State Forest.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>Mandatory evacuations were announced over the weekend in parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles west of Charlotte. The orders were still in place Monday morning for the 165 properties, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon.<br/>Three fires burned at least 7.5 square miles in the county and the two larger blazes are completely uncontained, Cannon said in a social media update Monday morning. The Black Cove Fire, one of the larger ones, was moving toward neighboring Henderson County, Cannon said. Officials there recommended voluntary evacuations in some areas on Sunday night.<br/>A downed power line sparked the Black Cove Fire, but the causes of the other two fires in Polk County were under investigation, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Jeremy Waldrop.<br/>The state Department of Environmental Quality issued air quality warnings in Polk, Rutherford, Henderson and Transylvania counties due to smoke.<br/>The North Carolina Forest Service was responding to wildfires across the state, with the most severe activity in western North Carolina and especially in Polk County, according to spokesperson Philip Jackson.<br/>\"We're seeing several wildfires across the state at this time, which is why it is absolutely paramount that folks respect the statewide ban on all open burning,\" he said.<br/>A statewide outdoor burning ban was issued in South Carolina, too. Much of the Carolinas are abnormally dry or experiencing moderate drought.<br/>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as crews in Pickens County fought the Table Rock Fire in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Winds and difficult mountainous terrain allowed that blaze and the Persimmon Ridge Fire in Greenville County to grow significantly on Sunday, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.<br/>The Table Rock Fire had expanded to more than 2 square miles by Sunday evening, including several hundred acres that firefighters intentionally burned to reduce the possibility of the area burning out of control, the commission said. The Persimmon Ridge Fire, which started Saturday, spread to over 1.25 square miles, the commission said.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8509129</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRK-J723-S526-F510-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Columbian Publishing Co.

In facing his former associates on the witness stand, Hunt gambles with not only his freedom, but also his life. That's tomorrow night, 10:00 right here on CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin with a growing wildfire burning along the Grand Canyon's north rim. The Dragon Bravo fire is now the largest wildfire in the U.S. mainland. Crews are bracing for worsening weather today as they work through bone-dry conditions, heavy winds, and extreme heat, trying to get the fire under control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire is just 11 percent contained. The fire was sparked by lightning on July 4th and has now scorched nearly 180 square miles of land. That's about three times the size of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Experts say the fire is intensifying enough to create its own weather, in fact. This time-lapse video shows a fire cloud forming in the sky, which tend to form over raging wildfires and volcanic eruptions.</p><p>Joining us right now to discuss this, Lisa Jennings, a firefighter and fire information officer with the Southwestern Incident Management Team, and she's also joined by her interpreter. Lisa, great to see you.</p><p>So you're bracing for more critical fire weather today after a more humid day on Friday. What is the latest there?</p><p>LISA JENNINGS, SPOKESPERSON, SOUTHWESTERN INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM: Yesterday, we had a great window of opportunity, and it was really the first good weather day we've had in almost two weeks. We keep saying even a good weather day on this fire would be a bad weather day on any other fire, but what it did is it allowed our firefighters to essentially go on the offense, get close in on the fire, and try to increase containment on this fire that's been incredibly hard to contain.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Wow. I mean, these pictures are extraordinary. You've, you know, talked about fire clouds being spotted over the Dragon Bravo fire, which can eventually generate lightning, wind gusts, and sometimes even produce tornadoes. Tell us more about this threat, how prevalent it has become during the battling of this fire.</p><p>JENNINGS: Yes, so that red cloud that you see on that clip, the technical term is a pyrocumulus cloud, and that's just, as you said, it is a fire cloud. So that superheated moisture that's released when a fire is burning fast and hot through vegetation, as that rises up off the fire, it forms this cloud. That cloud is over 24,000 feet in the air, which for a normal cloud, that's about the height that clouds are at.</p><p>But if you think this cloud originates on the ground, so an immensely high smoke column, what happens when it gets that high and forms into that fire cloud is then it begins pulling additional smoke and fuels into it, so it gets an updraft wind. And if it can get high enough, that wind can become a downdraft and spread fire out in all directions.</p><p>That's what we really watch for. Our number one objective is firefighter safety. So when those fire clouds form, that's when we have to pull back and go on the defense.</p><p>WHITFIELD: I mean, that's unbelievably dangerous, you know, on top of a job that is already dangerous.</p><p>[13:05:00]</p><p>So the latest update, you know, showing that the fire is just 11 percent contained, the fire was at 26 percent containment at the end of last week. But then dry heat, gusty conditions, you know, erased much of the progress from the last few days. So is there anything that can be done to combat kind of this record dryness? Does it change the way in which, you know, you try to attack this blaze?</p><p>JENNINGS: Yes, fire spread has been really tough to combat. When a fire grows, there are three things that go into it. The first is the weather, and that's the piece that's been really against us. We've had historically dry conditions for almost 10 days now, except that small window we had yesterday.</p><p>The second piece is the terrain here at the Grand Canyon. So we -- you can see the canyon behind us. It's beautiful to look at, but imagine going in there and trying to fight a fire. The Grand Canyon and the canyons that come off of it, they call those kind of finger canyons coming off the main one. They create their own wind tunnels, and that is very hard to fight.</p><p>And then the third piece is the fuel that it's burning through. You think of a campfire, right? You put the wood on the campfire. That is the fuel. In a forest fire, that fuel is live trees, and it is very thick out there. And that is causing this fire to grow quickly on these hot days and send out burning embers a mile ahead in some conditions.</p><p>All those three things make this extreme fire behavior, something that many folks have never seen before. And so we're having to readjust our strategies to essentially drive the fire into areas where that fuel, right, those forest types are a little bit smaller and easier to control, and that strategy has been effective.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So I wonder, too, Lisa, I mean, how are firefighters, how are these teams traversing? I mean, you just described this is very rugged terrain. This is difficult. You're talking about the fingers, you know, throughout the Grand Canyon. I think when tourists think about the Grand Canyon, they think about, OK, mules, helicopters driving to certain places. But now you're talking about battling a blaze there on the northern rim. So how are firefighters getting to those, you know, aggressive, you know, fire areas?</p><p>JENNINGS: One of the critical areas we're working right -- in right now is called Crystal Canyon, and it's been giving us trouble for days because there's a cliff in between where we can access and where the fire is burning lower down. So our only option in those areas is to use helicopters to drop water in because there is no way you can get a person, a firefighter down to combat that blaze.</p><p>And so we have a team of aircraft supporting this incident, a dozen aircraft, mostly helicopters assigned. And then we'll bring in those big air tankers that you see on fires with the red fire retardant to drop in and further slow the blaze in that area. But it's a slow process. And what it does is it helps contain that blaze until we can get the weather to come in and do some more aggressive work on the edges.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Incredible. I mean, all the best to you and all your teams, your interpreter there, your crews out there on the ground. I mean, this is very difficult and we wish you the best and continued safety.</p><p>Thank you so much, Lisa Jennings.</p><p>JENNINGS: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, we're also following other breaking news. Manhunts, plural, underway right now for two mass shooting suspects. In Tennessee, officials are looking for a man they allege killed four relatives of an abandoned baby who was found outside of a home. And in Montana, officials are searching for a suspect who they say killed four people at a bar in the town of Anaconda Friday morning. Investigators have located the truck. The suspect may have fled in.</p><p>CNN's Josh Campbell is following the latest developments on that search.</p><p>JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: An active manhunt underway right now in Montana, after authorities say a man allegedly opened fire inside of a bar in the city of Anaconda in the western part of the state, sadly killing four people and then fleeing. We've seen this infusion of multiple law enforcement agencies at the local level, the state level, as well as agents from the FBI and the ATF now also involved in this manhunt.</p><p>Now, authorities pushed out this image that you're seeing here of the suspect. They named him as Michael Paul Brown. This information they're trying to get out to the public. So anyone who might see this person or recognize him will actually call law enforcement.</p><p>Authorities did give an update on the status of this manhunt on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>RICO BARKELL, GRANITE COUNTY SHERIFF: Anytime you got, you know, an active shooter still on the loose is going to be dangerous. So, I know Deer Lodge County and Anaconda are taking every kind of precaution they can to make sure their citizens are safe. If there's any changes in their safety, they'll be notified. As of right now, there's no threat to the community as right now.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[13:10:02]</p><p>CAMPBELL: As far as a possible motive, authorities have not yet said. Their first focus right now was on locating this individual and bringing him safely into custody. We have seen in so many of these incidents that you and I have covered involving mass shootings that often in the early hours after an incident, sometimes police don't actually know the identity of the person that they're looking for.</p><p>That's different here. Here, relatively quickly, officials in Montana came out with the identification, with this image, again, trying to push this information out, telling the public that this suspect should be considered armed and dangerous after this incident. Again, they're wanting people to contact law enforcement, but they're specifically saying if you see this individual, do not approach him. Rather, pick up the phone, call 911.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Josh Campbell, thanks so much.</p><p>Then in Tennessee, officials are looking for a man they say killed four people. The victim's bodies were discovered hours after a seven- month-old baby related to them was found abandoned in a car seat, alive in the sweltering heat. Investigators say warrants are out for Austin Drummond, charging him with four counts of first-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, and other charges related to the killings.</p><p>CNN Correspondent Rafael Romo is here with more details on this. What more do authorities say they know about the suspect?</p><p>RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, number one, that he -- they believe he's still in Tennessee, and that's why they have launched this manhunt. And, Fred, court records show the suspect has a criminal record that includes a 10-year sentence for a 2013 aggravated robbery conviction. And the concern for officials in Tennessee and the public is that he's still at large.</p><p>The suspect has been identified as 28-year-old Austin Robert Drummond by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. He is 5 feet, 10 inches tall, weighs 190 pounds, and has brown hair, blue eyes, and a goatee, according to the TBI.</p><p>The vehicle the suspect was believed to be driving, a white 2016 Audi, was found unoccupied in Jackson, Tennessee. That's more than 70 miles away from Tiptonville, where the bodies of the victims were found. Drummond is accused of killing four relatives of a Tennessee baby who was found abandoned alive in a sweltering heat on Tuesday in a car seat in what authorities describe as a random front yard near the (INAUDIBLE) of Tigrett, nearly a 40-mile drive southeast of Tiptonville, where the bodies were found.</p><p>Tennessee officials haven't said what led them to name Drummond as a suspect or whether investigators know of a motive in the killings, how they were killed, or why the baby was abandoned a county away from where the bodies were found. What they want people to know right now is that the suspect is still at large and could be dangerous.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DANNY GOODMAN, 29TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY GENERAL: We are dealing with an extremely violent individual. This was what we would think is an isolated incident. It's not anything to where we think the community is in danger because of a person who may be out here randomly targeting people, because we don't think that's the case at all.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROMO: And District Attorney General Danny Goodman also said the victims were all from Dyer County and they suspect the suspect knew all of them. He also confirmed that two of the victims, 21-year-old James Wilson and 20-year-old Adrianna Williams, were the parents of the baby who was found abandoned in Dyer County. 38-year-old Cortney Rose and Braydon Williams, a teenager, were also killed.</p><p>Officials also said that Drummond, the suspect, is believed to still be in the area. The U.S. Marshal Service and TBI are offering a joint $15,000 reward for any information leading to Drummond's arrest. But, again, they cannot stress this enough. If you see the suspect, do not approach him. Call 911 right away.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, very good.</p><p>Rafael Romo, thank you so much.</p><p>All right, still ahead, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS stations across the country, says it is shutting down after federal funding cuts. What this means for your local news?</p><p>Plus, a former elementary school teacher arrested for allegedly killing a couple that was hiking with their children in Arkansas. What we're learning about the suspect in custody now. And Sidney Sweeney's ad campaign for American Eagle has ignited a culture war, a firestorm of sorts. Now, American Eagle is responding.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:19:01]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, just weeks after President Trump's rescissions bill canceled its funding, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting says it will start shutting down. CNN's Camila DeChalus is following this, and much more on how this could affect local public media across the country. Camila?</p><p>CAMILA DECHALUS, CNN REPORTER: Well, Fred, the company says that this move will drastically change the landscape of local TV news and radio across the country. They say that withholding federal funding will force smaller news stations that serve rural and smaller communities to ultimately shut down.</p><p>Now, the CEO and president of CPB put out a statement, and this is what she said. She said, \"Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations.\"</p><p>Now, on the other end, President Donald Trump is declaring this a major victory. As you know, for decades, Republicans have tried to withhold federal funding to public broadcasting groups because they've accused stations like NPR and PBS of having alleged liberal bias.</p><p>[13:20:07]</p><p>But on the other end, public advocates of public broadcasting have argued that who's going to be hurt most by this decision is really rural communities that have come to rely on public broadcasting to be informed about what's actually happening in their communities. It's also important to note that there are some local news stations across the country that have already anticipated these changes, and as a result, they've looked for other avenues to receive financial support so that they wouldn't have to rely so heavily on the federal government.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Camilla DeChalus, thanks so much.</p><p>All right, Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs numbers are stirring concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. The Dow closed down more than 500 points. The Nasdaq, made up of some tech's biggest companies, slid more than 470 points. A significant downward revision to May and June job numbers sent warning signals about the U.S. economy.</p><p>CNN Senior Reporter Matt Egan has details.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: This job market has been so relentless for so long, but all of a sudden, it's losing steam and warning lights are flashing. So the latest numbers show the U.S. economy added 73,000 jobs during the month of July. That is much weaker than expected.</p><p>The unemployment rate went from 4.1 percent to 4.2 percent. That's still low, but it's moving in the wrong direction. The thing that really got economists and investors alarmed, though, is the fact that there were these massive negative revisions to the months of May and June. Those months were revised down by more than a quarter of a million jobs. Just a stunning negative revision there.</p><p>When you look at the trend, you can see that during the months of May and June, there was almost no job growth at all, a major, major slowdown. Now economists, they like to take an average because it smooths out some of the volatility. Well, when you do that, you can see that over the last three months, this was the slowest pace of hiring in the United States, that since the middle of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>And when we look at the sectors, you can see the good news is some sectors, like health care, they are still adding jobs, another 73,000. But the bad news is that really accounts for all of the monthly job gains. We saw a slowdown in hiring and leisure and hospitality. That's bars, restaurants, hotels. Some sectors, they're losing jobs.</p><p>Information down by 2,000. Professional services losing another 14,000 jobs in July. And look at manufacturing losing 11,000 jobs. That suggests that the president's sky-high tariffs, they are not paying off and boosting manufacturing employment, at least not yet.</p><p>If anything, they appear to be backfiring because this sector continues to lose jobs. So why is this happening? Economists say one factor is, yes, the trade war. It's paralyzed businesses. Bosses, CEOs, they don't know what's going to happen next. And so a lot of them are delaying or canceling hiring altogether. Another factor, the immigration crackdown.</p><p>Look at this. Foreign-born employment in the United States is down by 1.5 million between March and July. That is a very significant drop. And economists say that reflects mass deportations and visas that have been allowed to expire. No matter the reason, it is very clear right now that this job market is suddenly stalling out.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Matt Egan, thanks so much.</p><p>Still ahead, a former teacher in custody accused of killing an Arkansas couple hiking with their children. His dramatic arrest in a hair salon. And new details about the killings straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:28:15]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, new video shows the moment a suspect in a double killing was caught by police while he was getting a haircut. The man was arrested in connection with the deaths of a married couple. They were attacked while hiking with their two young daughters at a state park in the Ozark Mountains.</p><p>CNN's Dianne Gallagher has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Elementary school teacher Andrew McGann appearing for the first time before a judge Friday. Police say the 28-year-old admitted to the shocking killings of Clinton and Cristen Brink. Stabbed as the couple hiked with their daughters at Devil's Den State Park Saturday afternoon.</p><p>COLONEL MIKE HAGER, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS STATE POLICE: It appears to be a completely random event.</p><p>GALLAGHER (voice-over): The Brinks being hailed as heroes.</p><p>HAGER: They absolutely protected those girls to their fullest extent to the point that it cost them their lives.</p><p>GALLAGHER (voice-over): Cristen's last moments spent trying to save her family.</p><p>MAJOR STACIE RHOADS, ARKANSAS STATE POLICE, INVESTIGATION DIVISION COMMANDER: The husband was attacked first. The mother did not return all the way to the car with the kids. We believe that the mother took them to safety and then returned to help her husband.</p><p>GALLAGHER (voice-over): New court documents revealed the Brinks' daughters first reported the attack to another hiker, who got them off trail before heading to find the Brinks' bodies and then hiking back out to get cell service. Another witness noticed a man with blood on his face drive off in a black car with tape over the tag.</p><p>Police believe the attack was planned even though the victims were random. And after more than 500 tips from the public, the terrifying four-day manhunt ended mid haircut at Lupita's beauty salon and barbershop in Springdale Wednesday evening.</p><p>ADRIANA RUIZ, LUPITA'S BEAUTY SALON: Something fell off about him.</p><p>[13:30:02]</p><p>He looked pretty scary. He didn't look like he was OK.</p><p>GALLAGHER (voice-over): McGann had just moved to Springdale after accepting a teaching position at a local elementary school for the upcoming school year. The district confirmed to CNN. McGann had been hired to work at least four school districts in three different states in just three years.</p><p>In 2023, in Texas, a parent who described him as cold told CNN she reported McGann after her son described his fourth-grade teacher as touchy and inappropriate with certain girls in class. An internal investigation found problems with classroom management and professional judgment, but did not find evidence of inappropriate behavior, according to the Lewisville Independent School District. It said McGahn resigned that may.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Now, each of those school districts say that McGahn passed a background check before being hired in court Friday. It was determined he would be represented by a public defender. Police say that McGann was injured during the attack and they have hair, blood, and other materials that connect him to the scene. They called him a DNA match.</p><p>And look, Arkansas State Police also said they fully expect law enforcement from neighboring states to begin reaching out to them about unsolved crimes in other jurisdictions.</p><p>Dianne Gallagher, CNN. Back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Dianne Gallagher, thank you so much. All right. Right now, half a million young Catholics are in Rome for a Jubilee of the Youth. They're calling it Catholic Woodstock, and it's all inspired by the new American Pope.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. A half million young Catholics flocking to Rome from more than 140 countries, in fact, for what's being dubbed as the Catholic Woodstock. Concerts, tents, water cannons, all part of the Vatican's Youth Jubilee. Pope Leo will celebrate an open-air prayer vigil this evening and have morning mass on Sunday. A pretty extraordinary view right there.</p><p>CNN's Christopher Lamb joining us from Rome with more. Pope Leo has just landed at the festival. I think we saw him in the Popemobile making his rounds waving. I mean, he is a big rock star there. Tell me what it's like to be there.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNNVATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Pope Leo is definitely getting a Rockstar welcome. He's touring the crowds behind me, the Tor Vergata field. People are running to wave to him. He's got a fair distance to cover to say hello to as many people as possible. As estimated, there are hundreds of thousands here, young people mainly who have been in Rome all week for a summit or a gathering of youth as part of the Catholic Church's Jubilee year celebrations.</p><p>There have been events throughout the week. But the star of the show is Pope Leo, the first American Pope who has a ride for this evening vigil of prayer, of music. It has got a festival atmosphere here. It's been dubbed, as you said, Catholic Woodstock. There's all sorts of different events going on and we've just had different musical acts.</p><p>I've been out in the crowd. And it's amazing how many people from across the world are here for this event. I spoke to pilgrims from Korea, from New Mexico. We spoke to people from Ecuador and other parts of -- they're all here to turn out for this event and to see Pope Leo who is going to address the crowd. He's going to take some questions from young people and he's then going to offer -- it is really the first major event that Pope Leo has led young people, a test of his papacy. He's only been in post for less than a hundred days.</p><p>So, this is an event where he's going to be seem to try and engage with young people. Can he do that as well as his predecessor of Pope Francis? It seems though that the crowds are giving him a very, very warm welcome here behind me. As you can hear, the music's playing. And Pope Leo is still touring the crowd here in the Popemobile.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Oh. I mean, it's incredible to watch. It's almost like he's, you know, going around a racetrack there. And then, you see people on the outside, like running to either get ahead of his popemobile, getting, you know, a wave at him or catching a glimpse of him. I mean, that's a lot of excitement there. All right. Christopher Lamb, we're going to check back with you there in Rome as this Catholic Woodstock gets underway.</p><p>All right. Coming up, as the Trump administration's immigration cracked down amplifies the stress and strain for refugees, how some newcomers are finding a safe space in New York's famed culinary scene.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. For many refugees seeking a new life in the U.S., starting over can be intimidating and even daunting at first. Some are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries, and the ongoing immigration crackdown across the U.S. can also add to the fears that some are feeling. But in New York, the diverse and iconic culinary scene is proving to be welcoming.</p><p>CNN Digital Reporter Alaa Elassar is covering this story. She's with me now. I mean, so great to see you. You write and you profile a number of the people and the places that are finding respite and home in New York City through the restaurant business. So, I'm wonder if you can, you know, just kind of summarize for us what kinds of fears are kind of permeating throughout the culinary scene because of the immigration policies and the practices right now.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>ALAA ELASSAR, CNN DIGITAL REPORTER: Of course. So, New York City would be nothing without its culinary scene. We know this already. Behind every restaurant in New York City is a kitchen full of migrants. So, obviously, these people are afraid. A lot of them just don't know what's going to happen. The journey to citizenship is now a lot longer, a lot harder than it was before.</p><p>Obviously, we see a lot of news about ICE detentions. And even though most of them are here legally, the ones that I've spoken to are documented, they just don't know. So, there's a lot of terror. But I have to be honest, there's a lot more hope.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Well, that is good, especially because you help profile a place where there is a lot of hope, a very unique approach that you profiled in Emma's Torch. And it really does help refugees rebuild their lives through cooking. What makes Emma's Torch, I guess, different from other organizations? What makes it so unique? And I guess it's become a safe place, a place of salvation, right?</p><p>ELASSAR: Exactly. So, Emma's Torch is very unique and very different than a lot of organizations in New York City that helps migrants. One of the biggest things is that it provides free culinary training. So, these people come and they learn everything, all of the basics, knife skills, how to cook intricate meals, and how to conduct interviews to get a job in the industry.</p><p>Remember, these are people from different countries who speak different language, very different cultures. So, it's --</p><p>WHITFIELD: And different backgrounds.</p><p>ELASSAR: Exactly.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Different experiences.</p><p>ELASSAR: All kinds of backgrounds.</p><p>WHITFIELD: What have you learned about some of the people who have, you know, learn new training, learning, I guess, a new lease on life? What did you learn about them individually?</p><p>ELASSAR: There was a lot of heartbreaking stories. We -- there was a lot of refugees from Ukraine who fled the war. Viokoslav (ph) was an incredible man who saw a missile fly past his window and have five -- had five minutes to pack up his family and drive all the way to the border of Poland in 28 hours. So, then, there was Georgia, the immigrant from Georgia, Annie (ph), she was so wonderful, fled human rights violations in Georgia to escape.</p><p>But one of the stories that stood out to me the most was Alpha Omar Diales (ph). He is from Guinea. And what was terrifying is that he was a freedom fighter. There it's considered protestors for freedom, fighting the violence against civilians, especially women. And you know, he did not want to leave his homeland or his sick sisters or his mother. He had no choice. He was arrested twice, in prison for three months, tortured. He was showing me scars all over his body. He was crying, telling me the stories of hearing people being electrocuted right in the cell next to him. So, he fled. These are all people who fled.</p><p>They just want a better life for their families and they all have a lot of pain behind their hearts, and I think it's quite important to remember these people's stories when discussing, you know, the issue surrounding immigration.</p><p>WHITFIELD: I mean, you write, in a city long celebrated for a gastronomic, excellence, and diverse international cuisines, nearly 60 percent of New York restaurant workers are foreign-born. Many having brought a wealth of culinary knowledge. Not all arrive though with the skills to survive at a professional kitchen. And refugees can face peculiar workplace stresses rooted in the political violence or extreme poverty. They fled. For some, the Trump administration's immigration crackdown now exacerbates the strain.</p><p>I mean, how willing were people to share with you perhaps initial reticence of even coming to the country, but then a need to do so, finding a safe place and now going back to some of those initial feelings of real fear.</p><p>ELASSAR: Yes. So, a lot of them, again, are leading these conversations with hope. With that being said, I think being an immigrant myself perhaps or a daughter of immigrants, it makes it a lot easier for people to trust me, and that's I think why I got so many intimate details from their stories. And again, I always say this, but regarding the debate surrounding immigration, we have to remember that unless, you know, you're indigenous or Native American, a lot of us come from people who immigrated at some point.</p><p>And frankly, the language that many people use to dehumanize and criminalize these people who have escaped for freedom, for the survival of their families just to have a life, it's frankly quite dangerous and not a true reflection of American values. And if you just notice these people's stories, if you look them in the eye and actually take a moment to listen, I think you would, you know, just have a different perspective. It could have been you. In another life, it could have been you. And the basic, the bare minimum of humanity is just having empathy.</p><p>WHITFIELD: How do you think a profile like this, a story that you have done here, giving real faces and names yes to these plights might help assist particularly in the humanization of so many people have felt -- who have felt dehumanized as a result of what has been happening?</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>ELASSAR: Exactly. Well, you and I just talked about this. Let's pause the politics for a moment and talk about the people. You know, these could -- again, it could have been you, and we are the children of immigrants. New York City, out of everywhere in the world, is based -- it's built -- the immigrants have built it.</p><p>And all I want to do with these stories is to have people to just, again, pause on the politics and think of the human that you're speaking about, especially -- I mean, if you see the photos of them, they're happy, smiley people. They're mothers, they're fathers, they're children. They have people who love them and they're here for freedom, for life, and for survival. So, just have some humanity is what I would say.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Something tells me, the torch in the name Emma's Torch.</p><p>ELASSAR: Yes.</p><p>WHITFIELD: I mean, there's a direct derivative there with the Statue of Liberty.</p><p>ELASSAR: Yes. WHITFIELD: And the immigrant story.</p><p>ELASSAR: Yes. So, it is a poem by Emma Lazarus. I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. But she was a poet. And she wrote a lot about, you know, immigrants. And one of her most famous poems was \"Give Me Your Poor, Your Huddled Masses Yearning for Freedom,\" and that's Emma's torch. That's the name.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Alaa Elassar, thank you so much.</p><p>ELASSAR: Thank you so much.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And of course, we want people to read your article. It's really brilliant and beautiful at cnn.com. Read the entire thing. You will be moved.</p><p>ELASSAR: Thank you so much.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. We'll be right back.</p><p>ELASSAR: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Thank good to see you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:55:00]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Sydney Sweeney, actress from \"Euphoria\" and \"The White Lotus\" fame, well, she's the lead in an upcoming movie about former boxer Christy Martin. But now, as a result of a controversial ad for the jeans company, American Eagle, the rising hollywood star finds herself caught in the middle of a fierce political debate. Here to tell us more, Elizabeth Wagmeister.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.</p><p>ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One of Gen Z's biggest celebrities starring in an American Eagle campaign, now at the center of a culture wars firestorm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jeans are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like her color personality and they have an eye color.</p><p>WAGMEISTER (voice-over): With critics saying, the ad promotes the discredited theory of eugenics.</p><p>SAYATANI DASGUPTA, SENIOR LECTURER COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: A woman of color would not have been hired for this advertisement. That is a purposeful act. Why? Because eugenics is deeply tied to the notion that some races are better than others. But yet, Sydney Sweeney's ad is really speaking to this political moment.</p><p>WAGMEISTER (voice-over): The ad has remained in the headlines for a full week.

D. VANCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: My political advice to the Democrats is continue to tell everybody who thinks Sidney Sweeney is attractive is Nazi. That appears to be their actual strategy.</p><p>WAGMEISTER (voice-over): The internet blowing up yet again at the intersection of pop culture and politics with heated responses from both sides to the ad and the controversy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My jeans are Blue.</p><p>WAGMEISTER (voice-over): American Eagle announced the campaign more than a week ago, saying Sweeney's girl next door charm and her ability to not take herself too seriously makes the ad both bold and playful. And pushing, it seems, all the right and the lefts buttons. The company responded on Friday, defending the campaign saying, it is and always was about the jeans and that great jeans look good on everyone. Sweeney so far has not weighed in.</p><p>SIDNEY SWEENEY, ACTRESS: But just so we're clear, this is not me telling you to buy American Eagle jeans.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sydney Sweeney has very jeans.</p><p>WAGMEISTER (voice-over): The ad dangling (INAUDIBLE) that ultimately netted American Eagle a very big catch.</p><p>MOLLY MCPHERSON, CRISIS AND REPUTATION STRATEGIST: This is the modern formula for outrage marketing. You spark debate, you drive engagement, you ride the wave. And then when the dust settles, American Eagle gets the clicks, the coverage, and also the cash.</p><p>SWEENEY: You see what I did there, right?</p><p>WAGMEISTER: now, the discourse around this ad has become so heated that some online critics have gone as far to say that this is Nazi propaganda. It has become a right-wing talking point, and politicians have taken notice. Donald Trump Jr. even sharing a spoof his father, President Trump, wearing the jeans.</p><p>Now, American Eagle says that this has nothing to do with anything except for the jeans. In their statement, sharing a message of inclusivity saying, quote, \"We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AA jeans with confidence their way.\" As for Sydney Sweeney, her team has not responded yet to CNN's request for comment.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right.

According to news reporting originating from Shenzhen, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"As data science advances, automated machine learning (AutoML) gains attention for lowering barriers, saving time, and enhancing efficiency. However, with increasing data dimensionality, AutoML struggles with large-scale feature sets.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Key Research And Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Guangdong Basic And Applied Basic Research Foundation; Undertaking National Science And Technology Major Project By Shenzhen Technology And Innovation Bureau; Excellent Youth Innovation Foundation of The Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of The Chinese Academy of Science. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: \"Effective feature selection is crucial for efficient AutoML in multi-task applications. This study proposes an efficient modeling framework combining a multi-stage feature selection (MSFS) algorithm and AutoSklearn, a robust and efficient AutoML framework, to address high-dimensional data challenges. The MSFS algorithm includes three stages: mutual information gain (MIG), recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV), and a voting aggregation mechanism, ensuring comprehensive consideration of feature correlation, importance, and stability. Based on multi-source and time series remote sensing data, this study pioneers the application of AutoSklearn for forest fire risk prediction. Using this case study, we compare MSFS with five other feature selection (FS) algorithms, including three single FS algorithms and two hybrid FS algorithms. Results show that MSFS selects half of the original features (12/24), effectively handling collinearity (eliminating 11 out of 13 collinear feature groups) and increasing AutoSklearn's success rate by 15%, outperforming two FS algorithms with the same number of features by 7% and 5%. Among the six FS algorithms and non-FS, MSFS demonstrates the highest prediction performance and stability with minimal variance (0.09%) across five evaluation metrics.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"MSFS efficiently filters redundant features, enhancing AutoSklearn's operational efficiency and generalization ability in high-dimensional tasks. The MSFS-AutoSklearn framework significantly improves AutoML's production efficiency and prediction accuracy, facilitating the efficient implementation of various real-world tasks and the wider application of AutoML.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An Efficient Task Implementation Modeling Framework with Multi-Stage Feature Selection and AutoML: A Case Study in Forest Fire Risk Prediction.

According to news originating from Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Ecosystem engineers are a critical driver of material cycling and energy flow in degraded or damaged ecosystems, and they are considered to be keystone species for ecological restoration.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Guangdong Academy of Forestry: \"Despite their importance, there are relatively few studies that quantify the roles of ecosystem engineers during ecological restoration. In this study, the influence of excavation by Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) on biological processes during the restoration in burned forest sites in subtropical China were assessed. Results showed that plant species preferentially colonized burrow habitats and animal species intensively utilized burrow resources, benefiting the restoration of biodiversity in burned forest habitats. One year following forest fire, the network complexity and stability of plants and animals in burned habitats with burrows were significantly higher than those without burrows. The significantly positive associations between animals, especially birds, and multiple plant species suggested that the burrow utilization by animals accelerate the ecological processes of plant seed dispersal from fire-free to burrow habitats, and from burrow habitats to burned habitats without burrows. These findings imply that pangolin burrows serve as hubs for multi-species coexistence and accelerate the biodiversity restoration of burned forests.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Excavation by ecosystem engineers, represented here by Chinese pangolins, exhibits important implications for ecological restoration of fire-burned forest ecosystems.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Chinese pangolins facilitate ecological restoration in burned forest sites by burrowing.

Let's continue to lead the world in economic prosperity and climate action,\" said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California State Director at Environmental Defense Fund. \"State leaders are rightly focused on making California a more affordable place to live. This report shows extending cap-and-trade will not only lower costs for families but that a stronger pollution cap further increases these benefits. The choice is clear for California it's time to act.\"</p><p>By extending cap-and-trade to 2045, which coincides with California's timeline to build a 100 percent clean energy economy, the report found:</p><p>$3.9 billion in net savings for California's most economically vulnerable families (nearly $700 for families earning $70,000 or less, or 42 percent of families overall) and $2.2 billion in net savings for the vast majority of families (nearly $200 for families earning $200,000 or less, or 85 percent of families overall)</p><p>287,000 jobs created by cap-and-trade program investments primarily in construction, agriculture and forestry, local transit, architecture, and engineering with an average salary of $93,600</p><p>$55 billion in total economic growth supported by cap-and-trade investments across all 58 counties, with the greatest amount of growth occurring in Los Angeles County ($13.9 billion), Orange County ($3.2 billion), Kern County ($3.2 billion), Fresno County ($2.7 billion), and Alameda County ($2.7 billion).</p><p>\"California's leaders can confidently extend cap-and-trade because the program is a proven cost cutter for families while contributing to California's prosperity,\" said Jonah Kurman-Faber, Greenline Insight's Founder and Principal and an author of the study. \"The vast majority of California's families come out ahead, and working families with lower incomes come out way ahead. The data disproves claims this program does the opposite.\"</p><p>\"As the Legislature and Governor currently negotiate how to reauthorize the program, the findings in this report should be central to those conversations,\" Arnie Sowell Jr., Executive Director of NextGen Policy. \"Clearly, a strengthened Cap-and-Trade program would help address California's affordability concerns by investing in California's most vulnerable communities; create new technologies and job opportunities; and contribute to economic expansion across our state. The way I see it, a stronger Cap-and-Trade program leads to a much stronger California for all.\"</p><p>\"Done right, we know that cap-and-trade funded programs can generate local jobs, cost savings, and economic opportunities for the communities that most need them,\"said Lolly Lim, Climate Equity Program Manager at The Greenlining Institute. \"The next phase of California's cap-and-trade must truly center these elements, ensuring tangible impacts on affordability and economic opportunities.\"</p><p>Cap-and-trade requires the state's major polluters such as oil refineries, power plants, industrial facilities, and fuel distributors to purchase \"allowances\" for each metric ton of pollution they emit to cover their annual emissions. The amount of emissions allowed under the cap declines over time, requiring the regulated entities to cut their emissions. Because the cap limits pollution that goes into the atmosphere, it provides the greatest possible assurance that emissions will decline in line with California's climate goals.</p><p>\"This report provides a strong foundation for state leaders to think big when extending Cap-and-Trade to ensure Californians get the most this program has to offer,\" said Daniel Barad, Western States Senior Policy Manager at Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Immense economic benefits await California from renewable energy, clean transportation, air quality, and conservation investments supported by Cap-and-Trade. A more robust program will generate more benefits for Californians while helping build a clean, sustainable economy.\"</p><p>Delaying the extension and ongoing uncertainty about strengthening the program are already costing California essential revenue. In February of 2024 the price of each allowance was $41.76, generating approximately $1.3 billion. In February of 2025 the price was $29.27, generating just under $900 million. This translates into fewer resources available to invest in utility bill credits, renewable energy, public transportation, sustainable housing, conservation, forest fire management, air quality, and more.</p><p>Since cap-and-trade began in 2012, California has reduced year-on-year emissions from nearly every sector covered by the program. As of May 2025, the program has invested $11.6 billion of allowance revenues.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127131466</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FS7-1C83-RRSM-K3K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 7, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Let's continue to lead the world in economic prosperity and climate action,\" said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California State Director at Environmental Defense Fund. \"State leaders are rightly focused on making California a more affordable place to live. This report shows extending cap-and-trade will not only lower costs for families but that a stronger pollution cap further increases these benefits. The choice is clear for California -- it's time to act.\"</p><p>By extending cap-and-trade to 2045, which coincides with California's timeline to build a 100 percent clean energy economy, the report found:</p><p>* $3.9 billion in net savings for California's most economically vulnerable families (nearly $700 for families earning $70,000 or less, or 42 percent of families overall) and $2.2 billion in net savings for the vast majority of families (nearly $200 for families earning $200,000 or less, or 85 percent of families overall)</p><p>* 287,000 jobs created by cap-and-trade program investments -- primarily in construction, agriculture and forestry, local transit, architecture, and engineering -- with an average salary of $93,600</p><p>* $55 billion in total economic growth supported by cap-and-trade investments across all 58 counties, with the greatest amount of growth occurring in Los Angeles County ($13.9 billion), Orange County ($3.2 billion), Kern County ($3.2 billion), Fresno County ($2.7 billion), and Alameda County ($2.7 billion).</p><p>\"California's leaders can confidently extend cap-and-trade because the program is a proven cost cutter for families while contributing to California's prosperity,\" said Jonah Kurman-Faber, Greenline Insight's Founder and Principal and an author of the study. \"The vast majority of California's families come out ahead, and working families with lower incomes come out way ahead. The data disproves claims this program does the opposite.\"</p><p>\"As the Legislature and Governor currently negotiate how to reauthorize the program, the findings in this report should be central to those conversations,\" Arnie Sowell Jr., Executive Director of NextGen Policy. \"Clearly, a strengthened Cap-and-Trade program would help address California's affordability concerns by investing in California's most vulnerable communities; create new technologies and job opportunities; and contribute to economic expansion across our state. The way I see it, a stronger Cap-and-Trade program leads to a much stronger California for all.\"</p><p>\"Done right, we know that cap-and-trade funded programs can generate local jobs, cost savings, and economic opportunities for the communities that most need them,\"said Lolly Lim, Climate Equity Program Manager at The Greenlining Institute. \"The next phase of California's cap-and-trade must truly center these elements, ensuring tangible impacts on affordability and economic opportunities.\"</p><p>Cap-and-trade requires the state's major polluters -- such as oil refineries, power plants, industrial facilities, and fuel distributors -- to purchase \"allowances\" for each metric ton of pollution they emit to cover their annual emissions. The amount of emissions allowed under the cap declines over time, requiring the regulated entities to cut their emissions. Because the cap limits pollution that goes into the atmosphere, it provides the greatest possible assurance that emissions will decline in line with California's climate goals.</p><p>\"This report provides a strong foundation for state leaders to think big when extending Cap-and-Trade to ensure Californians get the most this program has to offer,\" said Daniel Barad, Western States Senior Policy Manager at Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Immense economic benefits await California from renewable energy, clean transportation, air quality, and conservation investments supported by Cap-and-Trade. A more robust program will generate more benefits for Californians while helping build a clean, sustainable economy.\"</p><p>Delaying the extension and ongoing uncertainty about strengthening the program are already costing California essential revenue. In February of 2024 the price of each allowance was $41.76, generating approximately $1.3 billion. In February of 2025 the price was $29.27, generating just under $900 million. This translates into fewer resources available to invest in utility bill credits, renewable energy, public transportation, sustainable housing, conservation, forest fire management, air quality, and more.</p><p>Since cap-and-trade began in 2012, California has reduced year-on-year emissions from nearly every sector covered by the program. As of May 2025, the program has invested $11.6 billion of allowance revenues.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edf.org/media/extending-cap-and-trade-program-saves-working-families-39-billion-creates-287000-jobs-and-55\">https://www.edf.org/media/extending-cap-and-trade-program-saves-working-families-39-billion-creates-287000-jobs-and-55</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9227878 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9227878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRX-86K3-RY16-P3C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><timeReceived>8:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 7, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Sichuan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Litter on the forest floor, or from a fire perspective the litter fuel load (LFL), is a key driver of the occurrence and spread of surface fires and an important regulator of forest fire behavior. High-quality spatiotemporal LFL data are essential for modeling fire behavior and assessing fire risk in forest ecosystems.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Key Research &amp; Development Program of China, European Research Council through a Consolidator grant under the European Union. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, \"Traditionally, LFL is estimated from ground-based measurements, but they are difficult to implement on large spatial scales. While remote sensing techniques have the advantage of large-scale observation, they encounter challenges in retrieving LFL because forest canopies generally block signals from the forest floor. Here we present a new method based on modeled litter accumulation to estimate LFL dynamics, integrating litterfall influx from the forest canopy and decomposition outflux through a mass balance approach. Annual litterfall was estimated based on seasonal changes in foliage fuel load which are retrieved from Landsat imagery and a radiative transfer model, while the decomposition rate was derived from meteorological data. Litterfall and decomposition were quantified over the past 20 years with the difference between the two being LFL accumulating over time. We validated the estimated LFL using 105 ground-based measurements in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, China, and this validation demonstrated a reasonably strong performance for estimating LFL (R-2 = 0.67, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.56 Mg ha(-1), relative RMSE = 31.61 %).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our method integrates remote sensing-based foliage phenology with the ecological process of LFL accumulation, enabling large-scale LFL monitoring for forest fire risk assessments.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Estimating Forest Litter Fuel Load By Integrating Remotely Sensed Foliage Phenology and Modeled Litter Decomposition.

This study focuses on the procurement, logistics, and warehousing processes that are being developed and integrated into the humanitarian supply chain. The report recommends ways to improve 2025 California-like recovery operations from a wildfire by drawing on earlier models of disaster logistics. It underlines procurement, logistics, and warehousing importance in securing the necessary resources in a disaster within the shortest time possible for delivery and distribution. The paper explains how strategic planning, prepositioning supply, route optimization, and selecting the optimal location for the warehouse may help reduce the reaction time while minimizing waste to ensure overall successful recovery operations. The findings are aimed at strengthening continuous efforts by providing specific recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the wildfire disaster relief supply chain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Humanitarian supply chain (HSC) is the lifeline of timely provision of critical aid in various crises like natural disasters and conflict situations. Such supply chains assure that food, water, medicine, shelter, and other badly needed resources arrive systematically and swiftly for the affected population. Such a supply chain deals with multiple stakeholders like governments, NGOs, and logistics providers, who have to coordinate for success over the challenges of infrastructure, effective communication, and dynamic response to the changing situation [36]. A well-managed HSC can save lives, reduce suffering, and help communities to recover more quickly after disasters.</p><p>The most important role HSCs play in any wildfire scenario is supporting the affected communities. Wildfires will often devastate large areas and displace many people, while homes are destroyed and local infrastructures are ruined [4]. Humanitarian organizations must deploy food, water, medical facilities, and building materials to those affected regions quickly. Then, the HSC may eventually have to resort to airlifting or off-road delivery methods if there are compromised transportation routes in such a region [12]. Cooperation between governments, NGOs, and local authorities also ensures that such supplies are well utilized both in an effective and efficient way.</p><p>The recent cases of wildfires in 2025 show the significant role HSC plays in the recovery from the disastrous scenarios. HSCs have different issues caused by the fires burning in California and Los Angeles in January 2025 [35]. In addition to the significant number of evacuations and general destruction, shelter, food, water, and medical care needs are immense. Because of the declaration of emergency because of the fires in Los Angeles, there is a sense of focus that brings attention to how these fires impact supply chains and businesses within that region. Transportation has been affected by road closures and evacuations. Exposure to dangers such as smoke and poor-quality air has been experienced by outdoor workers. The trucking industry is a significant member in supply chains, and these disruptions have caused severe delays. Analysts feel that the fire disaster will incur an economic loss of $135 billion, and the damages will be tantamount to about 4% of the annual GDP of California [32]. The effects of such wildfires go beyond logistics,they endanger communities and livelihoods. This situation must be addressed very far away to prevent more interruptions. The HSC is critical in ensuring that aid is timely distributed to shelters and evacuation centers while managing resources such as firefighting equipment, relief teams, and communication systems. In relation to the scale of fires and the probable logistical hurdles, humanitarian organizations have to be agile and prepared to overcome smoke-filled air, closed roadways, and limited resources within the community to provide the right assistance for the affected communities [21].</p><p>Given the increased frequency and severity of wildfires in California, the recovery process must be optimized to reduce response times, minimize waste, and ensure timely delivery of resources. Using proven strategies from previous disaster recovery models will provide actionable recommendations for improving the efficiency of the humanitarian supply chain, ensuring that essential resources are available where and when they are needed most during wildfire recovery efforts. This sets the objective of this research study as designing and suggesting procurement, logistics, and warehousing strategies in enhancing wildfire recovery operations for the events happening in early 2025, based on insights from historical disaster supply chain models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Literature Review</emphasis></p><p>Wildfires severely interfere with HSCs by destroying infrastructure, routes of transportation, and critical supplies. Fires burn down roads, bridges, and airports, which limits the ability to transport vital supplies, such as food, water, and medical support. In addition, the evacuation of large segments of the population creates an immediate need for emergency shelter and minimal services, putting additional pressure on supply systems. Environment destruction further affects agriculture and local industries by reducing production capacity and limiting the access of goods. In addition, the smoke and air pollution caused by wild fires can also have an adverse effect on public health, increase the potential for more medical care, and make recovery more challenging. Driven by climate change, human activity, and natural factors, these wildfires have widespread impacts on biodiversity, air quality, and infrastructure. The following cases highlight the alarming scale and intensity of wildfires and therefore call for the development of all-encompassing fire management strategies and environmental policies. Knowledge of causes, consequences, and lessons from past fires can prevent such future disasters and strengthen the resilience of communities and ecosystems affected.</p><p>The Siberian Taiga wildfires of 2003 are considered one of the most severe wildfire events in history, burning a staggering 55 million acres of Eastern Siberian forests [16]. The fires caused major destruction to the taiga as well as greatly affected global emissions, as the carbon released equaled the amount of reduction in emissions to be achieved for the European Union under the Kyoto Protocol. This catastrophic event brought to the fore the increasing role of wildfires in the boreal forests of the northern hemisphere.</p><p>Similarly, the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires were another devastating example of the increasing severity of wildfires in the face of climate change [8]. These fires, which ravaged 42 million acres of land, killed over 3 billion animals, including more than 60,000 koalas [33]. The fires were fueled by the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, making the 2019/2020 bushfire season one of the worst in the country\u2019s history. In addition to the environmental damage, thousands of homes were destroyed, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland [14].</p><p>The 2014 Northwest Territories fires in Canada burned 8.5 million acres and were notable for the widespread smoke that affected air quality not only in North America but also across Europe [20]. A mix of human-caused and natural fires, this event highlighted the far-reaching effects that wildfires can have, especially when large areas of land are involved. Similarly, the 2004 Alaska fire season in the USA saw 6.6 million acres burned, with 701 individual fires, many of which were sparked by lightning. The warm and wet summer conditions contributed to this record-setting fire season, underscoring the growing intensity of fire events in the region (Ambrose, 2014).</p><p>Australia experienced another major wildfire event with the 1939 Black Friday bushfire, which burned 5 million acres in Victoria during extreme drought conditions [18]. The fire caused the tragic loss of 71 lives and destroyed over 700 homes, marking it as one of the most destructive bushfires in Australian history [5]. The Great Fire of 1919 in Canada also burned 5 million acres across Alberta and Saskatchewan, claiming 11 lives and destroying hundreds of buildings [34]. The devastation from these fires led to changes in fire management practices in both countries.</p><p>Other significant fire events include the 1950 Chinchaga Fire in Canada, which burned 4.2 million acres, creating a massive \u201cGreat Smoke Pall\u201d visible across both North America and Europe [24]. Similarly, the 2010 Bolivia forest fires, primarily in Bolivia\u2019s section of the Amazon, burned 3.7 million acres, exacerbated by both human activity and extreme drought conditions (Campanharo, 2021). The 1910 Great Fire of Connecticut in the USA, burning 3 million acres, killed 87 people and led to significant changes in forest protection policies [9].</p><p>In China, the 1987 Black Dragon Fire burned 2.5 million acres, killing 191 people and displacing thousands of others [26]. The 2011 Richardson Backcountry Fire in Canada, which burned 1.7 million acres in Alberta, was the largest fire in the province since the Chinchaga Fire of 1950 [31]. Dry conditions and human activity contributed to the fire, which led to evacuations in the affected areas. The 1989 Manitoba wildfires, burning 1.3 million acres, were marked by a record number of 1,147 fires and forced the evacuation of over 24,000 people [15].</p><p>Lastly, the 2024 Texas wildfires, which burned 1.1 million acres, became the largest wildfire event in the state\u2019s history [28]. The Smokehouse Creek Fire, in particular, accounted for much of the damage, further highlighting the increasing scale of wildfires in the USA.</p><p>These events, along with others on the list, show the growing intensity and frequency of wildfires globally, driven by climate change, human activity, and changing environmental conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Need for the Study on the Design and Management of HSCs</emphasis></p><p>The increased rate and intensity of wildfires, driven by climate change and land-use changes, make the urgent need for disaster preparedness and response measures apparent. Wildfires cause immense destruction to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements, often leaving communities devastated and in dire need of humanitarian assistance in places like California, Siberia, Australia, and Canada [30]. In such cases, well-coordinated HSCs are critical in delivering relief in time to ensure that essential resources such as food, water, medical supplies, and emergency shelter are provided appropriately to the affected populations.</p><p>Optimization of disaster relief operations and design and management of HSCs are exactly critical. Wildfires, by nature, disrupt transportation networks and destroy infrastructure and pose severe challenges for rescue operations due to restricted access to areas. Thus, an effectively managed HSC that integrates real-time data on the locations of affected populations, the extent of damage, and the availability of resources to ensure the quickest delivery of aid matters. The systems also need to have sufficient flexibility to adjust based on the different changes of events, which include weather, changing forefronts, and movement of displaced people.</p><p>There is a natural need for major planning to pre-position supplies in strategic locations, with an emphasis on the identification of high-risk zones. Then, there is an overriding need for resilient logistics networks capable of weathering the pressure associated with a major crisis. That was evident from the devastation caused by the Australian bushfires in 2019/2020, when thousands of homes were destroyed and the wildlife was devastated. The insights gained from past occurrences ought to guide future planning initiatives aimed at decreasing the susceptibility of communities to the disorder caused by wildfires and enhancing recovery durations.

Through the analysis of past wildfire relief programs\u2019 successes and failures, we can better utilize resources, minimize risks, and ensure more effective and just relief processes during future disasters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing the HSC for Wildfire</emphasis></p><p>The HSC comprises several fundamental parts that make sure there is effective response and allocation of resources after a disaster occurs. Of all these, there are three, which are at the top position: procurement, logistics, and warehousing; each plays its role in delivering aid in a timely and efficient fashion. The structure of the humanitarian relief chain comprises three primary steps: (1) the engagement of suppliers and the procurement process; (2) the establishment of predetermined locations for distribution, medical centers, and warehousing; (3) the transportation of goods [11].</p><p>Procurement is defined as the process of sourcing and acquiring the goods, services, and resources necessary for disaster response. Procurement for humanitarian work would therefore encompass identifying the sources, suppliers, and procuring a minimum list of commodities such as food, medication, and materials for shelters [22]. This also includes contractual provisions, budget considerations, delivery in time, and the integrity required while delivering assistance to affected persons by disasters [17]. Since the dynamics of a disaster is volatile, the procurement system must be responsive, adaptive, and sensitive to new needs as they arise in situations on the ground.</p><p>The second driver of supply chain, which is logistics, is the backbone of any HSC, and its focus lies in the movement of goods, people, and information. Good logistics management will ensure that resources are transported effectively from suppliers to affected regions [11]. This involves coordination in transportation, planning of routes, tracking of supplies, and making real-time decisions. In a disaster situation, logistics can be very complicated because of the destruction of infrastructure, geographical difficulties [1], and fluctuating needs, requiring flexible and adaptive logistics solutions.</p><p>Warehousing involves the storage and handling of supplies before their distribution to affected populations. Warehouses are essential in maintaining stock levels, ensuring product safety, and arranging items in an orderly manner for effective distribution. The strategic location of warehouses is crucial to ensure timely delivery of aid, especially in large-scale disasters. Pre-positioning of supplies and emergency warehouses in disaster-prone areas can greatly improve response times and efficiency.</p><p>A focus on procurement, logistics, and warehousing guarantees that the appropriate resources are obtained, transported efficiently, and stored strategically, thereby facilitating timely and effective delivery of relief. Through the optimization of these components, humanitarian organizations can enhance response times, reduce shortages, and improve overall recovery efforts in areas affected by disasters.</p><p>A study proposes a fire disaster management approach focusing on optimized resource allocation based on suppression priority, selecting sites using fire propagation models according to priorities, and altering real-time logistics to make adaptive plans for resource distribution and vehicle routing. Another study further suggests improving fire disaster management through increased participation of the locality to make prompt decisions, pre-positioning of warehouses and training personnel on standby, and decentralizing to make decision making agile and responsive in disaster-prone areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing the Procurement Strategy</emphasis></p><p>A clearly defined procurement strategy for HSCs must be put in place to enhance response to a fire disaster. Such a strategy enables timely procurement and delivery of essentials like food supplies, medical treatment, and firefighting equipment. Transparency, accountability, and efficiency minimize donor mistrust, wastage, and inefficient use of resources. Such strategies involve prepositioned stocks along with developing closer relations with suppliers to improve quick mobilization during emergencies. Effective procurement reduces risks, such as monitoring a supplier\u2019s performance, coupled with the use of technology to enable transparency and thereby increase the efficiency of disaster relief efforts while improving overall response time for saving lives and reducing suffering. Sahay et al. (2016) have discussed a procurement strategy for HSCs in disaster contexts by ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency for timely and cost-effective undertaking of any relief operation. Figure 1 represents the procurement design with the following strategies.</p><p>Ensure transparency: documenting every step of the procurement process, hence, keeping a fair view and clarity at every stage to build trust and accountability.</p><p>Maintain accountability: follow all the donor requirements and regulations so that funds are properly accounted for, and that donor expectations are met.</p><p>Focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness: This means getting the appropriate quantity and quality of supplies at the right time and place, from the least-cost provider.</p><p>Prepositioning of stocks: keeping critical stocks placed in well-defined, strategic locations prior to disasters allows for their speedy access when necessary.</p><p>Build strong supplier relationships: creating and maintaining reliable contacts with trusted suppliers permits prompt and reliable delivery of goods and services as needed.</p><p>Mitigate risks: continually monitor and assess any risk the supply chain faces, such that proactive measures can avert delays and interruptions in the procurement process.</p><p>Timely response to needs: throughout the time of disasters, swift acquisition has to deal with the emerging needs in a manner that avoids delays in humanitarian relief.</p><p>Monitor supplier performance: assessing the performance of vendors on a regular basis to assure all quality standards are adhered to and that issues can be addressed to improve service delivery.</p><p>Use technology for transparency: introduce technology and tracking systems that will provide real-time visibility into the procurement process and inventory levels.</p><p>Review and adapt procurement policies: continuously review and update procurement policies to ensure the emergence of challenges are met, as well as align with the disaster response strategy.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Procurement strategy in humanitarian supply chain for fire disaster response</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing Logistics Strategies</emphasis></p><p>The humanitarian work is carried out with logistics at its very base, deciding the proper mechanisms for effective resource distribution in times of emergencies [3]. It involves planning, coordinating, and implementing the transport of goods such as food, medicines, and tools to the affected regions by any disaster. Logistics shorten response time and put the relief at the right places in extreme urgency, especially in areas of high congestion or those difficult to reach [23]. It equally works in inventory control, locating collection and distribution centers, and handling infrastructure problems [6]. Humanitarian logistics can be described as a series of processes and systems that mobilize people, resources, and knowledge to provide timely assistance and support to communities affected by what can be considered disasters or emergencies, aiming to minimize shortages, waste, and costs in endeavor to maximize impact [27]. That is why logistics in humanitarian operations will ensure that the scarce resources will be used as efficiently as possible, avoiding any delay that can jeopardize relief operations and risk lives.</p><p>Once the fire disaster on February 20, 2019, set ablaze the old part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, which was mentioned above, it led to mass devastation and loss of lives, leaving behind 117 dead [6]. It spread quickly across tightly packed residential urban areas, posing considerable challenges for the efforts of rescue and relief. Traffic congestion, road conditions, and lack of evacuation plans aggravated an already bad situation. As a solution to the shabby traffic conditions during rescues, this research put forth a mathematical modeling approach for other disaster responses that the elected government should be implemented to optimize efficient transportation routes for relief resources, overcoming the issue of traffic congestion, firstly in rescue and secondly towards the enhancement of smooth governmental intervention. In addition, the model aims to improve preparedness and decrease response time while containing future devastation. The logistic solution that has been proposed by the author for managing fire disaster relief operations as an HSC (Fig. 2) can be summarized with these terms:</p><p>Mathematical model for logistics planning: the research suggests a mathematical modeling\u2013based approach for the planning of transporting relief and rescue resources, considering minimizing disaster response time in densely populated areas, like Dhaka.</p><p>Collection and distribution centers (CNs and DCs): by the model, the collection centers (mainly located on the outskirts) are positioned for accumulating relief items, whereas the distribution centers (within city) handle the reception of items and their distribution to demand points.</p><p>Route optimization: the model determines optimal routes for transporting relief resources from collection centers to distribution centers and finally into the affected areas, considering either traffic congestion or road conditions.</p><p>Traffic congestion index: here, the traffic density and suitability indices are defined to assess and monitor the transportation route, guiding decisions regarding the selection of such routes for timely delivery of resources.</p><p>Government intervention: the model provides for government intervention in case the traffic density or suitability of the route is found unacceptable, ensuring that such an operation is not obstructed [25].</p><p>Emergency monitoring cell: an emergency monitoring cell must be established to monitor the overall transportation route, guide the movements of the goods, and adapt to traffic challenges in real time.</p><p>Pre-positioning of resources: this pre-positioning of skilled relief personnel and emergency apparatus put resources at the collection centers ready for prompt delivery to the affected areas, shortening response time.</p><p>Routes for optimal response: the model supports the identification of routes that will lead to the most efficient response, depending on the level of traffic, road conditions, and alternatives available to minimize delays in reaching the affected areas.</p><p>Resource allocation to firefighting and rescues: the model accounts for the allocation of ambulance and fire truck resources, in addition to trained personnel to either firefighting or rescue operations, with a focus on minimizing associated response times [35].</p><p>Post-disaster recovery and mitigation: the model will incorporate post-disaster recovery and mitigation measures, such as identifying the cause of the fire disaster and suggesting actionable steps to prevent its reprisal.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Logistics design of humanitarian supply chain for fire disaster relief operations</p><p>Since humanitarian supply chains are seriously impacted by wildfires, particularly coordination, communication, and last-mile delivery of disaster relief goods, drones can offer a solution to this. Through more efficient logistics, reduced risks to human responders, and enhanced disaster response effectiveness, drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) offer a revolutionary solution, as explained below.</p><p>Interaction and arrangement</p><p>Conventional communication networks often function ineffectively in wildfires due to damaged roads and infrastructure. Restoring connectivity via drones with mesh networking or mobile relay functions enables volunteers, humanitarian groups, and firefighting teams to communicate with ease [10]. For instance, UAVs can relay radio signals or provide temporary Wi-Fi hotspots to ensure uninterrupted connectivity in hostile or remote locations.</p><p>Airborne monitoring and damage evaluation</p><p>Real-time mapping of fire extent via drones with thermal imaging and multispectral sensors can identify high-risk areas and stranded individuals [37]. To make sure medical and humanitarian aid is delivered where it is needed the most, this information optimizes evacuation routes and resource deployment.</p><p>Emergency medical supply delivery</p><p>Drones are able to transport essential medications, blood supplies, and portable emergency packages to inaccessible fire areas. UAVs have been shown to be effective in medical logistics by companies like Zipline, and this can be expanded to wildfire scenarios [2]. Materials are able to be airdropped without compromising human lives due to self-controlled drones that are capable of flying over hazardous grounds.</p><p>Search and rescue support</p><p>Even in smoke-covered areas, missing individuals can be located by AI drones capable of object recognition [29]. Drones can guide rescue teams to the victims while sidestepping risky routes when supplemented with ground robots.</p><p>Policy recommendations and future preparedness</p><p>Governments and disaster management bodies should invest in longer endurance fire-resistant UAVs as commercial drones may not be able to manage every wildfire scenario. Wildfire management on a mass scale could be enhanced even further with research on swarm drone technology [13].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing warehousing strategies</emphasis></p><p>A study [7] examined the main factors for choosing suitable warehouse locations, including efficient infrastructure, especially access to airports for quick disaster response, and safety. Proximity to seaports is less important indeed; rather, the ability to quickly send resources to a disaster site is critical. Many organizations also prefer safe locations, removed far away from disaster-prone areas, such as Dubai, which provides excellent infrastructure. There is evidence that the cost is the main element that influences warehouse location decisions, with organizations using UNHRD facilities, where storage is free of charge, therefore encouraging cooperation and efficiency in logistical matters. The work of Maharjan and Hanaoka [19] seeks to locate optimally the number and location of warehouses for disaster response using a maximal covering location problem (MCLP). It looks into different scenarios involving the trade-offs between the number of warehouses versus their coverage distance to achieve a certain level of service. The study demonstrates that the expected service level increases in the number of warehouses and decreases in coverage distance. Sensitivity analyses show how changing an assortment of warehouse numbers or geographical constraints affects coverage. The study\u2019s findings show warehouse location decisions are essential in facilitating faster response during disaster times and can be applied to other vulnerable countries in the context of public facility placement during a HSC after a major disaster.</p><p>The following considerations can be noted while deciding warehouse location under HSCs during major disaster situations, also as represented in Fig. 3:Fig. 3</p><p>Warehousing design of humanitarian supply chain for fire disaster relief operations</p><p>Maximal covering location problem: the research has applied MCLP to determine the number and position of warehouses. The model maximizes coverage while minimizing the number of warehouses with key parameters including response time and access to demand points.</p><p>Geographical constraints: the model incorporates different geographical conditions, rocky-terrain conditions particularly having an impact on travel time and accessibility. For example, the variations in distances (100-km, 200-km, and 300-km) would represent different responses according to the terrain conditions prevalent in the location.</p><p>Transportation accessibility: locations with increased road density and improved infrastructure are favored so that warehouses can easily be reached from demand points. In countries like Nepal with poor infrastructure, accurate distance computations (drawing from actual road networks) are essential in finding optimum sites for warehouses.</p><p>Disaster safety and development index: the study incorporated disaster safety and developmental indices that acted as other constraints in the programming. This meant that warehouses would be located away from disaster-prone (i.e., safer) areas while also taking into account the level of development of a site that affects operational ease.</p><p>Demand point prioritization: high-density areas demand greater humanitarian priorities. Hence, a priority value is assigned to each demand point based on population density, with higher density areas getting priority for relief.</p><p>Thresholds and constraints: for each factor (transportation accessibility, safety impingement, and development), thresholds are set up to ensure that only locations that could satisfy those constraints are selected as warehouse sites. During the model implementation, these thresholds are employed as an enforcement mechanism to maintain forgone consistency over candidate-location selection.</p><p>Scenario analysis and sensitivity testing: by reviewing various distances for coverage, the model provides options for selecting the number of warehouses, their locations based on resources available, and the desired response time. Sensitivity analysis serves to clarify how variations in key constraints influence decisions regarding warehouse locations.</p><p>Optimizing resource allocation: the primary objective will be finding the fewest warehouses that can completely serve all demand points. All decisions would also take into consideration readily available resources and possibly other aspects related to the capacity of the choice, such as balancing such trade-off between warehouse numbers and a covered area.</p><p>The humanitarian supply chain (HSC) designed to recover from the wildfire, as outlined in the strategies for recovery through its major drivers, is depicted in Fig. 4.Fig. 4</p><p>Humanitarian supply chain for wildfire disaster recovery</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>In the context of wildfire disasters, in the procurement, logistics, and warehousing of HSCs, these modes encompass a blend that helps to deliver the most efficient recovery in real time. The conjunction of technologies, actors, materials, and procedures is highly efficient in enabling essential supplies to be procured and distributed to affected communities, thereby reducing waiting times and minimizing impact throughout and after the disaster.</p><p>An effective procurement strategy focuses on the continuous acquisition and redistribution of assistance to victims. These could include medical supplies, food and water, or fire-retardant materials. The overall transparency and accountability will in turn contribute a lot in developing trust in the donors, optimal use of the resources, and timely availability of needed aid.</p><p>Prepositioning supplies in such strategic areas permits somebody to be more ready, leading to mobilization efforts in times of disaster. Also, fast and timely procurement will guarantee that policies and regulations put forth by the donor are met, while at the same time ensuring accountability in programming.</p><p>In other words, logistics deals with the very complicated planning, coordination, execution, and to some degree, installation for the moving of the supplies to wherever disaster has struck. Fire responses face the challenge of having congested road systems, dysfunctional infrastructure, and damage to the transport networks sometimes causing delays in delivery of aid materials. Effective decisions in a logistics plan\u2014like optimized routes of transport\u2014guarantee that no delays are caused to prevent the provision of assistance to affected populations. Logistics management encompasses the overall management of transportation systems, as well as control of inventories, the establishment of reception and distribution centers, and also the management of relief supplies. Emergency monitoring centers implement rapid response solutions with real-time tracking of supplies movement while making entries of challenges that arise such as congestion and infrastructure damage. Warehousing decisions are very vital as they determine the availability and accessibility of relief resources during a wildfire disaster. The strategic location of warehouses should consider such factors as infrastructure, disaster safety, and accessibility. It will ensure the rapid flow of supplies into the areas of the greatest demand. Using models like the maximal covering location problem (MCLP), it helps for an optimal location of warehouses, balancing the count of warehouses and distances of coverage to maximize response efficiency. Sensitivity analysis helps in adjusting the number of warehouses based on GIS limitations and available resources, hence ensuring a speedy response.</p><p>These elements\u2014discussions of procurement, logistics, and warehousing\u2014form the backbone of disaster recovery efforts in wildfire situations. By ensuring that resources are efficiently sourced, transported, and stored, they help to reduce the overall time to respond and reduce the wastage of resources, ultimately saving lives. Their induction into an HSC plans for recovery and builds the capacities against future disasters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Ambrose JM (2018) Geographies of responsibility (The University of Iowa).<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.17077/etd.alls00rx\">https://doi.org/10.17077/etd.alls00rx</url></p><p>[2].Amukele, TK.

The answer may be found by examining the events that set in motion this perfect firestorm 50 years ago. I believe the Mexican spotted owl, the black line and the ignorance of environmentalists are to blame.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When I first drove into these mountains in 1969, I began meeting the extraordinary people of these mountain towns and villages. In 1973, I was able to purchase a small farm along El Rito de Tierra Amarilla. I became a member of the Chama Valley's Southwest Forest Fire Fighters crew. These 20-person crews were organized by the N.M. State Forestry and came from the many towns in or near the National Forests. During my seven years with the Chama Valley Crew, we seldom worked in New Mexico because of a lack of forest fires here.</p><p>Enter the Mexican Spotted Owl decree in 1978. Most logging came to an end in the Western National Forests. It was a sad time in Chama as the sawmill/kiln, a large employer in Chama, was closed. Eighty mill employees, as well as the hundreds who worked in the forests, lost their jobs. I worked for local U.S. Forest Service contractors thinning and planting trees, building access roads and installing culverts. These access roads provided immediate fire suppression. There was no clear cutting of woods.</p><p>Many trees, unsuitable for lumber, were left by loggers and the bushes, grasses, oak groves and soils were left intact. Some forests became woodlands, a distinction unknown to ideological policy makers. Deer thrived and residents could collect all the firewood, pi\u00f1on, mushrooms and herbs they needed.</p><p>This same year, a radical change was imposed on forest firefighters: the black line. Now we started fires rather than suppress fires. Traditionally, a fire line of dirt was created along the burned area and stopped fire spread. Since nobody can stop a raging inferno at the head of a fire, a dirt line was started along its sides. Once these fires reach a certain size, the only way they end is when the fire hits a \"break\" in its path or a change in wind direction causes the fire to blow back on itself. Now the Forest Service starts a big back fire and hopes the fires burn toward each other. This is how a fire storm burns 500,000 acres instead of 500 acres, in my opinion.</p><p>In 1978, as crew boss, I went with the Chama Valley crew to the Big Sur Fire south of Monterey, Calif., where we saw the future. Bureaucrats had created a huge roadless area. One day, we watched the Santa Fe Hot Shot Crew almost burned alive when the Forest Service started a huge back fire. We listened to the panicked screams over the radio begging for a helicopter pickup, which couldn't happen.</p><p>Fortunately, a bulldozer dug a ditch on the hilltop just before the fire reached the crew. The dozer burned but nobody died. As we watched, green branches and dead birds fell out of the sky. They weren't burned but had been sucked up thousands of feet in the air. We sat in silence and could not believe our eyes. That Big Sur Fire burned close to a million acres, something none of us had ever seen before.</p><p>With true wilderness already protected, environmentalists created wilderness study and roadless areas to further keep mountain residents out of the forest that had sustained their families and villages for centuries. Now, only the U.S. Forest Service can enter the roadless areas to burn the rotten logs, little trees, grasses and shrubs in the name of fire prevention.</p><p>I did join the Gila Hot Shot Crew for a season. Before fire season we \"practiced\" by cleaning up after the loggers and thinning the Gila National Forest. Thinning improves lumber production but doesn't stop a fire. Thinning is not a one-size-fits-all operation. Higher altitudes require closer tree spacing so the snow pack won't melt prematurely.</p><p>We didn't burn anything in our cleanup work - no smoke, no fires. We carried burnable wood to clearings where rangers would burn our trimmed piles during the winter. We had a helicopter on standby for quick access to remote fires. It is puzzling why New Mexico has had only two hot shot crews when at least eight are needed. We are in the middle of a 60-year cyclical drought and it is urgent we return to the multiuse forest management that worked so well.</p><p>Chris J.

These federal funds may be used by the state to suppress and contain wildfires, improve and expand training, and employ prescribed burns as a tool to reduce the risk of wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This month, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management's (DEM) Forest Fire Program announced it will be offering a free, five-day, entry level course to train participants in the tools, tactics, and strategies used to suppress uncontrolled wildland fires. No prior experience in firefighting is needed to attend, but applicants must be at least 18 years of age. The classes will be held in June and priority enrollment will be given to local municipal firefighters and DEM employees. Registration is open through the end of the month.</p><p>According to DEM, Rhode Island experienced a total of 75 wildfires last year, with the majority occurring in the fall between mid-October and mid-November. DEM says wildfires are expected to become more frequent as climate change continues to create warmer, drier conditions, leading to longer and more active fire seasons.</p><p>\"I commend DEM for their outstanding efforts to help safeguard our communities from the threat of wildfires and improve forest resiliency. I am pleased to help provide the resources the state needs to prevent destructive blazes and protect lives, livelihoods, and property from the growing threat of uncontrolled brushfires and wildfires. DEM is putting federal funds to work investing in equipment and expanding their outreach and training to help lower wildfire risks and increase the effectiveness of wild firefighting tools and strategies,\" said Senator Reed, a member of the Appropriations Committee, which oversees federal funding for the U.S. Forest Service.</p><p>Last year, DEM's Forest Fire Program reported treating: \"130 acres of state property with prescribed fire, nearly a threefold increase from 2023. Last year, DEM conducted shaded fuel break brush clearing projects along various stretches of forestland on state lands to lessen the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. DEM has trained 46 new wildland firefighters in the past two years to help build RI's capacity to respond to wildfires.</p><p>DEM has trained 46 new wildland firefighters in the past two years to help build RI's capacity to respond to wildfires.\"</p><p>Last year, DEM's Fire Program received $132,561 in federal funding from the U.S. Forest Service for State Fire Capacity activities: These funds are allocated for salary, benefits, overtime (for training, prescribed fire and response etc.); and associated operating expenses for personnel assigned to the Fire Program. The state also got an additional $38,896 to boost its Volunteer Fire Capacity to help purchase equipment and provide fire training for volunteer firefighters. Reed also helped direct another $135,000 to Rhode Island last year under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for the state's Fire Program to purchase specialized firefighting equipment and a mini excavator used to fight wildfires.</p><p>Senator Reed helped pass both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (P.L. 117-58) and the Inflation Reduction Act (P.L. 117-169) which together included over $7 billion in funding across federal interagency to enhance America's ability to mitigate and respond to wildfires nationwide,</p><p>The Trump Administration has put a freeze on federal funding and Congressional Republicans are threatening to claw back unspent funds under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Senate Democrats have also decried the Trump Administration halting the disbursement of funds for forest management and restoration projects, as well as the universal hiring freeze for federal personnel, including permanent and seasonal firefighters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126970523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F43-NCW3-RRSG-X153-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 12, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting out of Tribhuvan University (TU) by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are an imminent danger to natural forest ecosystems, and carrying out zoning studies and forest fire risk assessments are of great practical significance in steering fire prevention, minimizing fire incidents, and limiting the environmental consequences of fire. Using the Gorkha district of Nepal as a case study, this study used remotely sensed high-temperature fire data as the forest fire sample.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Tribhuvan University (TU): \"Nine parameters related to topography, climatic conditions, vegetation, and human intervention were used as environmental variables affecting fire occurrence. Next, a MaxEnt forest fire risk assessment model was generated with GIS and R, which analysed the contribution, significance, and responses of environmental variables to the forest fire in Gorkha District. The findings demonstrate that (1) following a test of sample locations for forest fires, the MaxEnt model has excellent relevance and practicality when applied to fire risk assessment; (2) Out of 2747 fire points in the forest, only 110 Spatio-temporally independent fire points were used for the model building having high and normal confidence level. Regarding Area Under Curve (AUC) values, the training data yielded results of 0.875, while the test data produced acceptable results of 0.861 with a standard deviation of 0.0322; (3) the importance of climatic and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) variables to forest fire are 56.2 % and 32.9 %, respectively, and their contribution to forest fire are 32 % and 47.6 %, respectively. (4) There are numerous and intricate ways that environmental factors influence forest fires. The forest fire response curves to the nine chosen environmental variables are complex and nonlinear rather than linear; Maximum temperature of the warmest month (bio_5), Isothermality (bio_3), Precipitation of Driest Quarter (bio_17) and mean Diurnal Range (bio_2) bear a nonlinear positive link with the possibility of forest fires. In contrast, elevation, slope, temperature seasonality (bio_4), distance from the settlement, and LULC have a favorable stimulating response to the possibility of forest fires within an appropriate interval.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"(5) In Gorkha, there are geographical differences in the risk of forest fires. Only 12.83 % of the whole area is made up of areas at significantly high risk or above, compared to 87.17 % for high-risk and below.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Geospatial forest fire risk assessment and zoning by integrating MaxEnt in Gorkha District, Nepal.

Welcome to Exchange Income Corporation's conference call to discuss the financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The corporation's results, including the MDNA and financial statements, were issued on August 11, 2025 and are currently available via the Company's website or Cedar Pass. Before turning the call over to management, listeners are cautioned that today's presentation and the responses to questions may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of Canadian Provincial securities laws. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a true reliance should not be placed on such statements.</p><p>Certain material factors or assumptions are applied in making forward looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. For additional information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations and about material factors or assumptions applied in making forward looking statements, please consult the Quarterly and Annual mda, the Risk Factors section of the Annual information form and EIC's other filings with Canadian securities regulators. Except as required by Canadian Securities Law, EIC does not undertake to update any forward looking statements. Such statements may only as of the date made.</p><p>Listeners are also reminded that today's call is being recorded and broadcast live by the Internet for the benefit of individual shareholders, analysts and other interested parties. I would now like to turn the call over to the CEO of Exchange Income Corporation, Mike Powell. Thank you. Please go ahead. Mr. Plai.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you Operator Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me today is Richard Warrick, our cfo, who will speak about our quarterly financial results along with Jake Trainor and Travis Muir who will speak about our outlook for our two operating segments. Adam Turwin and Dave White are also on the call and will be available to respond to any specific questions on Canadian north and the Long Term Air Services Agreement that was announced subsequent to quarter end. Yesterday we released our second quarter results for 2025. Our performance in the second quarter continued to be very strong for each of our key financial metrics.</p><p>Once again we set Q2 high watermarks for each of our key metrics including revenue, adjusted ebitda, free cash flow, net earnings and adjusted net earnings. In fact, our revenues of 720 million were the highest achieved in any quarter in our history. Subsequent to quarter end we announced the closing of the Canadian north transaction. Equally important was the signing of the agreement with the Government of Nunavut for our Long Term Services whereby Canadian north and Comair will be the sole provider services for all three regions in Nun. The Canadian north acquisition is highly strategic for EIC as adding its infrastructure and assets and management team ensure that EIC has a unique value proposition for our customers and the Government of Canada.</p><p>Jake will talk further about some of the opportunities that exist for EIC with Canadian north as part of the family. We also updated our 2025 EBITDA guidance and increased the range to $725 million to $765 million, which now includes the financial results of Canadian North. The seasonality of Canadian north is relatively consistent with our other Essential Air businesses. As a reminder, we previously noted that the returns being free cash flow, less maintenance capex will be muted in the short term but are expected to meet our return or expectations by the end of 2026. These record results were generated during a time of uncertainty with business sentiment being weak at the start of the quarter due to the uncertainty related to trade policies and geopolitical events.</p><p>This quarter, however, is another example of how diversified and resilient our businesses are in times of uncertainty. EIC continues to generate strong returns even when the world is experiencing difficult times. The impact of tariffs was not material to EIC overall, however, it did negatively impact our Multi Story Window Solutions business line as the tariffs more than offset the productivity and profitability gains we achieved from our integration activities. We continue to be bullish on the long term fundamentals within that business line and we will review all options to mitigate the tariffs as we move forward through manufacturing decisions and changes in our supply chain.</p><p>Ultimately, I believe that Canada and the EOs will come to an agreement and hopefully will have reduced tariffs in the longer term as the two economies are so directly intertwined. Our remaining subsidiaries did not experience any direct impact from the tariffs other than reduced business sentiment which deferred some purchasing decisions from our customers during the quarter. We are still seeing significant number of inquiries throughout the businesses, especially as we exited the quarter. As customers realize that this trade environment is now the new norm, I believe that business sentiment will gradually improve and the number of firm orders will continue with a step based improvement, especially now that legislation has passed in the US which provides accelerated tax deductibility.</p><p>Subsequent quarter end, several of our manufacturing entities received purchase orders including our Multi Story Window Solutions business line which booked approximately $100 million in new projects. We expect that this positive momentum will continue throughout our various business lines. Our results were also impacted by the forest fires experienced across Canada. Most importantly, my heart goes out to these who have been displaced from their communities and from their homes. EIC was there to support these communities in evacuation efforts and we are currently providing capacity to repatriate the community members back home. Our Rotary Wing operations were also very busy in fire suppression work.</p><p>The impact on the communities first and foremost on our thoughts. However, it did impact our quarter as well. The evacuation sites provide a short term improvement to our charter operations. However, it subsequently has a negative impact on our scheduled service and medevac operations. Those communities which are no longer populated I will let Rich focus on the financial results for the operating segments. However, prior to passing off the call I wanted to provide some context on a couple of items. We will continue to have significant liquidity available to us. We had drawn the funds for the Canadian north acquisition prior to quarter end which is why the cash balance was in excess of normal amounts.</p><p>Our leverage ratios continue to be at the low end of the historical range and our balance sheet continues to be very strong which will allow us to execute on organic growth opportunities and or acquisitions. I also wanted to give my regular update on the status of significant contract proposals that remain outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2024, we submitted our proposal to the Australian Government for their maritime surveillance contract. We previously anticipated hearing the results of the award by July. However, the May election in Australia delayed the bid evaluation process and therefore we anticipate hearing on the results sometime in the third quarter.</p><p>As I previously commented, we believe we put together a very strong bid and we expect to have as good a chance as any other bidder. Additionally, within the geopolitical climate we continue to see significant interest from several other countries for additional ISR assets and we are working with several governments in developing solutions to their needs and have several discussions with those involved in the procurement process. Our second aircraft for the UK Home Office contract has been fully modified and is waiting regulatory certification in the UK and is expected to start flying later this month. We crossed and significantly exceeded Another milestone being the 3 billion equity market capitalization capitalization.</p><p>Our collective team is very proud of this achievement and it's a recognition of our business model. The year to date results are a very strong start to the year and continue to show the strength of our business model which is starting to be reflected in our share price. The demand for our services and products is very robust. Jake and Travis will focus on the outlook for our segments for the remainder of 2025. Lastly, we will provide the market with our expected adjusted ebitda guidance for 2026 at our third quarter conference call in November. Consistent with our past practice, I will now pass the call over to Rich.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you Mike and good morning. For the second quarter of 2025, revenue of 720 million, adjusted EBITDA of 177 million, free cash flow of 123 million, net earnings of 40 million and adjusted net earnings of 47 million were all second quarter records. Revenue in our aerospace and aviation segment increased by 28 million or 7% to 455 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 13 million or 10% to 148 million. Looking at the Essential Air Services business line, the improvements were driven by a couple key factors. First, historic organic growth capital expenditures over the past number of years to both satisfy increased demand and contract wins in our medevac operations primarily related to the BC and Manitoba medevac contracts drove increases in revenue and profitability including enhanced scope in multiple markets.</p><p>Second, the quarter experienced strong firefighting activities which resulted in evacuation flights and rotary wing fire suppression. Lastly, while load factors were strong in the first part of the quarter, scheduled service and medevac volumes experienced decline in latter part as a result of northern communities being displaced temporarily and not requiring those services. Our aerospace business line revenues and profitability were lower due to the planned wind down of certain training programs prior to the start of new programs and contracts. Additionally, one of the aerospace contracts changed from a performance based logistics agreement to a time and materials arrangement which results in more variability when comparing quarters.</p><p>Our aircraft sales and leasing business line increases were driven by continued improvement in leasing activity and robust parts demand. We are seeing significant demand in our leasing business for the aircraft and even more so on the engine side. Partially offsetting those increases was a reduction in large asset sales to the prior period. Those sales are generally lower margin transactions and more lumpy than our traditional parts and leasing business. Revenue in our manufacturing segment increased by 31 million or 13% to 265 million doll million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 9 million or 26% to $44 million. Our environmental access Solutions business line had increased revenues and adjusted EBITDA driven by the acquisition of Spartan which had significant demand for its composite maps.</p><p>As previously discussed, Spartan Team is evaluating several existing locations to house our second plant based on the longer term secular trends in the Canadian market. We saw a decrease in adjusted EBITDA due to a change in product mix as we saw greater mat sales compared to rental mats as certain rental mat projects were deferred into the latter portion of 2025 and into 2026. As expected, our multi story Window Solutions business revenue decreased due to project customer deferrals and related production gaps. Profitability was further negatively impacted in the short term by aluminum tariffs. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including changes in supply chain.</p><p>However, those take some time to identify and set up new suppliers to meet demand and quality requirements. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did see instances of being see instances of inquiries being converted into bookings. With over $100 million in bookings, we are encouraged that booking trends will continue to improve in the back half of the year due to the geopolitical trade risk becoming more normalized and businesses willing to deploy capital. Our precision manufacturing and engineering business line had another solid quarter from a revenue and profitability perspective. It was driven by customer demand across several industries including telecommunications, technology, resource and data centers.</p><p>Overall net earnings were $40 million for the second quarter which was an increase of 7 million or 23. The higher adjusted EBITDA and reduced interest expense was offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to the acquisition and growth capital investments and increased acquisition costs related to the Canadian IRP transactions. Because of its complexity, earnings per share increased to $0.78 per share compared to $0.69 in the prior quarter. Adjusted net earnings were 47 million compared to 38 million in the prior year with an increase in adjusted net earnings per share from $0.80 to $0.92 per share.</p><p>Free cash flow was 123 million compared to 101 million in the prior year. Free cash flow per share increased from $2.13 to $2.40 per share while free cash flow maintenance capital expenditures was 57 million compared to 52 million and on a per share basis increased from $1.11 to $1.12. Maintenance capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2025 were 66 million compared to the prior year 48 million on a six month basis, maintenance capital expenditures were 122 million compared to 88 million in the prior year. Q1 in the prior year was an anomaly on the low end due to the timing of maintenance events.</p><p>The increase in the current year is due to the timing of events coupled with the policy based on utilization for aircraft and engines within aircraft sales and leasing. As discussed in the first quarter, growth capital expenditures during the second quarter were $5 million compared to 45 million in the prior year. The second quarter was lower than anticipated as we expect based on current opportunities within aircraft sales and leasing that growth capital expenditures will be incurred in the third quarter which will reverse the negative second quarter growth capital expenditures. From our working capital perspective, we had an investment of approximately $40 million.</p><p>The investment was driven by growth in the business coupled with deposits of approximately $20 million for assets within our aircraft sales and leasing business line. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we collected a material government receivable of approximately $19 million to bring the aging of government receivables more in line with historical norms. We are actively managing our working capital and are working with each subsidiary team to convert working capital to cash. Corporation's aggregate leverage, including both its senior credit facility and convertible debentures, decreased from 3.36 at December 31 to 3.21 at June 30. Our aggregate leverage ratio remains near historical norms and well within our target.</p><p>Our M and A pipeline remains strong along with our liquidity to execute on acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a hallmark of ESE and allows us to be opportunistic organically and through acquisition when the right opportunities present themselves. That being said, the added liquidity does not change our view on leverage and we plan to maintain our leverage within our historical range. I will now turn the call over to Jake, who will provide an Update for the 2025 remaining outlook for the aerospace and aviation segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Rich. Travis and I will once again split up the Outlook section and I'll focus on the Aerospace and aviation segment. Travis will provide context on the manufacturing segment. Overall, we're expecting a strong last six. Months from a revenue and adjusted EBITDA perspective from our aerospace and aviation segment for several key reasons. The most significant will be the inclusion of the operating results of Canadian north due to the completion of the acquisition on July 1. Taking a step back, the Canadian north seasonality is relatively consistent with our Essential Air Services operations with their second and fourth quarters being relatively similar, the third quarter being the strongest and the first quarter is the seasonally weakest due to demand and weather factors. Secondly, we anticipate strengthening results due to growth capital investments made for the contractual wins announced over the past several years, including contributions from the UK Home Office's second aircraft, which is expected to start flying in late August upon regulatory approval.</p><p>I'll discuss the specific growth factors by business Line. Our Essential Air Services will see growth driven by a multitude of factors when compared to the prior period. The first and most significant will be the addition of Canadian North. We also anticipate strong load factors and growth across our legacy networks when compared to 2024. We had experienced strong load factors in Q1 and in early Q2 and then those were replaced by evacuation flights in Manitoba and Northern Ontario due to wildfires. The load factors specifically in Manitoba were then reduced in the latter portion of the quarter as communities that were displaced and therefore revenue and profitability of scheduled services were negatively impacted during the last six months of the year.</p><p>We do anticipate a normalization of results. Lastly, we expect continued growth in our medevac business because of increases in scope compared to the prior year. We anticipate receiving approximately eight to 10 of the new King Air360 aircraft under the BC Medevac contract by year end which will allow us to redeploy the pre existing aircraft throughout our other operations including the Newfoundland and Labrador fixed wing medevac operations. Offsetting some of these gains is the impact of continued labor shortages and supply chain challenges. We're not seeing a worsening of these dynamics, however, the challenges still remain specifically on aircraft parts and consumables as well as on aircraft maintenance labor.</p><p>The aerospace business line's revenue and EBITDA are expected to increase as the prior year comparables in the third and fourth quarters have started to reflect the wind down of training contracts and the conversion of the aerospace support contract from a performance based logistics agreement to a time and materials arrangement. These increases are expected to be driven by the second aircraft deployed onto the UK Home Office contract and continued strong tempo of flying for owned ISR assets. Our aircraft sales and leasing business is also expected to experience growth as Richard talked about the investment in both working capital for future parts sales and investment in aircraft and engines within the leasing portfolio anticipated within the third quarter.</p><p>We continue to expect growth in the leasing revenues as we place those aircraft and engines on lease. With the increase in inventory, we also anticipate greater part sales throughout the year assuming we can access MRO slots. Taking a step back, I wanted to focus on the strategic benefits of the Canadian north transaction for the longer term for EIC as a whole. We believe that the Canadian north infrastructure and aviation assets coupled with our existing operations provide us with a unique offering to meet the development needs of the North. As the Government of Canada renews its focus on development, security and sovereignty within the NorthEIC's comprehensive portfolio including advanced aerospace solutions, sovereign Arctic aviation defense enabling infrastructure in country defence manufacturing and our extensive network of partnerships with Indigenous communities and businesses uniquely position the company to lead and support these critical initiatives.</p><p>We will proactively have discussions with the Government and our customers about how EIC can support them in achieving their NATO targets and development in the North. We expect maintenance CAPEX expenditures to increase for a number of reasons. Firstly, due to the Addition of Canadian north we noted that the first year returns are expected to be muted due to higher than normal maintenance capex expenditures required when we negotiated the purchase price. We took into account the projected maintenance CAPEX expenditures and negotiated a corresponding reduction in the purchase price. Secondly, maintenance capital expenditures are expected to increase in line with increases in our adjusted EBITDA in our aerospace and aviation segment.</p><p>Thirdly, increases in maintenance capital expenditures related to our aircraft and sales and leasing business due to continued strengthening of utilization within our lease portfolio. And lastly, this quarter's maintenance capital expenditures in the central air services were below our internal expectations due to a timing of events which are expected to be caught up in subsequent quarters. Growth investments in the remainder of 2025 include capital expenditures for 8 to 10 new King Air aircraft which will be used in the BC Medevac contract. We've received five of these aircraft by the end of August. Lastly, Regional one has placed deposits on certain aircraft assets and anticipates on executing aircraft and engine transactions during the third and fourth quarters.</p><p>The business had negative growth capital expenditures during the second quarter which was an anomaly due to the timing of the execution of opportunities. As a reminder, transactions are only executed if they meet the same financial metrics as applied for acquisitions. I'll now pass it off to Travis to provide some commentary on the manufacturing segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Muhr:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Jake and good morning. We're anticipating continued growth in our revenues and profitability for our manufacturing segment for the remainder of the year compared to 2024. This growth is expected for two reasons. Firstly, we see the normalization of the business environment for many of our segment subsidiaries coupled with the annualized impact of Spartan in our Environmental Access Solutions business line. All of the businesses within the manufacturing segment were experiencing a strong level of customer inquiries at the start of 2025 with some softness experience as the tariffs were implemented. The tariff uncertainty saw a small reduction from a customer booking perspective in the second quarter, but the business sentiment has been gradually improving as customers began to accept the risk landscape.</p><p>Overall, as Mike had mentioned, as the tariff situation stands today, we have not been directly impacted by the tariffs except for the aluminum tariffs impacting the multi story Window Solutions business line during the quarter. The vast majority of our products that we produce are Canada, usa, Mexico compliant and therefore the broader risk of tariffs would relate to declining business sentiments and supply chain changes. As Richard commented, which do take some time to implement. Our Environmental Access Solutions business line is expected to generate returns higher than the comparative periods for the remainder of the year. Spartan continues to experience very strong demand for its composite Map solutions and we anticipate that they will continue to sell out their manufacturing capacity based on feedback received from customers and testing on the System 7 XT mat.</p><p>Also, the FAW Trackout product line is seeing very strong demand. Due to that demand, we are actively assessing various location alternatives to build a state of the art class. We see long term positive trends in the composite mat industry as the geographic and sector usage continues to expand and take market share from the traditional wood mat industry in the U.S. although we've seen some deferrals in project start dates for our mat bridge solutions business in Canada, we anticipate those projects commencing in the latter parts of 2025 and into 2026 which should drive an uptick in mat and bridge rentals.</p><p>We've talked a lot about our bullish view on the transmission and distribution sector as electric grids have to be expanded and hardened for the new electricity demands, whether it be for electric vehicles or data centers. We also see several tailwinds for the traditional oil and gas and pipeline sectors. As expected, our multi story window solutions business line revenue and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be lower than the comparative periods we had signaled our expectations in the year end and first quarter call and the drivers remain the same for the remainder of the year. The period over period declines are expected due to one the heightened interest rate environment that existed in 2023 and 2024 that resulted in reduced project manufacturing for 2025 as projects booked will be manufacturing 18 to 24 months after the booking date generally.</p><p>Secondly, for projects scheduled for 2025 we anticipate margin pressures due to the type of projects booked coupled with production gaps. We have integrated the manufacturing capacity in Canada by combining certain manufacturing facilities and are seeing the fruits of those activities as we did note profitability increase in benefits. However, those are more than offset by the tariffs as discussed in our reporting, we cannot alter our supply chains in the short term and and therefore were subject to the aluminum tariffs during the quarter. In the longer term we'll be able to mitigate the impact and optimize production.</p><p>Quoting in Canada and the U.S. continues to be very active and we're seeing bookings subsequent to year end. We are successful in booking approximately 100 million of new projects and we anticipate this trend to continue as developers become more comfortable with the economic environments we are in. We remain very bullish on this business line as the longer term fundamentals which drive demand being an acute shortage of affordable housing remains very strong across several geographic regions in Canada and the U.S. our precision manufacturing and engineering business line is expected to improve from a revenue and profitability perspective for the remainder of the year compared to the prior year.</p><p>We're seeing strength across various sectors including defense, telecommunications, technology, resource and data centers. We are anticipating growth capital expenditures to be incurred in each of the business lines, but that should be relatively consistent with the prior year. The growth capital expenditures in the Environmental Access Solutions business line will depend on the market dynamics as they continually reassess their fleet based on expected market conditions. But we do expect an investment in fleet along with the buildup of Max to realize those opportunities for the latter part of 2025 and into 2026. I'll now pass the call back to Mike.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Travis. I'm very excited about our future. We are guided by our past values and our various business lines are set up to realize significant tailwinds for the future. We have the right collection of businesses, the right management teams and our 20 year past provides evidence on our ability to strategically execute on those opportunities as EISC as a company is characterized by resiliency and stability and our record results and outlook for 2025 is a continuation of those trends. Before we move on to questions, I'd like to take a brief moment to thank Carmel Peter for her work at eic.</p><p>Over a year ago we announced that she would be retiring from management and moving to our Board of Directors. From that time, along with Adam and our team, she was leading our investigation and negotiation of the Canadian north acquisition. She agreed to stay in her president's role until the deal was completed or abandoned. The Canadian north acquisition was completed effectively July 1st along with the negotiation of a long term contract with the Government of New shortly thereafter. As per her usual performance, along with Adam and the team, she all expectations on getting this transaction closed.</p><p>This acquisition will drive our growth in 2026 and beyond. Carmel, thank you for all you have done for EIC during your time here as President. Your contributions have been fundamental to our success. Carmel's responsibilities have been absorbed by our senior team including Jake, Travis, Adam Darwin and Richard. I am pleased to announce that Jake, who has served as CEO of PAL during its period of rapid growth, has moved to EIC as our new President and Calvin Ash, a long time executive at pal, has taken over as the CEO of the PAL Group. The strength and depth of our management team are very important during senior management retirements.</p><p>Our focus on succession planning has served us well. Thank you for your time this morning. We'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>thank You. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. Should you have a question, please press star 4.1 on your telephone keypad. You will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. And should you wish to cancel your request, please press star four. 2. If you're using a speakerphone, please lift the handset before pressing any keys. One moment please, for your first question. Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Steve Hansen from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Morning, Steve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Hansen, your line is now open. Your next question comes from the line of Cameron Dorksen from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Cam operator. It appears you guys are having problems on your end. Could you please have someone look into this?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, we will check the issue and Mr. Dorkson, can you hear us?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Nobody can hear you. I'll hear you. Operator, you have a problem on your end.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Your next question comes from the line of James McCarrichel from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Are you guys able to hear me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>James, we can hear you. I'm glad someone got through. You can ask lots of questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>So congrats on a great quarter. And Jake, congrats on the new role. But yeah, I just wanted to ask on the Canadian north deal, now that it's closed, please give us an update on, you know, the capex plans for the rest of the year. Just want to get a sense of how we should be modeling that for the rest of 2020, 25 and into 2026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>That's a really good question. When we announced the deal, we said that it was going to take us probably through the end of next year to get to 15% return thresholds. And that was based on three items. One was getting the revenues where we needed to get them for the business to be profitable. And we're very pleased that we signed a long term contract with the government of Nunavut so we have a tick in that box sooner than we thought we would. Second piece is taking some costs out of the business by utilizing best practices with our aviation business.</p><p>And we're underway on that. We've had early wins. Rich and his team, for example, have negotiated a new credit card agreement which will save us a million dollars a year. So they're not all that fast, but. And we're changing things. Calvin and his team are looking at combis, looking at how we run our routes. We have a regional one by our part. So over the next sort of year and a half, you'll see the costs come down and Then finally the main piece to getting the 15% was we knew going into this transaction that there was a bunch of maintenance capital work, particularly some engines that needed to be overhauled and you will see much higher than normal maintenance capex over the next four quarters.</p><p>In particular, quite frankly, we thought about how we might even work that into the purchase price by increasing the purchase price and having the vendor do it. But we weren't sure we could get the work done in time. So when we looked at the purchase price, there's effectively part of what we're paying is some extra maintenance capex in the first part of what we see. So you'll see higher than normal maintenance capex for the next year or so as I don't want to say catch up because that implies that Canadian north were doing their maintenance capex and they most certainly were just by happenstance and how things come together.</p><p>There's a lot of overhauls and engine overhauls that need to be done, so you'll see that up front. But I'm pleased to say that the operating performance is ahead of our modeling significantly because of the early cost savings and the new contract with the government.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Appreciate the caller. Then, you know, you've been flagging the past couple quarters some opportunity to redeploy some assets from bc, you know, into the Newfoundland deal as some as you get some of these aircraft, it seems like these aircraft are coming into the back half of the year. So, you know, should we expect a pretty sizable improvement in margin in the next few quarters? You know, obviously for 2025 that's going to be reflected in the updated guide. But is there an opportunity to kind of continue to drive some improvement there into 2026?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Your general statement is correct with Newfoundland. The fact that we're using other planes changes our return on capital more than it changes our margins per se. Like as that contract goes into effect and we use assets we already own, we're going to earn a return on things without having to expend new capital. So that's exactly what we were looking for when we got the contract in B.C. because the fleet there was perfectly fine. The government wanted new aircraft. Jake? Yeah, James, Just to give you a.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Little more color, there's going to be some aircraft modifications needed just for configuration changes as they come out of service from BC and go into service in Newfoundland, which you won't see them start to contribute until early 26.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Appreciate the caller guys, and I'll turn the line over. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, James.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. For participants having issues staying connected, please dial +12898191350 or +1800-836-8184. Once again, that is PL 2898191350 or 1800-836-8184. Once again, please press star once. If you have a question, your next question comes from the line of Chris Murray from ATB Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, folks. Hey, good morning. Hopefully you can hear me okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, just.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>So just turning back to the guidance, the $35 million increase in the guidance, if you could maybe help us understand, you know, how that comes together. How much of that is the contribution from Canadian North? How much of that? It looks like, you know, some stronger margins in the aviation businesses maybe offset a little bit by manufacturing. So maybe you can just give us some color on how to think about how that stack lines up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, most of the increase would be explained by Canadian North. The number would have been bigger, quite frankly, Chris, if it weren't for the continued forest fires. We've had some of our biggest communities in Northern Manitoba empty for three, four, five weeks. And when that's the case, we aren't flying there. So that 35 million would have been had, would have, would have had at least a four as the first number if we had any remotely close to a normal forest fire year. This is a year like we've never seen before in the 50 years of operating in the north.</p><p>So 50 years plus. So to circle back to your question, it's general strength in our overall business offset by the forest fires, and then most of the growth would be coming from Canadian North.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then turning back to Canadian north, you know, maybe this, this is the uncomfortable question, but, you know, part of the, you know, the thought process, I think, or at least, you know, outside of observers. When we saw Canadian north merge with First Air, you know, there was a bit of a discussion about, you know, how effective that has been. I know you're, you know, I'm kind of thinking about, you know, your path forward. I know you talked about some, some SGA cost things like the credit cards, you know, there.</p><p>It seems like there's a maintenance bulge in there. But can you talk about, you know, streamlining kind of the operation? And I appreciate it. Sensitive given, given a lot of the, the moving parts here. But can you just talk a little bit about your opportunity to drive some of these costs out of the business? And when you talk about the reduction below your kind of 15% threshold, is that really tied more to kind of call it an EBIT margin or is that tied more to like the fact that you're going to be higher, just higher Capex for a while.</p><p>So I'm just trying to understand the kind of the balance of where the, where the issues lie.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>That's a really good question. So let's break it into pieces. The operating improvement was going to be driven by revenue and that box is ticked. We don't intend to make material changes to passenger prices for the general public. The government contract had not reflected changes to aviation inflation for a significant period. So that's caught up in that contract. So that piece is looked after. The operating improvement then is based on costs. And I would again break that into three pieces. There's kind of a G and a improvement and things like the credit card, but that's just an example.</p><p>They're streamlining some of the accounting systems and sort of bringing them in line with EIC standards which will make them more effective. The next big one we'll achieve later this quarter is moving them on to our global insurance plan, which as a group we buy at much cheaper prices than smaller airlines do. And then you will see the next piece will be the purchasing of parts through regional one, taking advantage of our group buying capability which will drive down their operating costs. And then the last piece, which is the part that's slightly more complicated, will be moving their fleet from pure freighter and pure passenger aircraft to a combination of combi aircraft and pure freighters.</p><p>There are certain markets that will always require pure freighters, but most of the places that fly out of the italics and yellow Knights could be more effectively serviced with a combination of passenger seats and freight on each plane. So we don't need to buy new aircraft or anything. You don't need to worry about big capital expenditures, but we will need to take some time to adapt the aircraft and make changes to how they're configured. That's a relatively modest expenditure, probably more in the hundreds of thousands or million dollar range than anything significant. But it'll take a while and it'll take some changes in how we route the aircraft and those things.</p><p>So that will take a slightly longer period. And then because of the maintenance capex we knew about that are going to be higher in this period that delays our 15% return simply because the way we define that is EBITDA minus maintenance capex. Maintenance capex will be high for the next few quarters. I would say we're ahead of track on the EBITDA part of the game. Our operations I would say are improving more rapidly than we anticipated in our business model. We got some great people at Canadian north who are eager to take advantage of some of our buying power and some of our opportunities.</p><p>And the capex will take care of itself over a reasonably modest period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adam Terwin:</emphasis></p><p>And Mike, there's one thing I might. Build on Chris's question there. And Chris, it's Adam and I think you hit it on accurately. Just going back to the history and the fact that there was a merger that was right after the merger Covid happened and I think was it been fairly well known there was some changeover at the CO level. So the fact that the merger happened and then Covid and a little bit of instability at the top bringing the two airlines together was challenged. And to your point, there is opportunities now with EIC's expertise, long term ownership and the fact now that we have this long term agreement with the government unavit helps for long term planning that there is also that ability to also drive additional synergies within that operation.</p><p>So that to your point, there is that opportunity as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you. And then just maybe quickly Mike. You know, historically when we think about maintenance capex and the proportion of revenue in the aviation business, we've always thought, we've always sort of seen it on average and yet it can be lumpy but about 12% of revenue. Is that what we should be thinking? Because I appreciate These are all 737-2-1200s and larger aircraft, but is that about the right level of magnitude to think about as you as you get to that 15% number?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, it'll vary period to period. Their maintenance capex as a percentage of resident you should be very similar to what we experience in our other airlines. In addition to the 737s they operate a significant fleet of ATRs and which are exactly the same aircraft in fact actually a slightly newer version of them that Comair operates. So your thought process is correct. Although it will be higher than that over the next three or four quarters. While certain things are done, we tend to want to do things earlier rather than later. And so we don't have aircraft out of service during busy periods.</p><p>And so with our capital structure we can do that. I don't want anyone walking away with maintenance capex is going up like they weren't doing the maintenance. No, that's not the issue. The thing was there's just a whole bunch of things by timing that engines can't do at the same time. And where they may have been leasing a Replacement. Now we're going to actually overhaul it and replace it or buy a new engine. So we knew about that up front and in our mind it was part of the 200 in addition to the 200 million we were paying.</p><p>And when you look at you, even with just the early stage six month number that most of that increase relates to Canadian north, you can see that the EBITDA multiple we purchased at this at was very attractive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's helpful. And if I can just squeeze, if I can squeeze a third one in. You did make the comment, I think in the script that you've been looking at a new factory for the matting business that's going better and sort of the decisions been made to go ahead with that. Can you kind of give us any update on expectations of where that should be cited and you know, any expectations for capital spending as we go into next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>The idea is it's going to be in the southeast US we're still working between. There's really kind of four states at this point. We're looking at it could be in Florida with the other plant. It could be in Texas and it could be in Alabama or it could be in Mississippi. Those are the four places we're down to. Give me one more quarter to give you a budget for it because what we're really working on right now is how big a plant do we build? Do we build this so that we could expand it again without moving? And I think that's where we're going.</p><p>So it's hard for me to give you a budget because we're still working on the business model. But I would hope by the time we report in November we'll be able to tell you that we set up a location, we signed some purchase orders and we've got a budget and we'll be able to give you a rough start update as well, but in rough numbers. We think it's at least an 18 month project to get the plant up and running. It could be as long as two years depending on what the wait times are for some of the equipment.</p><p>It's very unique, very heavy pressing equipment to make the composite mats. So I wish we could fly could operate it tomorrow. The demand is there and demand's not going anywhere. So we're prepared to make the investment. We just want to make sure we do it right. It's a big investment for Spartan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>All right, so thanks for passing on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Once again. For participants having issues staying Connected, please dial +12898191350. Once again, that's +12898191350. And your next question comes from the line of Cameron Dirksen from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We can, Kev. Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, perfect. Just to follow up, I guess on Chris question, just on the matting business, obviously it sounds like Spartan Mat is doing very well. In your prepared remarks and in the mda, there was also some commentary about the Canadian matting business and you struck a little more optimistic tone on increased activity there. Can you just maybe discuss the visibility you have on, on how that business is looking over the next number of quarters?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it was slower in Q2 than we would have anticipated because of the delay of some of the near projects, particularly some of the pipeline and transmission line integrity work that we do in the East. It was postponed. We're starting to see that start in the third quarter. But the sheer number of projects that are under consideration that are going to get in the ground over the next six months, 12 months, is remarkable. Hydro One talked about, I forget what seven new distribution lines they've got to build. They're talking about this natural gas work. There's oil and gas pipelines as well, and gas digging.</p><p>There's, I mean, it's, it's. Virtually all parts of the linear part of that business are bullish. In the medium term, it's still going to take us whether it's the end of this quarter, beginning of next quarter, and we'll start to see that stuff go. And a lot of it's tied kind of in with the infrastructure work that our Prime Minister has talked about. But it's beyond that. It's utility work even in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Manitoba Hydro has announced a major program working on maintenance of the two bipolar lines, which will create work. There's work in Saskatchewan, there's work in bc.</p><p>We're very bullish about the medium term on that business. Again, it's probably not a Q3 hit, but it'll start later in the year and into next year. And the medium term looks great in Canada, which matches what we're already seeing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>In the U.S. okay, that's super helpful. Maybe just a second question for me, just I guess on the aerial surveillance opportunities, I mean, you mentioned, I guess, I guess a Q3 decision hopefully here on the Australian contract. Can you just maybe discuss, if you can, any more details on what other opportunities are out there? I mean, I'm thinking also potentially in Canada with increased defence spending and focus on the north, there's potentially some opportunities for that business there as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>I have to be careful about being too specific because there's negotiations ongoing on a number of things. But I will say that we've spoken in the past about inquiries in Greenland, inquiries from other countries in Europe, discussions with the Canadian government about additional work for them. I point out we've had to work on the coasts of Canada for 40 some years. Just recently extended that for another long term contract where we will discuss about other work with the government of Canada. And there's other work potentially down in the Southern Pacific other than the Australian contract.</p><p>And so I'm concerned sometimes that because of the size of the Australian contract, the discussions get somewhat fixated on it. And that's a hit or miss. Either we win or we don't. But it's one contract, it's the biggest one. But there's opportunities all over the place. I'd be very surprised if we don't announce some successes before the year is over. Now those are things that are unlikely to impact this year's revenue by the time we win the contract and buy the parts and those kinds of things. But we are very active in a number of markets.</p><p>Jake, did I miss anything?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no, that's fair. And you know, unfortunately, instability in the world drives the demand for the type of services we provide through the surveillance work. And you know, there's robust pipeline and inquiries from just about every geographic region we're operating in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, no, that's definitely good to hear. I'll pass the line. Appreciate the time, guys.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes online of Krista Friesen from cibc. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe if I can just follow up on the matting questions. There certainly sounds like a lot of opportunity in Canada. How do you feel about your supply of mats and being able to keep up with that demand?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We are currently managing production so that we don't buy them too soon. One of the advantages that we have at Northern Mat is because we're vertically integrated, we make our own construction decisions and we have very strong inventory levels, levels of timber. So we can start and stop kind of when we need to. Because the Q2 was slower, we slowed our production in that period. As we see this coming, it's likely we will start up. We operate more than one facility. It's likely our second facility will ramp later this year. So I have very little concerns about our ability to, to have enough mats in the world.</p><p>The Addition of Duomal has been great for us in the East. They've increased our relations with Hydro Quebec. We sold them a bunch of mats in the last quarter. We're looking at other opportunities with them. And the one other thing I would point out that's bullish for the business, particularly once we get past Q3, is when the transcontinental pipeline was completed, there was a lot of used mats in the marketplace all over the place. And some of our competitors jumped on those and then used very cheap mats as a means to discount their way into the marketplace.</p><p>And that's a good strategy for very short periods of time. But the used mats coming off a pipeline project had very short lifespans and we're starting to see that expire. And so the relative health of our portfolio versus perhaps some of the others is going to put us in a great spot as the ramp up comes because we'll be able to provide the mats the customers need.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>I guess one of the things I would add is in the M and A, we talked about just some of the investments that they had made in new mat inventory during the quarter and in anticipation of mat sale demand for new mats. But. But if we got into a spot where the leasing demand accelerated earlier than expected, we would have the optionality to deploy those into our lease fleet or rental fleet to make sure that we're meeting customer demands on the rental side. So that buildup and the planning that they do as a team to make sure that we're ahead of market demand positions us well for the back half of the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. And then maybe just shifting gears to Canadian north. And congrats on being able to renegotiate that contract so quickly. Are there other large contracts like that that you'll be looking to renegotiate, I guess over the next six months here?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Not really. As it relates to. As it relates to Canadian North, I'm excited that Dave White and the team at Kuwait are negotiating the RFP on the Medevac business for Nunavut. And I'm confident that we will continue to serve as the sole provider of Medevac services in the North. But that contract is under negotiation. Maybe by the time we come in November we'll have something more to share on that. But that within Calm Air or Canadian north itself, most of the stuff has been dealt with in terms of contracts. It was really the fact that the aviation inflation was so high over the last couple of years and the previous contract really didn't capture that.</p><p>And the government init is, I would suggest you perhaps the most progressive in understanding the cost of operating in their area. And so when we sat down and talked to them, we went back and forth about the best way to minimize costs and the best way to accurately forecast. And one of the things that's in this contract that we haven't had in the past, it's historically been tied to fuel prices and cpi. Well, CPI can overstate or understate aviation inflation significantly. The new contract, while a portion of it will increase as relate to cpi, it's more specifically driven by aviation wages, parts costs and exchange rates.</p><p>And when you put those together, what that means is that the contract will be much more dynamic, both upwards and downwards depending on what happens with aviation inflation. Which means both the airline and our customer are going to be well taken care of because we don't have to have proxies. We actually have real hard numbers for adjusting the cost of the service.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Mike, if I could just add to that that aviation inflation formula is very important to this and forward looking as this is a 10 plus 5 year contract, a couple of years extension and there's work really looking at the forward. Future, where we're going and how to. Have a successful contract with our partners and GN for a long, long time to come.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>That's great color. Thank you. I'll pass the line.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Konark Gupta from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Morning co operator.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Morning Mike, can you hear me okay?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Absolutely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so that proves the line works actually for me, thanks. Okay, so yeah, first of all, congrats. To Carmel, Jake and Cal for the respective changes and the new future and the careers. So congrats maybe first on the capital side of things, Mike, your business is obviously growing or expanding all across, broadly speaking. You have a lot of subsidiaries that have growth aspirations and they need capital as well as you have obviously some of these major contracts that you talked about, like Australia for example, and some of those maybe. How do you like, you know, I know the short answer to this, you know, the return on investment benchmarks you have, but how do you kind of balance out or how do you kind of prioritize the capital allocation to these businesses now considering obviously.</p><p>I mean I know you have headroom on a leverage ratio with your prominence, but I mean you still have a lot of, I would say like capital ask is much higher I guess than perhaps the question that you might have on the lever side.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>You'Re banging on about the demand for capital. I mean your statement is absolutely Correct. But the way I would answer is our work is what fits our model, what fits, what do we want to do? And assuming we want to do it, we really don't view it as a competition between Pam's project and Richard's project. They're both individually reviewed and do they meet the standard? But the real test then becomes for us is where does the capital come from? How do we fund these things? And so which the test of that becomes our leverage ratio.</p><p>And when I speak to our investors, one of the pages in our, in our deck shows our historical leverage ratios. And we're, we're at the lower end of our historical aggregate debt. When I talk about aggregate, I'm talking about secured debt with our bank and convertibles. We had two sets of convertibles that we've called that turned into equity. The next set is over 25% in the money, so it's callable at any moment. So as we need equity in the short term, the convertibles will provide that. In terms of liquidity, we have scads with our bank facility.</p><p>I think I've mentioned this before, but I'd be one of the few Canadian businesses that says the Canadian banks are pretty good at what they do. We're well looked after by our debt syndicate of Canadian banks and a couple banks out of the US and so we're sitting with a billion dollars of liquidity. More than that, A little more than that perhaps. And we have equity available to us from those convertible debentures when needed. And we're working on now, we will probably at some point get a debt rating so that if we needed to tap the bond markets in the future, we would do that, but we would only do it with our historical levels of debt.</p><p>And when we talk about historical levels, I'm talking about debt to EBITDA ratios. We've been dogmatic about staying in a band. And if you look at it with the exception of a little bump up during 2020 when EBITDA went down because of COVID we stayed in that band for our 20 years. We're not going to change that. So our access to capital is sufficient, barring some change, to be able to fully take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. For us to continue to generate 20% plus returns for our shareholders, we need to invest capital.</p><p>And so when my guys bring me good opportunities, I'm glad to give Rich the problem of which pot are we going to take it out of? And if at some point in the future we need an equity, we'd raise it We've raised equity at continually higher prices over our history. The last batch I think we did was at 52 or $53. We're now 25, 30% higher than that, 40% higher than that. But having said all that, we don't need any equity. We don't view that as imminent or even in the medium term. But if we did, I have no reticence to do it to maintain a balance sheet.</p><p>So circling back to the end of your thing, the more good opportunities we have, the better. And we'll fund it with a balance sheet that looks like the balance sheet today, just more of it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>And from our perspective, carg, it's super exciting to see those opportunities coming up from the subsidiaries because that's part of what our secret sauce is, keeping our vendors engaged and keeping them for the long term. And it's those sorts of opportunities. Opportunities and having the capital to deploy that keeps them excited about their business and helps us generate those returns Mike's talking about over an extended period of time. So from our perspective, seeing those opportunities come up are an extremely positive thing. And to Mike's point, we'll find out how to get the capital to make sure that we continue to generate returns.</p><p>We've proven that we can.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>That's great color. Thanks, guys. That makes sense. And.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>And this is a real life example. The guys have proven they can invest money and grow regional. One we bought it did $16 million in EBITDA the year we bought it. It's going to be 10 times that big this year. And that's because those guys know how to invest money. So when we talked about growth capex being negative and in Q tip pure happenstance that nothing closed in that quarter. But if you look a little deeper, we had $20 million in deposits on transactions and I can tell you there's more coming. And so when Hank calls me and says, hey, I got some ERJ175s or I got some CRJ9 hundreds or Q4 hundreds, we're glad to write the check because that just fuels our future growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the addition, Mike. Thanks. Just on second one, maybe on the portfolio, I mean, you always have, I think the advantage or disadvantage, perhaps whatever you want to call it of a diverse portfolio is that some of the businesses will work strongly and some might be weaker for a moment and then things might flip flop. Right? So I mean, there's always some puts and takes. I mean, you know, if you look at, you know, the windows business over the last, I would say four or five Years maybe or five years. I mean Covid and tariffs and then like you know, some other issues, interest rate, etc, like all those factors have had exogenous impacts on the Quest business or Windows business, you know, at some point. I mean like I know the demand is great and all that, but obviously like we're not obviously seeing that flow through in the earnings, the quarterly earnings at this point, right? For the last many quarters.</p><p>At any point, like you know, would you feel like, I mean, yeah, sure, demand is fine, but then this is it and you know, we don't probably need as big of an asset so we need to either shrink or sell or do something, you know, I mean like is there, is there a possibility at least in consideration of strategic opportunities to optimize the portfolio that I mean.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We look at that stuff on a regular basis and if we see that it's plateaued or there isn't something, we can do it. The suggestions you make are stuff we would look at directly. We're nowhere near that in the window business. It frustrates me a little bit right now because we worked so hard to bring those plants together. We closed the Quest plant. It's now all of the BV facilities. We've done stuff that's improved our margins and then the tariffs in the US like just wiped out everything we did all at once now. So we changed how we're manufacturing.</p><p>We used to be location agnostic. We built stuff for Canada and the US and we built stuff for the US and Canada depending on what fit our production schedules. Well instantly we couldn't do that overnight. We have to build in the country we're using it for. So that means right now our Dallas plant is very slow. Our KD plants actually reasonably busy. And so we're dealing with those. We would do what you're suggesting, but I would tell you we're nowhere near that conclusion on that business. I think the best piece of I can give you is Comair.</p><p>If you went back a decade, was my weakest airline in terms of return on capital and most of the financial metrics. If you look at it today, it's added very near the top. And these things go through cycles. And the beauty of why EIC succeeds when perhaps some others don't is we don't have to make short term decisions. I have more people in my Windows business than I would have if I was only in the Windows business. The strength of my aviation business unequivocally is subsidizing the window business right now. But at the beginning of COVID The opposite was true at the beginning of COVID The window business helped carry some of the other stuff said we don't have a lack of confidence in it.</p><p>In fact, quite the opposite. I'm very confident in it. But the analysis you're talking about is done all the time and if we need to do something, we will. Right now we really don't see that as the future, but it is something we look at.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. And despite it's not specific to the Windows business, we understand that we live in a marketplace and an over performing subsidiary might, you know, you might need to make that assessment on an over performing subsidiary as well because someone may be willing to pay you more than you think it's worth. So it's not specific to the Windows business either. And even talking about that Konark like the, like that long term view that Mike talks about, incredibly important. Whereas we are also seeing competitors fail and competitors close their plan, which improves our long term outlook on those businesses just because they can have greater market share and greater pricing power.</p><p>So we constantly evaluate each of the businesses but that longer term outlook provides us a significant advantage in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys. And just quick clarification as a follow up maybe on the guidance I think you mentioned to Chris. I think the $35 million incremental would have been higher had it not been forest fires. I'm just trying to get the math right as we kind of contemplate you guys hitting an $800 million EBITDA mark at some point, I guess. Are we looking at probably mid to highest 700s perhaps, you know, without the forest fires. Is that the idea? Or it would have been more, more or less like 5, 10 million more more had it not been forest fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>I think the forest fires are more in the 10 million-ish challenge than the other. And I know you're trying to get me to give you a 2026 number. We'll give you one in November. But I will tell you that there is embedded growth that's going to come for stuff we've already paid for. The planes that are going to come out of Carson and go into Powell are going to generate income. I've already paid for the second plane for Britain that's going to generate income. And so I'm hoping we stay in the seven hundreds about as long as the so long a period of time as the stock stays in the 60s.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's really helpful, Mike. I'll wait for you guys on 426. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you and your next question comes from the line of Gary Ho from the Jordan Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Morning. Can you hear me okay?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we can.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. Okay, I want to touch on ma a a little bit. I know you just closed Canadian north acquisition and several growth projects on the go. I think you also mentioned M and a pipeline continues to be active across both segments. So where, you know, where are you spending your time on and what do you get excited about? Maybe talk about preference for tuck ins versus more platform type opportunities and maybe leverage off Konark's question there on the Windows segment. If I can flip that around and that you guys take a longer term view. Are you more opportunistic acquirers as well, buying good businesses at cyclical crops and perhaps attractive valuations? Maybe chat about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so I'll take your second question first. In terms of being an opportunistic buyer, I would tell you an unequivocal yes. We view ourselves as being independent thinkers and we've done deals that when they first came into us, we couldn't figure out why they were a business. Regional wanted to be a great example of that. My acquisition fellow at the time brought it to me and I didn't have any idea why I wanted to be in that business. He was out of it. It was a good business. I turned it down. He brought it back again.</p><p>I turned it down the second time and finally says, go meet with them. Come with me and if you still don't like it, I'll stop presenting it to you. And I went and met with them. And literally 45 seconds into the discussions with Jerome and his team, I realized what a great business this was. And we were competing with private equity and we had a model of investing in that business as opposed to reaping cash out of it. That made us a successful buyer. And now we look at today and it would be 10 times the size of what we bought it off of.</p><p>So yes, we view ourselves as opportunistic in terms of what we prefer, whether it's platforms or tuck ins. I'm not sure we have a preference. I would suggest to you that we see a lot more maybe tuck ins or businesses that are tangential to what we're in. So if we found another medevac business or we saw with the parts business or where we added the glazers to our window business, or if there was an aerial firefighting business as an example, that would be something we would love to have. And so most of the things we look at today tend to be related to what we do, but they're typically bigger than what I would classify as a tuck in today.</p><p>What we're looking at is virtually everything Adam and this team have is very related to something we have. I think I was told by a couple of my significant long term investors when we bought Canadian North. Oh, that makes sense. I should have known that was coming. And I think if we're successful on some of those deals that we're working on, I think that will be the market's reaction. I would caution that there's nothing imminent. We're not like at the 10 yard line ready to score here. Where Adam and his team are working hard on some opportunities and some of these projects, specifically where we're in a negotiated settlement as opposed to an auction, takes some time, but Adam and his team remain busy and it's both manufacturing and aviation assets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adam Terwin:</emphasis></p><p>To build on. What Mike's saying in terms of being opportunistic and being open minded to opportunities that were not necessarily directly in that niche within the manufacturing segment or within the aviation segment, we look to acquire a very specific type of company with a great leader and a good management team and really focus on the long term fundamentals of that business. Given our business plan to own that company for a very, very long time and also to empower the management team there. So being open minded and opportunistic allows us to have a broader scope of those types of companies.</p><p>At the same time, given some of the uncertainty that we had last year within both elections within the U.S. and then Canada this year, followed by some of the other uncertainty tied to the geopolitics and some of the economic positions, you often see that there's ebbs and flows of acquisition opportunities and what we call marketed deals coming in. You know, our ability to have those two funnels, one of the market deals and then one of the strategic deals, allows us to be a lot more active on a consistent basis. And I'd say that one of the exciting things when we buy a new company and for that owner coming on is the idea that EIC likes to continue to grow those businesses, including strategic acquisitions.</p><p>And so we're consistently working with all our subsidiaries. When they view there's an opportunity to go uncover opportunities that help them expand their overall operations. And as you can see, that's what our last four acquisitions have been. They've been all strategic opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great, makes sense. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the long term service agreement. I think the government, Nunavut has an option to purchase a stake in Canadian North. Maybe just talk about the reasoning and do you have a preference one way or another?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>The discussions about typically a long term agreement like that with the government in Nunavutu would have been done through an rfp. And there was discussions and there was reasons for both of us to want to do it quickly. And one of the things we said, look, if you're, we want to prove to you that we're good partners and we're negotiating this in good faith. And part of that was if you want to be our partner, join in. You got to pay the capital like we have and you could join. I think the government in Unovit took comfort in the fact that we were prepared to share the deal with them and if the deal wasn't fair, we wouldn't have shared it.</p><p>And so we aren't capital constrained. And so I don't think I would say that I want them to participate, but I'm not adverse to it. I mean having your biggest customer in a territory like that, that's going to be growing and is going to be a big part of our future, strengthens our business. So I think it's really more about whether the government in Unova wants to deploy the level of capital they need to be our partner. And if they do, we're glad to have them. It's crystal clear in the operating agreements that while they'll, they have board representation and those kinds of things operate in control of how you run an airline lies with the actual.</p><p>That's what we do. We're prepared to have a partner that we talked about things with. But operating decisions need to stay with us, Jake.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>And I think it's much more indicative of the degree of partnership that we have with the government of Nunavut in developing the critical infrastructure in the north. So rather than a financial matter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>I think that we might have had a bigger challenge providing that option to some other provincial or territorial governments than we did Nunavut. They, they are remarkably literate from an operating environment about their operating environment. They know how fundamental aviation is to the government, to the territory, and so they make a good partner. Perhaps not all, all of the territories or provinces we operate, the governments are as exposed to aviation and as such would be more challenged to be a partner. Nunavut is well situated to be our partners if they choose to. I suspect that will be something that will be decided by the next government.</p><p>In Nunavut. They have an election coming this fall and so I would be very surprised if any decision was made before that election and they have a year to decide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Those are my two questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steve Henson from Raymond Chains. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, Steve, sorry for the problems with the phone service here. Apparently we're still having them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Hansen, may you please check if your line is muted? Our next question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Operator. Steve, if you want to email me your question, I'll read it and get it answered. That way we can get around the problem with the phone system. So if you want to text me or email me your question, I'll read it to everyone and then I'll answer it. Operator, you can go with the next person.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Your next question comes from the line of Amir Izat from Ventum Financial. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrej:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrej:</emphasis></p><p>Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one. Well, this is Andre, first of all on behalf of Amer. But on the Australia maritime surveillance bid, given its scale, what's the realistic share of the contract you could control if successful? And how do any local content requirements. Factor into your economics, operational structure or partnership?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>The contract is probably. While the government does have the right to split it, I would suggest that's highly unlikely. The technology of the aircraft talking to one another, having two different companies with different software would be remarkably difficult. In fact, I think one of our competitive advantages is our aircraft run the same software that we own that the helicopter ISR running. So I don't think there's any likelihood that it gets split. I think it's a win or a loss in terms of local content. Do you want to take that, Jake?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I mean, we have committed and required. To set up operations in Australia. Knowing the time and space, that's not something that can be run remotely. And you know, it'll have a full operation set up to support a very significant aircraft operation down in Australia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrej:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great, thanks. And shifting to Canadian north, you pointed. Out in the MDMA that the Canadian. North infrastructure as a potential enabler for Arctic defense and security opportunities. Could you speak a little bit more about that and maybe from a practical. Standpoint, any steps we can take to monetize that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I mean, what you're going to see, I think in the north is two main themes of growth. One is we've seen the value of critical minerals. Nunavut is blessed with a lot of them. And so as those become a strategic asset that we want to have as a country and with our NATO partners and our American partners partners, you're going to see development of those. Well, that means Bringing in people and equipment and stuff into flying locations, which is exactly what we do, whether it's Comair or Canadian North. And then the other piece relates more to national defense.</p><p>We're going to need to build facilities in the North. We're built by the F35 Joint Strike Fighter. We don't have hangers for them, we don't have runways in enough places for them. And so the government's going to build those. And while I don't think we'll be hauling up a cement on our ATRs, we will be hauling up the people and rotating crews and doing all that stuff, which is going to create demand for our scheduled services. And because of the infrastructure we have there, it's exceptionally difficult for someone to do that at a better price than we can for the government simply because we've got hangars, we've got facilities, and if someone else wants to try and take that from us, their costs are going to be far higher than ours are.</p><p>So we're excited about the ability to lever the government's investments in defense with our scheduled airline. And then on top of that, it's not really so much a Canadian north story as it is a pal store, but the opportunities for other things like expanding the surveillance we do on east and west coast to our northern coast. I think there's things like that that we'll see discussions of perhaps expanding our role in the northern search and rescue program where we already provide the maintenance and overhaul capability for the aircraft which were recently purchased from Airbus. I think all of those are growth opportunities for us where we can partner with the government intent increasing our investment in defense and do it cheaper and faster than the government can do it itself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the color. I'll pass the line. Okay, operator, before we jump onto the next call, Steve Hanson sent me the question, which is what's the quantum of maintenance and growth capex we should expect this year? I'm not sure I can answer that with a specific number other than to say as it relates to Canadian north, the free cash flow will generate won't be a huge number in the first two or three quarters because of the maintenance capex, although the EBITDA we're generating is improving and some of the cost stuff we're doing is ahead of schedule.</p><p>Growth capex. I hope there's a lot of them. Right now it's really limited to finishing off the purchases of the King airs for the B.C. medevac contract, which will allow us to deploy their aircraft to Newfoundland with only a cost of modifying Them, which is relatively modest. And then. And we have significant investments in regional one for the balance of the year. And that could be in the 50 to $100 million range, depending on which transactions we close. But there's a bunch of stuff we're bullish on, quite frankly. That market today, it's easier to sell in than it is to buy in.</p><p>And so when we get the right opportunities, we're all over the place. So in general, maintenance capex will be heavy. The balance of this year and into next year, no surprises. That was part of our due diligence. We knew that was coming. We talked about hitting a 15% return by the end of next year. We are more confident than ever that we'll do that both by increasing revenue, decreasing costs, and then ultimately normalizing maintenance capex over a period of time. I hope I answered what you were looking for, Steve. Operator,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>thank you once again. Should you have a question, please press star. Then the number one on your telephone keypad. We have the line of Steve Hanson from Raymond James. Mr. Hanson, you may go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Steve, are you there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>I think my question's been answered. Mike. I'm good. Thanks for that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We can talk to you now, Steve. We do have the technology. People are building AI centers. Technology centers. We can complete a phone call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>We're running along. I think that's all an answer. I appreciate the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Steve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Steve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes from the light of Fraxy Hessen from Paradigm. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Razi Hasan:</emphasis></p><p>Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just two small ones here on the Windows business. Is it fair to say that we should begin to see results from the 100 million new projects you mentioned flow through in mid-2027 if the world stays the same way? Is that a fair assessment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean, each project is slightly different, but that on average, that's about right. I mean, the thing is, 100 million is a good number for this last month or so, but we burned that. We burned that much out of our book every quarter. More than that, actually. And so that while it's. While it's a good start and it's encouraging, we still got some work to do to get the actual order taking to where we want it to be. But it's a positive sign. And one of them was in a market. I'm not going to disclose where there was a market that was difficult in the US For a period of time.</p><p>So it's exciting to land a significant sale in a market that had been difficult for a while.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Razi Hasan:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Okay, great. And then maybe just lastly on the Australian contract, I'm not sure if you mentioned, but can you disclose how many bidders were in the process or how many bidders are left or any idea there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Right now? We know, you know, we suspect it's not a published thing. We suspect that there's about four bidders that were submitting. Obviously, the incumbent and ourselves, we feel, are the key challengers for this. But as I said, we anticipate there were four bidders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Razi Hasan:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks. I'll pass the line.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back to Mr. Mike Powell for any closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you to everybody for joining us today. It's an exciting day. We look forward to talking to you again in November. Have a great day, everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>And this concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-93ed1d558b2552ff868a9eedb1a1caa4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH2-KHM3-S5S1-P1YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 AlphaStreet Inc.

Welcome to Exchange Income Corporation's conference call to discuss the financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The corporation's results, including the MDNA and financial statements, were issued on August 11, 2025 and are currently available via the Company's website or Cedar Pass. Before turning the call over to management, listeners are cautioned that today's presentation and the responses to questions may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of Canadian Provincial securities laws. Forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a true reliance should not be placed on such statements.</p><p>Certain material factors or assumptions are applied in making forward looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. For additional information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations and about material factors or assumptions applied in making forward looking statements, please consult the Quarterly and Annual mda, the Risk Factors section of the Annual information form and EIC's other filings with Canadian securities regulators. Except as required by Canadian Securities Law, EIC does not undertake to update any forward looking statements. Such statements may only as of the date made.</p><p>Listeners are also reminded that today's call is being recorded and broadcast live by the Internet for the benefit of individual shareholders, analysts and other interested parties. I would now like to turn the call over to the CEO of Exchange Income Corporation, Mike Powell. Thank you. Please go ahead. Mr. Plai.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you Operator Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me today is Richard Warrick, our cfo, who will speak about our quarterly financial results along with Jake Trainor and Travis Muir who will speak about our outlook for our two operating segments. Adam Turwin and Dave White are also on the call and will be available to respond to any specific questions on Canadian north and the Long Term Air Services Agreement that was announced subsequent to quarter end. Yesterday we released our second quarter results for 2025. Our performance in the second quarter continued to be very strong for each of our key financial metrics.</p><p>Once again we set Q2 high watermarks for each of our key metrics including revenue, adjusted ebitda, free cash flow, net earnings and adjusted net earnings. In fact, our revenues of 720 million were the highest achieved in any quarter in our history. Subsequent to quarter end we announced the closing of the Canadian north transaction. Equally important was the signing of the agreement with the Government of Nunavut for our Long Term Services whereby Canadian north and Comair will be the sole provider services for all three regions in Nun. The Canadian north acquisition is highly strategic for EIC as adding its infrastructure and assets and management team ensure that EIC has a unique value proposition for our customers and the Government of Canada.</p><p>Jake will talk further about some of the opportunities that exist for EIC with Canadian north as part of the family. We also updated our 2025 EBITDA guidance and increased the range to $725 million to $765 million, which now includes the financial results of Canadian North. The seasonality of Canadian north is relatively consistent with our other Essential Air businesses. As a reminder, we previously noted that the returns being free cash flow, less maintenance capex will be muted in the short term but are expected to meet our return or expectations by the end of 2026. These record results were generated during a time of uncertainty with business sentiment being weak at the start of the quarter due to the uncertainty related to trade policies and geopolitical events.</p><p>This quarter, however, is another example of how diversified and resilient our businesses are in times of uncertainty. EIC continues to generate strong returns even when the world is experiencing difficult times. The impact of tariffs was not material to EIC overall, however, it did negatively impact our Multi Story Window Solutions business line as the tariffs more than offset the productivity and profitability gains we achieved from our integration activities. We continue to be bullish on the long term fundamentals within that business line and we will review all options to mitigate the tariffs as we move forward through manufacturing decisions and changes in our supply chain.</p><p>Ultimately, I believe that Canada and the EOs will come to an agreement and hopefully will have reduced tariffs in the longer term as the two economies are so directly intertwined. Our remaining subsidiaries did not experience any direct impact from the tariffs other than reduced business sentiment which deferred some purchasing decisions from our customers during the quarter. We are still seeing significant number of inquiries throughout the businesses, especially as we exited the quarter. As customers realize that this trade environment is now the new norm, I believe that business sentiment will gradually improve and the number of firm orders will continue with a step based improvement, especially now that legislation has passed in the US which provides accelerated tax deductibility.</p><p>Subsequent quarter end, several of our manufacturing entities received purchase orders including our Multi Story Window Solutions business line which booked approximately $100 million in new projects. We expect that this positive momentum will continue throughout our various business lines. Our results were also impacted by the forest fires experienced across Canada. Most importantly, my heart goes out to these who have been displaced from their communities and from their homes. EIC was there to support these communities in evacuation efforts and we are currently providing capacity to repatriate the community members back home. Our Rotary Wing operations were also very busy in fire suppression work.</p><p>The impact on the communities first and foremost on our thoughts. However, it did impact our quarter as well. The evacuation sites provide a short term improvement to our charter operations. However, it subsequently has a negative impact on our scheduled service and medevac operations. Those communities which are no longer populated I will let Rich focus on the financial results for the operating segments. However, prior to passing off the call I wanted to provide some context on a couple of items. We will continue to have significant liquidity available to us. We had drawn the funds for the Canadian north acquisition prior to quarter end which is why the cash balance was in excess of normal amounts.</p><p>Our leverage ratios continue to be at the low end of the historical range and our balance sheet continues to be very strong which will allow us to execute on organic growth opportunities and or acquisitions. I also wanted to give my regular update on the status of significant contract proposals that remain outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2024, we submitted our proposal to the Australian Government for their maritime surveillance contract. We previously anticipated hearing the results of the award by July. However, the May election in Australia delayed the bid evaluation process and therefore we anticipate hearing on the results sometime in the third quarter.</p><p>As I previously commented, we believe we put together a very strong bid and we expect to have as good a chance as any other bidder. Additionally, within the geopolitical climate we continue to see significant interest from several other countries for additional ISR assets and we are working with several governments in developing solutions to their needs and have several discussions with those involved in the procurement process. Our second aircraft for the UK Home Office contract has been fully modified and is waiting regulatory certification in the UK and is expected to start flying later this month. We crossed and significantly exceeded Another milestone being the 3 billion equity market capitalization capitalization.</p><p>Our collective team is very proud of this achievement and it's a recognition of our business model. The year to date results are a very strong start to the year and continue to show the strength of our business model which is starting to be reflected in our share price. The demand for our services and products is very robust. Jake and Travis will focus on the outlook for our segments for the remainder of 2025. Lastly, we will provide the market with our expected adjusted ebitda guidance for 2026 at our third quarter conference call in November. Consistent with our past practice, I will now pass the call over to Rich.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you Mike and good morning. For the second quarter of 2025, revenue of 720 million, adjusted EBITDA of 177 million, free cash flow of 123 million, net earnings of 40 million and adjusted net earnings of 47 million were all second quarter records. Revenue in our aerospace and aviation segment increased by 28 million or 7% to 455 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 13 million or 10% to 148 million. Looking at the Essential Air Services business line, the improvements were driven by a couple key factors. First, historic organic growth capital expenditures over the past number of years to both satisfy increased demand and contract wins in our medevac operations primarily related to the BC and Manitoba medevac contracts drove increases in revenue and profitability including enhanced scope in multiple markets.</p><p>Second, the quarter experienced strong firefighting activities which resulted in evacuation flights and rotary wing fire suppression. Lastly, while load factors were strong in the first part of the quarter, scheduled service and medevac volumes experienced decline in latter part as a result of northern communities being displaced temporarily and not requiring those services. Our aerospace business line revenues and profitability were lower due to the planned wind down of certain training programs prior to the start of new programs and contracts. Additionally, one of the aerospace contracts changed from a performance based logistics agreement to a time and materials arrangement which results in more variability when comparing quarters.</p><p>Our aircraft sales and leasing business line increases were driven by continued improvement in leasing activity and robust parts demand. We are seeing significant demand in our leasing business for the aircraft and even more so on the engine side. Partially offsetting those increases was a reduction in large asset sales to the prior period. Those sales are generally lower margin transactions and more lumpy than our traditional parts and leasing business. Revenue in our manufacturing segment increased by 31 million or 13% to 265 million doll million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 9 million or 26% to $44 million. Our environmental access Solutions business line had increased revenues and adjusted EBITDA driven by the acquisition of Spartan which had significant demand for its composite maps.</p><p>As previously discussed, Spartan Team is evaluating several existing locations to house our second plant based on the longer term secular trends in the Canadian market. We saw a decrease in adjusted EBITDA due to a change in product mix as we saw greater mat sales compared to rental mats as certain rental mat projects were deferred into the latter portion of 2025 and into 2026. As expected, our multi story Window Solutions business revenue decreased due to project customer deferrals and related production gaps. Profitability was further negatively impacted in the short term by aluminum tariffs. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including changes in supply chain.</p><p>However, those take some time to identify and set up new suppliers to meet demand and quality requirements. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did see instances of being see instances of inquiries being converted into bookings. With over $100 million in bookings, we are encouraged that booking trends will continue to improve in the back half of the year due to the geopolitical trade risk becoming more normalized and businesses willing to deploy capital. Our precision manufacturing and engineering business line had another solid quarter from a revenue and profitability perspective. It was driven by customer demand across several industries including telecommunications, technology, resource and data centers.</p><p>Overall net earnings were $40 million for the second quarter which was an increase of 7 million or 23. The higher adjusted EBITDA and reduced interest expense was offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to the acquisition and growth capital investments and increased acquisition costs related to the Canadian IRP transactions. Because of its complexity, earnings per share increased to $0.78 per share compared to $0.69 in the prior quarter. Adjusted net earnings were 47 million compared to 38 million in the prior year with an increase in adjusted net earnings per share from $0.80 to $0.92 per share.</p><p>Free cash flow was 123 million compared to 101 million in the prior year. Free cash flow per share increased from $2.13 to $2.40 per share while free cash flow maintenance capital expenditures was 57 million compared to 52 million and on a per share basis increased from $1.11 to $1.12. Maintenance capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2025 were 66 million compared to the prior year 48 million on a six month basis, maintenance capital expenditures were 122 million compared to 88 million in the prior year. Q1 in the prior year was an anomaly on the low end due to the timing of maintenance events.</p><p>The increase in the current year is due to the timing of events coupled with the policy based on utilization for aircraft and engines within aircraft sales and leasing. As discussed in the first quarter, growth capital expenditures during the second quarter were $5 million compared to 45 million in the prior year. The second quarter was lower than anticipated as we expect based on current opportunities within aircraft sales and leasing that growth capital expenditures will be incurred in the third quarter which will reverse the negative second quarter growth capital expenditures. From our working capital perspective, we had an investment of approximately $40 million.</p><p>The investment was driven by growth in the business coupled with deposits of approximately $20 million for assets within our aircraft sales and leasing business line. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we collected a material government receivable of approximately $19 million to bring the aging of government receivables more in line with historical norms. We are actively managing our working capital and are working with each subsidiary team to convert working capital to cash. Corporation's aggregate leverage, including both its senior credit facility and convertible debentures, decreased from 3.36 at December 31 to 3.21 at June 30. Our aggregate leverage ratio remains near historical norms and well within our target.</p><p>Our M and A pipeline remains strong along with our liquidity to execute on acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a hallmark of ESE and allows us to be opportunistic organically and through acquisition when the right opportunities present themselves. That being said, the added liquidity does not change our view on leverage and we plan to maintain our leverage within our historical range. I will now turn the call over to Jake, who will provide an Update for the 2025 remaining outlook for the aerospace and aviation segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Rich. Travis and I will once again split up the Outlook section and I'll focus on the Aerospace and aviation segment. Travis will provide context on the manufacturing segment. Overall, we're expecting a strong last six. Months from a revenue and adjusted EBITDA perspective from our aerospace and aviation segment for several key reasons. The most significant will be the inclusion of the operating results of Canadian north due to the completion of the acquisition on July 1. Taking a step back, the Canadian north seasonality is relatively consistent with our Essential Air Services operations with their second and fourth quarters being relatively similar, the third quarter being the strongest and the first quarter is the seasonally weakest due to demand and weather factors. Secondly, we anticipate strengthening results due to growth capital investments made for the contractual wins announced over the past several years, including contributions from the UK Home Office's second aircraft, which is expected to start flying in late August upon regulatory approval.</p><p>I'll discuss the specific growth factors by business Line. Our Essential Air Services will see growth driven by a multitude of factors when compared to the prior period. The first and most significant will be the addition of Canadian North. We also anticipate strong load factors and growth across our legacy networks when compared to 2024. We had experienced strong load factors in Q1 and in early Q2 and then those were replaced by evacuation flights in Manitoba and Northern Ontario due to wildfires. The load factors specifically in Manitoba were then reduced in the latter portion of the quarter as communities that were displaced and therefore revenue and profitability of scheduled services were negatively impacted during the last six months of the year.</p><p>We do anticipate a normalization of results. Lastly, we expect continued growth in our medevac business because of increases in scope compared to the prior year. We anticipate receiving approximately eight to 10 of the new King Air360 aircraft under the BC Medevac contract by year end which will allow us to redeploy the pre existing aircraft throughout our other operations including the Newfoundland and Labrador fixed wing medevac operations. Offsetting some of these gains is the impact of continued labor shortages and supply chain challenges. We're not seeing a worsening of these dynamics, however, the challenges still remain specifically on aircraft parts and consumables as well as on aircraft maintenance labor.</p><p>The aerospace business line's revenue and EBITDA are expected to increase as the prior year comparables in the third and fourth quarters have started to reflect the wind down of training contracts and the conversion of the aerospace support contract from a performance based logistics agreement to a time and materials arrangement. These increases are expected to be driven by the second aircraft deployed onto the UK Home Office contract and continued strong tempo of flying for owned ISR assets. Our aircraft sales and leasing business is also expected to experience growth as Richard talked about the investment in both working capital for future parts sales and investment in aircraft and engines within the leasing portfolio anticipated within the third quarter.</p><p>We continue to expect growth in the leasing revenues as we place those aircraft and engines on lease. With the increase in inventory, we also anticipate greater part sales throughout the year assuming we can access MRO slots. Taking a step back, I wanted to focus on the strategic benefits of the Canadian north transaction for the longer term for EIC as a whole. We believe that the Canadian north infrastructure and aviation assets coupled with our existing operations provide us with a unique offering to meet the development needs of the North. As the Government of Canada renews its focus on development, security and sovereignty within the NorthEIC's comprehensive portfolio including advanced aerospace solutions, sovereign Arctic aviation defense enabling infrastructure in country defence manufacturing and our extensive network of partnerships with Indigenous communities and businesses uniquely position the company to lead and support these critical initiatives.</p><p>We will proactively have discussions with the Government and our customers about how EIC can support them in achieving their NATO targets and development in the North. We expect maintenance CAPEX expenditures to increase for a number of reasons. Firstly, due to the Addition of Canadian north we noted that the first year returns are expected to be muted due to higher than normal maintenance capex expenditures required when we negotiated the purchase price. We took into account the projected maintenance CAPEX expenditures and negotiated a corresponding reduction in the purchase price. Secondly, maintenance capital expenditures are expected to increase in line with increases in our adjusted EBITDA in our aerospace and aviation segment.</p><p>Thirdly, increases in maintenance capital expenditures related to our aircraft and sales and leasing business due to continued strengthening of utilization within our lease portfolio. And lastly, this quarter's maintenance capital expenditures in the central air services were below our internal expectations due to a timing of events which are expected to be caught up in subsequent quarters. Growth investments in the remainder of 2025 include capital expenditures for 8 to 10 new King Air aircraft which will be used in the BC Medevac contract. We've received five of these aircraft by the end of August. Lastly, Regional one has placed deposits on certain aircraft assets and anticipates on executing aircraft and engine transactions during the third and fourth quarters.</p><p>The business had negative growth capital expenditures during the second quarter which was an anomaly due to the timing of the execution of opportunities. As a reminder, transactions are only executed if they meet the same financial metrics as applied for acquisitions. I'll now pass it off to Travis to provide some commentary on the manufacturing segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Muhr:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Jake and good morning. We're anticipating continued growth in our revenues and profitability for our manufacturing segment for the remainder of the year compared to 2024. This growth is expected for two reasons. Firstly, we see the normalization of the business environment for many of our segment subsidiaries coupled with the annualized impact of Spartan in our Environmental Access Solutions business line. All of the businesses within the manufacturing segment were experiencing a strong level of customer inquiries at the start of 2025 with some softness experience as the tariffs were implemented. The tariff uncertainty saw a small reduction from a customer booking perspective in the second quarter, but the business sentiment has been gradually improving as customers began to accept the risk landscape.</p><p>Overall, as Mike had mentioned, as the tariff situation stands today, we have not been directly impacted by the tariffs except for the aluminum tariffs impacting the multi story Window Solutions business line during the quarter. The vast majority of our products that we produce are Canada, usa, Mexico compliant and therefore the broader risk of tariffs would relate to declining business sentiments and supply chain changes. As Richard commented, which do take some time to implement. Our Environmental Access Solutions business line is expected to generate returns higher than the comparative periods for the remainder of the year. Spartan continues to experience very strong demand for its composite Map solutions and we anticipate that they will continue to sell out their manufacturing capacity based on feedback received from customers and testing on the System 7 XT mat.</p><p>Also, the FAW Trackout product line is seeing very strong demand. Due to that demand, we are actively assessing various location alternatives to build a state of the art class. We see long term positive trends in the composite mat industry as the geographic and sector usage continues to expand and take market share from the traditional wood mat industry in the U.S. although we've seen some deferrals in project start dates for our mat bridge solutions business in Canada, we anticipate those projects commencing in the latter parts of 2025 and into 2026 which should drive an uptick in mat and bridge rentals.</p><p>We've talked a lot about our bullish view on the transmission and distribution sector as electric grids have to be expanded and hardened for the new electricity demands, whether it be for electric vehicles or data centers. We also see several tailwinds for the traditional oil and gas and pipeline sectors. As expected, our multi story window solutions business line revenue and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be lower than the comparative periods we had signaled our expectations in the year end and first quarter call and the drivers remain the same for the remainder of the year. The period over period declines are expected due to one the heightened interest rate environment that existed in 2023 and 2024 that resulted in reduced project manufacturing for 2025 as projects booked will be manufacturing 18 to 24 months after the booking date generally.</p><p>Secondly, for projects scheduled for 2025 we anticipate margin pressures due to the type of projects booked coupled with production gaps. We have integrated the manufacturing capacity in Canada by combining certain manufacturing facilities and are seeing the fruits of those activities as we did note profitability increase in benefits. However, those are more than offset by the tariffs as discussed in our reporting, we cannot alter our supply chains in the short term and and therefore were subject to the aluminum tariffs during the quarter. In the longer term we'll be able to mitigate the impact and optimize production.</p><p>Quoting in Canada and the U.S. continues to be very active and we're seeing bookings subsequent to year end. We are successful in booking approximately 100 million of new projects and we anticipate this trend to continue as developers become more comfortable with the economic environments we are in. We remain very bullish on this business line as the longer term fundamentals which drive demand being an acute shortage of affordable housing remains very strong across several geographic regions in Canada and the U.S. our precision manufacturing and engineering business line is expected to improve from a revenue and profitability perspective for the remainder of the year compared to the prior year.</p><p>We're seeing strength across various sectors including defense, telecommunications, technology, resource and data centers. We are anticipating growth capital expenditures to be incurred in each of the business lines, but that should be relatively consistent with the prior year. The growth capital expenditures in the Environmental Access Solutions business line will depend on the market dynamics as they continually reassess their fleet based on expected market conditions. But we do expect an investment in fleet along with the buildup of Max to realize those opportunities for the latter part of 2025 and into 2026. I'll now pass the call back to Mike.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Travis. I'm very excited about our future. We are guided by our past values and our various business lines are set up to realize significant tailwinds for the future. We have the right collection of businesses, the right management teams and our 20 year past provides evidence on our ability to strategically execute on those opportunities as EISC as a company is characterized by resiliency and stability and our record results and outlook for 2025 is a continuation of those trends. Before we move on to questions, I'd like to take a brief moment to thank Carmel Peter for her work at eic.</p><p>Over a year ago we announced that she would be retiring from management and moving to our Board of Directors. From that time, along with Adam and our team, she was leading our investigation and negotiation of the Canadian north acquisition. She agreed to stay in her president's role until the deal was completed or abandoned. The Canadian north acquisition was completed effectively July 1st along with the negotiation of a long term contract with the Government of New shortly thereafter. As per her usual performance, along with Adam and the team, she all expectations on getting this transaction closed.</p><p>This acquisition will drive our growth in 2026 and beyond. Carmel, thank you for all you have done for EIC during your time here as President. Your contributions have been fundamental to our success. Carmel's responsibilities have been absorbed by our senior team including Jake, Travis, Adam Darwin and Richard. I am pleased to announce that Jake, who has served as CEO of PAL during its period of rapid growth, has moved to EIC as our new President and Calvin Ash, a long time executive at pal, has taken over as the CEO of the PAL Group. The strength and depth of our management team are very important during senior management retirements.</p><p>Our focus on succession planning has served us well. Thank you for your time this morning. We'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>thank You. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. Should you have a question, please press star 4.1 on your telephone keypad. You will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. And should you wish to cancel your request, please press star four. 2. If you're using a speakerphone, please lift the handset before pressing any keys. One moment please, for your first question. Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Steve Hansen from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Morning, Steve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Hansen, your line is now open. Your next question comes from the line of Cameron Dorksen from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Cam operator. It appears you guys are having problems on your end. Could you please have someone look into this?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, we will check the issue and Mr. Dorkson, can you hear us?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Nobody can hear you. I'll hear you. Operator, you have a problem on your end.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Your next question comes from the line of James McCarrichel from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Are you guys able to hear me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>James, we can hear you. I'm glad someone got through. You can ask lots of questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>So congrats on a great quarter. And Jake, congrats on the new role. But yeah, I just wanted to ask on the Canadian north deal, now that it's closed, please give us an update on, you know, the capex plans for the rest of the year. Just want to get a sense of how we should be modeling that for the rest of 2020, 25 and into 2026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>That's a really good question. When we announced the deal, we said that it was going to take us probably through the end of next year to get to 15% return thresholds. And that was based on three items. One was getting the revenues where we needed to get them for the business to be profitable. And we're very pleased that we signed a long term contract with the government of Nunavut so we have a tick in that box sooner than we thought we would. Second piece is taking some costs out of the business by utilizing best practices with our aviation business.</p><p>And we're underway on that. We've had early wins. Rich and his team, for example, have negotiated a new credit card agreement which will save us a million dollars a year. So they're not all that fast, but. And we're changing things. Calvin and his team are looking at combis, looking at how we run our routes. We have a regional one by our part. So over the next sort of year and a half, you'll see the costs come down and Then finally the main piece to getting the 15% was we knew going into this transaction that there was a bunch of maintenance capital work, particularly some engines that needed to be overhauled and you will see much higher than normal maintenance capex over the next four quarters.</p><p>In particular, quite frankly, we thought about how we might even work that into the purchase price by increasing the purchase price and having the vendor do it. But we weren't sure we could get the work done in time. So when we looked at the purchase price, there's effectively part of what we're paying is some extra maintenance capex in the first part of what we see. So you'll see higher than normal maintenance capex for the next year or so as I don't want to say catch up because that implies that Canadian north were doing their maintenance capex and they most certainly were just by happenstance and how things come together.</p><p>There's a lot of overhauls and engine overhauls that need to be done, so you'll see that up front. But I'm pleased to say that the operating performance is ahead of our modeling significantly because of the early cost savings and the new contract with the government.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Appreciate the caller. Then, you know, you've been flagging the past couple quarters some opportunity to redeploy some assets from bc, you know, into the Newfoundland deal as some as you get some of these aircraft, it seems like these aircraft are coming into the back half of the year. So, you know, should we expect a pretty sizable improvement in margin in the next few quarters? You know, obviously for 2025 that's going to be reflected in the updated guide. But is there an opportunity to kind of continue to drive some improvement there into 2026?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Your general statement is correct with Newfoundland. The fact that we're using other planes changes our return on capital more than it changes our margins per se. Like as that contract goes into effect and we use assets we already own, we're going to earn a return on things without having to expend new capital. So that's exactly what we were looking for when we got the contract in B.C. because the fleet there was perfectly fine. The government wanted new aircraft. Jake? Yeah, James, Just to give you a.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Little more color, there's going to be some aircraft modifications needed just for configuration changes as they come out of service from BC and go into service in Newfoundland, which you won't see them start to contribute until early 26.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James McGarragle:</emphasis></p><p>Appreciate the caller guys, and I'll turn the line over. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, James.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. For participants having issues staying connected, please dial +12898191350 or +1800-836-8184. Once again, that is PL 2898191350 or 1800-836-8184. Once again, please press star once. If you have a question, your next question comes from the line of Chris Murray from ATB Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, folks. Hey, good morning. Hopefully you can hear me okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, just.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>So just turning back to the guidance, the $35 million increase in the guidance, if you could maybe help us understand, you know, how that comes together. How much of that is the contribution from Canadian North? How much of that? It looks like, you know, some stronger margins in the aviation businesses maybe offset a little bit by manufacturing. So maybe you can just give us some color on how to think about how that stack lines up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, most of the increase would be explained by Canadian North. The number would have been bigger, quite frankly, Chris, if it weren't for the continued forest fires. We've had some of our biggest communities in Northern Manitoba empty for three, four, five weeks. And when that's the case, we aren't flying there. So that 35 million would have been had, would have, would have had at least a four as the first number if we had any remotely close to a normal forest fire year. This is a year like we've never seen before in the 50 years of operating in the north.</p><p>So 50 years plus. So to circle back to your question, it's general strength in our overall business offset by the forest fires, and then most of the growth would be coming from Canadian North.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then turning back to Canadian north, you know, maybe this, this is the uncomfortable question, but, you know, part of the, you know, the thought process, I think, or at least, you know, outside of observers. When we saw Canadian north merge with First Air, you know, there was a bit of a discussion about, you know, how effective that has been. I know you're, you know, I'm kind of thinking about, you know, your path forward. I know you talked about some, some SGA cost things like the credit cards, you know, there.</p><p>It seems like there's a maintenance bulge in there. But can you talk about, you know, streamlining kind of the operation? And I appreciate it. Sensitive given, given a lot of the, the moving parts here. But can you just talk a little bit about your opportunity to drive some of these costs out of the business? And when you talk about the reduction below your kind of 15% threshold, is that really tied more to kind of call it an EBIT margin or is that tied more to like the fact that you're going to be higher, just higher Capex for a while.</p><p>So I'm just trying to understand the kind of the balance of where the, where the issues lie.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>That's a really good question. So let's break it into pieces. The operating improvement was going to be driven by revenue and that box is ticked. We don't intend to make material changes to passenger prices for the general public. The government contract had not reflected changes to aviation inflation for a significant period. So that's caught up in that contract. So that piece is looked after. The operating improvement then is based on costs. And I would again break that into three pieces. There's kind of a G and a improvement and things like the credit card, but that's just an example.</p><p>They're streamlining some of the accounting systems and sort of bringing them in line with EIC standards which will make them more effective. The next big one we'll achieve later this quarter is moving them on to our global insurance plan, which as a group we buy at much cheaper prices than smaller airlines do. And then you will see the next piece will be the purchasing of parts through regional one, taking advantage of our group buying capability which will drive down their operating costs. And then the last piece, which is the part that's slightly more complicated, will be moving their fleet from pure freighter and pure passenger aircraft to a combination of combi aircraft and pure freighters.</p><p>There are certain markets that will always require pure freighters, but most of the places that fly out of the italics and yellow Knights could be more effectively serviced with a combination of passenger seats and freight on each plane. So we don't need to buy new aircraft or anything. You don't need to worry about big capital expenditures, but we will need to take some time to adapt the aircraft and make changes to how they're configured. That's a relatively modest expenditure, probably more in the hundreds of thousands or million dollar range than anything significant. But it'll take a while and it'll take some changes in how we route the aircraft and those things.</p><p>So that will take a slightly longer period. And then because of the maintenance capex we knew about that are going to be higher in this period that delays our 15% return simply because the way we define that is EBITDA minus maintenance capex. Maintenance capex will be high for the next few quarters. I would say we're ahead of track on the EBITDA part of the game. Our operations I would say are improving more rapidly than we anticipated in our business model. We got some great people at Canadian north who are eager to take advantage of some of our buying power and some of our opportunities.</p><p>And the capex will take care of itself over a reasonably modest period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adam Terwin:</emphasis></p><p>And Mike, there's one thing I might. Build on Chris's question there. And Chris, it's Adam and I think you hit it on accurately. Just going back to the history and the fact that there was a merger that was right after the merger Covid happened and I think was it been fairly well known there was some changeover at the CO level. So the fact that the merger happened and then Covid and a little bit of instability at the top bringing the two airlines together was challenged. And to your point, there is opportunities now with EIC's expertise, long term ownership and the fact now that we have this long term agreement with the government unavit helps for long term planning that there is also that ability to also drive additional synergies within that operation.</p><p>So that to your point, there is that opportunity as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you. And then just maybe quickly Mike. You know, historically when we think about maintenance capex and the proportion of revenue in the aviation business, we've always thought, we've always sort of seen it on average and yet it can be lumpy but about 12% of revenue. Is that what we should be thinking? Because I appreciate These are all 737-2-1200s and larger aircraft, but is that about the right level of magnitude to think about as you as you get to that 15% number?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, it'll vary period to period. Their maintenance capex as a percentage of resident you should be very similar to what we experience in our other airlines. In addition to the 737s they operate a significant fleet of ATRs and which are exactly the same aircraft in fact actually a slightly newer version of them that Comair operates. So your thought process is correct. Although it will be higher than that over the next three or four quarters. While certain things are done, we tend to want to do things earlier rather than later. And so we don't have aircraft out of service during busy periods.</p><p>And so with our capital structure we can do that. I don't want anyone walking away with maintenance capex is going up like they weren't doing the maintenance. No, that's not the issue. The thing was there's just a whole bunch of things by timing that engines can't do at the same time. And where they may have been leasing a Replacement. Now we're going to actually overhaul it and replace it or buy a new engine. So we knew about that up front and in our mind it was part of the 200 in addition to the 200 million we were paying.</p><p>And when you look at you, even with just the early stage six month number that most of that increase relates to Canadian north, you can see that the EBITDA multiple we purchased at this at was very attractive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's helpful. And if I can just squeeze, if I can squeeze a third one in. You did make the comment, I think in the script that you've been looking at a new factory for the matting business that's going better and sort of the decisions been made to go ahead with that. Can you kind of give us any update on expectations of where that should be cited and you know, any expectations for capital spending as we go into next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>The idea is it's going to be in the southeast US we're still working between. There's really kind of four states at this point. We're looking at it could be in Florida with the other plant. It could be in Texas and it could be in Alabama or it could be in Mississippi. Those are the four places we're down to. Give me one more quarter to give you a budget for it because what we're really working on right now is how big a plant do we build? Do we build this so that we could expand it again without moving? And I think that's where we're going.</p><p>So it's hard for me to give you a budget because we're still working on the business model. But I would hope by the time we report in November we'll be able to tell you that we set up a location, we signed some purchase orders and we've got a budget and we'll be able to give you a rough start update as well, but in rough numbers. We think it's at least an 18 month project to get the plant up and running. It could be as long as two years depending on what the wait times are for some of the equipment.</p><p>It's very unique, very heavy pressing equipment to make the composite mats. So I wish we could fly could operate it tomorrow. The demand is there and demand's not going anywhere. So we're prepared to make the investment. We just want to make sure we do it right. It's a big investment for Spartan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Murray:</emphasis></p><p>All right, so thanks for passing on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Once again. For participants having issues staying Connected, please dial +12898191350. Once again, that's +12898191350. And your next question comes from the line of Cameron Dirksen from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We can, Kev. Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, perfect. Just to follow up, I guess on Chris question, just on the matting business, obviously it sounds like Spartan Mat is doing very well. In your prepared remarks and in the mda, there was also some commentary about the Canadian matting business and you struck a little more optimistic tone on increased activity there. Can you just maybe discuss the visibility you have on, on how that business is looking over the next number of quarters?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it was slower in Q2 than we would have anticipated because of the delay of some of the near projects, particularly some of the pipeline and transmission line integrity work that we do in the East. It was postponed. We're starting to see that start in the third quarter. But the sheer number of projects that are under consideration that are going to get in the ground over the next six months, 12 months, is remarkable. Hydro One talked about, I forget what seven new distribution lines they've got to build. They're talking about this natural gas work. There's oil and gas pipelines as well, and gas digging.</p><p>There's, I mean, it's, it's. Virtually all parts of the linear part of that business are bullish. In the medium term, it's still going to take us whether it's the end of this quarter, beginning of next quarter, and we'll start to see that stuff go. And a lot of it's tied kind of in with the infrastructure work that our Prime Minister has talked about. But it's beyond that. It's utility work even in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Manitoba Hydro has announced a major program working on maintenance of the two bipolar lines, which will create work. There's work in Saskatchewan, there's work in bc.</p><p>We're very bullish about the medium term on that business. Again, it's probably not a Q3 hit, but it'll start later in the year and into next year. And the medium term looks great in Canada, which matches what we're already seeing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>In the U.S. okay, that's super helpful. Maybe just a second question for me, just I guess on the aerial surveillance opportunities, I mean, you mentioned, I guess, I guess a Q3 decision hopefully here on the Australian contract. Can you just maybe discuss, if you can, any more details on what other opportunities are out there? I mean, I'm thinking also potentially in Canada with increased defence spending and focus on the north, there's potentially some opportunities for that business there as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>I have to be careful about being too specific because there's negotiations ongoing on a number of things. But I will say that we've spoken in the past about inquiries in Greenland, inquiries from other countries in Europe, discussions with the Canadian government about additional work for them. I point out we've had to work on the coasts of Canada for 40 some years. Just recently extended that for another long term contract where we will discuss about other work with the government of Canada. And there's other work potentially down in the Southern Pacific other than the Australian contract.</p><p>And so I'm concerned sometimes that because of the size of the Australian contract, the discussions get somewhat fixated on it. And that's a hit or miss. Either we win or we don't. But it's one contract, it's the biggest one. But there's opportunities all over the place. I'd be very surprised if we don't announce some successes before the year is over. Now those are things that are unlikely to impact this year's revenue by the time we win the contract and buy the parts and those kinds of things. But we are very active in a number of markets.</p><p>Jake, did I miss anything?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no, that's fair. And you know, unfortunately, instability in the world drives the demand for the type of services we provide through the surveillance work. And you know, there's robust pipeline and inquiries from just about every geographic region we're operating in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Doerksen:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, no, that's definitely good to hear. I'll pass the line. Appreciate the time, guys.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes online of Krista Friesen from cibc. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe if I can just follow up on the matting questions. There certainly sounds like a lot of opportunity in Canada. How do you feel about your supply of mats and being able to keep up with that demand?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We are currently managing production so that we don't buy them too soon. One of the advantages that we have at Northern Mat is because we're vertically integrated, we make our own construction decisions and we have very strong inventory levels, levels of timber. So we can start and stop kind of when we need to. Because the Q2 was slower, we slowed our production in that period. As we see this coming, it's likely we will start up. We operate more than one facility. It's likely our second facility will ramp later this year. So I have very little concerns about our ability to, to have enough mats in the world.</p><p>The Addition of Duomal has been great for us in the East. They've increased our relations with Hydro Quebec. We sold them a bunch of mats in the last quarter. We're looking at other opportunities with them. And the one other thing I would point out that's bullish for the business, particularly once we get past Q3, is when the transcontinental pipeline was completed, there was a lot of used mats in the marketplace all over the place. And some of our competitors jumped on those and then used very cheap mats as a means to discount their way into the marketplace.</p><p>And that's a good strategy for very short periods of time. But the used mats coming off a pipeline project had very short lifespans and we're starting to see that expire. And so the relative health of our portfolio versus perhaps some of the others is going to put us in a great spot as the ramp up comes because we'll be able to provide the mats the customers need.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>I guess one of the things I would add is in the M and A, we talked about just some of the investments that they had made in new mat inventory during the quarter and in anticipation of mat sale demand for new mats. But. But if we got into a spot where the leasing demand accelerated earlier than expected, we would have the optionality to deploy those into our lease fleet or rental fleet to make sure that we're meeting customer demands on the rental side. So that buildup and the planning that they do as a team to make sure that we're ahead of market demand positions us well for the back half of the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. And then maybe just shifting gears to Canadian north. And congrats on being able to renegotiate that contract so quickly. Are there other large contracts like that that you'll be looking to renegotiate, I guess over the next six months here?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Not really. As it relates to. As it relates to Canadian North, I'm excited that Dave White and the team at Kuwait are negotiating the RFP on the Medevac business for Nunavut. And I'm confident that we will continue to serve as the sole provider of Medevac services in the North. But that contract is under negotiation. Maybe by the time we come in November we'll have something more to share on that. But that within Calm Air or Canadian north itself, most of the stuff has been dealt with in terms of contracts. It was really the fact that the aviation inflation was so high over the last couple of years and the previous contract really didn't capture that.</p><p>And the government init is, I would suggest you perhaps the most progressive in understanding the cost of operating in their area. And so when we sat down and talked to them, we went back and forth about the best way to minimize costs and the best way to accurately forecast. And one of the things that's in this contract that we haven't had in the past, it's historically been tied to fuel prices and cpi. Well, CPI can overstate or understate aviation inflation significantly. The new contract, while a portion of it will increase as relate to cpi, it's more specifically driven by aviation wages, parts costs and exchange rates.</p><p>And when you put those together, what that means is that the contract will be much more dynamic, both upwards and downwards depending on what happens with aviation inflation. Which means both the airline and our customer are going to be well taken care of because we don't have to have proxies. We actually have real hard numbers for adjusting the cost of the service.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Mike, if I could just add to that that aviation inflation formula is very important to this and forward looking as this is a 10 plus 5 year contract, a couple of years extension and there's work really looking at the forward. Future, where we're going and how to. Have a successful contract with our partners and GN for a long, long time to come.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>That's great color. Thank you. I'll pass the line.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Krista Friesen:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Konark Gupta from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Morning co operator.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Morning Mike, can you hear me okay?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Absolutely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so that proves the line works actually for me, thanks. Okay, so yeah, first of all, congrats. To Carmel, Jake and Cal for the respective changes and the new future and the careers. So congrats maybe first on the capital side of things, Mike, your business is obviously growing or expanding all across, broadly speaking. You have a lot of subsidiaries that have growth aspirations and they need capital as well as you have obviously some of these major contracts that you talked about, like Australia for example, and some of those maybe. How do you like, you know, I know the short answer to this, you know, the return on investment benchmarks you have, but how do you kind of balance out or how do you kind of prioritize the capital allocation to these businesses now considering obviously.</p><p>I mean I know you have headroom on a leverage ratio with your prominence, but I mean you still have a lot of, I would say like capital ask is much higher I guess than perhaps the question that you might have on the lever side.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>You'Re banging on about the demand for capital. I mean your statement is absolutely Correct. But the way I would answer is our work is what fits our model, what fits, what do we want to do? And assuming we want to do it, we really don't view it as a competition between Pam's project and Richard's project. They're both individually reviewed and do they meet the standard? But the real test then becomes for us is where does the capital come from? How do we fund these things? And so which the test of that becomes our leverage ratio.</p><p>And when I speak to our investors, one of the pages in our, in our deck shows our historical leverage ratios. And we're, we're at the lower end of our historical aggregate debt. When I talk about aggregate, I'm talking about secured debt with our bank and convertibles. We had two sets of convertibles that we've called that turned into equity. The next set is over 25% in the money, so it's callable at any moment. So as we need equity in the short term, the convertibles will provide that. In terms of liquidity, we have scads with our bank facility.</p><p>I think I've mentioned this before, but I'd be one of the few Canadian businesses that says the Canadian banks are pretty good at what they do. We're well looked after by our debt syndicate of Canadian banks and a couple banks out of the US and so we're sitting with a billion dollars of liquidity. More than that, A little more than that perhaps. And we have equity available to us from those convertible debentures when needed. And we're working on now, we will probably at some point get a debt rating so that if we needed to tap the bond markets in the future, we would do that, but we would only do it with our historical levels of debt.</p><p>And when we talk about historical levels, I'm talking about debt to EBITDA ratios. We've been dogmatic about staying in a band. And if you look at it with the exception of a little bump up during 2020 when EBITDA went down because of COVID we stayed in that band for our 20 years. We're not going to change that. So our access to capital is sufficient, barring some change, to be able to fully take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. For us to continue to generate 20% plus returns for our shareholders, we need to invest capital.</p><p>And so when my guys bring me good opportunities, I'm glad to give Rich the problem of which pot are we going to take it out of? And if at some point in the future we need an equity, we'd raise it We've raised equity at continually higher prices over our history. The last batch I think we did was at 52 or $53. We're now 25, 30% higher than that, 40% higher than that. But having said all that, we don't need any equity. We don't view that as imminent or even in the medium term. But if we did, I have no reticence to do it to maintain a balance sheet.</p><p>So circling back to the end of your thing, the more good opportunities we have, the better. And we'll fund it with a balance sheet that looks like the balance sheet today, just more of it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>And from our perspective, carg, it's super exciting to see those opportunities coming up from the subsidiaries because that's part of what our secret sauce is, keeping our vendors engaged and keeping them for the long term. And it's those sorts of opportunities. Opportunities and having the capital to deploy that keeps them excited about their business and helps us generate those returns Mike's talking about over an extended period of time. So from our perspective, seeing those opportunities come up are an extremely positive thing. And to Mike's point, we'll find out how to get the capital to make sure that we continue to generate returns.</p><p>We've proven that we can.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>That's great color. Thanks, guys. That makes sense. And.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>And this is a real life example. The guys have proven they can invest money and grow regional. One we bought it did $16 million in EBITDA the year we bought it. It's going to be 10 times that big this year. And that's because those guys know how to invest money. So when we talked about growth capex being negative and in Q tip pure happenstance that nothing closed in that quarter. But if you look a little deeper, we had $20 million in deposits on transactions and I can tell you there's more coming. And so when Hank calls me and says, hey, I got some ERJ175s or I got some CRJ9 hundreds or Q4 hundreds, we're glad to write the check because that just fuels our future growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the addition, Mike. Thanks. Just on second one, maybe on the portfolio, I mean, you always have, I think the advantage or disadvantage, perhaps whatever you want to call it of a diverse portfolio is that some of the businesses will work strongly and some might be weaker for a moment and then things might flip flop. Right? So I mean, there's always some puts and takes. I mean, you know, if you look at, you know, the windows business over the last, I would say four or five Years maybe or five years. I mean Covid and tariffs and then like you know, some other issues, interest rate, etc, like all those factors have had exogenous impacts on the Quest business or Windows business, you know, at some point. I mean like I know the demand is great and all that, but obviously like we're not obviously seeing that flow through in the earnings, the quarterly earnings at this point, right? For the last many quarters.</p><p>At any point, like you know, would you feel like, I mean, yeah, sure, demand is fine, but then this is it and you know, we don't probably need as big of an asset so we need to either shrink or sell or do something, you know, I mean like is there, is there a possibility at least in consideration of strategic opportunities to optimize the portfolio that I mean.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We look at that stuff on a regular basis and if we see that it's plateaued or there isn't something, we can do it. The suggestions you make are stuff we would look at directly. We're nowhere near that in the window business. It frustrates me a little bit right now because we worked so hard to bring those plants together. We closed the Quest plant. It's now all of the BV facilities. We've done stuff that's improved our margins and then the tariffs in the US like just wiped out everything we did all at once now. So we changed how we're manufacturing.</p><p>We used to be location agnostic. We built stuff for Canada and the US and we built stuff for the US and Canada depending on what fit our production schedules. Well instantly we couldn't do that overnight. We have to build in the country we're using it for. So that means right now our Dallas plant is very slow. Our KD plants actually reasonably busy. And so we're dealing with those. We would do what you're suggesting, but I would tell you we're nowhere near that conclusion on that business. I think the best piece of I can give you is Comair.</p><p>If you went back a decade, was my weakest airline in terms of return on capital and most of the financial metrics. If you look at it today, it's added very near the top. And these things go through cycles. And the beauty of why EIC succeeds when perhaps some others don't is we don't have to make short term decisions. I have more people in my Windows business than I would have if I was only in the Windows business. The strength of my aviation business unequivocally is subsidizing the window business right now. But at the beginning of COVID The opposite was true at the beginning of COVID The window business helped carry some of the other stuff said we don't have a lack of confidence in it.</p><p>In fact, quite the opposite. I'm very confident in it. But the analysis you're talking about is done all the time and if we need to do something, we will. Right now we really don't see that as the future, but it is something we look at.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Wowryk:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. And despite it's not specific to the Windows business, we understand that we live in a marketplace and an over performing subsidiary might, you know, you might need to make that assessment on an over performing subsidiary as well because someone may be willing to pay you more than you think it's worth. So it's not specific to the Windows business either. And even talking about that Konark like the, like that long term view that Mike talks about, incredibly important. Whereas we are also seeing competitors fail and competitors close their plan, which improves our long term outlook on those businesses just because they can have greater market share and greater pricing power.</p><p>So we constantly evaluate each of the businesses but that longer term outlook provides us a significant advantage in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys. And just quick clarification as a follow up maybe on the guidance I think you mentioned to Chris. I think the $35 million incremental would have been higher had it not been forest fires. I'm just trying to get the math right as we kind of contemplate you guys hitting an $800 million EBITDA mark at some point, I guess. Are we looking at probably mid to highest 700s perhaps, you know, without the forest fires. Is that the idea? Or it would have been more, more or less like 5, 10 million more more had it not been forest fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>I think the forest fires are more in the 10 million-ish challenge than the other. And I know you're trying to get me to give you a 2026 number. We'll give you one in November. But I will tell you that there is embedded growth that's going to come for stuff we've already paid for. The planes that are going to come out of Carson and go into Powell are going to generate income. I've already paid for the second plane for Britain that's going to generate income. And so I'm hoping we stay in the seven hundreds about as long as the so long a period of time as the stock stays in the 60s.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Konark Gupta:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's really helpful, Mike. I'll wait for you guys on 426. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you and your next question comes from the line of Gary Ho from the Jordan Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Morning. Can you hear me okay?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we can.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. Okay, I want to touch on ma a a little bit. I know you just closed Canadian north acquisition and several growth projects on the go. I think you also mentioned M and a pipeline continues to be active across both segments. So where, you know, where are you spending your time on and what do you get excited about? Maybe talk about preference for tuck ins versus more platform type opportunities and maybe leverage off Konark's question there on the Windows segment. If I can flip that around and that you guys take a longer term view. Are you more opportunistic acquirers as well, buying good businesses at cyclical crops and perhaps attractive valuations? Maybe chat about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so I'll take your second question first. In terms of being an opportunistic buyer, I would tell you an unequivocal yes. We view ourselves as being independent thinkers and we've done deals that when they first came into us, we couldn't figure out why they were a business. Regional wanted to be a great example of that. My acquisition fellow at the time brought it to me and I didn't have any idea why I wanted to be in that business. He was out of it. It was a good business. I turned it down. He brought it back again.</p><p>I turned it down the second time and finally says, go meet with them. Come with me and if you still don't like it, I'll stop presenting it to you. And I went and met with them. And literally 45 seconds into the discussions with Jerome and his team, I realized what a great business this was. And we were competing with private equity and we had a model of investing in that business as opposed to reaping cash out of it. That made us a successful buyer. And now we look at today and it would be 10 times the size of what we bought it off of.</p><p>So yes, we view ourselves as opportunistic in terms of what we prefer, whether it's platforms or tuck ins. I'm not sure we have a preference. I would suggest to you that we see a lot more maybe tuck ins or businesses that are tangential to what we're in. So if we found another medevac business or we saw with the parts business or where we added the glazers to our window business, or if there was an aerial firefighting business as an example, that would be something we would love to have. And so most of the things we look at today tend to be related to what we do, but they're typically bigger than what I would classify as a tuck in today.</p><p>What we're looking at is virtually everything Adam and this team have is very related to something we have. I think I was told by a couple of my significant long term investors when we bought Canadian North. Oh, that makes sense. I should have known that was coming. And I think if we're successful on some of those deals that we're working on, I think that will be the market's reaction. I would caution that there's nothing imminent. We're not like at the 10 yard line ready to score here. Where Adam and his team are working hard on some opportunities and some of these projects, specifically where we're in a negotiated settlement as opposed to an auction, takes some time, but Adam and his team remain busy and it's both manufacturing and aviation assets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adam Terwin:</emphasis></p><p>To build on. What Mike's saying in terms of being opportunistic and being open minded to opportunities that were not necessarily directly in that niche within the manufacturing segment or within the aviation segment, we look to acquire a very specific type of company with a great leader and a good management team and really focus on the long term fundamentals of that business. Given our business plan to own that company for a very, very long time and also to empower the management team there. So being open minded and opportunistic allows us to have a broader scope of those types of companies.</p><p>At the same time, given some of the uncertainty that we had last year within both elections within the U.S. and then Canada this year, followed by some of the other uncertainty tied to the geopolitics and some of the economic positions, you often see that there's ebbs and flows of acquisition opportunities and what we call marketed deals coming in. You know, our ability to have those two funnels, one of the market deals and then one of the strategic deals, allows us to be a lot more active on a consistent basis. And I'd say that one of the exciting things when we buy a new company and for that owner coming on is the idea that EIC likes to continue to grow those businesses, including strategic acquisitions.</p><p>And so we're consistently working with all our subsidiaries. When they view there's an opportunity to go uncover opportunities that help them expand their overall operations. And as you can see, that's what our last four acquisitions have been. They've been all strategic opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great, makes sense. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the long term service agreement. I think the government, Nunavut has an option to purchase a stake in Canadian North. Maybe just talk about the reasoning and do you have a preference one way or another?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>The discussions about typically a long term agreement like that with the government in Nunavutu would have been done through an rfp. And there was discussions and there was reasons for both of us to want to do it quickly. And one of the things we said, look, if you're, we want to prove to you that we're good partners and we're negotiating this in good faith. And part of that was if you want to be our partner, join in. You got to pay the capital like we have and you could join. I think the government in Unovit took comfort in the fact that we were prepared to share the deal with them and if the deal wasn't fair, we wouldn't have shared it.</p><p>And so we aren't capital constrained. And so I don't think I would say that I want them to participate, but I'm not adverse to it. I mean having your biggest customer in a territory like that, that's going to be growing and is going to be a big part of our future, strengthens our business. So I think it's really more about whether the government in Unova wants to deploy the level of capital they need to be our partner. And if they do, we're glad to have them. It's crystal clear in the operating agreements that while they'll, they have board representation and those kinds of things operate in control of how you run an airline lies with the actual.</p><p>That's what we do. We're prepared to have a partner that we talked about things with. But operating decisions need to stay with us, Jake.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>And I think it's much more indicative of the degree of partnership that we have with the government of Nunavut in developing the critical infrastructure in the north. So rather than a financial matter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>I think that we might have had a bigger challenge providing that option to some other provincial or territorial governments than we did Nunavut. They, they are remarkably literate from an operating environment about their operating environment. They know how fundamental aviation is to the government, to the territory, and so they make a good partner. Perhaps not all, all of the territories or provinces we operate, the governments are as exposed to aviation and as such would be more challenged to be a partner. Nunavut is well situated to be our partners if they choose to. I suspect that will be something that will be decided by the next government.</p><p>In Nunavut. They have an election coming this fall and so I would be very surprised if any decision was made before that election and they have a year to decide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gary Ho:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Those are my two questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steve Henson from Raymond Chains.

Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrej:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrej:</emphasis></p><p>Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one. Well, this is Andre, first of all on behalf of Amer. But on the Australia maritime surveillance bid, given its scale, what's the realistic share of the contract you could control if successful? And how do any local content requirements. Factor into your economics, operational structure or partnership?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>The contract is probably. While the government does have the right to split it, I would suggest that's highly unlikely. The technology of the aircraft talking to one another, having two different companies with different software would be remarkably difficult. In fact, I think one of our competitive advantages is our aircraft run the same software that we own that the helicopter ISR running. So I don't think there's any likelihood that it gets split. I think it's a win or a loss in terms of local content. Do you want to take that, Jake?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I mean, we have committed and required. To set up operations in Australia. Knowing the time and space, that's not something that can be run remotely. And you know, it'll have a full operation set up to support a very significant aircraft operation down in Australia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrej:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great, thanks. And shifting to Canadian north, you pointed. Out in the MDMA that the Canadian. North infrastructure as a potential enabler for Arctic defense and security opportunities. Could you speak a little bit more about that and maybe from a practical. Standpoint, any steps we can take to monetize that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I mean, what you're going to see, I think in the north is two main themes of growth. One is we've seen the value of critical minerals. Nunavut is blessed with a lot of them. And so as those become a strategic asset that we want to have as a country and with our NATO partners and our American partners partners, you're going to see development of those. Well, that means Bringing in people and equipment and stuff into flying locations, which is exactly what we do, whether it's Comair or Canadian North. And then the other piece relates more to national defense.</p><p>We're going to need to build facilities in the North. We're built by the F35 Joint Strike Fighter. We don't have hangers for them, we don't have runways in enough places for them. And so the government's going to build those. And while I don't think we'll be hauling up a cement on our ATRs, we will be hauling up the people and rotating crews and doing all that stuff, which is going to create demand for our scheduled services. And because of the infrastructure we have there, it's exceptionally difficult for someone to do that at a better price than we can for the government simply because we've got hangars, we've got facilities, and if someone else wants to try and take that from us, their costs are going to be far higher than ours are.</p><p>So we're excited about the ability to lever the government's investments in defense with our scheduled airline. And then on top of that, it's not really so much a Canadian north story as it is a pal store, but the opportunities for other things like expanding the surveillance we do on east and west coast to our northern coast. I think there's things like that that we'll see discussions of perhaps expanding our role in the northern search and rescue program where we already provide the maintenance and overhaul capability for the aircraft which were recently purchased from Airbus. I think all of those are growth opportunities for us where we can partner with the government intent increasing our investment in defense and do it cheaper and faster than the government can do it itself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the color. I'll pass the line. Okay, operator, before we jump onto the next call, Steve Hanson sent me the question, which is what's the quantum of maintenance and growth capex we should expect this year? I'm not sure I can answer that with a specific number other than to say as it relates to Canadian north, the free cash flow will generate won't be a huge number in the first two or three quarters because of the maintenance capex, although the EBITDA we're generating is improving and some of the cost stuff we're doing is ahead of schedule.</p><p>Growth capex. I hope there's a lot of them. Right now it's really limited to finishing off the purchases of the King airs for the B.C. medevac contract, which will allow us to deploy their aircraft to Newfoundland with only a cost of modifying Them, which is relatively modest. And then. And we have significant investments in regional one for the balance of the year. And that could be in the 50 to $100 million range, depending on which transactions we close. But there's a bunch of stuff we're bullish on, quite frankly. That market today, it's easier to sell in than it is to buy in.</p><p>And so when we get the right opportunities, we're all over the place. So in general, maintenance capex will be heavy. The balance of this year and into next year, no surprises. That was part of our due diligence. We knew that was coming. We talked about hitting a 15% return by the end of next year. We are more confident than ever that we'll do that both by increasing revenue, decreasing costs, and then ultimately normalizing maintenance capex over a period of time. I hope I answered what you were looking for, Steve. Operator,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>thank you once again. Should you have a question, please press star. Then the number one on your telephone keypad. We have the line of Steve Hanson from Raymond James. Mr. Hanson, you may go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Steve, are you there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>I think my question's been answered. Mike. I'm good. Thanks for that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>We can talk to you now, Steve. We do have the technology. People are building AI centers. Technology centers. We can complete a phone call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Hansen:</emphasis></p><p>We're running along. I think that's all an answer. I appreciate the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Steve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Steve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And your next question comes from the light of Fraxy Hessen from Paradigm. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Razi Hasan:</emphasis></p><p>Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just two small ones here on the Windows business. Is it fair to say that we should begin to see results from the 100 million new projects you mentioned flow through in mid-2027 if the world stays the same way? Is that a fair assessment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean, each project is slightly different, but that on average, that's about right. I mean, the thing is, 100 million is a good number for this last month or so, but we burned that. We burned that much out of our book every quarter. More than that, actually. And so that while it's. While it's a good start and it's encouraging, we still got some work to do to get the actual order taking to where we want it to be. But it's a positive sign. And one of them was in a market. I'm not going to disclose where there was a market that was difficult in the US For a period of time.</p><p>So it's exciting to land a significant sale in a market that had been difficult for a while.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Razi Hasan:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Okay, great. And then maybe just lastly on the Australian contract, I'm not sure if you mentioned, but can you disclose how many bidders were in the process or how many bidders are left or any idea there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jake Trainor:</emphasis></p><p>Right now? We know, you know, we suspect it's not a published thing. We suspect that there's about four bidders that were submitting. Obviously, the incumbent and ourselves, we feel, are the key challengers for this. But as I said, we anticipate there were four bidders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Razi Hasan:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks. I'll pass the line.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back to Mr. Mike Powell for any closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Pyle:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you to everybody for joining us today. It's an exciting day. We look forward to talking to you again in November. Have a great day, everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">operator:</emphasis></p><p>And this concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-9d1fffc310825e789197c08c414f4607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH2-KHM3-S5S1-P1YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 AlphaStreet Inc.

Peak wildfire season typically runs from mid-March through mid-May.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During a virtual media briefing today, the Department of Environmental Protections Forest Fire Service highlighted various communications platforms and tools designed to keep the public informed about wildfires, including reminders about common-sense prevention tips, real-time social media announcements about developing and ongoing fires, and online risk assessment data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents and visitors to New Jersey should not become complacent of wildfire risk just because the state received substantial rainfall in March and early April, said Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. In a changing climate, we are increasingly seeing dry conditions between heavy rainfalls, in what we have come to know as 'flash droughts. Despite the recent rain, wildfire risk remains heightened at this time of year, and public awareness of how to stay safe is paramount.</p><p>Enhanced Information Tools</p><p>Information about wildfire risks and mitigation is especially critical for people who live within or adjacent to forested areas, also known as the wildland-urban interface. Information tools the Forest Fire Service has introduced in response to the growing dangers include:</p><p>The NJ Fire Danger Dashboard, found on the Forest Fire Service website, is updated frequently with a fire danger rating by county, displays a color-coded index of different fire danger ratings and provides a snapshot view of risk by county. The dashboard also displays any current campfire restrictions that may be implemented depending on fire weather conditions such as high winds or prolonged dry periods.</p><p>The New Jersey Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (NJWRAP) compiles data and resources to assist residents, community leaders and fire professionals in taking actions to mitigate the threat of wildfire risk around their property and in their community. Data and preparedness resources presented in the portal were developed by the nations wildfire experts, with Forest Fire Service personnel providing practical and local information.</p><p>Time-Sensitive Wildfire Information</p><p>In addition to these risk assessment information tools, the Forest Fire Service is committed to issuing timely social media updates to inform the public and media about developing and ongoing wildfires classified as major or as complex incidents.</p><p>Major wildfires are defined as at least 100 acres in size. Fires smaller than 100 acres that result in road closures, threaten structures, or otherwise impact developed properties are known as complex incidents.</p><p>In the event of either a major wildfire or a complex smaller fire, real-time updates will be posted on the Forest Fire ServicesFacebook and X (formerly Twitter) accounts. Posts will provide essential information including the wildfires size, containment status, road closures, evacuations and types of resources responding to the fire. Posts will also include the approximate time of the next expected update.</p><p>Climate Change and Increasing Wildfire Risks</p><p>Spring is typically peak wildfire season in New Jersey. At this time of year, trees and underbrush are still leafing out, relative humidity is generally low and windy days are common. The combination of these factors means forested lands dry out quickly. Additionally, porous sandy soils in the vast Pinelands region of southern New Jersey do not retain moisture for long, exacerbating drying and making it possible for a fire to spark only hours after rainfall.</p><p>Climate change is making wildfire seasons longer. According to Climate Central, a research nonprofit, nationwide analysis of weather conditions during the past 50 years found that the annual number of fire weather days has risen by 10 days in northern New Jersey and four days in southern New Jersey. This data mirrors the DEPs own 2020 Scientific Report on Climate Change which states, wildfire seasons could be lengthened, and the frequency of large fires increased due to the hot, dry periods that will result from increased temperatures.</p><p>Murphy Administration Responds</p><p>In 2023, New Jersey had its most active fire year in more than a decade with 1,193 wildfires burning 18,043 acres statewide. Fourteen of these fires were considered major wildfires, burning more than 100 acres each. The most significant of these fires were the Jimmys Waterhole Wildfire on April 11 in Ocean County, which burned 3,449 acres and required evacuation from 170 structures, and the Kanouse Wildfire on April 12 in Passaic County, which burned 972 acres, closed State Route 23 and threatened 10 structures.</p><p>The Murphy Administration responded to the busy fire year by supporting the Forest Fire Service with a $3 million budget boost in FY23 to enhance protection of lives and property through investments in new equipment and staff. The investment helped upgrade the Forest Fire Services fleet of equipment, expanded the Forest Fire Services contracted air support during peak spring fire season and helped fund full-time employees that will fill critical vacancies.</p><p>Through the hard work and dedication of the Forest Fire Service staff, firefighters and support staff alike, thankfully no homes or structures were lost in any of the 14 major wildfires New Jersey experienced in 2023, said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests and Historic Sites. Thanks to investments by the Murphy Administration last July, the Forest Fire Service is now better equipped to ensure the protection of life, property and natural resources throughout the Garden State.</p><p>Fire Towers and Prescribed Burns</p><p>Keeping an eye on New Jerseys forested lands, the Forest Fire Service maintains a network of 21 fire towers across the state which are staffed any time forests are dry enough to burn. Fire Observers, trained in taking weather readings and reading smoke and fire behavior, scan the horizon from the towers looking for smoke, triangulate and pinpoint the location of the smoke with other nearby towers, and dispatch resources to investigate the cause. Fire towers frequently dispatch resources to the source of smoke several minutes before the first 9-1-1 call from a passerby is placed.</p><p>Fire observers are critical to the Forest Fire Services mission of early detection and rapid response to wildfires, said Bill Donnelly, State Forest Firewarden and Chief of the Forest Fire Service. New Jersey has some of the most volatile forest fuels in the country. Having eyes in the sky with the ability to dispatch resources at the first sign of smoke, as well as relaying to ground crews what the wind speed, wind direction and other weather conditions are doing, is immensely important.</p><p>To further reduce the threat of wildfire, the Forest Fire Service uses prescribed burns to reduce fallen debris and understory that can fuel wildfires. Prescribed fire also improves habitat for plants and animals, reduces the presence of damaging insects and ticks, and recycles nutrients into the soil.</p><p>So far this year, the Forest Fires Service has treated 14,402 acres of forest and grasslands with prescribed fire. As another component of its suite of enhanced public information tools, the Forest Fire Service maintains a Prescribed Fire Notifications Dashboard to keep the public informed on where and when these burns are taking place.</p><p>Wildfire Safety Tips</p><p>Prevention remains the most important part of the equation. Most wildfires can be avoided by adhering to these commonsense safety tips:</p><p>Dont discard cigarettes, matches or smoking materials on the ground.</p><p>Dont leave fires unattended. Douse them completely, until cold to the touch.</p><p>Keep matches and lighters away from children. Teach youth about fire safety. Children can learn about wildfire safety with Smokey Bears new mobile game Smokeys Scouts.</p><p>Protect your home and other structures from wildfire by creating defensible space. Visit njwildfire.org for more information.</p><p>Ensure fire trucks can access driveways.</p><p>Report suspicious vehicles and individuals to authorities.</p><p>Use wood stoves and fireplaces carefully, since both can emit embers that spark fires. Fully douse ashes with water before disposal.</p><p>Contact your nearest Forest Fire Service office about how to obtain a Campfire Permit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126485319</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BS6-H2Y1-JCBF-S072-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1426\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 9, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

New York followed its lead in December. Four days later, the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute sued Vermont for abusing its power and putting an unreasonable burden on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uschamber.com/assets/documents/Complaint-Chamber-v.-Moore-D.-Vt.pdf\">industry</url>.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On May 1, the Trump Department of Justice sued both Vermont and New York to block enforcement of climate superfund laws, which seek to hold major fossil fuel companies accountable for their share of the emissions that have contributed to the increasing scale of costly climate disasters between 1995 and 2024.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lawsuits came a day after the Trump administration <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02052025/hawaii-sues-big-oil-for-alleged-climate-deception-after-trump-administration-tried-to-block-the-litigation/\">sued Hawaii</url> and Michigan to block more conventional liability suits the states were yet to file against the fossil fuel industry for costs associated with specific climate-related damages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, Vermont is facing twin climate challenges, both with big economic considerations.\u00a0</p><p>State Treasurer Michael Pieciak and the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources are working to find the cost of environmental damage that can be linked to individual companies' fossil fuel products from 1995 until 2024, a calculation that will rely heavily on climate attribution science.</p><p>In the courts, meanwhile, the state is left to decide how best to defend the novel Climate Superfund Act, which is based on the established environmental doctrine of \"polluter pays\" for hazardous waste remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act-the existing Superfund law-and adapts that to climate change.</p><p>Through all this, the question remains: how will the small northern rural state afford much-needed adaptations to a warming climate in a world where natural disasters are increasing in scope and fury and don't wait for court verdicts.</p><p>The Justice Department's involvement, in particular, increases the likelihood that court battles will be long and expensive, experts said. Despite this, those who stand behind the bill show no signs of giving up.</p><p>\"Did I expect it? No. Am I surprised? Also, no,\" state Sen. Anne Watson, a sponsor of the Vermont Climate Superfund Law, said about the challenge from the federal government. Her confidence in the defensibility of the superfund act hasn't wavered.\u00a0</p><p>The quick response by the oil lobby and federal government, she said, was, \"really heartening, weirdly, because it tells me that we have hit upon a strategy that is effective, that is getting the attention of the fossil fuel industry, that they know this is a legitimate mechanism to hold them accountable.\"</p><p>Ben Edgerly Walsh, the Climate and Energy Program director at the Vermont Public Interest Group, said the Justice Department's involvement was unusual, but not a shock. VPIRG was a key advocate in passing the bill, and Edgerly Walsh views the lawsuit as a direct response from President Trump to big oil CEOs who met with him<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/27/climate-superfund-oil-executives-trump/\">, seeking protection from state actions,</url> in March.\u00a0</p><p>\"Frankly, the president is using the Department of Justice as a political shield for his allies in the oil industry,\" Edgerly Walsh said. \"It's incredibly disappointing to see the U.S. system of justice used that way. It's unprecedented.\"\u00a0</p><p>Trump in April signed an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/protecting-american-energy-from-state-overreach/\">executive order</url> for Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"take action to stop the enforcement of state laws that unreasonably burden domestic energy development.\"\u00a0</p><p>In a press <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-complaints-against-hawaii-michigan-new-york-and-vermont-over\">release</url> on May 1, Bondi wrote: \"These burdensome and ideologically motivated laws and lawsuits threaten American energy independence and our country's economic and national security. The Justice Department was working to 'Unleash American Energy' by stopping these illegitimate impediments to the production of affordable, reliable energy that Americans deserve.\" The Justice Department declined to respond further about the ongoing court action.</p><p>The Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute's legal filings from December in opposition to the climate superfund laws passed by Vermont stated that the federal government, not states, has the power to regulate emissions. Attorneys general from 24 conservative states-including West Virginia, Alabama and Alaska-joined the Chamber of Commerce's earlier challenge to Vermont's climate superfund law on the same day the Trump Administration filed its own suit in May.\u00a0</p><p>The Justice Department told the court that Vermont had infringed on presidential authority, and that its legislation is a danger to the nation's security. This came with a nearly identical lawsuit against New York.</p><p>Watson, a Democrat representing Montpelier, said her motivation is to hold the industry accountable for its harms and ease the load that a warming climate is causing Vermonters. \"We're moving forward with it,\" she said. \"People are having to shoulder a huge financial burden that they shouldn't otherwise have to bear because of the products from the fossil fuel industry.\"\u00a0</p><p>The climate superfund is a strategy for the state to bring in money it needs to help cover the costs of climate disasters. Residents already pay high taxes, and Vermont hasn't been able to find the funds to adapt to climate change within its borders.</p><p>\"Governor Scott is right, you just can't tax Vermonters any more.\" said Patrick Parenteau, professor emeritus at the Vermont Law and Graduate School and former counsel to the EPA's regional office in New England. Lawmakers have been working to keep education spending under control, he said, and the fiscally conservative governor is unlikely to add climate costs to the burden on taxpayers.\u00a0</p><p>The same goes for the legal costs of defending the new superfund law in court-Parenteau warned the legislature hasn't realized just how much this cost will grow in the coming years. \"They saw it coming. They heard about it. I don't think they fully appreciated just how complicated and expensive it's going to get,\" he said.</p><p>Even if Vermont successfully fights off the lawsuits, he predicts it could take up to a decade for money to actually come back in from the superfund to help people pay for climate adaptation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the climate crisis has already arrived. A year ago, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/former-hurricane-beryl-floods-vermont-in-a-repeat-of-last-year/\">Hurricane Beryl</url> tore through the middle of the state, flooding homes and farmland, and two years ago a once-in-a-lifetime flood did around a billion dollars of damage to the state, Watson said. Lawmakers saw this wreckage firsthand, as the river in the state's <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2023/07/11/photos-vermonts-capital-under-floodwaters/\">capital overflowed in 2023</url>, spilling into government buildings while local businesses resorted to piling their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/05/vermonts-flood-rebuild-climate-change-00109951\">soaked belongings in the streets.</url></p><p>Anthony Iarrapino, a lawyer for the Conservation Law Foundation, is one of the Vermonters who has seen this extreme weather and lobbied for the climate superfund last year. While he isn't directly involved in the lawsuits, he and Edgerly Walsh were in communication with the Agency of Natural Resources during this year's legislative session about implementing the law.</p><p>\"I'm happy to say that our legislature was not bullied by the Trump administration's lawsuit out of moving forward,\" Iarrapino said.\u00a0</p><p>Iarrapino said the Trump administration's support and protection of the fossil fuel industry do not reflect the real costs greenhouse gas emissions have had on the state through extreme weather events heightened by a warming planet.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's just hard to accept their complaints with a straight face,\" he said. \"They just don't have credibility here in Vermont, where we're still hurting, we're still suffering, we're still paying the bills, we're still nervously watching the weather forecast every time extreme rain is predicted or the air is too filled with forest fire smoke to go out.\"</p><p>Iarrapino also said Vermont's legislators and attorney general don't believe there is a national energy emergency, as Trump declared on his first day in office, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/index.php?tbl=T01.01#/?f=A&amp;start=1949&amp;end=2023&amp;charted=4-14\">domestic energy production has exceeded consumption</url> in recent years.</p><p>Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark is trying to prove the claim of an emergency is false. On May 9, Vermont joined with 14 states, including Michigan, in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ago.vermont.gov/sites/ago/files/2025-05/FiledComplaint.pdf\">lawsuit</url> against the president's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/\">Energy Emergency</url> declaration.</p><p>\"There is no energy emergency in this country. American energy production is at an all-time high, and this is an attempt by the Trump Administration to illegally circumvent environmental protections that keep us healthy and protect our rivers, wildlife, and other natural resources,\" Clark said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2025/05/09/attorney-general-clark-joins-coalition-states-challenging-trumps-fake-energy-emergency\">statement.</url></p><p>While Clark is gearing up for legal battles, the treasurer is slowing down-not out of fear, Parenteau said, but from dedication to the task of figuring out how much the big oil companies actually owe the state.</p><p>In the last legislative session, Pieciak received more money and time to work with experts on putting the superfund law into action. The new deadline for estimating the cost of fossil fuels on Vermont's climate is 2027.</p><p>\"He's smart about this,\" said Parenteau. \"He's listening to people like me say, you better have a bomb-proof case because it's going to be challenged to the max.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Vermont House Republicans introduced legislation in May to <url normalizedValue=\"https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2026/Docs/BILLS/H-0518/H-0518%20As%20Introduced.pdf\">stop the program to enact the superfund</url> altogether. This also didn't come as a surprise-the superfund passed in 2024 without the support of most Republicans, and Gov. Scott, a Republican, refused to sign it out of <url normalizedValue=\"https://governor.vermont.gov/press-release/action-taken-governor-phil-scott-legislation-may-30-2024\">concern for the cost and risk</url> of taking on big oil companies alone. Still, he's a named defendant in the Trump Administration's lawsuit. His office didn't respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.</p><p>This partisan divide has come up in other<url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23052025/vermont-governor-phil-scott-delays-ev-mandates/\"> disputes</url> this year over whether Vermont's climate goals are too ambitious. In response to the effort to repeal the superfund program, Watson said, \"The House Republicans are trying to do a lot of things around walking back any sort of climate legislation, and especially as chair of natural resources, I have no intention of entertaining that.\"</p><p>Watson's commitment to the superfund approach has taken root in other states that are considering following Vermont's example. \"I think if other states or countries want to see a dime from the fossil fuel industry, they should initiate similar laws of their own to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable,\" she said.</p><p>Four states now have their own bills pending, and six more have introduced bills that didn't pass committee this year but could come back in 2026. Nor is the United States the only country where a desire for this type of legislation is gaining support. <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hfcJBUKA906tuE_z-mz4JyMlPJkyadd8XxyWX3fAFPI/edit?slide=id.g344012d7ab8_0_71#slide=id.g344012d7ab8_0_71\">A new survey</url> from Greenpeace and Oxfam shows that<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/75582/global-survey-finds-8-out-of-10-people-support-taxing-oil-and-gas-corporations-to-pay-for-climate-damages/?_gl=1*1pmzxgg*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTQ1OTg3MjQyNy4xNzUwNzkzMTIy*_ga_94MRTN8HG4*czE3NTA3OTMxMjMkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA3OTMxMjMkajYwJGwwJGgxNDE1NTQwNDA3\"> a majority of people from across the world would support </url>their governments fining polluters for climate damages.</p><p>In the U.S., it is the red states that are arguing state superfund laws would create a \"'<url normalizedValue=\"https://ecf.vtd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_temp.pl?file=1792927-0--38529.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf\">confused patchwork of standards.'</url>\" In the Chamber of Commerce's lawsuit, these states support the argument that climate superfunds are preempted by the federal Clean Air Act, as well as multiple clauses of the Constitution-arguments that are at the heart of the Trump Administration's lawsuit, as well.\u00a0</p><p>Environmental advocates behind the superfund legislation anticipated this attack and made sure their approach did not seek to regulate current and future emissions, as the Clean Air Act does. Instead, the superfund imposes retroactive fines on past greenhouse gas pollution, using <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19042024/vermont-legislature-climate-change-superfund/#:~:text=end%20of%202024.-,Climate%20attribution%20science,-makes%20this%20assessment\">attribution science to calculate harms</url> caused by individual companies' emissions.</p><p>Watson has confidence going forward in the legality of the superfund. \"I firmly believe that our bill is constitutional and that it is lawful,\" she said. \"... They wouldn't be pushing back so hard if we didn't have an excellent case.\"</p><p>Both suits are on track to reach the Supreme Court, unless a new president comes to office and drops the Trump administration case before then. Even if the superfund survives this first round of challenges, there could be another set of tests in the future when the oil companies that have been watching from the sidelines so far become directly involved. Parenteau said those companies will likely file their own lawsuits against state superfund laws.\u00a0</p><p>On the other side, Vermont's lawyers could soon be joined by regional organizations supporting the superfund law, among them the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farmers Association, both of which are waiting to hear if the federal district court will approve them to jointly intervene in the chamber's case on behalf of Vermont citizens and farmers.</p><p>No one has intervened on either side in the Trump Administration's lawsuit, and it's still unclear whether the cases will be consolidated. Recently, the judge appears to be slowing down to coordinate the schedules of both cases. On Wednesday, all parties filed an agreed-upon request for both cases to share the same schedule, which suggests it's likely that the court will hear them together.\u00a0</p><p>What promises to be a drawn out process is one many Vermonters can't afford, environmental advocates say, as the costs of flooding and other climate-amplified weather events mount in a state where the climate crisis is only forecast to get worse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCLNE-96488</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCLNE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G4S-XVM3-SDSR-S044-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">462782</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2164\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 InsideClimate News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Climate News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 27, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Fossil Fuels</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice &amp;

According to news reporting out of Silchar, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are increasing in terms of number, size, and extent which have a growing influence on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Assam University: \"The economy and ecology of Northeast India have been seriously impacted by forest fires in many places, it is important to comprehend the region's spatiotemporal distribution, severity, and future projections for forest fires in light of climate change. Geographical information systems (GIS) integrating with remote sensing (RS) were used to understand the role of different parameters in all four bioclimatic zones of the region. Results: and discussion: Most of the fires were restricted to pre-monsoon season (93 %), alone 62 % in March. The forest fire in the present scenario was highest in the Lawngtlai district, followed by Dhalai and Ri-Bhoi. The Lawngtlai and Dhalai districts are at the highest risk (greater than 70 %) for future forest fires. Categorically, among the protected areas, Lengteng WLS has the highest (86.6 %) future forest fire risk followed by Tawi WLS (86.5 %), Ngengpui WLS (84.9 %), and Pualreng WLS (84.6 %).\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The results suggest that underground biomass in the lower elevated forest needs to be managed effectively at the onset of the fire season to reduce the occurrence of forest fires. There is a need for a well-defined framework supported by geospatial technology to predict, identify, and prioritize the fire potential zone with synergic strategies supported by the local community to mitigate the fire impact on the forests.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest fire estimation and risk prediction using multispectral satellite images: Case study.

According to news reporting out of Kunming, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"This study aimed to accurately map burned forest areas and analyze the spatial distribution of forest fires under complex terrain conditions.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Agricultural Joint Foundation of Yunnan Province. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Southwest Forestry University: \"This study integrates Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS data to map burned forest areas in the complex terrain of western Yunnan. A machine learning workflow was developed on Google Earth Engine by combining Dynamic World land cover data with official fire records, utilizing a logistic regression-based feature selection strategy and an enhanced SNIC segmentation GEOBIA framework. The performance of four classifiers (RF, SVM, KNN, CART) in burn detection was evaluated through a comparative analysis of their spectral-spatial discrimination capabilities. The results indicated that the RF classifier achieved the highest performance, with an overall accuracy of 96.32% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.951. Spatial analysis further revealed that regions at medium altitudes (800-1600 m) and moderate slopes (15-25\u00b0) are more prone to forest fires.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This study demonstrates a robust approach for generating accurate large-scale forest fire maps and provides valuable insights for effective fire management in complex terrain areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Mapping Burned Forest Areas in Western Yunnan, China, Using Multi-Source Optical Imagery Integrated with Simple Non-Iterative Clustering Segmentation and Random Forest Algorithms in Google Earth Engine.

According to news reporting from Wien, Austria, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The global community is grappling with a significant increase in forest fires' frequency, size, and intensity, presenting a profound challenge.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from European Forest Institute: \"To complement existing framing literature on forest fires, this paper examines collective frames applied to forest fires in a broader EU context. Employing a content analysis covering 354 EU policy documents-spanning both soft (non-legally binding) and hard (legally binding) policy documents-via the use of Atlas.ti, six collective frames on forest fires are outlined, identifying four as particularly dominant: \u2018climate adaptation and resilience', \u2018risk mitigation and protective governance', \u2018agriculture and rural development', and \u2018technocratic perspectives on forest fires'. These frames capture dominant perspectives promoted within specific policy domains, such as energy and agriculture. Despite the diverse approaches to framing forest fires and their varied objectives, a common thread connects the narratives in these documents, namely, the central theme of \u2018risk'.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Whether it emerges in the context of reporting or as part of a call to action for adopting certain EU measures, the use of risk operates as a narrative device that negatively frames the discourse, consistently employed to call for action. The findings underscore the importance of considering communication strategies surrounding forest fires, particularly in light of their implications for forest governance.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Through Smoke to Policy: Framing the EU Forest Fire Policy Landscape.

They already face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a January 2023 traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother near his home.</p><p>Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. His death led to nationwide protests, calls for police reforms in the U.S., and intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, a majority-Black city.</p><p>Mr. Cameron was called to the stand by the defense lawyer for Haley, who was at the traffic stop and arrived at the location of the beating after former officer Emmitt Martin kicked and punched Nichols in the head as Nichols was being held by Smith and Bean.</p><p>Mr. Cameron said Nichols had not yet been handcuffed and Haley used proper force in kicking Nichols once in the arm. The veteran police trainer said Haley kicked Nichols in order to facilitate the handcuffing of Nichols by the other officers.</p><p>However, under cross-examination by prosecutor Paul Hagerman, Mr. Cameron acknowledged that the punches and kicks by Martin to Nichols' head were unnecessary, excessive and an example of deadly force. Officers who saw those head blows had a duty to intervene and stop the beating at that point, Mr. Cameron said.</p><p>Texas Gov. Abbott signs $1B school voucher bill</p><p>Texas will implement a $1 billion school voucher program, one of the largest in the country, that uses public dollars to fund private school tuition under a bill Gov. Greg Abbott signed Saturday, capping off a yearslong effort by Republicans.</p><p>School voucher supporters have long targeted the state, where past efforts buckled for decades against resistance from Democrats and rural Republicans. Last month President Donald Trump called lawmakers before a key vote needed to finally get the bill to Abbott's desk.</p><p>Texas joins more than 30 other states that have implemented a similar program, of which about a dozen have launched or expanded their programs in recent years to make most students eligible.</p><p>School vouchers have been Mr. Abbott's primary focus this year, coming off a 2024 election cycle in which he led a campaign to oust GOP lawmakers who voted against a similar bill last session.</p><p>Republican lawmakers and bill supporters say it will give parents more choice by letting them pull their children out of poor-performing public schools.</p><p>\"Gone are the days that families are limited to only the schools assigned by government,\" Mr. Abbott said before signing the bill at the governor's mansion. \"The day has arrived that empowers parents to choose the school that is best for their child.\"</p><p>Second person charged with setting N.J. wildfire</p><p>A second person has been charged with arson in the wildfire in New Jersey's Pine Barrens that has grown into the state's second-largest fire in nearly two decades.</p><p>Prosecutors said Friday that a 17-year-old was arrested and charged with arson, aggravated arson and hindering apprehension. His name was not released because he is a juvenile.</p><p>The fire that has been burning for nearly two weeks is 80% contained, according to the state Forest Fire Service. The blaze in southern New Jersey's Ocean County has spread across 24 square miles. No injuries have been reported.</p><p>A 19-year-old man from Waretown was charged with arson a week ago. Prosecutors say Joseph Kling set wood pallets on fire and left the area. On Friday, prosecutors said Mr. Kling and a few other people took the pallets from a recycling center, drove to a heavily wooded area and used gasoline to start the fire.</p><p>Mr. Kling's attorney said at a detention hearing Friday that Mr. Kling did not intend to set the wildfire or destroy any property.</p><p>The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia and the Atlantic coast, a region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves where winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-250504159481913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FR4-6BD3-S2CX-S2V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 P.G.

According to news originating from the Department of Business Management by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Abstracts: The study focuses on enhancing early detection and intelligent warning of forest fires by leveraging deep learning coupled with remote sensing imagery.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Department of Business Management: \"The research adaptively enhances the genetic algorithm to optimize target detection algorithms for long and short-term memory networks. This approach aims to detect fire features from multi-temporal remote sensing data, enabling the construction of a forest fire early warning model. The experiment results indicated that the improved genetic algorithm stabilized fitness values by the 17th generation, significantly enhancing target detection efficiency and accuracy. The forest fire early warning model, developed using the improved genetic algorithm and remote sensing imagery, demonstrated impressive performance with only a 0.25 % absolute error between predicted and actual fire extent within the 11-318 m2 range. These findings suggest that the research model excels in providing precise early-stage warnings for small-scale forest fires.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The results of this research have significantly improved the response to sudden forest fires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Natural ecology early warning model by integrating IGA and remote sensing imagery.

In 2024, the number of forest fires in S\u00e3o Paulo state reached unprecedented levels. This phenomenon, combined with unfavorable conditions for pollutant concentrations, given temperature and precipitation anomalies, resulted in high concentrations of pollutants for several weeks, mainly affecting the number of hospitalizations of the most vulnerable age groups, children (due to respiratory diseases) and older adults (due to cerebrovascular diseases) in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. The Incidence Rate Ratio calculations demonstrate how different age groups are differently affected by changes in pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables, so that air temperature, relative humidity, concentration of Particulate Matter, SO2, NO2, and O3 are the main variables that affect hospitalizations by respiratory, cerebrovascular or cardiovascular diseases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>In the last decades, the frequency and extent of forest fires have increased dramatically worldwide1. Large-scale wildfires were observed in California (USA) in 20082, Colorado (USA)3 and Valencia (Spain)4 in 2012, Canada5 and Portugal6 in 2017, and Southeast Australia in 2019\u2013207. Anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation and pasture renovation or clearing, combined with extreme weather conditions like droughts and high air temperatures, have contributed to the occurrence and rapid spread of forest fires on an unprecedented scale and duration8,9. This combination of wildfires, particularly in tropical regions, unsustainable land use, and climate change, has caused a reinforcing effect due to a reduction in the Earth\u2019s capacity to sink CO2, disrupting the regulation of this greenhouse gas. As a result, the reinforcing effect leads to increased warming, which is one of the factors for igniting new fire outbreaks10.</p><p>Over the last decade, Brazil has attracted significant attention due to the large number and extent of forest fires, ranking first in the number of wildfires in South America11. Among the various biomes in this country, the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest (the predominant biome in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo) deserve special attention, as both can be classified as fire-sensitive because fire harms their biodiversity12. Therefore, at these biomes, only adverse conditions related to extreme droughts make them more vulnerable to fire13. However, climate changes have caused anomalies in rainfall patterns, intensifying droughts in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly during severe El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events14, 15\u201316 and due to effects of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) weakening17. When combined with unsustainable land use, such anomalies can increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves, providing more ignition sources for fires and lengthening the wildfire season. For instance, in 2020, over 312,140 km2 of the Brazilian territory was burned, with 46.3% and 28.6% of these fires concentrated in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, respectively18. This same year, the Pantanal was also devastated by a severe fire, which affected about a third of its total area (around 40,606 km2)19.</p><p>Forest fires harm the local fauna and flora and directly impact public health through atmospheric pollution. Their harmful effects can range from eye irritation and corneal abrasions in nearby populations to a significant increase in hospitalizations and deaths caused by respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, even in regions up to 1000 km away7.</p><p>Wildfire events can significantly contribute to an increase in the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) (generally confined to regions directly affected by the fire), methane (CH4), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM), particularly fine and ultrafine particles. These particles can travel long distances, causing harmful effects even in areas far from the fire\u2019s origin20,21. Compared to urban PM, wildfire-generated PM contains higher levels of oxidative potential (e.g., oxygenated PAHs and quinones) and proinflammatory components (e.g., aldehydes and NOx).</p><p>The exposure to wildfire smoke can result in respiratory (bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, heart stroke), and allergic and immunological disorders (Atopic dermatitis, Allergic rhinitis, and Asthma)22.</p><p>CO can form carboxyhemoglobin when it enters the human body. This compound impairs oxygen transport and can cause hypoxia, as well as having long-term toxic consequences for the body\u2019s organs and tissues. Furthermore, CO can disrupt intracellular respiratory processes, resulting in cellular hypoxia. Carbon oxides bound to intracellular macromolecules have toxic effects on all body tissues23,24. NOx, mainly from wildfire smoke, can cause coughing and inflammation of airways, favoring the prevalence of asthma and COPD25,26. VOCs can be composed of several elements that are harmful to human health (eg, acrolein, benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, etc.). In addition, they can react with hazardous compounds, like peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), resulting in a compound that favors the eyes, nose, and throat irritation27,28. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of O3 contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, especially in the most vulnerable populations29. SO2 can cause irritation and inflammation of the airways, affecting the respiratory system30. The exposure to high PM concentrations affects the cardiovascular, dermal, digestive, immune, nervous, respiratory, and reproductive systems29. However, compared to urban PM, wildfire-generated PM contains higher levels of oxidative potential (e.g., oxygenated PAHs and quinones) and proinflammatory components (e.g., aldehydes and NOx).</p><p>Furthermore, it is essential to highlight that as PM ages, its chemical composition changes, and its oxidative potential increases. As a result, PM generated by wildfires can become more toxic to macrophage cells as it travels, eventually reaching urban areas. Additionally, ultra-fine PM can pass through the alveolar membrane and penetrate deeper into the lungs. This can lead to changes in pulmonary responses, potentially affecting airway function and the body\u2019s ability to resist viruses and bacteria. Consequently, hospital admissions and emergency visits for respiratory symptoms, mainly for asthma, bronchitis, dyspnea, pneumonia, and COPD symptoms increase significantly31, 32, 33, 34, 35\u201336. In addition, exposure to elevated levels of PM2.5 impairs vascular function, which can contribute to cardio and cerebrovascular diseases37.</p><p>Therefore, although other events, such as dust storms38, extreme pollen seasons39 or changes in local emission patterns40 have been reported in the literature as responsible for the increase in hospital admissions, fire events deserve to be highlighted due to the change that occurs in the toxicity of the particles, making them extremely harmful to the population, especially the most vulnerable one.</p><p>Figure S1 summarizes the interactions described above and demonstrates how combining several processes can increase the number of mobility and mortality cases associated with high temperatures and air pollution levels. Based on this scenario, the current study aims to investigate how the increase in the number of forest fires, between January and September 2024 in S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality, combined with atmospheric conditions less favorable to pollutant dispersion, mainly during winter, resulted in a high concentration of atmospheric pollutants, and consequently on variations in the number of hospitalizations by respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wild fires and pollutant concentrations</emphasis></p><p>Figure 1 shows the number of fires and fire foci observed in S\u00e3o Paulo state from January until September 2024 (gray stars), compared to the average values recorded from 2004 to 2023 (red lines). Since January, the observed values \u200b\u200bhave consistently exceeded the historical average several times, with this trend becoming even more concerning during the fire season. On some days, up to 2,000 fires or outbreaks have been recorded. The data observed in 2024 also indicate an extension of the fire season, which historically begins in July and ends in the middle of October. However, more fire events \u200b\u200bhave been observed since January this year. The increasing number of fires can be attributed to extreme drought conditions and high temperatures, recorded in Brazil\u2019s southeast, central-west, and north regions in 2024. The figures S2 and S3 illustrate the temperature and precipitation anomalies for August and September, which coincided with the highest number of wildfires and/or fire spots. Both figures show meteorological conditions favorable to fires (higher temperature and reduced precipitation), particularly in the southeast, central-west, and north regions.Fig. 1</p><p>Number of Fire Events/Fire Forci from 2003 to 2024 in S\u00e3o Paulo state. The red line represents the daily average from 2004 to 2023, and the red shade depicts the standard deviation. The grey markers indicate the daily number of fire events in 2024. Note the change in the scale of fire events to reflect the elevated number in 2024 accurately. </p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas/\">https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas/</url>.</p><p>The Fig. 2 presents the August and September (Figs. 2a and b, respectively) \u00c5ngstrom Matrices41, 42\u201343 for S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality. Small particles (PM2.5) and black carbon are observed in both months, with the latter detected through its differential Single Scattering Albedo (dSSA). Although black carbon can be produced locally from vehicle emissions, the presence of particles with greater absorption capacity suggests the occurrence of the lensing effect44. This process is associated with the aging aerosols transported from other regions, which become coated with secondary organic aerosols. The advection of smoke plumes from fires occurred in rural areas of S\u00e3o Paulo state and Midwest and north regions of Brazil, to S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality, especially during the fire season, has been reported in several previous studies21,45,46.Fig. 2</p><p>\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m Matrix for S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality in 2024 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) august and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) september.</p><p>This information is complemented by Fig. 3, which shows the daily mean concentration of PM2.5, PM10, O3, SO2, NO2, and AOD values in S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality. As indicated in Fig. 1, the stars represent values registered from January to September 2024, while the red line shows the historical average value. Historically, higher concentrations of pollutants are observed in S\u00e3o Paulo during the winter months (June, July, and August) due to unfavorable conditions for pollutant dispersion (e.g., low convective boundary layer height, reduced wind speed, and absence of rain). Additionally, the average daily PM concentration often exceeds the national and international recommended daily limits between July and August, primarily due to the high number of biomass burning events, which advects smoke plumes to S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality, combined with the local emissions of air pollutants, as mentioned previously. In 2024, although the observed pattern is quite similar to the historical average PM concentration (Figs. 3a-b), it is evident that since May, the average daily concentrations have largely exceeded the historical average values, with a significant part surpassing the average standard deviation. From August onwards, the concentrations have predominantly remained above the average standard deviation. For PM2.5 and PM10, on certain days (23\u201325 September), the measured values were more than double the average standard deviation values. This pattern of higher values in 2024, compared to the historical time series, is also observed in O3 (Fig. 3c) and NO2 (Fig. 3e) (mainly in September).Fig. 3</p><p>Average daily concentration of PM2.5 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), PM10 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), O3 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), SO2 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>), NO2 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) and AOD (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) at S\u00e3o Paulo municipality.</p><p>On the other hand, SO2 (Fig. 3d) has a predominance of values below the average values, so September is the month with the higher number of days whose daily concentration is close to the average value provided by historical time series. This behavior results from reducing the sulfur content of fossil fuels, both industrial and automotive47. The higher AOD values (Fig. 3f) observed in 2024 are primarily due to the combination of adverse meteorological conditions (low air relative humidity, absence of rainfall) and wildfires, which together created less favorable conditions for pollutant dispersion, leading to increased concentrations of NO, NO2, NOx, and PM. In addition, the figure S4, derived from VIIRS satellite data, presents the Ultra Violet Aerosol Index values in Brazil on 23 September, showing high values (consequently high concentration of aerosols) in the Southeast, Midwest, and Northern regions. Unfortunately, field measurements of chemical compounds were not performed during 2024. Nevertheless, previous field campaigns in the Metropolitan Area of S\u00e3o Paulo have identified the presence of some biomass burning tracers such as levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan48, in the aerosol fine aerosol, in mass concentrations up to 1.2 \u00b5g m-3 (levoglucosan) during wintertime49,50. The authors concluded that S\u00e3o Paulo is impacted by regional sugarcane crop burning, what was also confirmed by analyzing air mass trajectories from the west and northwest, and by satellite measurements identifying hundreds of daily forest fires across the field campaigns.</p><p>Therefore, it can be concluded that the combination of unfavorable atmospheric conditions for the dispersion of pollutants and the increase in the number of fires resulted in higher concentrations of the pollutants shown in Fig. 3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Variations in hospitalizations due to respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases</emphasis></p><p>Figure 4 presents the incidence of respiratory (Fig. 4a), cerebrovascular (Fig. 4b), and cardiovascular (Fig. 4c) diseases recorded in DataSUS for S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality from 2000 to 2024. Respiratory diseases are most prevalent in children, followed by adults, and then older adults. These diseases exhibit seasonality, with a sharp increase at the beginning of autumn (March\u2013May) and a significant reduction during the summer (December-February). From February to September 2024, the number of children diagnosed with respiratory diseases was higher than the average value observed from 2000 to 2023, particularly during the first week of April (302 in 2024 compared to an average of 247 between 2000 and 2023, a 21% increase) and the first week of September (267 cases in 2024 compared to an average of 151 between 2000 and 2023, a 77% increase). In addition, the average number of cases in 2024 (161 \u00b1 70) was higher than the average \u200b\u200bobserved during the same months in 2000\u20132023 (150 \u00b1 52). The same pattern was observed in older adults (60 \u00b1 14 in 2024 compared to 48 \u00b1 4 from 2000\u20132023), while the difference in adults was smaller (95 \u00b1 46 during 2024 compared to 94 \u00b1 27 from 2000\u20132023).Fig. 4</p><p>Cases of respiratory (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), cerebrovascular (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), and cardiovascular diseases (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) observed in adult (red), child (yellow), and older adult (violet) patients in S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality. The dots represent the values observed in 2024, the dotted lines are the average from 2000 to 2023, and the shaded areas represent the standard deviation. </p><p>Source: DataSUS.</p><p>According to data extracted from DataSUS, cerebrovascular diseases in S\u00e3o Paulo (Fig. 4b) primarily affect older adults (101 \u00b1 5 hospitalizations/year), followed by adults (57 \u00b1 3 hospitalizations/year). The number of children diagnosed with these diseases is close to zero. From January to September 2024, hospitalizations in older adults consistently remained higher than the average observed between 2000 and 2023, with the average number of hospitalizations in 2024 (137 \u00b1 28) being 34% higher than the previous years (56 \u00b1 2). In the adult age group, although there was an increase (61 \u00b1 14 in 2024 compared to 56 \u00b1 2 from 200\u20132023), it is less significant (around 9%).</p><p>Similar to cerebrovascular diseases, cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 4c) primarily affect older adults (343 \u00b1 29 hospitalizations/year), followed by adults (232 \u00b1 14 hospitalizations/year). The number of children hospitalized due to cardiovascular diseases was close to zero. Among the three disease groups analyzed, this was the only one that showed a reduction in the number of hospitalizations compared to the period from January to September in 2000\u20132023. In the older adults, a reduction of around 5% was observed (311 \u00b1 52 in 2024 compared to 327 \u00b1 55 in 2000\u20132023), and in adults, the reduction was approximately 22% for adults (181 \u00b1 28 in 2024 compared to 231 \u00b1 22 from 2000\u20132023).</p><p>Table 1 shows the IRR estimate for the analyzed age groups based on the meteorological variables and pollutants indicated in the Methods section. Regarding respiratory diseases, children are greatly affected by the TMedian (IRR = 1.07\u201395%CI [1.05\u20131.09]), while  and  also play significant roles (IRR = 1.02\u201395%CI [1.00\u20131.04] and 1.01\u201395%CI [1.00\u20131.01], respectively). These results indicate that, for example, a 10 ug/m3 increase in  concentration can lead to a 20% increase in children hospitalized for respiratory diseases. Therefore, the combined increase in temperature, PM10, and NO2 observed during the first week of September explains the approximately 77% increase in children hospitalized for respiratory diseases. In contrast, adults are more affected by  and  (IRR = 1.01\u201395%CI [1.00\u20131.01]), while the older adults are primarily impacted by  (IRR ~ 1.01\u201395%CI[1.00\u20131.01]).</p><p>Only the adult and older adult age groups were analyzed for cerebrovascular diseases, as there were practically no cases recorded for children throughout the historical series (Fig. 4b). In adults the primary factor is  with IRR = 1.03\u201395%CI [1.02\u20131.04], followed by  (IRR = 1.02\u201395%CI [1.02\u20131.02]),  (IRR = 1.01\u201395%CI [1.01\u20131.02]),  (IRR = 1.01\u201395%CI [1.00\u20131.01]). For instance, a 5 \u00b0C increase in  can lead to a 15% increase in the number of adults hospitalized for cerebrovascular diseases, for example. Regarding the older adult group, the most significant risk factors are  (IRR = 1.02\u201395%CI [1.01\u20131.04]) and  (IRR = 1.01\u201395%CI [1.01\u20131.02]).</p><p>Similar to cerebrovascular diseases, cardiovascular diseases were analyzed only in the adult and older adult age groups, given the low occurrence of this illness in children, according to DataSUS (Fig. 4c). In adults, the leading risk factor is  (IRR = 1.02\u201395%CI [1.01\u20131.02]), followed by  (IRR = 1.02\u201395%CI [1.01\u20131.02]). These results indicate that a 5 \u00b0C increase in  may lead to a 10% increase in cardiovascular diseases among adults. For older adults, the primary factor is  (IRR = 1.02\u201395%CI [1.01\u20131.02]), followed by  (IRR = 1.01\u201395%CI [1.01\u20131.02]) and  (IRR = 1.01\u201395%CI [1.00\u20131.01]). This indicates that a 10 ug/m3 increase in the maximum concentration of SO2 may result in an increase of around 10% in the number of older adults with cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the correlation between SO2 and cardiovascular diseases justifies why this was the only group to show a reduction compared to the historical average, as SO2 concentrations in 2024 remained consistently below the historical average.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>In recent years, the combination of extreme events driven by climate change and unsustainable land use has led to a significant increase in both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, as well as the length of the fire season, in the Southeast, Midwest, and North states of Brazil.</p><p>This study showed that the intense drought and high temperatures observed between August (the end of the fire season) and September 2024 likely contributed to an increase in the occurrence of wildfires and an extension of the fire season. These factors led to more biomass-burning episodes during this period, exceeding the historical average by up to 50%. The increase in fires across several Brazilian regions (especially in the Midwest and North, which historically advect smoke plumes to S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality) resulted in higher emissions of pollutants (e.g., NO2, PM, SO2). Additionally, due to wintertime and the intense drought in September 2024, less favorable atmospheric conditions for pollutant dispersion led to elevated concentrations of pollutants in S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality.</p><p>Between January and September 2024, the number of hospitalizations due to respiratory or cerebrovascular diseases were higher than the average values \u200b\u200brecorded over the previous 19 years, especially during the fire season. Children and older adults were among the age groups with the most significant variation in respiratory and cerebrovascular diseases, respectively, demonstrating that the most vulnerable groups were the most affected. Additionally, the calculation of the IRR allowed for a detailed analysis of how each pollutant and meteorological variable examined in this study impacts different age groups.</p><p>The relationship between PM2.5, NO2, and respiratory diseases, particularly in children, observed in S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality, has also been observed in previous studies conducted in other regions, such as South Africa51, Hong Kong52 and Western Amazon53.</p><p>Regarding the cerebrovascular diseases, the association between them and air temperature was also observed by Mascarenhas et al.54 in a study conducted in 10 Brazilian cities and by Doi et al.55 in Japan. Doi et al.55 also identified a positive relationship between relative humidity and cardiovascular diseases, particularly in older adults. Additionally, highlighting the capability of SO2 and O3 to cause oxidative stress, Hahad et al.56 and Miller57 also identified a relationship between these pollutants and cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>The relationship between pollutants, atmospheric variables, and cardiovascular diseases, observed in this study, align with previous studies carried out in S\u00e3o Paulo state58, China59, and Iran60. Furthermore, the positive relationship between temperature, relative humidity, and cardiovascular diseases has also been observed in other studies in northern and southern China61 and Taiwan62.</p><p>Therefore, the results presented in this study demonstrate how the increase of fires triggers a cascade effect that leads to higher pollutant concentrations and, consequently, an increase in hospitalizations due to respiratory and cerebrovascular diseases, particularly among the most vulnerable age groups. Moreover, the IRR results provide valuable insights into the potential health implications of a future warmer climate, especially for children and older adults.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire events</emphasis></p><p>The daily number of fire incidents is sourced from the TerraBrasilis platform, developed by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The platform\u2019s first version was launched in 2019. The platform aims to create a spatial data infrastructure specifically for monitoring data from the Amazon Rainforest Monitoring Program by Satellite (PRODES) and Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER)63. All data are available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas/\">https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas/</url>, which contains records of all fire events detected by satellites and received by INPE since 1998. This study used data from reference satellites covering January 2004 to September 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pollutant concentration and atmospheric variables</emphasis></p><p>The Environmental Company of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (CETESB) operates an extensive network of fixed and mobile stations to monitor atmospheric pollutants across the state. The data from this network are made available through CETESB\u2019s platform Qualar (<url normalizedValue=\"https://qualar.cetesb.sp.gov.br/\">https://qualar.cetesb.sp.gov.br/</url>).</p><p>Concentration data for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, and SO2, as well as, values of Air Temperature (T) and Relative Humidity (RH) were extracted from the Qualar platform. All data were collected from all 15 automatic monitoring stations in the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality. Hourly data between January 2004 and September 2024 were selected for this study, so that, from them the median (), maximum (), and mean () weekly values were then determined.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ultra violet aerosol index and aerosol optical depth</emphasis></p><p>The Ultra Violet Aerosol Index is a measurement of the amount of aerosol in the Atmosphere. In this study it was obtained from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. VIIRS is part of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)64, such instrument captures measurements across 22 spectral bands, spanning wavelengths from 0.41 to 12 \u00b5m. Among these, 16 are moderate-resolution bands with a nadir spatial resolution of 750 m, while 5 are imaging bands with a higher nadir spatial resolution of 375 m. Additionally, VIIRS features a unique day/night band in the reflective solar spectrum (0.5\u20130.9 \u00b5m), which operates at three different gain stages. This configuration enables an extensive dynamic range, allowing data collection during daytime and nighttime orbits65.</p><p>Using data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m matrix was estimated using the methodology described in Cappa et al.66. This matrix provides information about the type of aerosols and their absorption capacity, measured by the differential Single Scattering Albedo (dSSA). In addition, these same data were used to plot the daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) [440 nm] time series (Fig. 4f) from January 2004 to September 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Diseases</emphasis></p><p>All disease data used in this work were collected from the DataSUS website (<url normalizedValue=\"https://datasus.saude.gov.br/\">https://datasus.saude.gov.br/</url>), a Brazilian Ministry of Health repository to S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality. The data were categorized into three age groups: children (0\u201314 years), adults (15\u201359 years), and older adults (60 years or older). The three groups of diseases analyzed comprise the following ICD codes: respiratory (J00, J01, J02, J03, J04, J05, J06, J11, J18, J20, J21, J22, 23, J30, J32, J40, J44, J45, J46, J47), cerebrovascular (I62, I63, I64, G45), and cardiovascular (I10, I11, I15, I20, I21, I24, I26, I45, I47, I48, I49, I50). The data covered the period from January 2000 to September 2024, and for analysis purposes, they were grouped into epidemiological weeks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Incidence rate ratio (IRR)</emphasis></p><p>The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was estimated using a univariate negative binomial regression. The outcome variable was the number of weekly hospitalizations to each age group (children, adults, and older adults), while the independent variables included the Mean, Median, and Maximum values of Air Temperature (T), Relative Humidity (RH), and concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3. The initial negative binomial regression model included all variables. Variables with a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P-value</emphasis> greater than 0.01 were removed using manual backward stepwise elimination. The final model was created based on the most relevant variables. This approach enables us to assess how different variables affect each age group.Table 1</p><p>Incidence rate ratio (IRR) [95%CI] of respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases in S\u00e3o Paulo municipality.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors thanked the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)/DECIT of Brazil for financing the CAIPORA project (444761/2023-3) and GD (174673/2023-0), and CAPES (Finances Code 001).

According to news reporting out of Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The timely and precise detection of forest fires is critical for halting the spread of wildfires and minimizing ecological and economic damage.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key R&amp;D Program of China; National College Students Innovation And Entrepreneurship Training Program. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"However, the large variation in target size and the complexity of the background in UAV remote sensing images increase the difficulty of real-time forest fire detection. To address this challenge, this study proposes a lightweight YOLO model for UAV remote sensing forest fire detection (LUFFD-YOLO) based on attention mechanism and multi-level feature fusion techniques: (1) GhostNetV2 was employed to enhance the conventional convolution in YOLOv8n for decreasing the number of parameters in the model; (2) a plug-and-play enhanced small-object forest fire detection C2f (ESDC2f) structure was proposed to enhance the detection capability for small forest fires; (3) an innovative hierarchical feature-integrated C2f (HFIC2f) structure was proposed to improve the model's ability to extract information from complex backgrounds and the capability of feature fusion. The LUFFD-YOLO model surpasses the YOLOv8n, achieving a 5.1% enhancement in mAP and a 13% reduction in parameter count and obtaining desirable generalization on different datasets, indicating a good balance between high accuracy and model efficiency.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This work would provide significant technical support for real-time forest fire detection using UAV remote-sensing images.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: LUFFD-YOLO: A Lightweight Model for UAV Remote Sensing Forest Fire Detection Based on Attention Mechanism and Multi-Level Feature Fusion.

Climate warming has intensified the occurrence of pest outbreaks in recent years, but the associated risk has not been precisely assessed or understood. To address this gap, this paper took Shandong Province, China as a case study, and constructed a feature optimization model for the class imbalance problem and a novel risk assessment method to quantify the temporal and spatial distribution of corn borer occurrence risk. Addressing the prevalent issue of class imbalance in pest datasets, a feature optimization model using Borderline-SMOTE to improve the Genetic Algorithm-Random Forest (GA-RF) was constructed, combined with Pearson correlation coefficient to jointly obtain a subset of features that affect corn borer. Subsequently, given the limitations of traditional risk assessment models that easily lose spatial information, by introducing the idea of weighted clustering algorithm, a novel machine learning model was proposed to assess the risk of agricultural pests and diseases. </p><p>Finally, integrating natural disaster risk theory, this paper achieved an assessment and zoning of corn borer risk in the study area based on hazard, sensitivity, disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, and comprehensive states. The results indicated that compared with the original RF model, the improved feature optimization model achieves increases of 18.64%, 11.12%, and 11.21% in OOB_score, Accuracy, and F1_score, respectively, and outperforms eight other benchmark models. In terms of clustering performance, the weighted K-means clustering algorithm achieves higher Silhouette coefficient by 0.0138 and 0.1885 compared with the weighted agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm (weighted AHC) and weighted DBSCAN, respectively, the Calinski-Harabasz index is higher by 3.8017 and 22.4039, and the Davies-Bouldin index is lower by 0.1006 and 0.4889, demonstrating superior clustering results. The spatial zoning results closely align with actual conditions. The risk of corn borer occurrence was concentrated in the southwest and northern areas of Shandong Province, while the risk in the central and southeast areas was relatively low. This research provides a novel approach to agricultural disaster risk assessment and the obtained results can serve as decision support for corn borer prevention and control in Shandong Province.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Due to global warming, the suitable habitats for agricultural pests are expanding, and their development times are advancing continuously1. Agricultural pests can lead to a decrease in grain production, resulting in a series of societal issues. Therefore, it is of significant importance to assess the risk of pest occurrence systematically to enhance crop yields. Corn is one of the most crucial staple crops globally2. As a significant agricultural producer and consumer worldwide, China has a wide planting area for corn. In 2022 alone, the planting area of corn in China reached 43.07 million hectares, accounting for approximately 36.4% of the total grain planting area. The corn production amounted to 277.2 million tons, representing about 40.38% of the total grain production3,4. As a major province in both corn production and consumption, Shandong Province accounts for approximately 10% of China\u2019s corn sown area and production5. The quantity of corn consumption and processing in Shandong consistently ranks first in China, exerting a significant influence on the national and even global corn market.</p><p>The corn borer, commonly known as the corn drill worm, is an important pest of grain crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum6. It causes harm by hiding and burrowing as larvae, damaging the undeveloped and rolled-up tender leaves during the whorl stage. Additionally, it inflicts harm after silk emergence by damaging the silks and female spikes. In its mature larval stage, it bores into corn stalks and female spikes, posing considerable challenges for prevention and control efforts7. Research indicates that in normal years, corn yield is reduced by 10\u201315% due to corn borer damage, and in years of severe infestation, the reduction can exceed 30%, leading to even complete crop failure8. According to statistics, the annual loss in corn production in China caused by the damage from corn borers is as high as 6 to 9 million tons (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.moa.gov.cn/ztzl\">https://www.moa.gov.cn/ztzl</url>). Predictably, pests like corn borer are a key agricultural disaster concern for cultivators of crops, especially in areas where agriculture serves as a pillar industry9, 10\u201311. In recent years, the intensifying trend of global warming has significantly enhanced the pest\u2019s adaptability in northern China, increasing its overwinter survival rate, number of generations per year, and overall geographical distribution12,13. Consequently, climate change may have exacerbated the risk of corn borer outbreaks in Shandong Province. Pest disasters such as the corn borer have become critical threats requiring close monitoring in agricultural production, especially in areas that rely heavily on agriculture, where the pressure of prevention and control is particularly severe. Generally, the risk caused by agricultural pests and diseases can be mitigated to some extent through risk assessment and zoning, facilitating precise pesticide application by agricultural workers in practical operations14. Agricultural workers thus seek to enhance productive gains through accurate risk assessment and optimized management strategies15,16. However, to date, no studies have assessed the risk of corn borer from an integrated disaster risk assessment perspective. This study aims to fill that gap.</p><p>Disaster risk assessment involves dividing a particular area into zones of different risk levels, thereby formulating various disaster prevention and mitigation strategies to reduce the losses caused by disasters to human society17,18. It holds significant practical value in disaster risk management. Currently, it is widely used in various disaster fields such as floods, earthquakes, and landslides19, 20\u201321. From the perspective of research subjects, studies on disaster risk assessment can be divided into two main parts: one is the construction of the assessment indicators system, which includes the selection of assessment indicators and the determination of indicator weights18,22. In traditional risk assessment studies, the selection of evaluation indicators is typically performed manually by researchers based on theoretical foundations and existing research findings, combined with the specific characteristics of the disaster18,22,23. Appropriate evaluation indicators are selected to construct a risk assessment system, and methods such as expert scoring or analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are utilized to determine the weights of these indicators24,25. An apparent drawback of this approach is its susceptibility to subjective factors, resulting in the composition of the assessment system and the determined weights not being optimal26. Feature optimization enables the identification of the most relevant set of features to the target problem from a large pool, thereby enhancing the accuracy of results27. Zhang et al. utilized the correlation analysis (CA) and x-Loading weight method (x-Lw) to identify features related to leaf water content in winter wheat. Their results showed that the model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to using all features28. In the context of pests and diseases research, the vast number of available features causes significant redundancy. Unfortunately, feature optimization methods have not yet been applied to risk assessment studies in agricultural pests and diseases research22.</p><p>The second aspect is the methodologies of risk assessment, encompassing the construction of assessment models and the division of risk levels. In previous studies, mathematical-statistical methods such as weighted comprehensive evaluation and natural disaster risk index method have often been used to establish assessment models22,29. These methods compute the risk index of the study area to represent its occurrence risk and utilize natural breaks classification (Jenks) to divide risk levels30,31. Although this approach is practical and has been widely applied in the field of natural disaster risk assessment, it simplifies complex assessment results into a single risk index or level, leading to the loss of significant spatial information and details. Moreover, the natural breaks classification method is the classification of one-dimensional data, and the method needs to preset the number of levels, which makes the classification results blind29. To address this issue, some scholars have introduced machine learning and deep learning algorithms to train sample sets and predict disaster risk probabilities or levels within the study area32, 33, 34, 35, 36\u201337. For example, Mishra et al. successfully predicted forest fire risk and its spatial distribution in Odisha, India using machine learning models, achieving high prediction accuracy and revealing important temporal trends38. Guria et al. further combined Sentinel-2 MSI data with ensemble machine learning methods to assess forest fire susceptibility and probability in the Similipal Biosphere Reserve39,40. These studies not only demonstrate the excellent performance of machine learning models in environmental risk assessment, but also highlight the significance of multiple conditioning factors and the application potential of advanced machine learning algorithms in the field of risk assessment. This type of method has high accuracy and applicability, but the training process requires known historical disaster risk probability or levels within the study area41, 42\u201343. In practice, many types of disasters and areas still lack official statistical risk levels and probabilities, preventing the widespread adoption and application of this method44. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore a risk assessment model that can maintain high accuracy in the absence of historical risk probability levels. Clustering algorithms, as an unsupervised learning technique, cluster similar data points into a group, ensuring maximum similarity within a cluster while maintaining distinct differences between clusters45. Compared with traditional supervised learning methods such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, which rely heavily on labeled data, clustering methods are unsupervised learning approaches that offer significant advantages in situations where historical data and labeled samples are limited. Although traditional clustering methods can perform unsupervised grouping, they do not account for feature weights46. As a result, when dealing with data containing indicators of varying importance, they may fail to accurately reflect the contribution of each feature. In contrast, weighted clustering algorithms can incorporate feature importance into the clustering process, making them particularly suitable for disaster risk assessment studies. Currently, in risk assessment research, clustering algorithms are typically used to classify disaster occurrence probabilities, calculated by machine learning algorithms, into different clusters, thus delineating study area into varying risk zones47,48. Essentially, this method still relies on machine learning algorithms to predict disaster occurrence probabilities, while clustering algorithms function as a means of probability grading rather than serving as the core risk assessment model. Therefore, this study introduces the concept of weighted clustering algorithms to build a novel risk assessment model.</p><p>In summary, current research on using machine learning for corn borer risk assessment remains limited. Moreover, traditional disaster risk assessment methods often rely on manually selected indicators and weights, which may not comprehensively reflect the actual risk49,50. Traditional models are also prone to losing spatial information and struggle to function effectively when historical data are lacking. These limitations constrain their applicability and accuracy29. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to accurately assess the occurrence risk of corn borer disasters in Shandong Province through the optimization of indicators and the construction of risk assessment models.

The widely accepted mechanism for natural disaster formation is the four-factor theory17. Therefore, this study integrates the occurrence mechanism of agricultural pests and diseases, drawing on regional disaster system theory and natural disaster risk theory, to conduct risk assessment research from four perspectives: the danger of disaster-causing factors, the sensitivity of the disaster-forming environments, the vulnerability of disaster-bearing objects, and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>Shandong Province, located in the eastern coastal region and the downstream area of the Yellow River in China, boasts a favorable geographical position. It is one of China\u2019s top ten grain-producing provinces and one of the thirteen major grain-producing areas in the country, with an annual planting area of approximately 2.7 \u00d7 10\u2077 hm\u00b2 and a corn yield exceeding 20 million tons51. Shandong Province has a warm temperate monsoon climate, with average annual temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C to 14 \u00b0C and annual average precipitation between 550 and 950 millimeters. Approximately 60\u201370% of the annual precipitation falls during the summer months. With an average of 2290 to 2890 h of sunshine annually, the natural conditions are highly conducive to corn growth52,53. However, due to its favorable climate, Shandong faces a greater threat from the corn borer compared to other provinces with higher corn yields, such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia, which are located further north and have colder climates, making them less affected by corn borer infestations54. The peak oviposition period of corn borer adults typically occurs in June and July, coinciding with the seedling and whorl stages of corn, thus exerting a significant impact on corn quality and yield. Figure 1 shows the geographical location of the study area, along with photos of the corn borer disaster discovered during our field investigations54,55.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>The study area (The figure was generated using QGIS 3.34.13 software, with the URL link: <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/\">https://qgis.org/</url>.) and field investigation photos of corn borer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Summary of pests and diseases risk assessment indicators</emphasis></p><p>The paper has summarized indicators from relevant assessment systems. Taking into account the biological characteristics of pests and diseases and the mechanisms of disaster occurrence, as well as considering both natural and human-induced factors triggering disasters, we have developed a comprehensive pests and diseases risk assessment indicator system. This system comprises 4 primary indicators, 14 secondary indicators, and 84 tertiary and quaternary indicators. Data collection for this study was conducted based on this system, the detailed contents of which are presented in Table S1 (available in the supplementary materials) .</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data collection</emphasis></p><p>The corn borer, belonging to the Lepidoptera family Crambidae, undergoes approximately 5\u20136 generations primarily in Shandong Province. It favors moderate temperatures and high humidity, with environmental temperatures between 20 and 26 \u00b0C and relative humidity above 80% being most conducive to its growth and development56. The corn borer exhibits strong flight capabilities and phototropism. Newly hatched larvae are agile and drift with the wind to nearby host plants. Mature larvae overwinter as pupae in the stalks, tassels, or roots of host crops such as corn. Upon suitable humidity conditions in the following spring, pupae metamorphose into moths, laying eggs that hatch into larvae, which then infest corn crops57. As indicated above, factors such as precipitation, temperature, sunlight, wind speed, wind direction, and tillage methods may all influence the occurrence of corn borers. Therefore, based on Table S1 and considering the biological characteristics of corn borers, as well as the confidentiality and accessibility of data, this study ultimately collected 43 secondary and tertiary indicator data from four criteria layers: the danger of disaster-causing factors, the sensitivity of disaster-forming environments, the vulnerability of disaster-bearing objects, and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, for further optimization. These indicators include occurrence data of corn borers, agricultural statistics, socio-economic statistics, and meteorological data from 16 sub-provincial cities in Shandong Province. The data period is from 2007 to 2010 and 2013 to 2019, and the specific indicators and data sources are listed in Table S2 (available in the supplementary materials) .</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data preprocessing</emphasis></p><p>Based on the People\u2019s Republic of China Agricultural Industry Standard\u2014Technical Specification for Forecast Technology of the Corn Borer (NY/T 1611\u20132008) and the local standard for grading the degree of corn borer occurrence issued by the Shandong Provincial Plant Protection Station, the criteria for grading the degree of corn borer occurrence are shown in Table 1. The corn borer occurrence data were extracted and organized, and the degree was classified according to Table 1. Using a monthly time scale, the frequency of the highest occurrence degree in each city was categorized as light occurrence <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">V</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">1</emphasis> (levels 0\u20131 as light occurrence), moderate occurrence <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">V</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis> (levels 2\u20133 as moderate occurrence), and severe occurrence <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">V</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">3</emphasis> (levels 4\u20135 as severe occurrence).

Meanwhile, 43 influencing indicators were utilized as independent variables to construct the indicator optimization sample set. The dimensions of the sample set were (11 \u00d7 16) \u00d7 44. Upon analysis of the sample set data, it was observed that the ratio of sample quantities in each class was 32:110:27:7, with the highest ratio being less than 1:13, indicating a severe imbalance in the dataset.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Indicator optimization methods</emphasis></p><p>Feature selection is essential for eliminating redundant or irrelevant variables, reducing model complexity, minimizing the risk of overfitting, and improving both generalization and predictive accuracy. Selecting the most discriminative features with respect to the target variable enhances training efficiency and model interpretability, offering clearer and more reliable support for decision-making. Therefore, we first used Random Forest to eliminate nonlinear redundant features to avoid overfitting, and then applied the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess linear correlations. In cases of significant linear correlation, the feature with the higher importance score was retained, while the lower-scoring feature was removed. This process is illustrated in Fig. 2.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Indicator optimization flowchart.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pearson correlation coefficient</emphasis></p><p>The Pearson correlation coefficient serves as a simple and rapid method for feature (indicator) optimization, involving the calculation of correlation between each pair of indicators to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features, thereby reducing feature redundancy in input machine learning models58.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Construction of the GA-RF model improved by Borderline-SMOTE</emphasis></p><p>Random Forest (RF)59 is a Bagging ensemble learning algorithm capable of handling high-dimensional data and computing feature importance, making it particularly suitable for feature optimization. Compared to other algorithms, RF has better accuracy and stability, and can evaluate accuracy without the need for a validation set, making it widely used in various disaster risk assessment and warning problems60. Therefore, in this study, the RF model was chosen as the base model for feature optimization research.</p><p>However, due to the characteristics of pest and disease outbreaks, the feature optimization dataset for corn borer still suffers from severe class imbalance issues, leading to reduced accuracy in feature optimization. The Borderline-SMOTE algorithm is a data preprocessing method used to address class imbalance problems61. Therefore, to address the issue of imbalanced samples, this study, based on constructing the RF model, utilized the Borderline-SMOTE algorithm to enhance the training set before the Bootstrap Resampling process. This generated more reasonable minority class samples, which were then added to the sample set. Without altering the original data distribution, the sampling subset obtained was a more balanced dataset, effectively improving the robustness of the RF model. Additionally, Genetic Algorithm (GA) was employed for the parameter optimization of RF62.

The objective of clustering algorithms is to partition the data set into tight and similar clusters, with samples within each cluster being as similar as possible, while samples between different clusters have significant differences. Applied to risk assessment problems, the goal is to construct a sample set based on risk assessment indicators and use clustering algorithms to cluster samples with similar assessment indicators into one cluster, thereby dividing the sample set into different classes to achieve assessment level classification. In risk assessment, the similarity of assessment indicators refers to the proximity of indicator values. In this case, distance-based clustering algorithms are more suitable, and the K-means clustering algorithm is a commonly used distance-based clustering method. However, different indicators have different effects on the correctness of the output results, i.e., they have different weights. Therefore, risk assessment studies should also consider the influence of indicator weights on assessment results. This paper finally introduces the weighted K-means clustering algorithm to construct the risk assessment model. The clustering effect of the weighted K-means clustering algorithm heavily relies on whether an appropriate number of clusters <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> has been selected. Therefore, before clustering, this paper first determines the optimal number of clusters <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> through the elbow method66 combined with the silhouette coefficient method67.</p><p>The specific steps of the assessment model constructed in this paper are as follows:</p><p>Establish an assessment data set based on the constructed risk assessment system.

Figure 5 presents the correlation coefficient matrix of all indicators within the study area. The deeper the red color and the smaller the ellipse area, the stronger the positive correlation; the deeper the blue color and the smaller the ellipse area, the stronger the negative correlation. Conversely, lighter colors and larger ellipse areas indicate weaker correlations. The figure shows that there are complex interrelationships among the factors in the study area. Specifically, many factors are interrelated with one another, and each of them also exhibits significant correlations with other variables, demonstrating characteristics of \u201cinteraction effects\u201d and \u201cmulticollinearity.\u201d When a dataset contains multiple highly correlated features, it increases the risk of model overfitting and reduces model interpretability. Therefore, indicator optimization is necessary68. Given the intricate relationships among variables, correlation coefficients can be used as one method for screening, but they are insufficient for optimal indicator selection on their own. Thus, based on the feature importance derived from the Borderline-SMOTE improved GA-RF model, this study first identified a preliminary set of indicators. On this basis, irrelevant and redundant features were further removed using correlation analysis, and the final optimal indicator set was obtained for subsequent risk assessment research.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Pearson correlation coefficient matrix plot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feature datasets determination</emphasis></p><p>The indicator importance was calculated based on the constructed Borderline-SMOTE improved GA-RF model and sorted in descending order.

The results showed that the RF model achieved the highest accuracy, with an OOB_Score of 96.364%, when 33 features were included. At this point, the remaining 10 indicators were excluded. Additionally, from the perspective of multicollinearity, variables with significant correlations were sequentially eliminated based on importance ranking, retaining only the highly important indicators.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Indicator importance results chart.</p><p>Consequently, the final optimal indicator set comprises 17 indicators, including 1 target layer, 3 criterion layers, and 17 indicator layers, representing the risk assessment indicator system for corn borer disaster in Shandong Province, as illustrated in Fig. 7.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>Risk assessment system for corn borer in Shandong province.</p><p>The danger of disaster-causing factors: the disaster-causing factors refer to various pests and diseases that cause losses in grain crops, which are important risk assessment indicators.

The disaster-forming environmental factors in this study include precipitation at 20\u201320 h (Precipitation at 20\u201320 h: The total amount of precipitation accumulated from 20:00 on one day to 20:00 on the following day), sunshine duration (Sunshine duration: The total time during which direct solar irradiance equals or exceeds a threshold of 120 W/m\u00b2), wind direction of extreme wind speed (Wind direction of extreme wind speed: The direction from which the wind was blowing at the moment the extreme wind speed was recorded), number of days with daily precipitation \u2265 0.1 mm (Number of days with daily precipitation \u2265 0.1 mm: The total count of days within a period where the daily precipitation was 0.1 millimeters or more), amount of Potassium fertilizer converted (Amount of Potassium fertilizer converted: The quantity of various potassium fertilizers applied, standardized to its equivalent mass of the active component, potassium oxide (K2O)), minimum temperature (Minimum temperature: The lowest air temperature recorded during a given period), maximum daily precipitation (Maximum daily precipitation: The highest amount of precipitation recorded in a single day during the observation period), average maximum temperature (Average maximum temperature: The arithmetic average of the daily maximum temperatures over a specific period), extreme wind speed (Extreme wind speed: The highest instantaneous wind speed recorded during a given period, reflecting the peak gust intensity), maximum air pressure (Maximum air pressure: The highest atmospheric pressure value recorded within a specific period), average vapor pressure (Average vapor pressure: The mean partial pressure exerted by water vapor in the air over a defined period), and average relative humidity (Average relative humidity: The arithmetic average of the relative humidity readings over a specific period).</p><p>Disaster prevention and mitigation capacity: disaster prevention and mitigation capacity is agricultural production and socioeconomic factors that restrict and influence the risk of pests and diseases. The influencing indicators of disaster prevention and mitigation capacity include the total value of agricultural output (Total value of agricultural output: The total monetary value of all products from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery within a region during a specific period), GDP per capita (GDP per capita: The gross domestic product of a region divided by its total population), and effective irrigation area (Effective irrigation area: The area of cultivated land equipped with irrigation systems and capable of being irrigated under normal conditions).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model accuracy validation</emphasis></p><p>This study adopts a combined strategy of ablation experiments and comparative experiments to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different models under the specific data characteristics of this research. The ablation experiments are employed to assess the precision variations of the RF model before and after improvements. In the comparative experiments, mainstream classifiers such as AdaBoost69 and XGBoost70 are introduced as benchmarks, along with two oversampling techniques (ADASYN and SMOTE-ENN) for performance comparison. The evaluation metrics selected include Accuracy, F1_score, Out-of-Bag (OOB) score, and confusion matrix (Fig.  S3).</p><p>To enhance the robustness of the results, stratified 5-fold cross-validation is utilized, and the standard deviation and confidence interval of each metric are computed to reflect the stability of model performance.</p><p>For models that do not require sample balancing (RF, GA + RF, XGBoost, AdaBoost), stratified 5-fold cross-validation is directly applied to ensure that the class distributions of the training and validation sets in each fold remain consistent with the original dataset. For models requiring sample balancing (SMOTE + RF, SMOTE + GA + RF, ADASYN + GA + RF, SMOTE-ENN + GA + RF, Borderline-SMOTE + GA + RF), stratified 5-fold partitioning is first performed to maintain the class distribution consistency. Oversampling techniques (SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE-ENN) are then applied exclusively to the training sets, while the validation sets retain the original real data, thereby preventing synthetic samples from leaking into the validation process and avoiding overfitting. Accuracy and F1-score values for each model are calculated based on stratified 5-fold cross-validation.</p><p>Since the OOB score is an internal evaluation mechanism specific to the RF model and cannot be obtained through cross-validation, this study calculates the OOB score by averaging the results from five repeated runs. The evaluation metric values for each model are summarized, and the corresponding boxplots are presented as shown in the Fig. 8.</p><p>Fig. 8</p><p>Precision comparison of different schemes. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) are Accuracy, F1_score and OOB_score, respectively.

With the introduction of the SMOTE algorithm, these metrics improved by 13.87, 4.31, and 5.35%, respectively. When both GA and SMOTE were combined, the improvements over the original model reached 18.18, 9.42, and 10.55%, outperforming the application of either GA or SMOTE alone. The ADASYN algorithm improved performance by 18.25, 9.99, and 9.81%, respectively, over the original RF model, and by 8.02, 3.41, and 0.29% over the GA + RF model. After incorporating the SMOTE-ENN algorithm, the performance gains over the original model were 18.21, 10.56, and 10.95%, respectively, and 7.98, 3.98, and 1.43% over the GA + RF model. By introducing the Borderline-SMOTE algorithm, the model achieved improvements of 18.64, 9.11, and 11.93 compared to the original RF model.</p><p>These results indicate that integrating ADASYN, SMOTE, and GA algorithms can all effectively improve the accuracy of the RF model. This demonstrates that ADASYN and SMOTE algorithms are effective in addressing the issue of sample imbalance during the feature selection process for corn borer risk assessment, while the GA algorithm also significantly enhances model performance through parameter optimization. Although SMOTE-ENN generates minority class samples and filters noise through ENN, its more complex processing leads to higher computational and time costs, resulting in slightly lower accuracy improvements compared to Borderline-SMOTE in this task. Without considering time and computational costs, the combination of Borderline-SMOTE and GA optimization yields the highest model accuracy. Although models like XGBoost and AdaBoost generally hold potential advantages in many tasks, their performance in this study was limited by the lack of resampling to address data imbalance, which led to a bias toward the majority class and reduced the recognition ability for the minority class, ultimately resulting in lower accuracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Risk assessment and zoning of corn borer disaster in Shandong Province</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Indicator weight determination</emphasis></p><p>According to the steps of the cloud model method and Fig. 7, a hierarchical structure was established, including the target layer, criterion layer, and indicator layer.

By using the final cluster centroids as data, the bar charts for each class are plotted, as shown in Fig. 9.</p><p>Fig. 9</p><p>Clustering results. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) correspond to hazard, sensitivity, disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, and comprehensive assessment, respectively.</p><p>For hazard assessment and zoning, it can be visually observed that the changes in the frequency of moderate occurrence and light occurrence exhibit opposite trends among the different classes. This is because, under the condition of a fixed total frequency, if an area has a high frequency of moderate occurrence, then the frequency of light occurrence must be relatively low, thus indirectly confirming the logical consistency of the clustering results with real-world scenarios. According to the results of importance calculation and correlation coefficients, it is evident that the frequency of moderate occurrence has a significant impact on the occurrence of corn borer disasters. Moreover, as the frequency of moderate occurrence increases, the risk of disaster occurrence and the hazard level also increase.</p><p>For sensitivity assessment and zoning, although the maximum daily precipitation in the cluster 2 area is low, the precipitation at 20\u201320 h and the number of days with daily precipitation \u2265 0.1 mm are at a relatively high level. The \u201chigh frequency and low intensity\u201d precipitation feature ensures a long-term high humidity environment, which is very conducive to the growth and development of eggs and larvae of the corn borer. Previous studies have shown that corn borer eggs and early larvae are highly sensitive to environmental humidity, and high humidity can significantly increase egg hatchability and larval survival rates71,72, while also reducing the risk of premature desiccation and death. In addition, precipitation also plays a significant role in the growth status of host plants. Moderately frequent precipitation helps corn plants maintain vigorous growth, thereby providing more nutritional resources and feeding sites for corn borers, which indirectly promotes their population expansion73. Therefore, the precipitation characteristics in this region not only directly create a suitable microenvironment but also indirectly facilitate the large-scale occurrence of corn borer through their influence on the physiological status of the host plants. In addition to precipitation, other environmental indicators in this region, such as temperature and sunshine hours, also show relatively balanced and high levels. This multi-factor favorable natural background provides a good disaster-prone foundation for the stable development of the corn borer population. From the perspective of the combined effect, the synergistic effect between high humidity and suitable temperature may further enhance the promoting effect on corn borer outbreaks. Therefore, the environment in this area is a high sensitive area for corn borer occurrence. In the cluster 0 area, the precipitation at 20\u201320 h, the average maximum temperature, and the number of days with daily precipitation \u2265 0.1 mm were the highest among the groups. The warm climate and relatively humid air environment are also conducive to the reproduction of corn borer. At the same time, the extreme wind speed in this area also needs special attention, because it is an important factor in the migration of corn borer in adults. Therefore, this area is a relatively high sensitive area. In contrast, the distribution of indicators in the cluster 1 area was more balanced, but the overall value was relatively low. This indicates that the natural conditions in this area were relatively unfavorable to the reproduction of corn borer, and it was a moderate sensitive area for the corn borer occurrence. The sunshine duration and average maximum temperature in the cluster 3 area were the lowest, and the hatching rate of overwintering pupae of corn borer was relatively low. Therefore, this area belongs to the low sensitive area.</p><p>For disaster prevention and mitigation capacity assessment and zoning, the total value of agricultural output and effective irrigation area of cluster 3 area are the highest among the groups, while the GDP per capita is low. Agricultural production in the area is large but the economy is relatively underdeveloped and more dependent on agricultural income. Therefore, farmers in this area demonstrate a higher level of attention and emphasis on pest control and prevention, making it the area with the strongest capacity for corn borer control. In contrast, cluster 0 exhibits higher GDP per capita, total value of agricultural output, and effective irrigation area, indicating a relatively developed agricultural economy and higher socioeconomic status in the area. Consequently, the agricultural modernization level in the area is higher. Regarding pest control and prevention, farmers in this area also demonstrate a strong capacity to cope with pests, making it an area with relatively strong capacity in corn borer control. The results of cluster 2 and cluster 3 are similar, but the agricultural economy of the cluster 2 area is lower than cluster 3 area, and the social economy is lower than cluster 0 area. Overall, cluster 2 exhibits a moderate level of capacity in pest control and prevention. Cluster 4 has a relatively low total value of agricultural output and effective irrigation area, but the highest GDP per capita, and this cluster represents areas with relatively poor agricultural economy but high per capita income. Since agriculture is not the main development industry in this area, its capacity for pest control and prevention is relatively weak. Cluster 1 and cluster 4 exhibit similar characteristics, but cluster 1 shows greater disparities in agricultural and socioeconomic levels. Due to the lesser proportion of agricultural development in the industrial structure of this area, its capacity for pest control and prevention is the weakest.</p><p>Finally, according to the mechanism of natural disaster risk formation, the occurrence risk of corn borer disaster results from the comprehensive interaction of hazard, sensitivity, and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity. Therefore, this study establishes a comprehensive assessment datasets based on the assessment data of the 3 criteria layers.</p><p>Fig. 10</p><p>Risk zoning maps. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) correspond to hazard, sensitivity, disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, and comprehensive assessment, respectively. (The figure was generated using QGIS 3.34.13 software, with the URL link: <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/\">https://qgis.org/</url>).</p><p>According to the clustering results under the four scenarios, the risk levels were divided respectively, and the zoning results were obtained, as shown in Fig. 10. The distribution of hazard shows a clear spatial clustering phenomenon, with high risk areas primarily concentrated in the southwestern part of the study area, in Heze City. Relatively high risk areas are found in the northern cities of Yantai and Weihai. In contrast, the southeastern and central parts of the study area show medium to low risk zones, which is related to the relatively low historical pest occurrence frequency in these areas. This reflects significant spatial differences in disaster factor risks across the study area.</p><p>The sensitivity of the disaster-forming environments exhibits obvious regional variations. High sensitivity areas are distributed in Dezhou, Yantai, Dongying, Jining, Heze, and Weifang, located in the western and northwestern parts of the study area. These areas typically have more suitable temperatures and higher precipitation frequencies, with a long-standing warm and humid environment that favors the hatching and larval growth of the corn borer. The southeastern areas, such as Rizhao and Qingdao, show lower sensitivity, which is related to the relatively cooler climate and lower humidity conditions in these areas. The spatial pattern shows a decreasing trend from the northwest to the southeast.</p><p>Disaster prevention and mitigation capacity show spatial differences that are closely related to regional economic development levels and agricultural production conditions. Regions like Weifang and Jining demonstrate the highest disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, as these areas have a developed agricultural economy, widespread effective irrigation areas, and well-developed agricultural production technologies and infrastructure. In contrast, regions with lower disaster prevention and mitigation capacity are mainly concentrated in cities where economic development is dominated by non-agricultural industries or in areas with weak agricultural infrastructure, such as Zaozhuang, Rizhao, and Weihai. Spatially, the trend shows that the western and eastern coastal regions have stronger disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, while the central and southern regions are weaker.</p><p>The spatial distribution pattern of comprehensive risk shows a decreasing trend from the northwest to the southeast. Heze City emerges as the area with the highest comprehensive risk. Historically, Heze has experienced the highest degree and frequency of corn borer occurrence, leading to an increase in overwintering larval populations. Moreover, the large planting area and the presence of corn straw provide favorable conditions for overwintering larval survival. With long sunshine duration and high temperatures, the climatic conditions are conducive to the pupation of larvae into moths the following year. Consequently, this area is considered a high risk area for corn borer damage and should be regarded as the key defense area of Shandong Province. Conversely, Zibo City has the lowest risk. The frequency of corn borer occurrence is low, with small planting areas and low yields. The natural environment is not conducive to corn borer development, making it a low risk area for corn borer occurrence. Additionally, Dezhou and Weihai City are also high risk areas requiring heightened prevention and control measures. Yantai, Dongying, Binzhou, and Zaozhuang City are moderately high risk areas and should likewise take proactive preventive measures. Taian, Liaocheng, Weifang, and Jining City are considered moderate risk areas for corn borer occurrence, and the corn borer disaster is easily to occur if the conditions are suitable. Rizhao, Qingdao, Jinan, Linyi, and Zibo City are classified as low risk areas, being less susceptible to corn borer damage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Generalization of the assessment model</emphasis></p><p>The scientificity of the assessment model is the key to this study. In traditional risk assessment studies, when assessing the hazard of two areas, several hazard indicators are usually selected and the weight of the indicators is calculated. Then the weighted comprehensive analysis method is used to calculate the comprehensive assessment value of the two areas, representing the local hazard. The hazard levels are then classified using the natural breaks classification. This method ignores the characteristics of the disaster type to be assessed, so it is unreasonable in some cases. The following takes earthquake disaster as an example to prove the generalization and advantages of the model constructed in this paper.</p><p>As shown in Fig. 11A, in the hazard assessment of earthquake disasters, the assessment indicators include earthquake magnitude and frequency. The x-axis represents earthquake magnitude, with a weight of 0.6, while the y-axis represents earthquake frequency, with a weight of 0.4. Suppose area A occurred 8 earthquakes of magnitude 1 during the study period, while area B occurred 2 earthquakes of magnitude 5. By using Formula (4) to calculate the hazard, the hazard index for area A is 8 \u00d7 0.4 + 1 \u00d7 0.6 = 3.8, and for area B: 2 \u00d7 0.4 + 5 \u00d7 0.6 = 3.8. This indicates that the earthquake hazard of both areas is the same when using the weighted comprehensive analysis method. However, with each increase in magnitude, the amplitude of the earthquake increases by about 10 times, and the energy of the earthquake increases by about 31.6 times74,75. Therefore, although Region A has more frequent earthquakes, Region B has a higher earthquake energy density and destructiveness, making it more potentially hazardous. This contradicts the conclusion derived from the previous method, confirming that traditional risk assessment models simplify complex evaluation results into a single risk index or level, which leads to the loss of a significant amount of spatial information and details.</p><p>Fig. 11</p><p>Comparison chart of the evaluation results of the two methods in the hazard assessment of earthquake disasters. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) is the result of weighted comprehensive analysis method. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis>) is the result of our method.</p><p>A similar issue is encountered in the assessment of corn borer pest risk levels, where the classification of risk levels does not always correspond directly to actual yield losses. In fact, the yield loss caused by a severe, concentrated outbreak of corn borer is often much greater than the total loss caused by multiple instances of mild or localized pest outbreaks. This is because severe pest damage typically occurs during critical corn growth stages, causing irreversible damage to processes such as pollination and grain filling, while mild pest infestations, even if frequent, allow crops to self-regulate and recover to some extent. Additionally, traditional pest grading methods may focus more on occurrence frequency and coverage area, while overlooking the actual severity of the pest damage and its direct impact on yield, leading to a discrepancy between the risk assessment results and the actual crop losses.</p><p>Figure 11B shows the assessment results of the model constructed in this paper. It can be observed that the clustering algorithm separates A and C, B and D, and E into three clusters respectively. Cluster A and C represent areas with low earthquake magnitudes but high frequency, cluster B and D represent areas with low frequency but high earthquake magnitudes, and cluster E represents areas with both low earthquake magnitudes and frequency. Based on the characteristics of these clusters, cluster B and D are classified as high risk areas, cluster A and C as moderate risk areas, and cluster E as a low risk area. It can be seen that the approach adopted in this study clusters samples with similar indicator values into the same class, fully considering the spatial location information of different assessment indicators of the samples, thereby avoiding the problem of losing a significant amount of spatial information in the weighted comprehensive analysis method. The model is more reasonable and applicable to a wider range of scenarios, with stronger generalization. Moreover, the weighted K-means clustering algorithm also considers the influence of indicator weights on the clustering results, making the assessment results more accurate and mitigating the deficiencies of mathematical-statistical models to the greatest extent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reliability of clustering algorithm</emphasis></p><p>The core concept of the risk assessment model developed in this study is to categorize the disaster occurrence risks of various cities into different clusters using clustering algorithms, and to classify these clusters into different risk levels based on their characteristics. A weighted K-means algorithm was employed as the primary clustering method, considering the influence of indicator weights on the assessment results. However, under the same weighting conditions, it is still necessary to compare this method with other clustering algorithms to identify the optimal approach. Therefore, we selected the weighted agglomerative hierarchical clustering (weighted AHC) and weighted DBSCAN algorithms for comparison with the weighted K-means algorithm. The number of clusters in weighted AHC was set to be consistent with that of weighted K-means, using the \u201caverage\u201d linkage method. For weighted DBSCAN, the min_samples parameter was set to 1, and all distance computations were performed using the weighted Euclidean distance, with other parameters kept at their default values. The clustering performance was evaluated using Silhouette Coefficient, Calinski\u2013Harabasz Index, and Davies\u2013Bouldin Index. The experimental results are shown in the Table 5.</p><p>Table 5</p><p>Precision comparison of different clustering algorithms.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Model</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Silhouette coefficient</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Calinski-Harabasz</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Davies-Bouldin</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted AHC</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.5194</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">29.5823</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.8512</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted DBSCAN</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.3477</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">10.9801</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.2395</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted K-means</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.5332</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">33.3840</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.7506</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>It can be observed that, within the context of this dataset, the weighted K-means algorithm achieved the best clustering performance across all three evaluation metrics. In particular, it outperformed the weighted AHC and weighted DBSCAN algorithms in terms of cluster compactness and separation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Weighted K-means algorithm is more suitable for the risk assessment research presented in this study.</p><p>Fig. 12</p><p>k-value determination procedure. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) correspond to hazard, sensitivity, disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, and comprehensive assessment, respectively.</p><p>After determining the selected model, the performance of machine learning models still relies on the tuning of hyperparameters38, 39\u201340. Similarly, in the weighted K-means clustering algorithm, the number of clusters (k-value) directly determines both the quantity and quality of the resulting clusters, which has a direct impact on the risk zoning outcomes. An inappropriate k-value may lead to overfitting or underfitting, thereby affecting the clustering quality. Therefore, this study employs the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index to jointly determine the optimal k-value, as shown in Fig. 12.</p><p>First, the hazard assessment datasets were input into the three methods respectively, and the evaluation metrics under different k values (k = 1 ~ 10) were calculated. The results are shown in Fig. 12a. From the SSE curve, it can be seen that the error decreases rapidly before k = 4 and the decline slows when k \u2265 4, indicating that k = 4 is the \u201celbow point.\u201d At this point, the silhouette coefficient reaches a local maximum and the Davies-Bouldin index is minimized, suggesting that the clustering performance is optimal when k = 4. Therefore, the optimal number of clusters for hazard assessment is k = 4. Figure 12b shows the trend of K values for sensitivity assessment. The SSE curve declines significantly before k = 4 and flattens when k \u2265 7. Considering that the silhouette coefficient reaches its maximum and the Davies-Bouldin index is minimized at k = 4, it can be concluded that k = 4 is also the optimal number of clusters for sensitivity assessment. Figure 12c presents the clustering results for disaster prevention and mitigation capacity. The SSE curve shows the greatest variation between k = 4 and k = 6. Although the silhouette coefficient is highest at k = 2, such a small number of clusters is not practical. Taking into account the second-highest silhouette coefficient at k = 5 and the lowest Davies-Bouldin index, k = 5 is ultimately selected as the optimal number of clusters for disaster prevention and mitigation capacity. Figure 12d shows the results of the comprehensive risk assessment. The SSE curve has a clear inflection between k = 4 and k = 5. At k = 4, the silhouette coefficient is the highest and the Davies-Bouldin index is the lowest, indicating that the clustering performance is optimal. Therefore, the optimal number of clusters for comprehensive risk assessment is determined to be k = 4.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reliability of zoning results</emphasis></p><p>The data used in this study covers the years 2007\u20132010 and 2013\u20132019. To validate the reliability of the zoning results, relevant information from 2020 and beyond was consulted. According to the \u201cPest and Disease Information\u201d released by the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Bureau of Heze City in 2020 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://hznync.heze.gov.cn\">http://hznync.heze.gov.cn</url>), the average number of live pests detected per hundred corn plants through stem stripping was 42.3, an increase of 16% compared to the same period last year. The occurrence level of corn borers was classified as level 4, indicating a severe occurrence. Additionally, the forecast results from 2021 to 2023 also indicate severe occurrences. These findings are consistent with the assessment results of this study, verifying the reliability of the results obtained in this paper.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitations and broader implications of our work</emphasis></p><p>Although the model proposed in this paper addresses several limitations of traditional risk assessment approaches, it also introduces new complexities and challenges. In contrast to conventional supervised prediction models that require extensive labeled datasets, our unsupervised clustering-based risk assessment framework proves especially advantageous in data-limited settings. This is particularly relevant in many regions where long-term pest monitoring data are unavailable, but meteorological, agronomic, and socio-economic indicators can be accessed. This study therefore provides a practical solution for real-time risk assessment and spatial planning.</p><p>Moreover, the spatial heterogeneity of corn borer risk revealed in our model aligns with biological findings regarding the pest\u2019s temperature and humidity preferences. For instance, regions such as Heze and Dezhou are characterized by warm, humid conditions and dense crop residues\u2014ideal for overwintering and reemergence of corn borers. This supports previous ecological studies showing that corn borer population dynamics are heavily influenced by microclimatic and agronomic factors. By incorporating indicator weighting and spatial structure into the clustering process, our model avoids the shortcomings of traditional risk scoring methods\u2014namely, the oversimplification of diverse risk factors into a single composite index. This methodological innovation enables more interpretable and context-sensitive results, which can inform precision agriculture practices and policy design. From a methodological perspective, the framework can be extended to other agricultural pest or disease scenarios, especially when comprehensive risk assessment is needed without high-quality occurrence labels. Future work can explore integration with remote sensing data or real-time surveillance platforms to further enhance prediction and response capabilities.</p><p>However, the integration of multiple machine learning components inevitably increases the computational complexity of the model. To address the prevalent issue of class imbalance in pest datasets, we constructed a feature optimization model using Borderline-SMOTE to improve GA-RF, combined with Pearson correlation analysis to identify key influencing indicators. Subsequently, to overcome spatial information loss in traditional models, we introduced a weighted clustering algorithm to assess spatial risk levels. While this multi-step structure enhances accuracy and generalizability, it also leads to increased computational demands, particularly during large-scale applications. Algorithms such as Borderline-SMOTE, genetic algorithms, and random forests are computationally intensive, especially with high-dimensional data. In addition, the time complexity of K-means clustering rises significantly with increased data volume and the number of clusters, adding further computational burden. Compared to traditional weighted index approaches, the proposed method requires significantly more resources, potentially reducing practical efficiency when scaling up.</p><p>To mitigate these scalability challenges, particularly for national or continental applications, leveraging distributed computing architectures is a crucial next step. Cloud computing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), are exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. GEE\u2019s parallel processing capabilities, combined with its vast, readily accessible archive of global meteorological and remote sensing data, would not only drastically reduce the computational burden of our framework but also streamline the data acquisition process. By porting our model to such a platform, the intensive tasks of feature optimization and clustering on massive datasets become feasible, paving the way for large-scale, near-real-time risk assessment and monitoring.</p><p>Furthermore, while the cloud model method used for determining feature weights reduces subjectivity compared to direct expert scoring or AHP, it still relies on expert input to a certain degree. This introduces potential subjective bias in the weighting process. In future research, combining objective data-driven weight determination (e.g., entropy weighting, machine learning-based importance scoring) with expert knowledge may enhance the robustness and credibility of the risk assessment framework.</p><p>In summary, while our proposed method offers strong advantages in flexibility, interpretability, and biological relevance, there remains room for further improvement in computational efficiency, scalability, and weight objectivity, which we aim to address in future studies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>Against the backdrop of global food security being heavily impacted by crop pests, this study focused on corn borer and constructed a novel method for assessing and zoning corn borer disaster risks. Firstly, the Borderline-SMOTE enhanced GA-RF model and the Pearson correlation coefficient were jointly utilized to optimize the feature subset of corn borer disasters. Subsequently, considering the influence of both spatial location and weight of indicators on the assessment results, a risk assessment model based on weighted K-means clustering algorithm was proposed. Finally, combined with the theory of natural disaster risk, the spatial zoning of corn borer occurrence risk was realized by taking Shandong Province of China as the study area. The following valuable conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>The Borderline-SMOTE-GA-RF feature optimization model constructed in this study effectively addressed the problem of class imbalance in the corn borer sample set. Compared to the original RF model, the OOB_Score, Accuracy, and F1_Score improved by 18.64, 11.12, and 11.21% respectively, outperforming typical machine learning algorithms such as AdaBoost and XGBoost. Based on a large collection of indicator information, this model combined with the Pearson correlation coefficient, optimized 17 indicators under 3 criterion layers, establishing a corn borer risk assessment system in Shandong Province.</p><p>Compared with the classical weighted comprehensive analysis method, the weighted K-means risk assessment model constructed in this paper fully considers the spatial location information of assessment indicators and has better generalization. Taking the Shandong Province of China as the study area, the risk zoning of the corn borer disaster was realized by combining cloud model and risk assessment system. The results show that Heze, Dezhou, and Weihai City are high risk areas. In comparison, the risk of corn borer disasters occurring is higher in the southwestern and northern areas of Shandong Province, while the risk in the central and eastern areas of Shandong Province is lower. This conclusion is consistent with some publicly available data, indicating the reliability of the results.</p><p>This paper proposes a new risk assessment model based on the weighted K-means clustering algorithm, providing new insights for agricultural disaster zoning research. Meanwhile, this study is the first to establish a corn borer risk assessment system based on improved machine learning methods. The proposed model enables rapid and cost-effective delineation of corn borer risk zones, providing insights into the spatial distribution of risk levels and identifying high-risk areas for corn borer outbreaks in Shandong Province. This facilitates precise prevention and control in key regions. Moreover, the quantified importance of various driving factors influencing corn borer risks offers valuable references for future research by other scholars. Due to the difficulty in obtaining data, the assessment and zoning results of this study are at the sub-provincial city level, which is still not detailed enough. In future research, higher-resolution zoning will be achieved by combining small-scale data to assist relevant units in making more detailed decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors wish to thank Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs for arranging corn borer occurrence data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Subedi, B.

According to news originating from Braga, Portugal, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"The main purpose of this study was the development of a methodology to assess the potential impacts of forest fires on geoheritage through a systematic and practical approach. The proposed methodology was applied to the geoheritage of the Estrela UNESCO Global Geopark (UGGp) in Portugal, following a forest fire in August 2022 that affected approximately 15% of its geosites (22 out of 147).\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Erasmus+; European Commission; Foundation For Science And Technology. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Institute of Earth Sciences: \"A total of 20 geosites were selected for analysis, including eight directly impacted by the fire and 12 that remained unaffected. The assessment framework integrates vulnerability and hazard factors. Vulnerability was quantified based on two primary criteria: geosites value and their educational and touristic uses. Each criterion was operationalized through defined parameters and indicators, supported by standardized guidelines for evaluation. Forest fire hazard data were obtained from the Portuguese Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests (ICNF). The degradation risk was calculated as a function of these two factors. The results indicate that the highest vulnerability level identified was 'low,' signifying the absence of substantial loss in scientific value. However, discernible impacts on cultural, scenic and ecological values, and on educational/touristic uses were observed across most geosites. The maximum degradation risk was classified as 'medium,' suggesting that the predominant granite and glacial landforms within the study area exhibit a relatively high degree of resilience to forest fire-induced damage.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The findings underscore the importance of implementing targeted management strategies to mitigate the impacts of forest fires within the Estrela UGGp. Moreover, the methodology offers a transferable framework for geoheritage degradation risk assessment, which could be applied in diverse contexts to further enhance the understanding and conservation of geoheritage.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessment of forest fires impacts on geoheritage: A study in the Estrela UNESCO Global Geopark, Portugal.

Millions of trees knocked down by Hurricane Helene last year combined with long stretches of dry weather this spring are making for a long and active fire season in the Carolinas, North Carolina State University forestry and environmental resources professor Robert Scheller said. \"Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,\" Scheller said. \"Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.\" </p><p>Both South Carolina and North Carolina have issued statewide bans on outdoor burning. North Carolina fires Mandatory evacuations continue for about 165 properties in parts of Polk County in western North Carolina, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon. Three fires burned at least 7.5 square miles (19.5 square kilometers) in the county and the two larger blazes were completely uncontained, Cannon said in a social media update Monday morning. The Black Cove Fire, one of the larger ones, was moving toward neighboring Henderson County, Cannon said. Kim Callaway, who lives near one of the evacuated areas in Polk County, has prepared her home, WLOS-TV reported. \"We've already actually evacuated everything that we thought that was important,\" Callaway said. \"And now we're just staying at the house and trying to do what we can to get our house prepared if the firemen need to show up and hold the line.\" A downed power line sparked the Black Cove Fire, but the causes of the other two fires in Polk County were under investigation, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Jeremy Waldrop. A number of other wildfires burning across the state including one that damaged 500 vehicles at a salvage yard in Burke County, officials said. South Carolina fires Two fires in the South Carolina mountains have led Gov. Henry McMaster to declare a state of emergency. One fire was in Table Rock State Park in Pickens County and the other was on Persimmon Ridge in Greenville County. Winds and difficult mountainous terrain allowed blazes to grow, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. The Table Rock Fire expanded to more than 2 square miles (5.3 square kilometers), including several hundred acres that firefighters intentionally burned to try to contain the flames, officials said. The Persimmon Ridge Fire, which started Saturday, spread to more than 1.25 square miles (3.2 square kilometers) despite many dozens of water drops, the commission said. Human activity ignited both the Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires. No injuries had been reported, and while no structures were imminently threatened, voluntary evacuations of about 100 homes remained in place. How a September hurricane is creating March fires Scheller, the North Carolina State University professor, predicted this busy fire season if the region saw dry weather following Helene. Scientists saw something similar in 2022 when a fire burned more than 51 square miles (133 square kilometers) of timberland in the Florida Panhandle. The Bertha Swamp Road Fire almost directly followed the eye pattern from 2018's Hurricane Michael and the fallen pine trees left behind. Pines and their waxy needles dry out and become very flammable, Scheller said. The fallen trunks can also block roads and paths used to fight fires, experts said. The last ingredient to fuel wildfires is dry weather. Despite recent rain, the Carolinas are undergoing an extreme drought, according to federal monitors. The common denominator for many fires on the East Coast is human activity, whether people burn debris, light a campfire that isn't well watched or toss out cigarette, Scheller said. And more people living next to areas that can burn make fires a bigger threat, he said. New Jersey fire A forest fire burning in New Jersey's million-acre Pinelands region was 100% contained on Monday morning, the New Jersey Forest Fire Services said in a post on X. The fire was first spotted Saturday and burned through about 3.5 square miles (5.8 kilometers). That blaze led authorities to evacuate two campgrounds in Wharton State Forest, officials said. The cause was under investigation. Fire forecast A front moving off the East Coast brought rain and more humidity to the area, helping firefighters Monday. But not much rain fell and temperatures are expected to get warmer and the air drier as the week goes on, likely meaning another round of wildfires unless people follow burn bans and fire safety. \"It is absolutely paramount that folks respect the statewide ban on all open burning,\" North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Philip Jackson. said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>(New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection via AP) A firefighter looks on as the California Branch wildfire burns Saturday, March 22, 2025 in New Jersey's Wharton State Forest.

He and his team have investigated some of the most devastating wildfire disasters of the last 20 years, from the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado to the Camp Fire, which destroyed Paradise, California. Alex and his team used these investigations to learn about how fire moves through a community, find vulnerabilities and evaluate evacuation procedures. Using these investigations, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, Alex led the effort to create practical guidance for saving lives during fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recognition of his impact, Alex has been named an honoree of the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal, which recognizes exceptional government employees. The award, commonly known as the Sammies and often called the Oscars of public service, is presented by the Partnership for Public Service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To celebrate, we caught up with Alex to ask a few questions about his career and some of the most impactful findings from his wildfire research.</p><p>What does a fire protection engineer do?</p><p>Fire protection engineering is only about 100 years old. The field has two primary goals: enhancing life safety and reducing property losses from fire.</p><p>Historically, the profession has focused on fire inside buildings. But the problem of outdoor fires is escalating rapidly. Wildfires are becoming larger and more intense, so they have a larger impact on life safety and infrastructure.</p><p>What's behind this increase in wildfire danger?</p><p>There are a few reasons. Occasional small fires are healthy. They clear out the dry leaves and dead wood. But for over three-quarters of a century in the U.S., we tended to put out all forest fires early. That policy resulted in an extensive buildup of material ready to burn. And that, together with droughts and other environmental conditions, is now creating explosive fire behavior.</p><p>But that's not the whole story. We're also building more homes in and near forested areas. These areas are called the wildland urban interface (WUI). And they are our main concern.</p><p>How has wildfire research changed during your career?</p><p>As wildfires have gotten larger, we've needed to change our approach from actively fighting the fire to reducing the hazards ahead of time and having an evacuation plan.</p><p>When the town of Paradise, California, was hit by a fire in 2018, 20,000 structures were exposed at the same time. There aren't 20,000 fire engines in the entire state of California. Actively fighting a fire that large is unrealistic.</p><p>How is fire different from other types of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or hurricanes?</p><p>Most of my work has been about studying fires after they happened. We want to know what went wrong and find the success stories, so we can learn from these tragedies and avoid repeating mistakes.</p><p>There are a few unique challenges to investigating fires compared to other natural disasters. For one thing, fire makes more fire. Other disasters don't self-propagate. Hurricanes don't make more hurricanes; tornadoes don't make tornadoes.</p><p>Another challenge is that firefighters save structures during the event. That makes it really hard to know: Did a home survive because of the way it was built, or did it survive because it was defended by a firefighter?</p><p>A third fundamental difference is that the exposures are extremely local. The heat in one spot could easily be one hundred times higher than a spot just five feet away. That's really different from, say, an earthquake, where all the buildings are struck in more or less the same way.</p><p>What matters when it comes to protecting your home against wildfires?</p><p>You and your neighbors have to deal with two fundamental challenges: embers and flames.</p><p>Embers can be a problem as they can cause ignitions inside or outside of a structure. Embers can be very small or larger than the size of my fist. During a severe wildfire, your home may be bombarded by literally a million embers, so it's important to seal off your home to prevent them from getting inside. One example is the garage door trim. If the trim doesn't connect with the floor, embers go right in that little gap, start a fire in the garage, and burn your house down.</p><p>We have identified more than 40 similar potential ember vulnerabilities for houses. You have to deal with all of them. With that many embers, they're going to find that weak spot.</p><p>The second part is the flames. The most effective way to prevent flames from spreading is to get rid of the fuel and remove that exposure. For a fire protection engineer, anything that can burn is considered fuel. Removing a fuel is straightforward, but relocating it can be tricky. Some fuel, like sheds, RVs, boats and wood piles, are easily movable. These items should be moved further away from homes. Distance is the most effective way to prevent fire from spreading. What we absolutely do not want is residents moving fuels away from their own homes and placing them near their neighbors' houses. This is a very common scenario in high-density construction. When this happens, we are solving one problem but creating another.</p><p>Other fuels, like your neighbor's house, are immovable. That's when it's important to use \"fire hardening.\" That involves steps like installing fire-resistant siding and windows.</p><p>But this has to be done at the community level. If you do all the preparations on your parcel and your neighbor does nothing, and your homes are less than 25 feet apart, you're going to be very lucky if your house survives.</p><p>What are some of the key things you've learned about wildfire evacuation and sheltering?</p><p>After someone reports a forest fire to 9-1-1, it could easily take two hours to fully evacuate a small town. That means if the fire can get to the community in less than two hours, you will not have enough time to get the people out. In that scenario, ordering an evacuation can be very dangerous. When cars are stuck in traffic trying to escape, those cars can be overrun by fire, causing fatalities.</p><p>We recently updated a report called ESCAPE that helps the decision makers fire chiefs, city officials and law enforcement plan for these no-notice or limited-notice fires. The report helps you figure out if you're going to have enough time to evacuate your community. It also helps you plan for what to do when there isn't time for a full evacuation. In those cases, we want to bring people to open spaces nearby such as golf courses or big parking lots to serve as Temporary Fire Refuge Areas. These areas don't guarantee safety, but it's better to be in an open space than to be trapped in your car or home.</p><p>The key idea behind ESCAPE is to be ready ahead of time. If you're not prepared, it will be very dangerous. You have to do the training, educate the public, work with mutual aid, label the Temporary Fire Refuge Areas, do drills, collect the information and work with your other jurisdictions so that it's all connected. It's impossible to do all this work when a fire is approaching.</p><p>It seems like a critical part of your work is not only doing the research, but also telling local fire officials and the public about it. How do you balance those two responsibilities?</p><p>If we do research and file it away, it doesn't do anything. It is absolutely critical to make sure that we translate the science into readily understandable material. For example, our full report on the Camp Fire is 1,000 pages long to date. To make it easier to use, we distilled our advice for evacuation and shelter into a 169-page report, which can teach people the core ideas, and they can refer back to the longer documents to learn more. That was still a little too much, so we simplified that further into a free online training tool that can teach you the core ideas in three hours.</p><p>It's up to us to make sure that the science is usable, and we're always searching for ways to make our findings more accessible.</p><p>You've been studying wildfires for more than 20 years. What has driven you to work so hard at this problem for decades?</p><p>It's not an easy thing to witness a destroyed community. When I go out and see the devastation, and I know I can do something about it, that's the incentive for me to do the work that I do.</p><p>There's a great opportunity here at NIST, not just to do science but to have an impact on people's lives.</p><p>Is there any advice you have for young people who are thinking about going into wildfire research?</p><p>I think this is the largest fire problem for the next generation. There is at least a generation if not two worth of high impact work to be done here.</p><p>Wildfire used to be a problem only for Western states. It's no longer a Western problem. This year, we've had fires in South Carolina all the way to north of Boston, and in some cases, 100 fires at once. The bad news is that the East is even less prepared; they don't have the infrastructure, the experience or the building codes. The good news is that we can leverage the knowledge from previous fires to prepare.</p><p>What has been the biggest factor in completing this important work?</p><p>We had the help of many, many people who made this research possible. Over the years, we have had hundreds and hundreds of external collaborations that have helped us re-create these catastrophic events so that we can learn from them. We've also had a lot of support internally at NIST to create our wildfire research group and create high-impact case studies, laboratory experiments, reports and online tools. It has really been a team effort.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127189441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2H-WG53-RRMS-P48V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 16, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This study conceptualizes transmission lines as functionally critical infrastructure and develops a four-dimensional vulnerability assessment framework encompassing Danger, Susceptibility, Resistance, and Recoverability, taking into account natural environmental conditions, human disturbances, grid operational states, and emergency response capabilities. Distinct from conventional classification methods that primarily rely on structural topology or subjective judgment, this study adopts a hazard index\u2013based approach and introduces an objective weighting mechanism using the entropy method to quantitatively evaluate and classify indicators across the four dimensions. A case study of 500\u00a0kV transmission lines in Henan Province, China, reveals that the composite vulnerability index of the province\u2019s critical power infrastructure reaches 57.2, indicating a high level of vulnerability. Among the transmission towers, 19.8% are classified at the \u201cHigher\u201d level and 40.6% at the \u201cHigh\u201d level. Considerable variation in Recoverability among towers significantly influences the overall vulnerability assessment results. Moreover, the distribution of susceptibility to various hazards and accidents shows strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity, closely related to seasonal factors and tower locations. Based on these findings, targeted strategies are proposed from the perspectives of line inspection and differentiated management, providing technical support for enhancing power grid resilience and improving disaster response efficiency.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Although the large-scale interconnection of power grids has achieved a wider range of optimal resource allocation, it has also reduced the safety and stability of the system, with widespread power outages caused by localized failures occurring multiple times1,2. In recent years, earthquakes, rain, snow, freezing weather, rainstorms, typhoons, and other natural disasters around the world, as well as intentional or unintentional external damage are threatening the stable operation of power grid transmission lines, even leading to large-scale power outages and other accidents, causing serious economic losses and social impact. For example, on July 13, 2019, a transformer fire caused a massive power outage in Midtown and the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, U.S., with nearly 70,000 customers affected; the destruction of critical infrastructure and power disruptions in Ya\u2019an, Sichuan, China in 2013 and Wenchuan, Sichuan, China in 2008 due to earthquakes, and the massive power outage in southern China in 2008 due to severe weather caused by freezing rain and snow. In a comprehensive analysis of the above power emergencies, the initial cause is mostly the damage to the grid system by external factors, which leads to the unstable operation of the grid and thus causes serious socio-economic losses3, 4\u20135. Therefore, it is crucial to design a comprehensive vulnerability assessment method to evaluate the safety risks of the grid in the context of natural disasters and external damage, and to develop targeted vulnerability reduction measures for the assessment results.</p><p>The vulnerability analysis of the grid was first proposed by Petroianu et al. in 1974, but due to the small scale of the grid at that time, the vulnerability analysis of the grid did not receive sufficient attention. With the increasing scale and complexity of power grids, the consequences of power grid accidents have become more and more serious, and the vulnerability of power grids in their own structure and operation state has drawn people\u2019s attention again, A. A Found reintroduced the concept of vulnerability in 1994, used the transient energy function to analyze the vulnerability of power grids, and made it a new element of power system dynamic safety assessment6. Subsequently, scholars worldwide initiated research on vulnerability assessment in the power sector. Some researchers proposed a vulnerability assessment method based on cascading indices and spectral graph metrics, which involves calculating and comparing these indices to rank transmission lines under different contingency scenarios7,8.</p><p>According to the different research contents, the research on vulnerability in the field of electric power can be divided into three categories.</p><p>(1) Technical vulnerability assessment: Also known as electrical vulnerability, this method analyzes the power system\u2019s structure and operational mode9 based on the grid\u2019s topology and system operating conditions. Depending on the research perspective, technical vulnerability in power grids can be classified into structural vulnerability10, state vulnerability, and a comprehensive vulnerability assessment that integrates both perspectives11, 12\u201313.</p><p>Grid structural vulnerability assessment focuses on the tendency of a grid system to fail to maintain its topological integrity and normal operation after a certain unit or units exit due to external disturbances or failures in the system, and analyzes grid resilience from the perspective of the importance of a node or branch in the grid structure. For a particular grid, its network structure is unique, and therefore, structural vulnerability is a reflection of the inherent vulnerability of the grid14,15. Complex network-based research methods are the mainstream approach to assessing the structural vulnerability of the grid16,17. The grid state vulnerability assessment focuses on the tendency of the electrical parameters showing the system operating state to change abnormally and approach a critical value when a fault occurs in the system, thus making the grid unable to continue to provide services, and analyzing the grid\u2019s ability to resist faults and disturbances from the operating state5. With the in-depth study of grid vulnerability, some scholars believe that the analysis model considering only structural vulnerability ignores the state parameters in operation, and the analysis method considering only state vulnerability ignores the importance of the unit in the grid structure, and both analysis and assessment methods have certain shortcomings18,19. The assessment methods of grid vulnerability gradually develop from single attribute vulnerability assessment to integrated vulnerability assessment combining structural vulnerability and state vulnerability20, 21, 22\u201323.</p><p>(2) Physical Vulnerability Assessment: For components or infrastructure in the grid, the risk of accidents such as insulation degradation, transmission line, and facility damage due to external influences (natural disasters, climatic factors, human damage) is analyzed for these elements8,24. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) jointly developed the VRAP (Vulnerability Risk Analysis Program) in 1997, which is an early application of physical vulnerability assessment for power facilities. The practicality of vulnerability assessment was subsequently optimized in 2002 with the promulgation of the Draft Methodology for Vulnerability Assessment of Power System Infrastructure. Since then, scholars have begun to focus on such assessment methods, Kang L et al. analyzed the vulnerability of grid infrastructure when it is affected by external factors through a risk assessment approach, and proposed a model of joint cooperation between enterprises and the government to assess25. Baiardi F et al. used hierarchical analysis to assess the vulnerability of critical infrastructures in the event of an attack using power equipment as an example26. Wang Yujie et al. used simulation modeling to assess the physical vulnerability of the Yunnan power grid by focusing on the impact of geological disasters on power grid towers27.</p><p>(3) Emergency system vulnerability: Analyze the response and recovery capacity of the power emergency management system in the face of accident hazards. At present, there are few studies on emergency vulnerability in the field of electric power, and most of the existing studies are conducted from two aspects: vulnerability of the emergency system and vulnerability of emergency capability. Cheng Zhengang et al. constructed an assessment index of the vulnerability of the electric power emergency system from nine aspects, including the legal basis and organizational structure28. Zhu Weidong constructed an evaluation index system for the vulnerability of emergency management capability of nuclear power plant safety accidents from the attack-defense perspective29.</p><p>In summary, compared with existing studies, this paper takes into account the grid\u2019s ability to resist disturbances and recover from disasters while considering the degree of disturbances and impacts on the grid from a safety risk perspective, and analyzes the grid and its line vulnerability qualitatively and quantitatively using the entropy weight method and the hazard index method, which qualitatively indicates the assignment criteria and vulnerability level levels of each index, and quantitatively is a method of obtaining and analyzing safety vulnerability evaluation data using GIS software, which is combined with the entropy weight method to calculate the grid safety vulnerability level. A 500 kV transmission line in Henan Province was selected for case study, and from the perspective of line operation and inspection and emergency repair, targeted countermeasure suggestions were given for different safety vulnerability characteristics and levels, with better identification capability and higher identification accuracy for transmission towers and line vulnerability levels, providing a more accurate basis for the development and implementation of measures to ensure grid operation and reduce grid vulnerability.</p><p>To achieve a scientifically sound assessment of power grid security vulnerability, this study designs the research process as illustrated in Fig. 1, following the logical sequence outlined below: First, based on the theory of system vulnerability, the study defines a four-dimensional framework\u2014Danger, Susceptibility, Resistance, and Recoverability\u2014to establish the theoretical foundation. Second, an evaluation index system is constructed to ensure that the four dimensions are measurable and comparable. Third, the hazard index method is applied to assign values to the indicators, and the entropy weight method is employed to determine the weights, thereby enhancing objectivity and comparability among the indicators. Fourth, the DSRR comprehensive vulnerability assessment model is developed to map the indicators to a composite index. Finally, an empirical case study is conducted on the 500 kV transmission lines in Henan Province to test the model\u2019s applicability and assess indicator variability. Each phase builds on the previous one in a logically progressive manner, from theoretical construction to empirical analysis, forming a complete and coherent cycle that ensures the vulnerability assessment results are both theoretically grounded and practically valid.Fig. 1</p><p>Technical roadmap for grid safety vulnerability assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Method</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Entropy method</emphasis></p><p>The entropy method determines the weights based on the information utility value of each index. The concept of entropy originates from physics and represents the degree of disorder of the system, and it is believed in information theory that the higher the entropy of information, the lower its usable value30. The weights derived using the entropy method reflect the extent to which a given factor contributes to variations among different evaluation targets. For example, when the transmission line spans a small area, the climatic conditions are nearly identical, resulting in minimal differences in their impact on various transmission towers. However, even within a small area, road traffic conditions can vary significantly, leading to notable differences in their influence on transmission towers. Consequently, when applying the entropy method, the weight of road traffic factors will far exceed that of climatic conditions.</p><p>The entropy method plays a pivotal role in the assessment of power grid safety vulnerability, particularly in its ability to achieve objective weighting, quantify indicator differentiation, and integrate the influence of multiple factors. By calculating the information entropy of each indicator, it determines weights scientifically, avoids subjective biases, emphasizes the impact of key indicators, and downplays less critical factors, thereby constructing a comprehensive vulnerability index. Moreover, the entropy method dynamically captures the spatial and temporal variations in vulnerability, providing robust data support for the assessment results. This approach facilitates the identification of highly vulnerable regions and components, offering a reliable foundation for optimizing power grid layout, designing protective strategies, and ensuring efficient resource allocation31. Thus, the vulnerability results calculated using the entropy method effectively reflect the relative vulnerability levels among different objects within the study system. The determination of indicator weights using the entropy method involves the following steps:</p><p>(1) Construction of the original evaluation matrix.</p><p>For the studied of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">m</emphasis> transmission towers (i = 1, 2, \u2026, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">m</emphasis>), suppose it has <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> sets of evaluation indicators (j = 1, 2, \u2026n) and let the assigned data of indicator  of  be .

This method assigns values to indicators by grading the status of stored material types, safety devices and measures to obtain scores for the corresponding indices, so that data of different orders of magnitude can be graded and then assigned to achieve a dimensionless processing of indicators.</p><p>To achieve dimensionless processing of different indicators, the hazard index method mainly adopts two types of scoring approaches: (1) linear normalization, which is suitable for continuous variables, and (2) graded assignment, which is suitable for discrete variables with national standards or empirical classification criteria.</p><p>For continuous variables, the scoring formula is expressed as:7where  is the hazard index score of the -th evaluation object for the -th indicator,  is the raw data value, and  and  are the reference maximum and minimum values of the indicator.  and  represent the upper and lower bounds of the score, which are uniformly set to 100 and 10 in this study to ensure consistency across indicators. For indicators with clearly defined grading standards (such as tower-to-road distance, soil pH value, air quality index, etc.), a stepwise assignment method is adopted. Based on relevant standards or literature, interval thresholds are defined and fixed scores are assigned accordingly.</p><p>Due to the different units of the evaluation indicators, it is necessary to perform dimensionless processing before calculation. In this paper, the hazard index method is used for dimensionless treatment of each indicator. The raw data of the indicators in this paper differ greatly in magnitude; for example, the raw data of the distance indicator ranges from tens to thousands of meters, while the temperature indicator is nearly within the same order of magnitude. If the range method were used, the dispersion degree of the distance index would be much larger than that of the temperature index, leading to the failure of the temperature index in the evaluation. Therefore, compared to the range method, the hazard index method is more suitable for this paper.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power grid safety vulnerability assessment model</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Construction of evaluation index system</emphasis></p><p>McEntire (2001) states that vulnerability is determined by the extent to which the components of a disaster include risk, susceptibility, resistance, and recoverability. Risk and susceptibility are summarised as adverse factors, while resistance and recoverability are summarised as capacity factors33,34. The current research on vulnerability in the field of electric power is divided into technical vulnerability, physical vulnerability and emergency vulnerability. To differentiate from technical vulnerability, this paper defines grid safety vulnerability as \"the degree to which transmission lines (including towers) are vulnerable to loss of power system functions and adverse impacts on society due to insufficient structural strength or emergency recovery capabilities in the face of natural disasters and human damage\u201d. This concept emphasizes the outstanding characteristics of four aspects of the safety vulnerability of power grid: (1) Danger: the possibility and severity of damage to the physical structure of power grid caused by natural disasters and man-made damage; (2) Susceptibility: the scope and degree of influence after the occurrence of power grid accident; (3) Resistance: the resistance of internal factors such as the structural strength of the power grid and the current operating state to external influences; (4) recoverability: the emergency repair and recovery ability of the power grid. Selecting the index elements according to the four aspects of \u201cdanger\u201d, \u201csusceptibility\u201d, \u201cresistance\u201d and \u201crecoverability\u201d is the key to building the evaluation index system using the safety vulnerability model. Thus, we call it the DSRR model, which systematically reflects an analytical view of the relationship between environmental and human systems. The indicators in these four aspects each influence the grid\u2019s safety vulnerability from the perspectives of both \u201coffense\u201d and \u201cdefense\u201d. Specifically, danger and susceptibility are the attack factors of vulnerability and have a positive correlation with the safety vulnerability of the power grid. Danger represents the extent to which the power grid is affected by natural disasters and other external factors. Susceptibility represents the impact of the accident on society. The deeper the impact of the accident, the larger the scope of impact, the lower the social acceptance. It can be inferred that the higher the danger and susceptibility, the higher the safety vulnerability of the power grid. Resistance and recoverability are the defense factors of vulnerability and are negatively related to the safety vulnerability of the power grid. Resistance represents the ability of the transmission line itself to resist external influences, and recoverability represents the ability of emergency repair and recovery after the power grid accident. The higher the resistance and recoverability, the lower the vulnerability. The relationship between them is shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2</p><p>Framework of power grid safety vulnerability assessment index system.</p><p>(1) Danger index elements.</p><p>Danger index elements are used to characterize the degree of external impact on transmission lines. It mainly refers to the external pressure caused by natural disasters, environment and human activities on the tower and line. According to the analysis of power grid safety vulnerability factors, natural disasters affecting the safety vulnerability of transmission lines mainly include wind damage, lightning, rain and snow freezing, pollution flashovers, floods, etc. Other external damages include theft, mechanical touch, and tree crossing.

The susceptibility index element is used to characterize the severity of the consequences of a power grid accident and the degree of harm that affects society. The damage caused by a power grid accident affects the life of the residents on the one hand and the production and operation of the local economy on the other. The higher the voltage level, the greater the loss of electrical load caused by the accident. Therefore, this paper takes the degree of grid disaster impact as the first level index of the susceptibility assessment index system and extracts three grid susceptibility index elements by analyzing the susceptibility factors and using the index system construction method, as shown in Table 2.Table 2</p><p>Susceptibility index elements of the power grid.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"344\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"280\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Primary index</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Secondary indicators</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Disaster impact degree</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">GDP of cities receiving electricity</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Population density of cities receiving electricityPopulation density at the location of the tower</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Voltage level</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>(3) Resistance index elements.</p><p>The resistance index element is used to represent the physical property of the tower and its ability to defend against disasters. It mainly refers to the resistance of the type and current state of the tower to external pressure. Transmission poles and towers can be distinguished according to materials, functions, and insulator suspension methods. Different types of transmission poles and towers have different design strengths, and their resistance to disasters and external forces will naturally vary. At the same time, under the influence of the surrounding environment, there is corrosion, and uneven stress leading to aging and wear of accessories, which will affect the strength of the tower itself, and thus affect its ability to resist external pressure. Therefore, this paper selects tower classification, tower strength, topographic relief, and line characteristics as the primary index elements for resistance evaluation. Through the analysis of safety vulnerability factors and the construction method of the index system, 10 secondary index elements such as function classification, voltage level, service, life, and soil PH are extracted, as shown in Table 3.Table 3</p><p>Resistance index elements of the power grid.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Indicator classification</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Primary index</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Secondary indicators</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tower type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Tower classification</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Materials used for tower</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Function classification</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Insulator suspension mode</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tower status</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Tower strength</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">service length</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Soil PHAir pollution degree</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Average annual air humidity</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Topographic relief</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The elevation difference between towers</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Line characteristics</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Line corner</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Line span</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>(4) Recoverability index elements.</p><p>The recoverability index element is used to represent the emergency repair and recovery ability after the accident, and it is the social level\u2019s resistance to the power grid accident.

After scoring the corresponding secondary indicators for each transmission tower, the entropy method can be employed to determine the weight of each indicator. The weighted average of the secondary indicators is then calculated, which yields the score for each primary indicator. Based on these scores, a corresponding analysis can be provided.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Calculation and analysis of danger index</emphasis></p><p>(1) Wind damage.</p><p>There are three secondary indicators of wind damage, the annual average extreme wind speed, the annual average wind speed, and the angle between the line and the dominant wind direction. The first two can be obtained directly from the software output results. The angle between the line and the dominant wind direction can be calculated by the following formula.16where,  is the angle between the direction of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>-th transmission line and the dominant wind direction,  is the direction of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>-th transmission line, and  is the dominant wind direction of the position of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>-th transmission tower. Since the angle between the wind direction and the line cannot be greater than 90 degrees, when  is more than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees,  is equal to 180\u2013; and when  is more than 180 degrees and less than 360 degrees,  is equal to 360 -, repeat the above operation until  is less than 90 degrees. After obtaining the scores of three secondary indicators, the entropy weight method is used to determine the weights of each secondary indicator as 0.01, 0.03, 0.96. See Fig. 16 for the scores and weighted comprehensive scores of all secondary indicators.Fig. 16</p><p>Wind disaster danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>From the analysis of weighted calculation results, it can be seen that the dispersion degree of extreme wind speed and average annual wind speed scores of the indicators is relatively low, that is, the difference between these two indicators on the danger of transmission towers is small. However, the scattered degree of the included angle score between wind direction and line direction is large, which has a great impact on the relative vulnerability of each transmission line. On the whole, the transmission towers with \u201chigh\u201d relative danger are mainly distributed in the east section of the transmission line. The line trend has a large angle with the local annual dominant wind direction, which is more vulnerable to the impact of wind.</p><p>(2) Damage caused by thunder.</p><p>By calculation, the weights of thunderstorm day, conductivity and altitude are 0.04, 0.88 and 0.08 respectively. The conductivity index scores have a large dispersion, which brings a large difference in the danger of each transmission tower. At the same time, due to the low conductivity of most soil in the area where the line passes, the lightning danger of the transmission tower is greatly improved. According to the classification of danger in Table 6, most of the lightning danger is classified as \u201chigh\u201d or above, the results are shown in Fig. 17.Fig. 17</p><p>Thunderstorm danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(3) Ice damage.</p><p>Through calculation, the weights of the average wind speed in winter and spring, the dominant wind direction angle in winter and spring, the coldest month temperature, the temperature in winter and spring, and the humidity in winter and spring are 0.01, 0.3, 0, 0.69, and 0 respectively after the weights with the order of magnitude below 10\u20133 are reset to zero. On the whole, the icing danger of the west section of the line is \u201chigh\u201d or above, showing a trend of high in the west and low in the east (As shown in Fig. 18). According to the analysis of the GIS map of the line, the low temperature in the west section is mainly caused by the fact that the west section mainly crosses wide areas such as farmland, and the east section mainly passes through dense urban areas. At the same time, such geographical distribution also leads to higher average wind speed in winter and spring in non-urban areas, It further aggravates the icing danger of transmission lines in non-urban areas. It is consistent with the historical data of ice disasters and accidents in non-urban areas, which proves the effectiveness of the analysis. On this basis, the greater the angle between the line and the dominant wind in winter and spring, the higher the danger of icing.Fig. 18</p><p>Ice danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(4) Flooding.</p><p>The weights of extreme precipitation, annual precipitation and distance from water system are 0.08, 0.02 and 0.9 respectively. Affected by the rise of river water level in the rainy season, the transmission towers close to the water system are more vulnerable to flooding. There are three transmission towers within 200 m from the water system, but the average distance is more than 150 m. The overall danger to flooding is at a \u201clow\u201d level, as shown in Fig. 19.Fig. 19</p><p>Flooding danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(5) Pollution flashover.</p><p>The weights of population density and distance from pollution source are 0.3 and 0.7 respectively, and the dispersion degree of other indicators is relatively low, which will hardly bring differences to the danger of different transmission towers to pollution flashover. On the whole, the danger of pollution flashover in the west section of the line is lower than that in the east section. The main reason for the analysis is that the west is non-urban and the population density is low. At the same time, the city itself is an important pollution source, and the degree of pollution in non-urban areas is low. As the city is closer to the city, the danger of pollution flashover is higher, as shown in Fig. 20. In the west section, the danger of some transmission towers to pollution flashover is abnormal, mainly due to the proximity to highways and ordinary roads. According to the spatial attribute analysis in ArcGIS, the main reason for the high danger of pollution flashover near the 100 # transmission tower is that the line is close to the high speed and is close to the pollution source.Fig. 20</p><p>Pollution flashover danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(6) Landslide and debris flow.</p><p>According to the weight calculation results, the weights of extreme precipitation and slope index are 0.02 and 0.98 respectively, and the danger difference caused by the difference in annual precipitation can be almost ignored. According to the slope information obtained from ArcGIS, the line crosses a plain area with small topographic relief and low altitude. More than 90% of the transmission tower is located at a slope of less than 10 degrees. Therefore, the overall landslide danger of the line is low, which is at or below the \u201clow\u201d level, as shown in Fig. 21.Fig. 21</p><p>Landslide and debris flow danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(7) Earthquake.</p><p>The weights of peak ground acceleration and slope are 0.44 and 0.56 respectively. The seismic danger is based on the distribution of the acceleration of the peak ground motion. The danger of the westernmost section is relatively high as a whole, and the seismic danger of the transmission tower with large slope will fluctuate greatly. Due to the overall low peak ground motion acceleration at the location of the line and the small topographic relief across the line, the overall danger to earthquake disasters is at a \u201clow\u201d level, and individual locations reach a \u201clow\u201d level, as shown in Fig. 22.Fig. 22</p><p>Earthquake danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(8) Steal.</p><p>The weights of peak ground acceleration and slope are 0.44 and 0.56 respectively. The difference in danger to theft mainly comes from the distance from the road. Due to the corresponding consideration in the assignment, the higher the population density score, the lower the actual population density, and the same is true for the distance from the road. It can be seen from the figure that the danger of tower material theft is \u201chigh\u201d and above, and the danger of most transmission towers is \u201clow\u201d and below due to the relatively close distance from the road and low population density, as shown in Fig. 23. The theft danger near the 50 # transmission tower is high. Combined with the geographical characteristics of this section, the main reason is that this section is located in rural areas, with relatively low population density and relatively weak social supervision.Fig. 23</p><p>Theft danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(9) Foreign object touching wire.</p><p>Population density, distance from the water and cross-road situation weights are 0.09, 0.08 and 0.83 respectively, combined with the above analysis, the line overall foreign object touch line in the \u201clow\u201d level, foreign object touch line danger of relatively high transmission tower in the closer to the water and cross-road location. In accordance with the order of cross-area highway, urban trunk road, general road, foreign object touching line vulnerability shows a decreasing trend, as shown in Fig. 24.Fig. 24</p><p>Foreign object touching wire danger distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>(10) Comprehensive danger index.</p><p>According to the entropy method, the weights of various disasters and accidents are shown in the Table 24, and the distribution of the danger index of the power grid calculated by the weighted sum is shown in Fig. 25.Table 24</p><p>Weights of various accidents and disasters.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"10\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_24\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Accident type</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Foreign object touching wire</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Earthquake</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Steal</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Icing</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">Pollution flashover</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\">Wind damage</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\">Landslide</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col9\">Damage caused by thunder</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col10\">Flood and water-logging</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weight</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.21</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.18</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.16</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.15</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.12</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.12</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.05</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">0.01</entry><entry colname=\"col10\">0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Fig. 25</p><p>Distribution of comprehensive danger index of transmission towers.</p><p>The larger the weight of accidental hazards represents the larger the gap it makes between transmission towers danger, and vice versa the smaller. For example, the greatest weight of foreign object touching danger means that there is a large gap between transmission lines threatened by foreign object touching, while the flooding danger is nearly 0, which means that there is almost no difference in the size of each transmission tower threatened by flooding. From the perspective of safety, the greater the weight, the more discrete its danger state is, the more unstable it is, and there are points with higher danger that deviate from the normal state. We should find the points with higher danger to this disaster and strive to solve it, so that the danger of this kind of disaster tends to be stable. For the disaster types with low weight, it is necessary to further analyze whether the system as a whole is in a high danger state. However, with the expansion of the scope of research and the increase of evaluation indicators, the probability of a small weight but a high danger state as a whole will become smaller and smaller. According to the weighted comprehensive danger distribution diagram of various disasters, the danger index of 168 # and 125 # transmission towers is higher than 50, which is at the \u201chigh\u201d level of danger, indicating that they have deviated from the normal state in multiple types of disaster danger.</p><p>For high-weight, high-dispersion disasters such as foreign object collisions, it is essential to strengthen patrols and clearance operations in key areas, install protective devices, and establish real-time early warning systems. For low-weight disasters such as floods, which may still affect overall stability, optimizing foundation design and enhancing drainage systems are recommended to improve flood resistance. For transmission towers with high vulnerability indices (e.g., towers 168# and 125#), localized reinforcement, dynamic monitoring, and customized maintenance strategies should be implemented. Additionally, the disaster assessment framework should be optimized holistically, with dynamic adjustments to weight distributions to address the compounding effects of multiple disasters. These measures collectively aim to significantly enhance the resilience and safety of the power grid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Calculation and analysis of susceptibility index</emphasis></p><p>The only index of susceptibility index is that the population density at the location of the transmission tower is distributed discretely with the spatial location of the transmission tower. The other indicators will not change with the location of the transmission tower because they are selected as the relevant indicators of the power receiving area. Therefore, the weight is determined as 0 by the entropy weight method. When the number of receiving cities is multiple, these indicators will be weighted. From Fig. 26, it can be seen from the figure that when the line passes through cities and towns, the susceptibility will increase with the increase of population density. When transmission tower accidents occur in areas with high population density, the emergency repair and rescue will have a great impact on the surrounding social activities.Fig. 26</p><p>Distribution of susceptibility index of transmission towers.</p><p>To address the discrete characteristics of transmission tower locations and population density distribution in susceptibility indices and their potential impacts on social activities, several measures should be implemented. These include optimizing transmission line planning and layout, enhancing the design and management of transmission towers in densely populated areas, establishing emergency response mechanisms, strengthening the protection of surrounding areas, conducting public awareness campaigns, and implementing dynamic monitoring and population assessments. These measures aim to mitigate the impact of transmission tower incidents on densely populated areas, improve the overall safety and risk resilience of the power grid, and ensure the stability of social activities and public safety.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Calculation and analysis of resistance index</emphasis></p><p>A total of 10 secondary indicators are set for the resistance index, of which the three indicators of tower material, insulator suspension method and service life do not change with the number of the transmission tower in the study object of this paper. The weight is calculated by entropy method as 0, so this paper only considers the weight of the other seven secondary indicators. Due to the small number of secondary indicators, the weight of resistance index is determined directly according to the degree of dispersion of secondary indicators when calculating resistance index, as shown in the Table 25.Table 25</p><p>Weight of secondary indicators of resistance.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"8\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_25\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Secondary indicators</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Function classification</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Line span</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Line corner</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Soil PH</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">Air pollution degree</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\">Average annual air humidity</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\">Relative height difference of tower</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weight</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.58</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.15</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.14</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.07</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.04</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.02</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">0.004</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>It can be seen from the table that the main index that causes the resistance gap between transmission towers in the line studied in this paper is the functional classification, that is, the design strength of tension tower and tangent tower is the most important reason for the resistance gap between transmission towers. Due to the large amount of data, this paper will not show the scores of secondary indicators of 187 transmission towers separately. The weighted scores of resistance index are shown in the figure below.</p><p>The resistance is negatively related to the safety vulnerability, so it is necessary to find the transmission tower with low resistance and formulate targeted solutions. On the whole, the resistance of the tension tower is significantly higher than that of the tangent tower. The span of 101 # and 144 # transmission towers with the lowest resistance is more than 600 m. The transmission tower is located in acidic soil, and 101 # transmission tower is accompanied by an angle of about 5 degrees, as shown in Fig. 27.Fig. 27</p><p>Resistance distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>To address the identified issues, the following targeted safety measures can be implemented. First, enhance the structural strength of suspension towers by optimizing the design of critical components and stability measures to narrow the resistance gap with tension towers. Second, optimize the span design of long-span transmission towers by adding intermediate support points to reduce the force-bearing span. In areas with acidic soil, adopt corrosion-resistant materials or improve soil conditions to mitigate the impact of corrosion on tower foundations. Additionally, upgrade the design of angle towers to improve their capacity to withstand horizontal loads and corner stresses. Simultaneously, establish a regular monitoring and maintenance mechanism, with a focus on the operational status of towers with lower resistance, and further reinforce wind and seismic resistance in regions with complex terrain or long spans. These measures can significantly enhance the stability and risk resilience of transmission towers, thereby strengthening the overall safety and resilience of transmission networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Calculation and analysis of recoverability index</emphasis></p><p>The indicators of recoverability are ranked from the largest to the smallest according to the weight as the distance from the road, population density and distance from the power supply bureau, with the weight of 0.88, 0.12 and 0.0006 respectively. As shown in the Fig. 28, the recoverable force shows a strong positive correlation with the distance from the road for each transmission tower. The distance from the transmission tower to the power supply bureau is within 20 km, which can be reached in a relatively short time. Therefore, this indicator has a small impact on the recoverability of the research object, while the maximum distance from the transmission tower to the road is about 3 km, and the nearest distance is only 17 m. The distance from the road has a relatively obvious impact on the transportation of emergency repair and rescue facilities and equipment, At the same time, the distance from the road Is too far, which also brings challenges to the routine inspection work.Fig. 28</p><p>Recoverability index distribution of transmission towers.</p><p>To address issues related to recoverability, several targeted measures can be implemented. Constructing dedicated access paths will enhance the accessibility of remote transmission towers, while utilizing drones and remote sensing technologies will optimize inspection efficiency. Establishing emergency response bases in key areas will strengthen rapid response capabilities. Future planning should prioritize road accessibility and incorporate supporting infrastructure for remote regions. Additionally, collaborating with local governments to improve regional infrastructure is crucial. These measures will significantly enhance the operational resilience of transmission towers and the overall safety and reliability of the power grid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Calculation and analysis of safety vulnerability of power grid</emphasis></p><p>The weighted results of danger, susceptibility, resistance and recoverability by entropy method are listed in the Table 26.Table 26</p><p>Weights of various elements of grid safety vulnerability.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_26\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Indicators</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Danger</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Susceptibility</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Resistance</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Recoverability</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weight</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.14</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.24</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.02</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.6</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>It can be seen from the table that the dispersion of the recoverability index brings the greatest difference to the safety vulnerability of each transmission tower, which indicates that the recoverability of different transmission towers is quite different, while the resistance of each transmission tower is relatively small. From the perspective of safety, it shows that the recoverability of some transmission towers has a relatively high deviation from the average level. After the accident, it is difficult for these transmission towers to achieve timely and effective repair and recovery. Compared with the recoverability, the difference between the susceptibility and danger of each transmission tower is small.</p><p>The power grid safety vulnerability index of 187 500 kV transmission towers from Luohe City to Zhoukou City in Henan Province is 57.2, which is a high level of vulnerability as shown in Table 18. As shown in Fig. 29, the safety and vulnerability of the 187 500 kV transmission towers are located in the \u201chigher\u201d level of a total of 37, accounting for 19.8% of the total number of transmission towers. There are 76 transmission towers at \u201chigh\u201d level, accounting for 40.6% of the total number. More than half of the transmission towers have safety vulnerability at a high level or above, indicating that the safety vulnerability level of these transmission towers deviates greatly from the average level of the line. The root causes of the differences in vulnerability of different transmission towers can be found by reversely inferring the index with larger weight among the four factors, such as danger and susceptibility, so as to put forward countermeasures and suggestions to reduce the vulnerability of power grid safety.Fig. 29</p><p>Distribution of power grid safety vulnerability index.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion and suggestions</emphasis></p><p>(1) Set elastic patrol period.</p><p>On the basis of comprehensively grasping the operation status of transmission lines, the patrol period shall be appropriately extended or shortened. DL /T741 Operating Regulations for Overhead Transmission Lines stipulates that the normal inspection period of transmission lines is once a month42. However, with the increasing scale of power grid erection and the longer operation mileage, the demand for improving the inspection efficiency is increasing. Through the analysis of the safety vulnerability of the power grid, the vulnerability and resistance of each transmission tower of the line can be obtained. For areas or transmission towers with inconvenient traffic, high difficulty in patrol inspection but low vulnerability or high resistance of the transmission tower, the patrol inspection period can be appropriately extended, such as 90 #, 91 #, 92 # transmission towers with danger index lower than 25 (as shown in Fig. 25). For transmission towers with high danger or low resistance, the inspection period can be appropriately shortened to ensure that these transmission towers are in normal working conditions, such as 168 # and 125 # transmission towers with danger index higher than 50 and 101 # and 104 # transmission towers with low resistance index (as shown in Figs. 25 and 27). These transmission towers are more vulnerable to disasters and accidents than other transmission towers on the line, or are large-span and small-angle tangent towers, and their environment is greatly affected by corrosion and other factors, It\u2019s components are more vulnerable to damage or fatigue43.</p><p>(2) Carry out fine patrol inspection.</p><p>Determine key patrol inspection disaster types by season44. Through danger analysis, most disasters or accidents have strong seasonal distribution characteristics. Spring patrol inspection should focus on the impact of wind damage on the transmission tower, as well as the icing of the line caused by special climate changes such as the late spring cold, the warming of the temperature in spring, and the increase of human activities. The patrol inspection in densely populated areas should be strengthened to prevent the impact of foreign objects on the operation of the power grid caused by human activities such as kite flying and tree planting. Winter is characterized by low temperature, foggy and high degree of pollution. The winter is relatively dry. In addition to the influence of coal heating, the degree of air pollution has increased compared with other seasons. In case of heavy fog, pollution flashover is likely to occur. At the same time, the winter temperature is relatively low. Especially, the average temperature of January in the area where the research line is located is extremely in line with the temperature standard suitable for icing. Once the humidity and wind speed conditions meet the requirements, the line icing disaster is likely to occur, and the icing leads to the increase of wind area, causing secondary disasters such as line galloping. In the period of severe climate change, combined with the focus of seasonal patrol inspection, the efficiency of patrol inspection can be improved and the safety of power grid can be guaranteed.</p><p>Refine the inspection contents according to disaster types. For example, the impact of wind disaster on the transmission tower is mainly concentrated on the swing angle of fittings, bolts and conductors. The frequent change of wind direction will cause the wear of fittings, especially the insulator connection fittings. The lateral swing of conductors will easily lead to the loosening of the tower bolts. When the wind is too strong, it will also lead to the wind deviation tripping. Therefore, the key inspection contents for the wind disaster will be determined45. Patrol inspection of pollution flashover mainly includes observation and measurement of insulator surface pollution. According to the different types of disasters, we can determine the focus of targeted patrol inspection, cooperate with seasonal patrol inspection, and further improve the efficiency of patrol inspection.</p><p>(3) Improve the intrinsic safety level of power grid.</p><p>Installation of safety guards based on safety vulnerability characteristics46. For example, the tower materials of 28 #, 65 # and other transmission towers with high danger to theft shall be subject to anti-unloading treatment, and anti-theft bolts shall be installed at the section number close to the ground (as shown in Fig. 23). For transmission towers with high danger to floods such as 149 # and 79 # and high danger to landslides such as 41 #(as shown in Fig. 21), effective anti-erosion measures can be taken to reduce their danger, such as setting drainage ditches and making foundation protection for transmission towers. The insulator suspension mode shall be improved to V type near the poles and towers with high danger to icing and pollution flashover. According to different disaster characteristics, technical means shall be used to improve the safe operation level of power grid. Reasonably follow the warning signs and warning signs. On the one hand, ensure the standardization and integrity of the pole number plate and warning plate of the transmission tower itself. On the other hand, warning signs in line with the situation should be set near the corresponding dangerous points, such as setting warning elevation on the road near the 83 # transmission tower with important crossing, and installing warning signs of \u201chigh voltage danger, no fishing\u201d along the 111 # and 79 # transmission towers near the water area (as shown in Fig. 5).</p><p>(4) Strengthen scientific and technological support.</p><p>Select the appropriate online monitoring device according to the characteristics of danger and resistance. The transmission line online monitoring device can be divided into several types according to different monitoring purposes, such as meteorological monitoring, conductor temperature monitoring, line sag and wind deflection monitoring, tower tilt monitoring, anti-theft alarm monitoring, etc. Comprehensive online monitoring will not only increase the cost of line operation and use, but also cause waste of resources. Therefore, different types of online monitoring devices should be installed according to the vulnerability attributes of different transmission towers to achieve reasonable and optimal resource allocation. For example, the conductor temperature monitoring device is installed on 152 #, 153 # and other transmission towers with high icing danger (as shown in Fig. 18), and the tower tilt monitoring device is installed on 144 #, 143 # and other large-span and corner towers with low resistance, so as to grasp the line operation status remotely and online, and go to the site in time to understand and deal with the transmission towers with abnormal parameters.</p><p>(5) Optimize emergency supplies reserve.</p><p>From the analysis of safety vulnerability results, it can be seen that recoverability and susceptibility are the two items that account for a large proportion of safety vulnerability. Improving recoverability and reducing danger are the most effective ways to reduce the gap between safety vulnerabilities of transmission towers. Densely populated areas and transmission towers far away from the road are more difficult parts in the process of power emergency response. Reasonably allocate emergency supplies47. Targeted emergency repair equipment corresponding to disasters shall be allocated nearby. For example, the danger of wind disaster and icing near 100 # tower is relatively low, and the danger of pollution flashover is relatively high (as shown in Fig. 29). More emergency repair equipment and components for pollution flashover accidents shall be stored in the nearest emergency repair station of this section to realize the rationalization of emergency resource allocation. Improve the emergency repair capability. In the research line, the danger of wind disaster and pollution flashover of the transmission tower located in the densely populated area is relatively high, while the danger of icing and other disasters is relatively low. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the response ability and knowledge reserve of the emergency repair personnel in the area to disasters such as wind disaster and pollution flashover, develop the emergency decision support system, optimize the emergency route, minimize the repair time, and reduce the impact on the surrounding social activities, so as to improve the recoverability of the power grid in the face of accident disasters and reduce its susceptibility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion and outlook</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>The following results are obtained in this paper:</p><p>Based on the safety vulnerability model, the evaluation index system of power grid safety vulnerability is constructed. The safety vulnerability model is introduced into the electric power field, and the power grid safety vulnerability evaluation index system is constructed from the four levels of danger, susceptibility, resistance and recoverability. Through literature research, the evaluation method and basis of 52 secondary indicators are defined, and the weight of each indicator is determined by entropy method.</p><p>Methods and ideas for processing raw data using geographic information technology-based software. The coordinate information of transmission towers is obtained by geographic location capture and other means, and the methods of using ArcGIS software extraction, interpolation and nearest neighbor analysis to process four types of raw data, such as geospatial, geographic environment, meteorological environment and social environment, are given.</p><p>187 500 kV transmission towers from Luohe City to Zhoukou City in Henan Province were selected for example study. The safety vulnerability distribution of the 187 towers was analyzed, and targeted countermeasure suggestions were given for different safety vulnerability characteristics from the perspective of line operation and inspection and emergency repair.</p><p>In conclusion, this study establishes a comprehensive power grid safety vulnerability assessment framework incorporating four key dimensions: susceptibility, sensitivity, resistance, and resilience. By integrating the entropy weight method with GIS-based spatial analysis techniques, a multi-dimensional and spatially refined assessment approach is proposed. Taking the 500 kV transmission lines in Henan Province as a case study, the model effectively captures the differentiated vulnerability levels of transmission towers and identifies critical risk factors that impact grid stability. These findings provide a robust basis for implementing differentiated inspection protocols, targeted maintenance strategies, and focused mitigation of weak links in the power grid.</p><p>Compared with existing vulnerability assessment approaches\u2014many of which rely on structural topology or subjective weighting\u2014this study demonstrates significant improvements in three aspects. First, it introduces a more objective weighting mechanism, where the entropy method reflects the inherent variability among indicators and eliminates the arbitrariness of expert judgment. Second, it constructs a systematically comprehensive indicator framework, integrating natural hazards, geographic conditions, socio-environmental contexts, and structural characteristics, thereby addressing the limitations of incomplete indicator coverage in prior models. Third, it enhances operational applicability, leveraging GIS tools to achieve spatial visualization and classification of vulnerable segments, thus improving the practicality and precision of risk identification. Accordingly, the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches in terms of theoretical rigor, evaluation accuracy, and practical relevance, offering a scalable and adaptable solution to support the enhancement of grid resilience and the modernization of safety management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitations and prospects</emphasis></p><p>The expected goal of this paper has been basically achieved, but due to the limitations of objective factors such as personal level and data acquisition, the research still has the following aspects that can be further improved.</p><p>In this paper, the ease of access to data is considered and the accuracy of selection of some data had to be partially discarded. The replacement of some of the indicators can further improve the accuracy of the safety vulnerability assessment, for example, the study of lightning danger uses ground flash density and ground flash intensity instead of the number of thunderstorm days, which can obtain more accurate lightning danger assessment results.</p><p>The disaster chain should be further studied. The research on the disaster chain in this paper is relatively simple. For example, the slope factor is taken into account when evaluating the danger to earthquakes, but it is still necessary to further study the relationship between disasters and secondary disasters in the future, and constantly enrich and improve the current safety vulnerability assessment index system.</p><p>Develop visualization software for power grid safety vulnerability assessment. This paper has spent a lot of energy in the processing of tens of thousands of original data. The processing ideas of different original data have strong logic. The input of original data and the output of vulnerability evaluation results can be realized through programming. At the same time, the evaluation results of each transmission tower are presented in a visual interface, and the patrol list of each transmission tower is automatically generated, and the allocation suggestions of emergency resources are given.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Yan, J.

According to news reporting from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest resources are one of the indispensable resources of the earth, which are the basis for the survival and development of human society. With the swift advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, the utilization of deep learning for smoke detection has achieved remarkable results.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Postgraduate Research And Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; National Key R&amp;D Program of China. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"However, the existing deep learning models have poor performance in forest scenes and are difficult to deploy because of numerous parameters. Hence, we introduce an optimized forest fire smoke monitoring system for embedded edge devices based on a lightweight deep learning model. The model makes full use of the multi-scale variable attention mechanism of Transformer architecture to strengthen the ability of image feature extraction. Considering the needs of application scenarios, we propose an improved lightweight network model LCNet for feature extraction, which can reduce the parameters and enhance detecting ability. In order to improve running speed, a simple semi-supervised label knowledge distillation scheme is used to enhance the overall detection capability. Finally, we design and implement a forest fire smoke detection system on an embedded device, including the Jetson NX hardware platform, high-definition camera, and detection software system. The lightweight model is transplanted to the embedded edge device to achieve rapid forest fire smoke detection.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Also, an asynchronous processing framework is designed to make the system highly available and robust. The improved model reduces three-fourths of the parameters and increases speed by 3.4 times with similar accuracy to the original model. This demonstrates that our system meets the precision demand and detects smoke in time.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Forest Fire Smoke Monitoring System Based on a Lightweight Neural Network for Edge Devices.

Using high-resolution Landsat-derived kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), alongside precipitation (PPT), soil moisture (SM), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and solar radiation (SR), several key indices were derived such as Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). The study offers a robust framework to monitor vegetation health under climate stress by integrating satellite-based indices with detailed climate datasets. Our findings reveal significant temperature-induced stress during critical years like 2005 and 2016, with over 60% of the region experiencing vegetation degradation. Long-term trend analysis indicates that while 22.5% of forested areas show signs of recovery, 3.6% continue to degrade, primarily due to persistent temperature extremes and water stress. Soil moisture emerged as a critical driver during the dry season, positively influencing 11.16% of the region, while solar radiation exhibited mixed effects depending on moisture availability. </p><p>These insights highlight the complex interplay of climatic drivers on vegetation dynamics, particularly in tropical ecosystems. The study underscores the need for adaptive management strategies to enhance resilience against climate extremes, providing valuable guidance for sustainable land management in Southern Thailand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The increase in both frequency and intensity of climate extremes has become a critical global issue1,2, significantly impacting tropical ecosystems where vegetation is highly vulnerable to temperature changes and water stress3, 4, 5\u20136. Given these shifts, vegetation health is now seen as a critical indicator of ecosystem resilience, requiring consistent monitoring to support effective land management and conservation7, 8\u20139. Southern Thailand, known for its tropical forests, mangroves, and agricultural landscapes, faces escalating impacts from rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns10,11. While the vulnerabilities of these ecosystems are broadly acknowledged, limited research has been conducted on the region\u2019s long-term vegetation dynamics under climate stress, highlighting a significant research gap. These climate changes pose severe risks to vegetation health, contributing to land degradation, declining productivity, and biodiversity loss12, 13\u201314. Various indices, such as kNDVI, VCI, TCI, and VHI have proven effective for assessing vegetation health by capturing the complex interactions among vegetation growth, climate factors, and environmental stressors15,16. These indices provide a nuanced view of vegetation dynamics by accounting for biotic and abiotic stressors like drought, heat waves, and moisture availability17, 18\u201319. The evaluation of vegetation health remains a core focus in ecological and environmental research, with numerous indices designed to measure vegetation vigor and stress20,21. However, while these indices are widely applied, their integration with detailed climate datasets to examine the interplay of multiple stressors across spatiotemporal scales remains underexplored in Southern Thailand\u2019s diverse ecosystems. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely utilized metric for monitoring vegetation dynamics22,23. However, recent advancements have introduced enhanced versions, such as the kNDVI, which offers improved sensitivity to vegetation changes in complex ecosystems24. The kNDVI employs kernel-based methods to overcome limitations associated with traditional NDVI, particularly in tropical regions, where dense vegetation and varied landscapes may obscure changes in vegetation health24,25. The kernel NDVI (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis></emphasis>NDVI) was adopted because it outperforms standard NDVI in three practical ways. (i) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>NDVI remains quasi-linear up to LAI \u2248 6\u20137, whereas NDVI plateaus near LAI \u2248 3\u2013424,25. (ii) its Gaussian kernel linearizes illumination- and sensor-induced heteroscedasticity, reducing scene-level noise by \u2248 10\u201315% in huid, cloud-affected imagery26. (iii) Background bias being rank based, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>NDVI is far less sensitive to soil and aerosol contamination than Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) or Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which require empirical coefficients30. Comparative evaluations at Southeast-Asian flux-tower sites show that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>NDVI explains 8\u201311% more ariance in gross primary production than NDVI or EVI31. Alongside kNDVI, indices like VCI and TCI have been designed to offer more focused assessments of specific environmental stressors27. VCI, for instance, assesses vegetation health by comparing it to historical variability, making it especially useful for identifying the effects of drought and land degradation28,29. Conversely, TCI specifically targets temperature-related stress, a growing concern in tropical areas experiencing rising temperatures and frequent extreme heat events30,31. By combining indices like TCI and VCI, the VHI provides a holistic tool for assessing biotic and abiotic stressors, making it valuable for tracking long-term vegetation trends32,33. Spatial modeling approaches, as demonstrated in recent studies on water availability and vegetation stress in India34, 35\u201336, provide valuable insights for integrating climatic factors into vegetation health assessments across tropical ecosystems. In addition, optimizing land use for climate mitigation through nature-based solutions, as highlighted in Rajasthan37, reinforces the role of vegetation monitoring in guiding sustainable land-use planning. Furthermore, soil moisture anomalies have been shown to significantly impact agricultural productivity and water resource management38, underlining their critical role in understanding vegetation dynamics within moisture-sensitive regions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climatic drivers of vegetation dynamics</emphasis></p><p>The association between climate factors and vegetation health is well-documented, with temperature and water availability emerging as critical influences on vegetation dynamics39, 40, 41\u201342. Higher temperatures, especially during the growing season, are associated with reduced vegetation productivity and higher mortality from heat stress43, 44\u201345. Like those in Southern Thailand, tropical ecosystems are particularly at risk, operating near their thermal limits46,47. Studies increasingly highlight the impact of temperature anomalies, noting that extreme heat events can significantly impair vegetation growth and lead to long-term ecosystem degradation48, 49, 50, 51\u201352. Water availability, often estimated through precipitation (PPT) and soil moisture (SM), is critical to vegetation health. Drought conditions resulting from lower rainfall or higher evapotranspiration are linked to severe vegetation stress and land degradation in tropical regions39,53,54. VPD further complicates this relationship by intensifying water stress through increased transpiration and moisture loss during prolonged dry spells55,56. Studies show that regions with sufficient soil moisture display stronger resilience to temperature stress, highlighting the need for comprehensive assessments that integrate both temperature and moisture factors to monitor vegetation health accurately57, 58\u201359.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vegetation dynamics in Southern Thailand</emphasis></p><p>Research on vegetation dynamics in Southern Thailand has primarily focused on its biodiversity and the effects of land use changes, such as deforestation and agricultural growth60. However, the impact of long-term climate variability on vegetation health is less frequently addressed. Some studies indicate rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns drive vegetation degradation, especially within forests and agricultural zones61,62. Mangrove ecosystems, critical for coastal protection and biodiversity, also face threats from sea-level rise and temperature stress, posing further risks to the region\u2019s ecological stability63, 64, 65, 66\u201367. Despite these challenges, there is limited research integrating vegetation indices that incorporate climate responsiveness, such as kNDVI, VCI, TCI, and VHI with climatic drivers to capture the interplay of stressors in these critical ecosystems.</p><p>Although numerous studies examine climate change impacts on vegetation health, a crucial gap remains in understanding the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation health in Southern Thailand. Much research has focused on broader areas or specific vegetation types, often overlooking the distinct climatic conditions and land-use patterns unique to this tropical region. Furthermore, while traditional indices like NDVI are widely used, fewer studies have adopted advanced indices such as kNDVI alongside essential climate variables to capture the combined effects of moisture stress and energy-related variables, including temperature and solar radiation, on vegetation. Research on the resilience of different land uses, such as forests, agricultural lands, shrublands, and mangroves, to prolonged climate stress over decades is also notably limited. This study integrates widely employed indices, including kNDVI, VHI, and TCI, with detailed climate datasets in a long-term spatiotemporal framework, focusing specifically on Southern Thailand\u2019s unique tropical ecosystems. By employing a dynamic thresholding approach and analyzing ecosystem-specific responses, the study provides novel insights into the interplay of temperature and water stress on vegetation health, offering actionable recommendations for adaptive management. Given these gaps, this study hypothesizes that vegetation health in Southern Thailand exhibits distinct responses to climatic stressors, driven predominantly by temperature and water availability, with variability across land-use types and ecosystems. The objectives are: (1) Quantify long-term vegetation stress and degradation using advanced satellite-derived indices (kNDVI, VCI, TCI, and VHI) from 2000 to 2023. (2) Analyze the contributions of key climate variables (PPT, SM, VPD, SR, and LST) to vegetation health trends across seasonal and annual timescales. (3) Identify critical years of vegetation stress and assess the severity of degradation. (4) Evaluate the resilience of different land-use types (forests, agricultural lands, shrublands, and mangroves) to climatic extremes. Ultimately, this research seeks to address the identified knowledge gaps and provide actionable insights to support adaptive land management strategies that mitigate the impacts of climate variability and enhance ecosystem resilience in tropical ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>The study area covers Southern Thailand, from 97.63\u00b0E to 102.09\u00b0E longitude and 5.62\u00b0N to 11.03\u00b0N latitude. This region experiences a tropical climate with consistently high temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons, making it particularly susceptible to extreme temperature changes and water scarcity68,69. This area\u2019s diverse ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, mangroves, and agricultural lands, exhibit varying resilience to drought and rising temperatures70 (Fig. 1). These ecosystems are ecologically vital and central to the region\u2019s economy, especially in agriculture and forestry, and rely heavily on vegetation health71,72. Declined vegetation vitality due to climate stress could have significant socio-economic effects, including reduced agricultural productivity and accelerated land degradation73.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) Map of Thailand showing regional divisions with the Southern Region highlighted.

Although these ecosystems are critically important, there is a notable scarcity of long-term research specifically investigating the effects of climate variability on vegetation health. This gap makes Southern Thailand an insightful case for studying the broader implications of climate change on tropical ecosystems. In such contexts, climate stress can set off a series of cascading impacts spanning ecological, economic, and social dimensions, with significant and widespread consequences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dataset</emphasis></p><p>The dataset for this study spans 2000 to 2023 and integrates satellite-derived and climate data to evaluate vegetation health. Primary data sources include Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 for calculating kNDVI and LST, supplemented by environmental variables such as PPT, SM, VPD, and SR. LST values were derived on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, following77\u2019s methodology, which extracts LST from the thermal infrared bands of Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 (see Table 1). The GEE code repository facilitated high-resolution LST calculations, aligning them with kNDVI data for consistency78. Additionally, PPT data were sourced from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) dataset, known for its high spatial resolution79,80. SM, VPD, and SR data were obtained from the TerraClimate database to account for moisture conditions, atmospheric demand, and energy availability for vegetation growth, respectively81,82 (Table 1).</p><p>Preprocessing the datasets involved several vital steps to ensure consistency and accuracy. Landsat images were atmospherically corrected and cloud-masked using GEE functions83,84. Both kNDVI and LST were derived from the processed Landsat imagery. At the same time, the PPT, SM, VPD, and SR datasets were resampled using bilinear interpolation to match the 30-meter spatial resolution of the Landsat data. Given the challenges of obtaining clear monthly Landsat imagery in humid regions like southern Thailand, robust preprocessing steps were implemented to handle cloud cover and ensure data quality. Temporal aggregation was performed to compute annual, dry season, and wet season averages, which are the most suitable timeframes for Southern Thailand. For monthly composites, median compositing was used to reduce the influence of residual cloud contamination and ensure representative surface reflectance. Annual and seasonal composites were derived by averaging these monthly medians. In cases where more than 50% of the pixels in a month were masked due to clouds, linear interpolation was used from adjacent months to fill gaps, validated against CHIRPS precipitation anomalies to confirm that seasonal patterns were preserved (R\u00b2 = 0.78, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.01) (Figure S5).

From these images, the kNDVI was calculated using the Near-Infrared (NIR) and red bands24 (Eq. 1).1</p><p>where n and r represent the reflectance of the NIR and red bands, respectively.

The parameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> was identified pixel-wise as region-specific to ensure the accuracy of kNDVI values for the study area85,86. Dense forest areas utilized smaller \u03c3 values to enhance sensitivity to subtle vegetation changes, while agricultural and mixed-use areas employed larger \u03c3 values to account for heterogeneity. The annual and seasonal \u03c3 values are provided in Tables S1 and S2 to enhance transparency and reproducibility87,88. The calculated kNDVI data, along with LST, were used to derive three key indices (i.e., VCI, TCI, and VHI) to assess vegetation stress and drought conditions more holistically89,90. These indices provide a robust framework for understanding the interaction between vegetation vigor, climatic factors, and temperature-induced stress, which are essential for the long-term monitoring of vegetation health.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Step-by-step process for dataset integration, analysis, and evaluation of climatic impacts on vegetation health.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climatic stress indicators of vegetation health</emphasis></p><p>VCI was derived from kNDVI to monitor vegetation vigor relative to its historical range. It reflects how current vegetation conditions compare to the best and worst observed conditions over the study period91,92. By normalizing kNDVI to the historical minimum and maximum values, VCI captures the relative health of vegetation based on its growth potential under normal conditions (Eq. 4).4</p><p>where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">kNDVI</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">min</emphasis> \u200band <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">kNDVI</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">max\u200b</emphasis> represent the minimum and maximum kNDVI values observed over the study period. This index is critical for identifying periods of vegetation stress due to drought or land degradation, as it directly links current conditions to historical extremes93.</p><p>TCI reflects temperature-induced stress in vegetation and is based on LST. High temperatures can lead to moisture loss, heat stress, and reduced photosynthetic activity, which negatively impact vegetation94,95. TCI measures how far the current LST deviates from the optimal temperature range for vegetation growth96 (Eq. 5).5</p><p>TCI is essential for assessing the impact of extreme temperatures on vegetation, particularly in regions where heat stress is a major limiting factor for plant growth. VHI integrates both VCI and TCI to comprehensively assess vegetation health, capturing both vegetation vigor and temperature-related stress97.</p><p>VHI integrates both VCI and TCI to provide a comprehensive indicator of vegetation health, accounting for both biotic (vegetation vigor) and abiotic (temperature stress) influences97,98. (Eq. 6).6</p><p>Where \u03b1 is a weighting factor, typically set to 0.5, giving equal importance to VCI and TCI 99,100. The flexible weighting allows for adjustments based on the relative importance of temperature and vegetation vigor in different regions or seasons. This adaptability is particularly useful in areas like Southern Thailand, where climatic factors and temperature stress influence vegetation during wet and dry seasons. These indices were calculated for each year from 2000 to 2023, providing a detailed, multi-dimensional assessment of vegetation health, and stress across the study period. Integrating kNDVI, LST, and climate variables allows for a more robust analysis of vegetation dynamics, helping to identify critical periods of stress and offering valuable insights into environmental management and drought mitigation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anomaly calculation for vegetation health, vegetation condition, and temperature condition indices</emphasis></p><p>This study assesses vegetation health from 2000 to 2023 by calculating anomalies for VHI, VCI, and TCI, which indicate deviations from long-term trends and highlight periods of vegetation stress or favorable conditions. Annual mean values for each index were calculated as the average of monthly data for each year (Eq. 7)101,102, and long-term averages were established as baselines for detecting anomalies (Eq. 8)103.78</p><p>Here,  \u200b represents the annual mean for index X in year i, and  denotes the long-term mean of the index over n years. Anomalies (\u200b) were expressed as the percentage deviation from the long-term mean (Eq. 9).9</p><p>Positive anomaly values indicate better-than-average vegetation health, while negative values suggest potential stress or drought conditions98,104. A dynamic thresholding approach was applied to ensure the meaningful identification of significant anomalies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dynamic threshold approach for anomaly detection in vegetation health indices</emphasis></p><p>This study evaluated the annual anomalies of the VHI, VCI, and TCI from 2000 to 2023 to assess vegetation stress and drought conditions. To objectively identify significant anomalies, dynamic thresholds were established for each index based on their statistical distributions105. Specifically, a severe anomaly threshold was defined as two standard deviations below the mean (\u00b5X \u2212 2\u03c3X\u200b), and a normal threshold as two standard deviations above the mean (\u00b5X + 2\u03c3X\u200b)105,106. This approach is grounded in the empirical rule, which posits that approximately 95% of normally distributed data falls within \u00b1 2 standard deviations from the mean, ensuring that identified anomalies are statistically significant and not due to random variability107. For each index X (VHI, VCI, TCI), the thresholds were calculated as (Eqs. 10 and 11):1011</p><p>where \u00b5X\u200b represents the mean of the annual anomalies for index X and \u03c3X\u200b denotes the standard deviation of the yearly anomalies for index X. This method ensures that significant deviations from the norm, identified as anomalies, are statistically robust and not due to random fluctuations. Furthermore, to isolate the most critical adverse events, the 90th percentile of the severity index was employed to identify the top 10% worst years for each index. This percentile-based criterion focuses the analysis on extreme events that have the most substantial impact on vegetation health, enhancing the study\u2019s relevance for drought monitoring and environmental management. The selected thresholds are pivotal for differentiating typical variability from significant stress events in vegetation indices. By employing statistically derived thresholds, the study ensures that the identification of severe anomalies is both objective and reproducible, thereby strengthening the validity and reliability of the findings. Additionally, this study applies the dynamic thresholding approach in combination with integrated statistical and spatial analysis methods, such as the use of kNDVI and climate variables, to better capture subtle vegetation responses under complex environmental stressors. This enhanced detection of extreme stress events, tailored to the unique conditions of Southern Thailand\u2019s tropical ecosystems, provides a more detailed understanding of vegetation health dynamics compared to conventional static thresholds.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trend analysis</emphasis></p><p>A detailed trend analysis of VHI, TCI, and VCI was conducted\ufeff to assess vegetation health across distinct land use categories in Southern Thailand.

The relative contributions of each climate factor to variations in these indices were computed based on the partial derivative of each index for the respective climate variables113,114 (Eq. 15). For VHI, all selected climate factors were included to capture the comprehensive influence of climate variability on overall vegetation health. In contrast, the VCI analysis focused on PPT, VPD, SM, and SR, as these factors are more directly related to water availability and vegetation conditions. For TCI, the analysis was narrowed down to LST, VPD, and SR, as these factors are more directly related to temperature stress and its impact on vegetation115,116. This targeted approach for each index ensures the most relevant climate factors are assessed based on the specific dynamics of the studied index.15</p><p>where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fi\u200b\u200b</emphasis> denotes the contribution of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">th</emphasis> climate factor, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fi\u200b\u200b</emphasis> represents the sensitivity of VHI to the ith climate factor derived from the linear regression model117.

This sensitivity reflects how responsive each index is to incremental changes in the respective climate factors. Larger absolute values of the regression coefficients indicate a stronger influence of the corresponding climate factor on vegetation dynamics, while statistical significance reflects the robustness of the estimation.16</p><p>Here, the \u200b\u200b represents the responsiveness of VHI to changes in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">th</emphasis> climate factor.

This ensured identifying the most impactful climate drivers for each vegetation index, distinguishing them from those with less significance. A classification-based method was then applied to assess various climate factors\u2019 positive and negative influences on vegetation dynamics. For VHI, all five climate factors were considered, while for VCI and TCI, the analyses were tailored to the most relevant climate factors, as previously outlined.</p><p>Each factor was classified as contributing either positively or negatively to vegetation health, and these classifications were summed to determine the overall impact in each region. Regions where all factors contributed positively or negatively were classified as having predominantly positive or negative impacts, respectively123. To further refine the analysis, the dominant climate factor representing the most substantial positive or negative influence was mapped for each area, providing a comprehensive spatial assessment of the factors driving vegetation health. The analysis then identified the dominant climate factor in regions experiencing both positive and negative impacts, facilitating mapping the most influential drivers. The spatial extent of these effects was measured, offering a clearer picture of the relative influence of each factor across the study area. By integrating a partial derivative-based analysis with this classification approach, the study thoroughly evaluates the effects of climate factors on vegetation health at both annual and seasonal scales. This dual approach enhances the understanding of short- and long-term climate impacts on vegetation dynamics, providing critical insights for developing effective climate adaptation strategies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vegetation stress and drought severity</emphasis></p><p>The vegetation health indices (VHIs) from 2000 to 2023 highlight critical years of vegetation stress in Southern Thailand. A dynamic threshold approach was employed to identify severe anomalies, which allowed for the objective differentiation of significant stress events from normal fluctuations. In 2005, all three indices indicated considerable stress, with 21.52% of the area classified as severely stressed by VHI and 60.36% experiencing severe temperature anomalies, according to TCI. This combined impact of vegetation health deterioration and temperature stress made 2005 particularly challenging for vegetation health. In 2016, stress persisted, with 17.03% of the area under severe conditions, according to VHI, and 65.31% experiencing severe temperature stress, as indicated by TCI (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, the Less Severe category represents areas where vegetation health indices deviate moderately from the long-term mean falling between one and two standard deviations below the average. These regions indicate mild to moderate stress, distinct from the most critical zones classified as Severe.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Drought severity in Southern Thailand (2000\u20132023) based on VHI, VCI, and TCI indices.

Comparative analysis across the indices suggests that temperature anomalies had the most significant impact on vegetation stress, as evidenced by the higher proportion of severe areas in TCI compared to VHI and VCI, and the years 2005 and 2016 emerged as the most critical, with substantial areas affected by severe anomalies. While VHI provided a balanced assessment of overall vegetation health, TCI captured more acute stress driven by temperature variability, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple indices for a comprehensive understanding of drought impacts. These findings underscore the need for targeted mitigation strategies addressing temperature-induced stress to enhance vegetation resilience in Southern Thailand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trend analysis</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vegetation anomalies and land use dynamics: seasonal and annual VHI trends</emphasis></p><p>The analysis of VHI anomalies across Southern Thailand\u2019s land use classes reveals complex seasonal and annual vegetation patterns.

This persistent degradation highlights the need for targeted reforestation and soil management strategies to address long-term ecological challenges. During the dry season, 47.9% show insignificant declines, reflecting overall vulnerability, though significant changes are minimal. In the wet season, 42.5% of shrublands also exhibit insignificant decreases, highlighting that even favorable water conditions may not lead to full recovery.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Seasonal and annual VHI trends across LULC classes in Southern Thailand, showing the distribution of vegetation health trends. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) Annual VHI, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis>) Dry season VHI, and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C</emphasis>) Wet season VHI reveal varying responses to environmental conditions. Forest and arable lands display resilience with notable increases in VHI, while shrublands show persistent vulnerability. This indicates that shrublands are inherently less resilient to environmental stress, requiring interventions to enhance their adaptive capacity.</p><p>Arable land, being more sensitive to water availability, presents a mixed response. Dry season data suggest some resilience, likely aided by irrigation practices, while wet season improvements hint at a more robust recovery driven by sufficient rainfall. These contrasting responses across different land use types emphasize the significant impact of seasonal dynamics on vegetation health. While forests and arable lands show signs of resilience and potential recovery, the shrubland remains particularly vulnerable, indicating the need for focused management strategies. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions to mitigate environmental stressors and promote long-term sustainability across various ecosystems. Targeted water management and sustainable agricultural practices can mitigate stress in arable lands and shrublands, ensuring long-term vegetation health.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatiotemporal dynamics of VCI anomalies across LULC</emphasis></p><p>The spatiotemporal analysis of VCI anomalies in Forest Land (FL) shows that 31.6% of the area shows notable increasing trends in vegetation health, likely to indicate successful reforestation efforts or favorable climatic conditions. However, 4.7% of the forested regions exhibit significant declines, raising concerns about ongoing deforestation or the impacts of prolonged drought, particularly during dry periods. Seasonal analysis indicates that 35.7% of forested areas show VCI improvements during the dry season, which may reflect enhanced water management strategies. In contrast, 4.4% show declines, potentially signaling stress caused by insufficient water availability. In the wet season, 33.9% of forests exhibit VCI increases, benefiting from ample rainfall, while another 4.4% face declines, suggesting persistent environmental challenges that remain even during more favorable periods (Fig. 5). Resilience is evident in mangrove forests (MF), especially during the wet season, where 33.9% of areas show VCI improvements, likely benefiting from favorable water conditions. In contrast, 4.4% of mangrove regions experience declines, which may be attributed to environmental challenges like coastal erosion or human activities impacting these sensitive ecosystems. During the dry season, significant VCI increases across 35.7% of arable land are likely the result of enhanced irrigation systems or the use of drought-tolerant crops (Fig. 6E). However, many agricultural areas face insignificant decreases during the wet season, revealing vulnerabilities in productivity caused by fluctuating water availability. This variability underscores the need for sustainable agricultural practices, such as improving drainage infrastructure and optimizing irrigation strategies, to mitigate the risks to food security. (Fig. 6 ABCDFGHI).</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Seasonal and annual VCI trends across LULC classes in Southern Thailand. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) Annual VCI, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis>) Dry season VCI, and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C</emphasis>) Wet season VCI display varying responses among LULC classes. Forest and upland areas exhibit resilience with significant increases, while arable and shrubland areas show more mixed trends, with some regions experiencing substantial declines.</p><p>Minimal significant trends appear in shrubland (SL), with much of the area showing insignificant decreases in seasonal and annual analyses. This indicates that shrublands may be less affected by seasonal variations, likely due to their adaptive nature and low vegetation density. However, localized factors such as land management practices or grazing could explain the few areas showing notable trends. As anticipated, urban land (UL) exhibits mostly insignificant VCI trends, reflecting the limited vegetation typical of urban landscapes. The few significant changes observed are likely tied to shifts in urban green spaces or the impact of infrastructure development on vegetation. This analysis underscores the importance of seasonal and environmental conditions in influencing vegetation dynamics across LULC categories. Forest lands exhibit signs of recovery but also contain areas requiring attention due to decreasing trends. Mangrove forests demonstrate resilience but still face localized stressors. Agricultural areas show adaptive capacity in the dry season but remain vulnerable during wetter periods. Shrublands appear less responsive to seasonal changes, and the urban regions exhibit relative stability, with occasional vegetation changes tied to urban development124,125. These findings emphasize the need for land-use-specific interventions, such as reforestation, agricultural water management, and urban green planning, to enhance vegetation health and resilience across ecosystems.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Spatial distribution of annual, dry, and wet season trends in VHI (ABC), VCI (DEF), and TCI (GHI) across Southern Thailand.

In forested areas, 67.8% exhibit minor, statistically insignificant decreases in TCI (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> \u2265 0.05), suggesting that temperature fluctuations have a limited overall impact on vegetation in these regions (Fig. 7). However, 13.8% of forested regions show significant improvements (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.05), indicating areas where favorable temperature conditions promote healthier vegetation. Conversely, 1.6% of forested regions experience significant declines, highlighting localized vegetation loss due to temperature stress, particularly during the dry season (Fig. 6I). During this period, 61.4% of forests show insignificant decreases, reflecting mild temperature stress without severe consequences. In contrast, 24.7% display significant TCI increases, implying localized climatic benefits or the presence of temperature-adaptive species. However, 3% of forested areas face significant declines, underscoring hotspots where temperature stress is a major driver of vegetation degradation. Mangrove forests show predominantly insignificant TCI decreases, suggesting that temperature fluctuations exert limited influence on overall vegetation health. Nonetheless, areas with significant increases highlight regions where favorable temperature conditions aid mangrove growth and recovery, particularly in coastal environments. Arable lands exhibit increased sensitivity to temperature stress, with insignificant TCI decreases dominating during the dry season. In the wet season, significant TCI increases reflect enhanced vegetation growth, as favorable temperature and moisture conditions boost agricultural productivity. Shrublands exhibit mixed responses, with 58.4% showing insignificant decreases in TCI during the dry season, indicating limited sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. However, small regions with significant declines point to areas adversely affected by prolonged temperature stress. Urban land, as expected, shows predominantly insignificant trends due to limited vegetation cover, with substantial trends linked to urban green spaces or temperature management strategies.</p><p>A comparative analysis of TCI\u2019s performance across these land-use types highlights its unique ability to capture temperature-related stress, particularly in regions with extreme fluctuations. For example, while traditional indices like NDVI or VHI might overlook localized stressors, TCI effectively identifies areas where temperature is a primary driver of vegetation change. This makes it especially valuable in ecosystems like arable lands and mangroves, where vegetation health is closely tied to seasonal temperature dynamics. These findings emphasize the importance of TCI in identifying temperature-induced vulnerabilities and informing adaptive management strategies to mitigate climate impacts. For forested areas, identifying hotspots with significant TCI declines underscores the need for reforestation programs with temperature-adaptive species. At the same time, the role of TCI in arable lands highlights the necessity for temperature-resilient crops and irrigation systems during dry seasons. This analysis underscores the varying degrees of temperature stress across land-use types and highlights TCI\u2019s capability to capture critical stress points. Forested areas demonstrate a mix of resilience and vulnerability, while mangroves and arable lands exhibit adaptability under favorable conditions. Shrublands show overall stability with localized stress points, and urban areas remain largely unaffected, apart from trends tied to urban greening initiatives. These insights reinforce the need for targeted strategies, such as optimizing temperature management in arable lands and strengthening mangrove conservation in coastal environments, to sustain vegetation health under rising climate pressures.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>Seasonal and annual TCI trends across LULC classes in Southern Thailand. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) Annual TCI, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis>) Dry season TCI, and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C</emphasis>) Wet season TCI illustrate the percentage distribution of significant and insignificant trends across different LULC types. Forest lands show high levels of stability with minor increases, while arable and upland areas display more substantial increases in TCI, particularly during the wet season, indicating temperature-driven resilience.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Annual and seasonal climate contributions to vegetation health: comparative impacts on VHI, VCI, and TCI in tropical ecosystems</emphasis></p><p>This study examines the impact of critical climatic factors SM, SR, VPD, PPT, and LST on vegetation health through three key indices: the VHI, VCI, and TCI. The analysis spans annual, dry, and wet seasons, allowing for the identification of seasonal variations in how these environmental variables affect vegetation. The findings below outline the contributions of each factor to the indices, followed by a seasonal comparison.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Annual contributions to vegetation health</emphasis></p><p>The annual analysis highlights the significant impact of climatic variables on vegetation health, with substantial variations in their contributions across the VHI, VCI, and TCI indices. SM emerged as the dominant factor influencing VHI, with positive and negative effects. It improved vegetation health across 13.11% of the area, where optimal moisture levels supported plant growth but negatively impacted 16.41%, likely due to water stress caused by insufficient or excessive moisture. This highlights the critical role of SM in balancing water availability, as drought and waterlogging can hinder vegetation productivity. SR also played a dual role. It negatively affected 13.42% of the area by increasing evapotranspiration, leading to moisture depletion and plant stress. However, SR positively influenced regions with sufficient soil moisture, benefiting 11.93% of the area by driving photosynthesis. This underscores the importance of SR in maintaining energy balance and promoting growth (Fig. 8A). PPT and LST also negatively impacted 10.81% and 10.34% of the area, respectively. These effects are likely linked to excess rainfall or heat stress. Despite this, VPD and PPT contributed more minor but significant positive effects, benefiting 9.15% and 7.32% of the area. These findings suggest that, under moderate conditions, these factors play a supportive role in maintaining healthy vegetation. As hydrological conditions significantly influence urban and vegetation health34, this study further highlights their critical role in shaping vegetation dynamics in Southern Thailand.</p><p>SR played a significant role in influencing VCI, negatively affecting 21.80% of the area. This is likely due to increased evapotranspiration, which depletes moisture, especially under high radiation, leading to water stress. In regions where moisture was not limited, however, SR positively impacted 11.39% of the area by facilitating photosynthesis (Fig. 8B). This dual role reflects SR\u2019s influence on the energy balance of vegetation. Excessive solar radiation can cause harm, while moderate levels enhance growth. SM had mixed effects as well. It negatively impacted 12.47% of the area, likely due to waterlogging, but improved vegetation health in 17.11% of the area where moisture levels were optimal. VPD and PPT followed similar patterns. VPD had a more prominent negative effect, highlighting the role of atmospheric moisture demand in vegetation stress. However, moderate VPD levels supported growth in areas under less stress, illustrating the complex relationship between atmospheric moisture and plant responses.</p><p>LST had a significant negative impact on 19.61% of the area, according to TCI, as thermal stress disrupted plant metabolism and reduced vegetation health. In contrast, moderate temperatures positively affected 11.44% of the area, allowing plants to thrive under more favorable conditions. SR significantly improved photosynthesis and benefited vegetation health across 24.53% of the area (Fig. 8C). However, excessive solar radiation negatively affected 10.58%, showing the delicate balance between helpful and harmful radiation levels. VPD also contributed positively to 23.75% of the area by promoting transpiration, a crucial process for nutrient transport in plants. Still, high VPD levels, which increase moisture demand, negatively impacted 10.10% of the area, contributing to vegetation stress, a pattern also observed with VHI and VCI. The pixel-wise climatic sensitivities (\u03b2), inter-annual variability (\u0394), absolute contributions (C = \u03b2\u00b7\u0394) and normalised relative contributions (R) that underpin these percentage patterns are provided in Supplementary Figure. S4, with accompanying study-area statistics in Table S3.</p><p>Fig. 8</p><p>Percentage contribution of environmental predictors to the VHI, VCI, and TCI on an annual, dry, and wet seasonal basis in Southern Thailand. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) VHI contributions highlight SM and SR as key influences, with positive and negative effects varying by season. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis>) VCI contributions strongly influence SR and SM, particularly in the wet season. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C</emphasis>) TCI contributions show temperature (LST) as the dominant factor, especially in the wet season, reflecting temperature-driven vegetation stress. This analysis emphasizes the seasonal sensitivity of vegetation health to climatic variables.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seasonal contributions to vegetation health</emphasis></p><p>In the dry season, SM remained the most significant negative contributor to vegetation health under the VHI, affecting 15.86% of the area. SR followed closely with a negative impact on 13.14% of the area. PPT and VPD also showed adverse effects, although LST had a more minor influence. Notably, PPT emerged as the most significant positive factor in this season, enhancing vegetation health in 13.13% of the area, while SM contributed positively to 11.16%. These findings underscore the importance of targeted water management practices, such as soil moisture retention and efficient irrigation systems, to mitigate stress and optimize vegetation health during the dry season. Although smaller in magnitude, SR and LST also played positive roles, indicating their relevance in supporting plant productivity under favorable conditions. During the wet season, LST showed a dramatic shift, becoming the dominant positive factor contributing to 30.61% of the area, underlining the significance of thermal dynamics during this period <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(</emphasis>Fig. 9<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">).</emphasis> SR and PPT also made substantial positive contributions, while SM and VPD had more minor positive impacts. Negative influences were led by SM (11.00%) and SR (8.57%), with LST showing the least negative effect, highlighting the seasonally shifting importance of these factors.</p><p>The VCI reflected similar patterns. SM and VPD had more pronounced negative impacts during the dry season, with SM affecting 19.63% of the area and elevated VPD influencing 16.81%. This underscores the vulnerability of vegetation to moisture deficits in arid conditions. SR further reduced vegetation vitality, negatively affecting 14.85% of the area, which is in line with its negative role observed in the VHI analysis. Positive contributions from SM and SR were limited, suggesting that only certain regions benefited from favorable conditions, much like the constrained positive impacts seen in the VHI. In the wet season, solar radiation positively influenced 20.36% of the area, while soil moisture supported vegetation health across 15.10% of the region, reflecting its role in VHI. The reduction in adverse effects of precipitation and the expansion of its positive influence underscores the critical role of sufficient rainfall during this period. VPD, while generally contributing to vegetation stress, played a more supportive role in the wet season, positively impacting 11.55% of the area by facilitating transpiration under more favorable moisture conditions.</p><p>The TCI highlighted the increasing importance of LST during the dry season, contributing positively to 44.63% of the area. This emphasizes the role of moderate temperatures in sustaining vegetation health when moisture is limited. The relatively minor adverse effects of LST (4.23%) indicate that while thermal stress can occur, LST remains a beneficial factor in maintaining vegetation growth in arid conditions. SR positively influenced 23.71% of the area but continued to exert adverse effects over 7.91%, demonstrating the dual impact of SR seen in both VHI and VCI. VPD\u2019s negative impact of 10.20% was more prominent, reflecting the increased atmospheric moisture demand that exacerbates water stress in vegetation during the dry season. During the wet season, LST emerged as the most critical positive factor, contributing to 50.03% of the area. This highlights the importance of favorable thermal conditions in supporting vegetation growth under well-watered conditions. However, SR\u2019s negative impact increased to 14.30%, likely due to heat stress despite moisture availability, while positive contributions were more restricted (9.45%). The negative influence of VPD also grew to 16.84%, stressing vegetation even in areas with adequate soil moisture, reflecting its role in regulating transpiration and moisture demand. This seasonal variability highlights the need for adaptive strategies that address the shifting importance of climate drivers, such as optimizing thermal conditions and balancing water availability to sustain vegetation productivity year-round.</p><p>Fig. 9</p><p>The spatial distribution of dominant climate factors impacts vegetation health Across seasons. The maps display the combined dominant impacts of Climatic predictors on vegetation health indices: VHI, VCI, and TCI for Annual (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>), Dry (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis>), and Wet (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C</emphasis>) seasons. The individual contributions of climatic factors SM, SR, VPD, PPT, and LST to vegetation health indices VHI, VCI, and TCI across annual, dry, and wet seasons are detailed in Supplementary Material Appendix A. Figures S1, S2, and S3 illustrate these seasonal impacts, revealing the detail and season-dependent influences of each predictor on vegetation health.

In the wet season, LST showed solid positive contributions, underscoring its critical role in tropical vegetation dynamics during periods of high precipitation. These findings highlight the necessity for adaptive environmental management strategies that account for seasonal variability in climate drivers to enhance ecosystem resilience in tropical regions. The VCI results aligned closely with the VHI, reinforcing the importance of SR, SM, and VPD in determining vegetation health across seasons. Both indices demonstrate the dual roles of these factors: while optimal conditions promote vegetation growth, excesses or deficits can result in stress and reduced vitality. These complementary insights further underscore the need for adaptive management strategies that consider seasonal fluctuations in environmental drivers, particularly under the pressures of climate change. LST emerged as a crucial driver of vegetation health across all seasons, with its positive influence being most pronounced during the wet season. The complex, season-dependent impacts of SR and VPD suggest careful management is needed to mitigate thermal and moisture stress. The interplay between these factors, as evidenced in the VHI and VCI results, points to the importance of optimizing shading and selecting heat-tolerant species to minimize the adverse effects of climate-induced stress on vegetation.</p><p>Overall, this comprehensive analysis highlights that vital environmental factors have significant and seasonally dependent impacts on vegetation health indices (VHI, VCI, and TCI) in Southern Thailand. SM and SR were consistently identified as primary drivers across all seasons, with SM exhibiting both positive and negative effects depending on moisture availability and seasonal conditions. LST demonstrated a substantial positive influence during the wet season, affecting over 30% of the area for VHI and over 50% for TCI, supporting its role in promoting vegetation health under moist conditions. The VCI analysis further highlighted the need to manage moisture availability and mitigate excessive heat stress. SR and VPD can either exacerbate moisture stress during dry periods or support vegetation growth under optimal conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climatic drivers of vegetation health in Southern Thailand</emphasis></p><p>The results of this study reveal significant spatiotemporal variations in vegetation health, driven by climatic factors such as SM, SR, PPT, VPD, and LST. Vegetation in Southern Thailand shows pronounced sensitivity to seasonal and annual climate dynamics, especially under extreme temperature and moisture conditions, aligning with findings from similar tropical ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of extreme temperature and moisture deficits on vegetation stress</emphasis></p><p>Spectral monitoring has proven effective for assessing vegetation health in tropical ecosystems, particularly during seasonal extremes126. The applicability of vegetation indices to aquatic systems, such as the Dharoi Reservoir, further underscores their utility in diverse environments37. The patterns observed in Southern Thailand reflect these findings, reaffirming the capacity of indices like VHI and kNDVI to capture climate-induced vegetation stress. This stress has serious implications for agriculture, as shown in simulations from Jammu and Kashmir, where concurrent heat and drought threaten food production127. Similar risks are evident in Southern Thailand, where vegetation degradation due to temperature and moisture extremes affects food systems and livelihoods.</p><p>The VHI identified severe vegetation stress during 2005 and 2016, aligning with temperature anomalies detected by TCI. These years saw temperature-induced stress across 60.36% and 65.31% of the region, respectively, highlighting the compounding effects of heat and moisture deficits. Events like April 2016\u2019s drought, linked to ENSO and anthropogenic influences, disrupted agriculture and reduced yields128. Rising temperatures further limit evapotranspiration and intensify soil moisture deficits, suppressing productivity under prolonged heat stress129, 130, 131, 132\u2013133. These outcomes align with global trends linking heat and drought to reduced yields, reinforcing the need for climate-adaptive agriculture134,135. Forests and mangroves are especially vulnerable forests that decline rapidly under moisture deficits, while mangroves face risks from combined heat and water stress136,137. This degradation threatens biodiversity, timber production, and coastal protection. For agriculture, temperature and moisture stress reduce productivity, disrupt food supply chains, and endanger rural livelihoods138.</p><p>Southern Thailand\u2019s experience mirrors broader patterns: increasing drought and heat reduce photosynthesis and resilience, exacerbating food insecurity139. In Southern Africa, for instance, recurring ENSO-induced droughts disrupt economies and livelihoods, demanding urgent adaptation140. These challenges highlight the need for climate-smart practices like drought-tolerant crops, improved irrigation, and resilient afforestation141. High-resolution climate models also support mitigation planning under extreme events142. The interlinkage between vegetation health, ecological resilience, and human well-being necessitates proactive adaptation to protect food security and livelihoods as ecosystems approach critical thresholds.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drivers of vegetation degradation and resilience across land cover types</emphasis></p><p>While the VCI remained relatively stable, the more significant fluctuations in TCI indicate that temperature stress, rather than water availability, is the primary driver of vegetation degradation in this region. This observation is consistent with143, who found that TCI is dominant in detecting vegetation stress, especially in dry areas. Likewise, increases in temperature caused by forest degradation and land conversion in tropical regions are known to push species closer to their thermal limits144. Temperature-driven degradation is also linked to greenhouse gas emissions from forest loss, which are often underestimated in climate models145. In subtropical wetlands, increased temperature sensitivity further intensifies vegetation stress146,147.</p><p>Trend analysis across land use categories provides insight into vegetation resilience and vulnerability. Forested areas recovered in 22.5% of the region but a decline in 3.6%, particularly during the dry season, likely due to sustained water stress or deforestation pressures. These findings mirror those from other tropical regions, where droughts have heightened forest vulnerability to fires, exacerbating degradation during dry periods148,149. These patterns suggest a variety of factors influencing forest health, including potential recovery in some areas and degradation in others. The decreases in some forested areas could be attributed to deforestation or water stress, as suggested by previous studies150. The improvements noted in some forests during the dry season could potentially be due to adaptive ecological processes151. However, the significant declines in 4.4% of areas, likely driven by persistent drought stress or other environmental pressures, highlight the need for targeted conservation efforts. The differences observed during the wet season, with 25.8% of forests showing recovery and 55.9% slight declines, indicate that while water availability is a critical factor, other issues such as soil quality or human activities might also play a role in determining vegetation health152.</p><p>This persistent degradation highlights the need for targeted reforestation and soil management strategies to address long-term ecological challenges. The spatiotemporal analysis of VCI and TCI anomalies across land cover types reveals that mangrove forests are generally resilient to seasonal fluctuations and remain vulnerable to localized stressors such as coastal erosion and human activity. This aligns with global trends of mangrove degradation, where aquaculture, urban development, and nutrient depletion have driven significant losses, as seen in Brazil and the Indian Sundarbans153]\u2013 [154. Global assessments show that human-driven factors accounted for 62% of mangrove degradation between 2000 and 2016, highlighting the urgency of targeted conservation efforts155.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate factors and vegetation stress dynamics</emphasis></p><p>The analysis highlights the critical role of climate factors, particularly SM and SR, in shaping vegetation dynamics. SR exhibits a dual effect, promoting vegetation growth in moisture-rich areas but intensifying stress in regions with limited water availability due to increased evapotranspiration. Groundwater-rich zones are better able to sustain vegetation under high SR, while moisture-limited areas face significant stress156, 157\u2013158. Similarly, soil moisture plays a pivotal role, especially during the dry season, supporting vegetation in 11.16% of the study area. This underscores the importance of water retention strategies and irrigation to mitigate drought impacts, particularly as climate change exacerbates seasonal dryness. Temperature stress further compounds vegetation vulnerability. During the wet season, LST positively influenced vegetation health across 30.61% of the region, showcasing its importance in tropical ecosystems with ample precipitation159, 160\u2013161. However, excessive SR during the dry season negatively affected 13.14% of the area, demonstrating the need for strategies to manage SR exposure and reduce heat-induced stress. These findings underscore the sensitivity of vegetation to combined heat and moisture challenges, particularly in tropical climates where ecosystems operate near critical thresholds.</p><p>Vegetation degradation carries significant socioeconomic repercussions, particularly for forestry and agriculture. Deforestation-driven greenhouse gas emissions in forestry contribute to climate change162\u2013 163 while reducing timber yields and carbon trading opportunities, undermining local and global economies164. Agricultural productivity is similarly affected, with soil erosion and irregular precipitation increasing costs and threatening food security. Rural livelihoods are disproportionately impacted by vegetation loss. Communities dependent on forest resources suffer from reduced biodiversity and ecosystem services, disrupting their income and resource stability. Vulnerable populations in developing regions are particularly at risk, making restoration an ecological imperative and a socioeconomic necessity to support human well-being and resilience. Effective restoration strategies must prioritize biodiversity recovery and ecosystem functioning. Evidence suggests that ecological restoration enhances biodiversity by 44% and ecosystem services by 25%, though full recovery often lags behind undisturbed ecosystems165. Natural regeneration (passive restoration) often surpasses active interventions in restoring biodiversity and vegetation structure. Agroforestry and sustainable land-use practices also offer dual benefits, fostering biodiversity while improving soil stability and crop yields. Restoration strategies tailored to tropical regions\u2019 unique ecological and socioeconomic conditions, such as Southern Thailand, are essential for achieving long-term impact.</p><p>Integrating monitoring frameworks into restoration efforts is critical for tracking carbon stocks and biodiversity recovery. Adaptive management approaches ensure restoration aligns with evolving ecological and socioeconomic goals, enhancing sustainability. Investments in initiatives like REDD + exemplify the broader benefits of restoration, contributing to climate resilience, poverty alleviation, and biodiversity conservation. Moreover, restored ecosystems enhance soil properties, improving agricultural productivity and forest regeneration potential166. Restoration efforts should integrate socioeconomic considerations to maximize their benefits for ecosystems and communities. By aligning restoration with sustainable development goals, policymakers can support climate resilience, food security, and economic stability. Proactive planning that bridges ecological restoration with livelihood improvement is vital for addressing the twin challenges of climate change and land degradation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strategies for Climate-Resilient vegetation management</emphasis></p><p>The spatial dominance patterns of temperature, soil-moisture, precipitation, and solar-radiation stress identified in Fig. 8 provide the biophysical foundation for the management actions proposed below. These findings highlight the need for vegetation management strategies that integrate ecological and policy implications. Forested regions require targeted efforts to address deforestation, maintain biodiversity, and manage water stress. At the same time, areas with declines in VHI and TCI necessitate reforestation and sustainable land-use practices to restore ecosystems and support carbon sequestration. Arable lands and shrublands are vulnerable to wet season challenges like soil erosion and waterlogging. Adaptive water management, including drainage systems and conservation practices, is essential to safeguard crop productivity. While our study incorporated comprehensive preprocessing steps to address uncertainties in satellite-derived indices, including cloud masking using the Quality Assessment Band and multi-temporal compositing, certain limitations persist. Despite these measures, regions with frequent cloud cover may experience reduced temporal continuity. Similarly, mixed land-use areas present challenges in accurately isolating vegetation-specific responses despite our use of stratified analysis based on detailed land cover maps. Future studies should explore the integration of high-resolution satellite imagery and data fusion techniques to mitigate these limitations further and enhance the precision of vegetation monitoring in tropical ecosystems. Season-specific interventions, such as optimized irrigation, shading structures to mitigate solar radiation stress, and temperature-resilient crops, are critical for addressing the impacts of climate variability. Policy alignment with frameworks like REDD + can leverage funding for conservation and climate adaptation. Establishing monitoring frameworks to track vegetation health and adaptive management strategies informed by climate models will ensure long-term sustainability. These actionable measures provide clear pathways for mitigating vegetation stress and enhancing ecosystem resilience in tropical regions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>This study provides a comprehensive analysis of vegetation health trends across Southern Thailand from 2000 to 2023, focusing on how seasonal and annual climate factors, particularly temperature and water availability shape ecosystem resilience. Findings indicate a strong sensitivity of tropical vegetation to extreme temperatures, with notable stress recorded in 2005 and 2016. This observed sensitivity underscores the vulnerability of these ecosystems and highlights the broader challenges tropical regions face in adapting to climate variability. Additionally, soil moisture proved crucial during the dry season, mitigating water stress in forested and agricultural areas. In contrast, high solar radiation levels increased photosynthetic activity in moisture-rich regions but heightened stress in drier areas. These findings highlight the need for integrated water resource management strategies, such as efficient irrigation systems, water retention techniques, and soil conservation practices, to combat seasonal water stress and enhance ecosystem resilience. Forested and cultivated lands demonstrated considerable resilience to seasonal stressors; however, persistent drought conditions and continued deforestation in forested areas underscore the pressing need for adaptive management strategies. Reforestation programs using temperature- and drought-adaptive species and policies that curb deforestation is critical for maintaining ecosystem stability in these areas. Although mangrove forests have shown relative resilience to short-term climate fluctuations, they are increasingly challenged by coastal erosion and human activities. Targeted conservation strategies, including mangrove restoration and coastal erosion control measures, are essential to protect these critical ecosystems. To address these challenges, a multifaceted approach is required that integrates ecosystem-specific strategies with broader adaptive management frameworks. Enhanced early warning systems for extreme weather events and policies promoting sustainable land use will strengthen climate resilience in tropical ecosystems. These findings underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to land management, one that adapts to the seasonal needs of Southern Thailand\u2019s ecosystems. Effectively addressing climate stress will require targeted actions like enhanced irrigation systems and shade structures and a broader commitment to biodiversity conservation. Transformative agricultural strategies, offer practical guidance for implementing climate-resilient land management practices, which are vital for long-term ecosystem stability and food security in tropical regions. By deepening our understanding of these intricate ecological dynamics, this study lays the groundwork for sustainable management practices that support tropical ecosystems\u2019 immediate and long-term resilience to climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>We are grateful to the Key Laboratory for Silviculture and Conservation of Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, (100083), P.

Here, we investigate how these changes have affected the carrying capacity of mountain ash forests (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eucalyptus regnans</emphasis>), the world\u2019s tallest flowering plant and one of the most carbon-dense forests on earth. We analyze data from a large network of silvicultural experiments collected between 1947 and 2000 in southeastern Australia to identify trends in mortality rates and carrying capacity for the species, and to quantify how these changes relate to spatiotemporal variations in climate. We show that forests growing in the warmest and highest vapor pressure deficit conditions had the lowest carrying capacity, and this capacity further decreased with rising temperatures. Key findings indicate that a projected three \u00b0C increase in temperature by 2080 could reduce tree density and carbon stock in these forests by 24%, equivalent to losing 240,000 hectares of mature mountain ash forests. Trees that died were 0.62 times the size of living trees (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., they were suppressed), with no detectable effect of climate on this ratio. We discuss the implications for forest conservation and management, and how reduced carrying capacity could undermine global forest restoration and carbon sequestration efforts.</p><p>Climate change threatens mountain ash (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eucalyptus regnans</emphasis>) forests, which are among Earth\u2019s most carbon-dense ecosystems. This study finds that a projected 3\u2218 C warming by 2080 could reduce tree density and carbon storage in these forests by 24%</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Forests are one of the largest terrestrial carbon sinks in the world, absorbing about a third of our annual global emissions1. However, changes in climate threaten the ability of existing forests to remain net CO2 absorbers2. This threat is being realized with increasing reports of tree mortality rates accelerating in many parts of the world3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\u201310 in response to rising temperature and drought intensity over the past century11. As climate warming continues, physiological models predict further drought-induced tree mortality to occur6, 7\u20138. From an ecosystem perspective, the main concern is not changes in tree mortality rates per se, but changes in the forest\u2019s carrying capacity, which determines how much carbon a forest can hold. Changes in forest carrying capacity have the potential to turn forests from a carbon sink to a carbon source as they transition from higher to lower densities through increased tree mortality. Linking changes in mortality rates to changes in carrying capacity is essential if we want to predict where and how much forests will alter their carrying capacity under climate change.</p><p>In even-aged forests, carrying capacity can be described by the self-thinning line, which is the maximum number of trees of a given mean size that can be stocked per unit area12. Self-thinning is one of the few laws in plant population ecology13 and results from an equilibrium between stand growth and density-dependent mortality in even-aged stands. As trees grow larger, they require more space and resources to survive, causing smaller trees to become increasingly suppressed and eventually die. Recent studies have advanced our mechanistic understanding of how tree shape, metabolism, and resource competition drive this self-thinning process14, 15, 16\u201317. Self-thinning lines have been shown to vary with species and site quality18, 19, 20, 21, 22\u201323 but have traditionally been treated as time-invariant. Rapid changes in climatic conditions are challenging this assumption. Many regions are becoming more arid, with reduced soil water availability and increased atmospheric vapor-pressure deficits (VPD)8,24. In theory, this should result in reduced leaf area, a decrease in plot-level photosynthetic capacity, and a subsequent reduction in forest carrying capacity25. Despite this threat, few studies have explored how the self-thinning line changes over time in response to climatic variability. This is an important knowledge gap given the widespread changes in forest dynamics26 and the need to detect and understand shifts in mortality rates and their drivers27,28.</p><p>Also of interest is the partitioning of tree mortality within the stand. Climate change is unlikely to impact all trees equally22,23,29,30. However, it remains unclear which trees are most at risk. Studies in mixed-species forests have reported that large and tall trees are at greater risk8,31, 32\u201333, but many empirical studies in monocultures have consistently found higher sensitivity among smaller, suppressed trees32,34, 35\u201336.</p><p>Here, we build on recent advances in self-thinning modeling37 to investigate changes in carrying capacity and their climate drivers in forests dominated by mountain ash (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eucalyptus regnans</emphasis>), the tallest flowering plant on Earth and one of the most carbon-dense forests38, 39\u201340. Using long-term data spanning five decades (1947\u20132000), we quantify temporal changes in forest carrying capacity, their associations with climate conditions, and shifts in the relative size of dying trees and their potential climate drivers. Based on these findings, we project future changes in forest carbon stocks under climate warming scenarios.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p>Both temperature and mountain ash mortality rates have increased over time (Fig. 1). Temperatures in the region increased by 0.71\u00b0C between 1947 and 2000, with some noticeable variability from year-to-year. Over the same period, mortality rates for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E. regnans</emphasis> (adjusted for tree density and tree size) increased by 33%.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Temporal trends in temperature and mortality rates.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Mean annual temperature (MAT) anomalies vs. year for each plot.

The solid line shows the mean fitted value and the shaded area shows the 95% CI.</p><p>Statistical modeling of the effect of Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) on self-thinning showed that higher temperatures were associated with lower carrying capacity. The effect size was consistent whether the impact of temperature was modeled across space using static self-thinning allometries (Fig. 2 and Table 1: Eq. (1)) or in time using dynamic self-thinning allocations (Table 1: Eq. (2)) or a mix of both (Table 1: Eq. (3)). Carrying capacity was lowest for stands growing in the warmest conditions and further decreased with rising temperatures within each plot. On average, each additional one \u00b0C increase in temperature was associated with a 24.6% increase in mortality rates and a 9% reduction in the carrying capacity of mountain ash stands (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Based on these relationships, the model predicts that a three \u00b0C increase in MAT will result in a 24% decline in tree density and carbon content in these forests. The CSIRO RCP8.5 scenario projects this region will experience those temperatures by ~2080.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The influence of temperature on self-thinning allometry.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Effect of MAT1960\u22122000 on maximum stand stocking per ha.

Here, we predicted that a three \u00b0C increase in temperature will decrease the carrying capacity of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E. regnans</emphasis> by 24%. Trees that died were on average 0.62 times smaller than the surviving trees (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., they were suppressed trees), with no detectable effect of climate on this pattern.</p><p>Despite numerous studies on spatial variation in self-thinning21,22,42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48\u201349, we are only aware of four studies exploring temporal variation. Three from Northern Europe and Canada reported increased carrying capacities over time50, 51\u201352, while a fourth study spanning from Spain to Sweden found no significant temporal changes53. This geographical pattern suggests that the trend in carrying capacity may depend on regional climate constraints. In temperature-limited systems, increased carrying capacity may be due to longer growing seasons and higher CO2 concentrations54 or perhaps, in the case of European forests, to increased nitrogen deposition55,56. However, forests in warmer, seasonally dry climates face different limitations. In these systems, such as Mediterranean and temperate forests, including our mountain ash forests of southeast Australia, tall trees with high leaf area become increasingly vulnerable to atmospheric water demand as temperatures rise8, limiting the forests\u2019 ability to support high biomass levels. Our findings support this mechanism: as the climate warmed, mountain ash forests sustained fewer trees. While the strong correlation between temperature and VPD in our study region (Supplementary Fig. 2) makes their individual effects difficult to disentangle, this relationship suggest that warming effects may be mediated through rising VPD, an important driver of drought-induced plant mortality57,58.</p><p>Our results offer insights into the commonly used technique of space-for-time substitution. By using long-term experiments covering wide climatic gradients and leveraging recent self-thinning methods with improved temporal resolution, we were able to disentangle spatial and temporal variations in carrying capacity and identify climate as a causal factor. We found that a one degree temperature increase among sites (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., in space) and a one degree increase within sites (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., in time) had similar effect sizes. This provides compelling evidence for a projected decrease in carrying capacity due to climate warming and supports the often assumed but rarely tested space-for-time substitution59,60 for our case study.</p><p>Changes in forest carrying capacity have knock-on effects on many ecosystem services. Perhaps the most direct consequence is a drop in forest carbon stock. Here, we can distinguish between temporary and more permanent changes in the self-thinning line (Fig. 5). For example, during a multi-year heatwave or drought (Fig. 5a.), the forest\u2019s carrying capacity will temporarily drop (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., the forest becomes a carbon source) before recovering its initial trajectory as the conditions ease (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., the forest is once again a carbon sink). With climate warming, the drop in carrying capacity is likely to be more permanent (Fig. 5b).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Predicted effect of a transient vs. permanent three \u00b0C increase in temperature on the self-thinning trajectory.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Heatwaves cause a temporary reduction in the self-thinning line. As the conditions ease, the stand recovers its original trajectory. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Climate change might cause a more permanent reduction in the self-thinning line.</p><p>This predicted 24% drop in carrying capacity at the stand scale does not include the impact of rising risk posed by changes to fire regimes. Warmer temperatures and increasing aridity are likely to drive more frequent fires61, resulting in stands with lower carbon density62. Additionally, regeneration failures may cause less carbon-dense species to replace parts of the landscape63, 64\u201365, leading to a further reduction in carbon stocks beyond this predicted 24% decrease. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eucalyptus regnans</emphasis> forests are among the most carbon-dense on Earth, storing 450\u2013819 tonnes of carbon per ha in live trees66,67. Extrapolating the 24% carrying capacity drop to the million hectares of tall-open wet forests in Victoria and Tasmania would mean, at minimum (using the 450 tonnes carbon per ha value\u2013representative of a typical stands\u2013rather than the 819 tonnes carbon per ha value representative of old growth forests), a loss of around 108 million tonnes of carbon stock by 2080 compared to current conditions. For context, this would be equivalent to one million people driving 10,000 km per year for 75 years. The average car emission in Australia is ~146 g carbon per km68. This predicted carbon loss is also equivalent to the loss of 240,000 ha of mature mountain ash forests. The tall-open wet forests of the Central Highlands provide essential water supply for Melbourne\u2019s five million inhabitants. Recent studies highlighted that streamflow behavior and water yield were sensitive to self-thinning parameters69,70. This means that any alterations to the self-thinning line are likely to have implications for Melbourne\u2019s water supply.</p><p>Trees that died were consistently smaller than their neighbors (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., they were suppressed), averaging 62% of their diameter (Fig. 4). This size ratio was stable across all tested climatic gradients. While several studies report greater drought-related mortality among larger trees31, 32\u201333,71, others, including ours, find higher vulnerability among suppressed individuals32,34, 35\u201336. Reconciling these patterns requires accounting for relative size within a stand (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., social or canopy status), absolute size, and potential confounders such as stand structure and species composition. In mixed-species forests, the apparent vulnerability of large trees can stem from drought-sensitive taxa, particularly fast-growing pioneer species, dominating the upper canopy72, but see ref. 73 for an alternative view. Size effects may also be driven or amplified by indirect mortality agents, for example bark beetles which preferentially attack large pines during droughts74. By contrast, our monospecific, even-aged stands lack these confounders, and mortality concentrates among suppressed trees, consistent with self-thinning dynamics. The vulnerability of suppressed trees stems from physiological and morphological constraints: reduced light interception, smaller carbon reserves, and limited access to deep soil water due to shallow root systems75, 76, 77\u201378.</p><p>Changes in carrying capacity pose a significant challenge to global-scale tree restoration initiatives, which have been proposed as a key mitigation strategy to reduce atmospheric CO279. Despite their potential, such initiatives may not deliver their expected outcomes due to carrying capacity changes that are currently unaccounted for. The density-dependence nature of temperature and drought related mortality25 suggests that reducing stand density can improve forest resilience to climate change. The potential of forest thinning to mitigate drought stress has been highlighted in many studies6,80,81 although there is still debate on the consistency of this effect82. Our conceptual framework provides additional insights into this issue: as the self-thinning line drops, stands that were on the self-thinning line become overstocked and suffer excess mortality83, while stands with sufficiently low densities avoid being caught on the wrong side of the self-thinning line and fare better. We suggest using climate sensitive self-thinning diagrams and forecasted trajectories (Fig. 5) to guide density management recommendations in a changing environment. This will allow for the implementation of climate-smart forest management that promotes resilience in areas of the landscape where stands are vulnerable to climate change84. These results call for a broader investigation into the dynamic nature of carrying capacity, with significant implications for ecosystem services and the development of mitigation strategies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Case study species and area</emphasis></p><p>This study focuses on the tall-open wet forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. These forests are dominated by mountain ash (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E. regnans</emphasis>), the tallest angiosperm (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i.e</emphasis>., flowering plant) in the world. Living individuals reach heights of 100 meters39. Their great height and typical occurrence in mono-specific stands allow the forests to accumulate extraordinary amounts of aboveground carbon per unit area [&gt; 450\u2013819 tonnes carbon per ha66,67]. Tall-open wet forests cover an area of  ~1,000,000 ha spread across Tasmania and Victoria. Here, we focus specifically on the Central Highlands of Victoria, a mid-mountainous range located 80 km east of Melbourne, covering around 400,000 ha, including  ~30% of tall-open wet forests. In the Central Highlands, the tall-open wet forests occur from 200\u20131100 m above sea level with mean annual rainfall of 1000\u20131600 mm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Field data</emphasis></p><p>The data in this study come from a database of long-term silvicultural experiments in even-aged stands from Victoria\u2019s Central Highlands. Most of the experiments were started in the 1960s by the Victorian Forestry Commission to study the effect of thinning on growth and yield. Each experimental site had several permanent plots and included a range of thinning treatments, plus controls. Mean plot size was 2600 m2 (ranging from 400 m2 to 8000 m2). Individual trees within each plots were measured for diameter at breast height (DBH, measured at 1.3 m) and status (alive, dead) every 2\u20133 years until the late 1990s or early 2000s. The data was originally collected by the Forestry Commission. When the Forestry Commission was dis-established in 1983, the Victorian Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) and its precursors managed and curated the data.</p><p>We selected pure <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E. regnans</emphasis> plots from the database based on the following criteria37: more than 80% of the basal area was from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E. regnans</emphasis>, plots were sufficiently large (\u2265400 m2) with sufficiently long intercensus intervals (\u22650.5 year) and growth (\u0394<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis>\u22650.1 cm year\u22121). We excluded plots that experienced fire, psyllid infestation, or storm damage. For each plot and each measurement, we calculated the quadratic mean diameter (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis> in cm) and tree density (trees ha\u22121). For each pair of successive measurements on the same plot, we counted the number of dead trees (\u0394<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis>, in trees) and calculated the net increase in quadratic diameter (\u0394<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis>, in cm) during that period. In total, we had 1302 measurements from 112 plots, including 328 measurements from 40 unthinned control plots that showed no evidence of having experienced disturbance over their measurement period. See Supplementary Fig. 1 for the plot location and Supplementary Table 1 for the data summary.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modeling variation in self-thinning associated with variation in climatic conditions</emphasis></p><p>The self-thinning line describes the maximum number of trees of a given mean size that can be stocked per unit area. Since the maximum stocking level described by the self-thinning line depends on the amount of resources available, we expect it to decrease as climatic conditions become less favorable, which in these forests translates to being warmer and drier.</p><p>Self-thinning modeling methods fall into two categories: traditional methods based on static size-density allometry, and more recent methods based on the dynamic allocation between stand growth and mortality37. Static allometry methods are straightforward to use and well suited to detecting spatial variations in self-thinning and their environmental drivers. However, because static allometries integrate the impact of past conditions over the entire stand\u2019s lifespan, they are poorly suited to quantifying temporal changes in self-thinning. Dynamic allocation methods have better temporal resolution and can detect both spatial and temporal variations in self-thinning; however, they typically require more data than static allometry methods.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial variation in the self-thinning line based on static size-density allometry</emphasis></p><p>We first analysed spatial variation in the static size-density allometry associated with variation in mean climatic conditions among plots. We used linear mixed-effects models on selected control plots37 to estimate the self-thinning parameters. We accounted for repeated measurements per plot using plot-level random effects. The linear mixed-effects model that we used was:1where log(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis>ij) is the natural logarithm of tree density for observation <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> in plot <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>, which is modeled as being sampled from a Normal distribution with mean <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis>ij and standard deviation <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis>; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis>ij is the quadratic mean diameter associated with observation <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> in plot <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>; and  is the average mean annual temperature of plot <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> over the 1960 to 2000 period. Climate variables (temperature and precipitation) were extracted from 1 km resolution Australian Gridded Climate Data85.

AHMI combines MAT and precipitation in a simple ratio: . This metric, which is the inverse of the classic Martonne aridity index87, has proven valuable for modeling tree growth in the region41. Vapor pressure deficit, which measures the difference between actual and saturated air moisture, has been linked to drought-induced plant mortality58. Before fitting the models, we transformed the climate variables to simplify interpretation: MAT and VPD were centered, while P and AHMI were both centered and scaled. This ensured the intercept reflects the average population response.</p><p>Among the four climate predictors (parameters shown in Supplementary Table 2), only MAT and VPD had significant effects on the self-thinning line. The MAT model performed best in leave-one-plot-out cross-validation, with an RMSE of 0.131, compared to 0.136 for VPD, 0.154 for precipitation, and 0.152 for AHMI (see Supplementary Table 3). Given the strong correlation between MAT and VPD in our dataset (R = 0.96, see Supplementary Fig. 2), their similar performance was expected. However, due to VPD data availability (starting only from 1980 versus records extending back to 1900 for the other variables) and the lack of reliable VPD projections for future climate scenarios, we focused subsequent analyses on MAT while acknowledging that its effects may be mediated through increased atmospheric water demand (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., rising VPD).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatiotemporal variation in the self-thinning line based on growth\u2013mortality allocation</emphasis></p><p>We then used recent advances in self-thinning modeling to quantify both spatial and temporal changes in the self-thinning line linked to variation in climatic conditions.</p><p>We first used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with a Negative Binomial family and a log-link to calibrate a mortality model37.

The slope of the self-thinning line is calculated from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>1 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>2. The impact of climatic predictors on the self-thinning line is best understood as a modifier of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>0. The effect size of , , and MATij on the intercept of the self-thinning line is thus , , and , respectively. The relative reduction in carrying capacity associated with a one \u2218 C increase in temperature can be calculated by computing the exponent of these ratios. For example, if <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>5 = -0.22 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>2 = 2.4, then the additive impact of MATij on the intercept of the self-thinning line is  and the multiplicative impact of MATij on the carrying capacity is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>\u22120.09 = 0.91. In this example, for each degree increase in MATij, the carrying capacity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., maximum tree density per ha for a stand of a given quadratic mean diameter) of the forest drops by 9%. For a three \u00b0C increase in MATij, the carrying capacity of the forest is multiplied by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>\u22120.09\u00d73 = 0.76, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., a 24% drop.</p><p>We fit all models using the \u2018brms\u2019 package88 in R89 with weakly informative priors90. Uncertainty in the derived parameters was propagated by sampling from the joint posterior distribution (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., MCMC samples) of model parameters to obtain a posterior distribution for the derived parameters. We then summarized the posterior distribution by computing the mean and 95% credible intervals for each parameter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model evaluation</emphasis></p><p>We assessed the accuracy of the final models using three common metrics: the coefficient of determination (R2, Eq.(6)), root mean squared error (RMSE, Eq.(7)), and bias (Eq.(8)), all calculated using a leave-one-plot-out cross-validation procedure.678</p><p>In these equations, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis>i is the observed value (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., log(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis>) for Eq. (1) and mortality count and mortality rate for Eqs. (2) and (3)) for inventory <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and  is the model\u2019s prediction.  is the average observed value in the dataset.</p><p>To calculate these metrics, we used leave-one-plot-out cross-validation. This involved training the model on all data except one plot, predicting for the left-out plot, and repeating the process for each plot. We then used these out-of-sample predictions to compute the goodness-of-fit metrics.</p><p>On out-of-sample data, the static self-thinning allometry (Eq. (1)) had a R2 of 0.973, RMSE of 0.131, and bias of -0.010 in terms of log(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis>) (see Supplementary Table 3). The final mortality model (Eq. (3)) had a R2 of 0.984, RMSE of 58.9, and bias of -4.5 in terms of mortality count per ha and a R2 of 0.719, RMSE of 0.019, and bias of -0.0049 in terms of mortality rate (see Supplementary Table 3).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forecasting the impact of climate warming on carrying capacity</emphasis></p><p>To assess the impact of climate warming on forest carrying capacity, we computed the self-thinning line using a future climate that is three \u00b0C warmer than the current levels. This corresponds to the RCP8.5 scenario developed by CSIRO for the region41. We compared the effects of a transient (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">g</emphasis>., 10 year heatwave) versus a permanent (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">g</emphasis>., climate warming) three \u00b0C temperature increase on stand survival trajectory.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of relative tree size on mortality</emphasis></p><p>We tested the potential impact of climatic factors and year on the relative size of trees that die. In each successive pair of measurements on the same plot, we recorded the quadratic mean diameter of the live trees at the beginning of the period and the quadratic mean diameter of the trees that died by the end. The ratio of these two measurements is often referred to as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> factor, where .</p><p>We used linear mixed models to test whether the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> factor was influenced by climatic factors (MAT, precipitation, AHMI), temporal trends (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>., calendar year), and stand dominant height (Ho). We tested for dominant height as taller trees might be more susceptible to drought due to increased hydraulic constraints91. We used a plot-level random effect to account for the fact that measurement from the same plots are not independent. The model structure is shown in Eq. S7 in Supplementary Note 4. Parameter estimates for the fitted models are available in Supplementary Table 4. None of the tested predictors (climate variables, time trends, or dominant height) were significant, indicating that suppressed trees were consistently more likely to die than other trees across all conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC), through an ARC Discovery Project (DP220103711 to C.R.N., R.T., A.P.R., P.J.B., and M.J.D.).

This study proposes a real-time deep learning framework that combines the InceptionV3 architecture with Convolutional Block Attention Modules to enhance spatial and channel-level feature discrimination. The model is further optimized through a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">proposed attention</emphasis> module that intensifies attention to small and minute blood-related patterns, even under challenging conditions such as occlusions, motion blur, and low visibility. A dedicated benchmark dataset comprising over 9500 manually annotated CCTV images captured under diverse lighting and environmental scenarios is developed for model training and evaluation. It achieves a detection accuracy of 94.5%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores all exceeding 94%, outperforming baseline methods. These results demonstrate the effectiveness in accurately identifying blood traces in real-world surveillance footage, offering a practical and scalable solution for enhancing public health and safety monitoring.

These systems, equipped with the capability to analyze and interpret scenes in real time, play a crucial role in maintaining public safety and security2,3. Traditional surveillance techniques, often reliant on human observation, pose certain limitations due to the possibility of human errors, biases, and the demanding requirement of continuous monitoring. One particularly important aspect of surveillance, especially in remote settings such as crime scene inspection and medical diagnosis, is detecting the presence of bloods in a scene4. Blood presence can provide vital information about security issues or medical emergencies5. However, identifying blood, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments, can be challenging even for experienced human operators6.</p><p>Image processing techniques have shown promise in overcoming these challenges7. By employing sophisticated algorithms to analyze visual data, it is possible to detect specific features, such as the blood specific color and texture, more accurately and consistently than through human observation alone. These techniques can be implemented in an automated system, reducing the need for continuous human monitoring and improving the overall efficiency and reliability of the surveillance process8.</p><p>Modern Video surveillance system are design to enhance the safety of individual and properties9. These systems use CCTV cameras to monitor people\u2019s activities or other real-time information. The smart surveillance system is now widely used in public and private places because it provides improved security and safety2,10. It protects and activates an alarm on different activities like robbery, theft, and criminal activities happenings. The surveillance system utilizes human motion to detect suspicious activity and activate an alarm to alert the security guards to stop the ongoing activity. Recent research articles are available in the open literature, which covers the most recent methods for improving security using CCTV surveillance systems11, 12\u201313. However, this section reviews the most recent methods that potentially address different surveillance system applications.</p><p>Automated analysis of CCTV images and videos has been studied to detect any various situations14,15. For example, Marbach et al.16 proposed an automated fire detection algorithm in CCTV images by using temporal variation of fire intensity in the candidate region to determine the presence of fire and non-fire pixels. Similarly, Celik et al.17 and Gope et al.18 have developed color models to detect fire in video sequences or in still images. Benjamin et al.19, Liu et al.20, and Han et al.21 used different color spaces and developed models to detect fire and smoke in still images or in video sequences. Pedestrian detection is a difficult problem because people can show widely varying appearances in the scene. Malagon-Borja et al.22 detect pedestrians using PCA without knowing the prior knowledge of the scene. Cucchiara et al.23 developed a method to analyze human behaviors by calculating the frame wise projection histogram24. This method classifies the posture of the monitored person.</p><p>According to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior method that exists for CCTV surveillance systems, specifically designed to detect blood in real-world surveillance footage. However, many approaches have already been proposed for the detection of blood in endoscopic video. Most of the approaches are based on color-based features. For instance, Gopi et al.25 developed a bleeding detection algorithm specifically for capsule endoscopy by utilizing color texture features derived from orthogonal moments on HSV color images. The authors integrated the local binary pattern with color texture features and employed a multilayer perceptron neural network to detect bleeding within the vein. Pan et al.26 introduced a novel approach that used RGB variations and HSV saturation. Their method measures original color differences within the RGB space, and refines them using region-growing segmentation. Figueiredo et al.27 introduced a technique for detecting blood using the CIELab color space. Similarly, Abouelenien et al.28 implemented a method that leverages HSV histograms, dominant colors, and a co-occurrence matrix to identify blood. Furthermore, Ghosh et al.29 developed an approach that relies on the statistical descriptors from transformed RGB features. Yong et al.30 used the RGB color spaces and its conversion between the color spaces for the identification of bleeding and non-bleeding regions with endoscopic images. Pan et al.31, shows that the bleeding regions show dominant red, high saturation, and low brightness color configurations with in images and green and blue are relatively low as compared to the red color in the RGB color space. As deep learning (DL) models evolve, the enhanced learning capabilities of neural network architectures are increasingly replacing conventional image analysis techniques32. Recent studies have harnessed the power of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework to detect and classify blood regions in images33, 34\u201335. For instance, Abouelenien et al.34 incorporated CNNs with HSV histograms, dominant colors, and a co-occurrence matrix to detect blood in images. Ghosh et al.35 proposed a method that combines statistical features of a transformed RGB color space with CNNs for bleeding detection36. Proposed an enhanced model by using attention-enhanced model for detecting blood vessels in the OCT images.</p><p>CNN based models have proven effective, while on the other hand, most CNN-based models not only learn relevant features but unfortunately also learn from irrelevant features like noise37 and background information, which reduces overall performance. Learning from irrelevant features can significantly reduce the overall performance of the model. Inspired by human visual perception, which focuses on important regions within a complex scene, many researchers have proposed various attention modules that have been investigated in different domains38,39. Based on this, important regions representing the abnormality within the images are considered more significant compared to other regions. Attention-based mechanisms have been used alongside various deep CNN models, showing great potential in further enhancing CNN performance. These attention networks suppress redundant information in the feature map and focus more on effective features. They have been widely used in different tasks and improve the representational power of CNN networks by focusing on the dominant features while suppressing redundant and unnecessary ones. The attention mechanism extracts better feature effects and improves predictive power. Recent research focused on the development of more powerful attention mechanisms40 to improve CNN model performance. The Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) proposed by Woo et al.41 greatly improves CNN model performance by capturing important features in the feature maps. CBAM contains two different types of attention modules: The Channel Attention Module (CAM) and the Spatial Attention Module (SAM), which make the model focus more on the important regions within the image. Multi-scale convolutional operations allow CNN-based models to focus on more relevant and concise features and enable the module to better capture the spatial relationships between features, thus improving the performance of the module42,43.</p><p>While CNN models have shown strong capabilities in detecting blood-related conditions, several limitations and challenges remain. First, many existing studies have concentrated on identifying a single type of blood anomaly. As a result, these models are proficient at specific tasks but may struggle with more complex real-world scenarios. We argue that there is a critical need to develop a more comprehensive blood detection system that can identify various blood conditions concurrently. Secondly, there is a notable lack of datasets featuring authentic blood images annotated with multiple conditions. Studies have shown that there can be significant correlations between different blood samples from the same patient. We have addressed these issues by developing our own benchmark dataset for more effective evaluation and advancement in this area. In this study, we present the BloodNet system, an automated and accelerated multiclass deep learning classification tool specifically designed to detect blood in CCTV images. Our approach begins by extracting discriminative deep feature representations from blood images. This is achieved by feeding the images into multiple deep learning blocks, which act as feature descriptors, often referred to as the backbone. Next, these extracted features undergo refinement and are integrated into a unified feature representation using the attention block. Finally, a trained model, combined with a Softmax layer, generates a probability distribution for three distinct blood conditions, acting as a non-linear classifier. By following this method, BloodNet effectively addresses the challenges of blood detection in CCTV footage, making the process faster and more accurate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main contributions</emphasis></p><p>We have offered the main contributions, which can be summarized as follows:</p><p>The primary contribution of this work is the development of a new dataset named \u201cBloodCCTV-9500\u201d, curated from diverse media sources, which serves as the foundation for detecting multiple blood abnormalities in various scenarios. It includes a wide variety of complex blood scenes, designed to enhance the adaptability of the proposed systems for real-time scenario.</p><p>This paper introduces a new model for classifying blood in complex CCTV footage. The proposed model utilizes InceptionV3 architecture due to its effective features extraction tailored specially for blood detection in complex scenario and a multi-scale attention module, enabling it to extract features from the most relevant regions in CCTV images. InceptionV3 captures global representations of blood regions. In our study, we assessed the performance of several CNN model backbones to identify the most effective one for feature extraction. After selecting a high-performance backbone, we integrated an attention block designed to capture additional high-level feature representations. This enhancement helps in distinguishing different classes of blood images by leveraging the backbone network\u2019s output. Our proposed network block also incorporates channel-wise attention, which refines and fuses features by utilizing discriminative feature maps generated in the previous step.</p><p>We demonstrate that the proposed BloodNet system outperforms all other tested backbone models. This evaluation is conducted using our proposed dataset, which comprises a diverse collection of challenging blood images representing three distinct blood scenarios.</p><p>We performed extensive experiments and ablation studies to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-scale model in achieving high classification accuracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paper organization</emphasis></p><p>This paper is structured to guide readers through our research on optimizing CCTV blood detection using a multi-scale deep learning approach. Section 3 presents the dataset creation criteria and explains the architecture of the proposed network. This section also discusses the BloodCCTV-9500 dataset, shares our empirical results, and provides a comparative analysis. Finally, in Sect. 4, we summarize our findings and suggest potential directions for future research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed methodology</emphasis></p><p>In this section, we present an overview of BloodCCTV-9500, the architecture of the blood detection network, and a feasibility study. Additionally, we discuss the modifications made to the InceptionV3 model to improve detection capabilities. Figure 3 shows a visual representation of the general workflow, encompassing the stages of training, testing, and applying the proposed model. Further details are provided in the following sub-sections.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dataset generation and sample selection criteria</emphasis></p><p>We have made a significant contribution to the field of blood detection by developing and annotating a novel medium-scale benchmark dataset. The dataset is curated with the help of domain field experts and validated by experts to visually verify the presence of blood spot in each and every individual image. From extensive review of recent literature, it can be concluded that BloodCCTV-9500 is the most challenging dataset compare of different types of challenging scenario. BloodCCTV-9500 includes visual samples for varying illumination, diverse and challenging environments, backgrounds, and a range of blood spot appearances in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our dataset is unique and focus on blood detection, which address the gaps by being the first of its kind specific real-world scenarios and application.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dataset description</emphasis></p><p>BloodCCTV-9500 includes a collection of images for both indoor and outdoor environments, which addresses the challenge across various backgrounds. It consists of wide ranges of lighting conditions, to ensure the model generalization in recognition under different illumination levels. This collection of different lighting condition represent the real-world conditions. Additionally, BloodCCTV-9500 presents specific challenges such as blood visibility at various backgrounds and degree of occlusion. The most challenging aspect of is the variations in the color and texture of blood spots at different background. These crucial factors are particularly important during creation of dataset to ensure its generalization to detect blood presence in complex scenarios. The collection of different images in a variety of backgrounds, similar colored objects, tests the model\u2019s performance to distinguish the presence of blood in challenging ways. We also applied standard image augmentation techniques including rotation, horizontal flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustment to improve the model\u2019s robustness and reduce overfitting. These techniques helped in simulating real-world variability in these images and were important in improving model generalization.</p><p>In order to ensure the transparency and reproducibility of the results, we plan to publicly release of BloodCCTV-9500 and code implementation, for future research by broader community. This will allow other researchers to test and improve upon our work, promoting further advancements in blood detection and related fields.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison</emphasis></p><p>To date, few datasets have focused specifically on blood detection in CCTV surveillance footage, making BloodCCTV-9500 a novel contribution. While there is existing dataset available specifically for medical imaging and endoscopic blood detection, these focus on controlled environments with high-resolution images. BloodCCTV-9500 consists of different images belonging to three scenarios including blood on floor in outdoor setting, blood in indoor setting and collection of blood on various items which pose threat to person security. BloodCCTV-9500 is tailored specially for real-world surveillance contexts, which are more challenging due to lower resolution, variable lighting, and occlusion.</p><p>Comparing our dataset to public medical imaging dataset (e.g., those used for endoscopy) highlights how our dataset captures more realistic, dynamic scenarios. The images in our dataset simulate actual CCTV footage, featuring lower-resolution images, diverse appearances, and background noise typical of surveillance footage. This makes BloodCCTV-9500 especially well-suited for testing algorithms designed for real-time blood detection in challenging environments. Some sample images and the distribution of images in each class are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Collection of samples of images in BloodCCTV-9500. Subfigure (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) shows the sample blood on floor; (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis>) shows the collection of indoor scenes while subfigure (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C</emphasis>) shows the collection of images on the presence of blood on different items.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Distribution of images in different classes in Blood CCTV-9500.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ethical considerations</emphasis></p><p>The use of CCTV footage for research purposes raises important ethical and privacy concerns. In this study, we ensured that all collected images in the BloodCCTV-9500 dataset were sourced from publicly available on social media platform repositories and included in a manner that avoids revealing any personally identifiable information. During dataset preparation, we have ensure that sensitive regions were manually reviewed and cropped to ensure individual privacy. This dataset was developed exclusively for academic research only and can be obtained for further research purposes upon request.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InceptionV3 architecture</emphasis></p><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a crucial role in deep learning, particularly for object classification using image data. Instead of relying on general matrix multiplication, CNNs utilize convolutional operations. Typically, a CNN consists of three main layers: the input layer, which prepares the data for processing; hidden layers, which connect the input and output layers; and the output layer, which produces the results.</p><p>In our research, we utilize InceptionV3 as the backbone model. InceptionV3 is an advanced version of the original Inception-V1 model, incorporates several optimization techniques to enhance its adaptability, and offers greater network complexity and improved recognition performance over its earlier versions. In this research, we have used transfer learning which allows the model to retain the weights of earlier layers while adapting the final layer to new categories. This enhances training efficiency by reusing low-level learned features. Moreover, we have optimized the InceptionV3 architecture framework to balance precision and efficiency. Our proposed solution is effective in real-time blood detection, offering high performance in challenging environments. It performs robustly across diverse, complex scenarios, demonstrating strong recognition capability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed network</emphasis></p><p>We present two significant enhancements in the network architecture to achieve high performance on our proposed BloodCCTV-9500 blood detection dataset. First, we incorporated a proposed module at the beginning of the backbone to improve intermediate feature extraction from the images. Additionally, we have removed the final layer from this module and introduced an attention block module to further enhance the intermediate features before making the final recognition. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model, we used the existing learned weights and parameters, enabling the network to effectively capture domain-specific visual features. The feature extraction pipeline of a pre-trained network is inherently robust and diverse, making it an excellent starting point for any vision-based classification task. Our pipeline encompasses feature extraction, integration of attention mechanisms, and final classification to achieve optimal performance (Fig. 3).</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>General depiction of the proposed framework.</p><p>Building on the success depicted in Fig. 4, which illustrates the InceptionV3 architecture for blood detection, we draw inspiration from successful feature extraction strategy across various computer vision domains. To optimize feature selection for blood classification tasks, particularly in extremely challenging scenarios, we utilize several backbone feature extractors. These include Xception, MobileNet, ResNet50, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3. Our experimental results in Section IV demonstrate that InceptionV3 offers superior feature extraction for blood detection tasks. Theoretically, InceptionV3 surpasses its predecessors due to its enhanced Inception modules, which have been refined for better performance. One of the most remarkable aspects of Inception modules is their multi-scale processing capability, which yields superior results across numerous tasks. InceptionV3 incorporates three fundamental Inception modules: Inception (A), (B), and (C). Each module features multiple convolutional and pooling layers operating in parallel as shown in Fig. 4.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Multi-branch convolutional pathway of InceptionV3 module.</p><p>These layer leverage compact filter sizes such as 1 \u00d7 1, 3 \u00d7 3, 1 \u00d7 3, and 3 \u00d7 1 to effectively minimize the number of trainable parameters. InceptionV3 processes input images that are typically sized as 299 \u00d7 299 \u00d7 3. Initially, the image passed in five through 5 convolutional layers, each utilizing multiple 3 \u00d7 3 kernels. In our proposed framework, we have removed the final dense layers from the InceptionV3 model. This modification yields a feature vector with dimensions of 8 \u00d7 8 and 2048 channels, denoted by \u03b1. This transformation is mathematically expressed in Eq. 1:1</p><p>Where \u03b6 represents each Inception modules and \u00b5 represents the initial convolutional operation performed on the input \u03c7. Because of the operation utilizing Eq. 1, we have obtained a feature vector presented by \u03b1 which contains different information from the images including its structure and other details, etc. To improve classification accuracy and mitigate misclassification issues, we incorporated a modified attention module. This addition enhances the extraction of both channel-specific and spatial details. As illustrated in Fig. 5, this augmented approach significantly refines our detection capabilities.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Modified spatial attention with variable kernel size.</p><p>These enhancements are designed to improve the model\u2019s accuracy and computational efficiency. A comprehensive explanation of each modification is provided in the following subsections.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed attention network</emphasis></p><p>In our framework, we have removed the last layer from the InceptionV3 module and integrated a modified attention block to refine and enhance features before making final predictions. These architectural modifications are design to boost the model\u2019s overall accuracy and efficiency. While Integrating a CA module with backbone model features can be effective in simpler scenarios, such as distinguishing between blood and non-blood objects. However, it falls short in more complex cases that require precise blood detection and localization. To address this, we incorporate both CA and modified SA modules into our proposed network. This integration enhances the model\u2019s ability to focus on critical regions for blood detection. Our attention scheme effectively extracts the most significant blood regions, thereby improving the precision and accuracy of blood identification in various challenging contexts. The details of the proposed framework are further explained in the next subsection.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Channel Attention (CA)</emphasis>: CA plays an important role by enabling the models to focus on the most informative channels within the feature map. It consists of enhance attention mechanism which involves several computational steps which are specially designed to enhance the model\u2019s focus and recognition performance. Initially, it computes both global average and max pooling operations across each channel in the intermediate extracted feature map. These operations combined aggregate useful information on a channel-by-channel basis and capturing the overall importance features of each channel. The pooled features are then passed through a shared multi-layer perceptron layer, which includes fully connected layers with nonlinear activations. This layer is important for enhancing the discriminative power by inter channel dependencies. The output of this layer is further processed by a sigmoid activation function, producing an attention map that highlights the importance of each channel. This enhance feature map indicates and represent the most important across each channel. During inference process, the attention map is applied element-wise to the original feature map, thereby refining the feature representation. As a result, channels are scaled according to their attention values, effectively amplifying the informative channels while diminishing the impact of the less useful ones. This mechanism allows the model to focus computational resources on the most discriminative features. Consider \u03b1 be the feature map, which is generated by the application of InceptionV3 model on each image. This feature map yields two distinct spatial background descriptions: \u03b1Cavg and \u03b1Cmax. Mathematically:23</p><p>By these operations, the output of \u03b1Cavg and \u03b1Cmax is generated by two fully connected (FC) layers, f c1 and f c2, which utilizes the ReLU activation function to extract both Mmax and Mavg. By combining it, the weight coefficients Mc(\u03b1) are calculated as follows:456</p><p>In this approach, f c1 and f c2 use 1 \u00d7 1 convolution operations to expand and compress the features to optimize each channel. The \u2296 symbol stands for the ReLU function, while \u2295 signifies the addition operation. By adding Mmax and Mavg, we derive the final, more concise features, Mc (\u03b1). To ensure a smooth feature flow, a skip connection \u2297 is incorporated, leading to the creation of the CA map Fc:7</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modified Spatial attention</emphasis></p><p>This mechanism improves a neural network\u2019s ability to focus on important spatial region within feature maps. This process involves a few key steps. Initially, global max pooling and average pooling operations are applied across the channel dimension of the input feature maps. These pooling operations generate two separate 2D maps that summarize the spatial context by capturing the most and average activated features across all channels. This allows the model to highlight spatial regions of interest by emphasizing their relative importance.89</p><p>The pooled outputs, \u03b1Savg and \u03b1Smax, are concatenated and then passed into a convolutional layer to generate a spatial attention map. This map assigns importance to different spatial locations, allowing the model to emphasize informative regions while suppressing irrelevant ones. The final refined feature map, denoted as MsFc, which is computed using the following method:10</p><p>Here, f represents the filter size in each convolution operations. Additionally, global average pooling operation is applied to generate an enhanced feature descriptor:1112</p><p>The concatenated features are then batch normalized, and the final feature map FCS is generated by combining batch normalization with \u03b1:13</p><p>In our approach, the extracted feature maps are first passed through a dense layer with 150 neurons, followed by a softmax layer. To improve recognition performance in complex scenarios, we integrate dual attention modules that generate enhanced feature representations. The resulting features are then passed through three fully connected layers with 64, 32, and 2 neurons, respectively.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussion</emphasis></p><p>In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of our experimental setup and results.

The results showed that these classical models significantly low on the BloodCCTV-9500 dataset, achieving minimal accuracies of only 53.5%, 63.8%, and 74% respectively.

Overall patterns show significant overlap and making it difficult for conventional classifiers to distinguish between classes based on color distribution alone.

The configurations explore the effectiveness of CA, SA, and combinations of both (CA + SA) on different evaluation matrics. In simpler configurations where only CA or SA is applied, the recognition performance remains consistent with an accuracy of 92.28%, precision at 92.66%, recall at 92.20%, and an F1 score of 90.66%.

Further experimentation with different kernel sizes, such as 1 \u00d7 1, 7 \u00d7 7, and 1 \u00d7 1, leads to marginal improvements in performance metrics, maintaining accuracy in the range of 92.41\u201392.47%, with precision and recall around 91.66% and 91.33%, respectively. This indicates that overly large kernels (e.g., 7 \u00d7 7) may introduce excessive smoothing and reduce spatial specificity, while overly small kernels may not capture sufficient contextual detail46,47. The proposed model, which uses the kernel configuration of 1 \u00d7 1, 3 \u00d7 3, and 1 \u00d7 1, archives the best over results for all matrices. This combination benefits from the 1 \u00d7 1 kernel\u2019s channel-wise compression and projection, and the 3 \u00d7 3 kernel\u2019s ability to extract rich spatial features from localized regions. The 1 \u00d7 1 layers help enhance representation learning without introducing high computational cost46.

Figure 13 shows the training accuracy and training loss of the proposed model over 30 epochs. The training accuracy increases and saturates near 96%, which show a strong indication that the BloodNet model learns effectively from the training data. The training loss curve also decreases and stabilizes at a very low value, reflecting convergence and minimized error. It show that the proposed model demonstrates efficient learning and optimization. Therefore, it can be concluded from Fig. 13 that the proposed model is well-trained without significant signs of under fitting or overfitting during the training phase.</p><p>Fig. 12</p><p>Ablation study based on attention network order and kernel size.</p><p>Fig. 13</p><p>Training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>In the field of computer vision and image analysis, the application of CNNs has greatly enhanced performance across a variety of tasks. In this research, we introduced a system specifically designed for blood detection in challenging and dynamic environments. We employed the InceptionV3 models as backbone feature extractor and a novel dual attention mechanism. Our model significantly improved blood detection recognition which has the enhance capability even in complex scenarios. The proposed model, integrates a proposed module in the backbone and an attention-over-attention mechanism before classification, which performed better than other state-of-the-art approaches. Our model shows high recognition performance, and a classification accuracy of 94.5%. These results show the effectiveness of combining CA and SA mechanisms with the InceptionV3 architecture, making it particularly best choice for real-time blood detection in CCTV surveillance systems. For future work, we plan to develop a more diverse, large scale dataset that includes more scenarios and additional classes with even more complex environments, such as extreme lighting conditions and additional types of occlusions. This expanded large scale dataset will further improve the model\u2019s generalization to real-world surveillance scenarios. We also plan to investigate advanced attention mechanisms, such as Vision Transformers, in future iterations to potentially enhance the model\u2019s ability to focus on complex visual cues. In addition, we aim to optimize our model architecture for real-time deployment by exploring lightweight variants that reduce computational load while maintaining strong classification performance. This will support integration into edge devices for practical surveillance applications.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Aliouat, A. Kouadria, N.

Attacks are a serious risk for neural network security; recent defence mechanisms remain restricted concerning their applicability to real-world environments. The influence of adversarial attacks is essential, as they can challenge the security and reliability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in crucial applications.

The smart medical care method contains IoMT gadgets generally utilized to control clinical traffic constantly. The medical care traffic conveyed to AI allows the structure to understand the development of many intellectual medical care methods, like disease prediction and remote medical monitoring2. Nevertheless, IoMT also presents substantial cybersecurity difficulties; this effect on patients\u2019 medical and patient confidentiality is a primary concern nowadays. As the IoHT becomes progressively incorporated into medical care methods, the risk of cyber threats focusing on sensitive medical information elevates, posing severe attacks on patient privacy and the integrity of the medical care framework3. Hackers are individuals who pose an attack on data models. Hackers utilize device and network flaws to guide business costs, destructive operations, and customers financially4. The primary goal of intrusion detection is to distinguish between abnormal and normal data violations. System security protects networks, systems, data, programs, and user accounts from modification, disruption, or unauthorized access. A single intrusion can promptly make the method inaccessible and affect the organization5. Detecting intrusions is a crucial challenge in cyber security. DL and ML approaches recognize abnormal behaviourIntrusion Detection System (IDS) behaviour. Either linear or non-linear DL/ML classifiers are susceptible to adversarial threats that deceive classification methods. IDS is vulnerable to Adversarial threats, which are substantial threats to advanced AI applications, particularly with the growing utilization of data-oriented models and internet-based applications in significant fields like cybersecurity and biometric authentication6.</p><p>Adversarial threats pose a risk while employed to modify the classification. A slight disruption could allow malware to bypass recognition. An effectual adversarial threat on an IDS can bypass recognition, posing an immediate attack on ML-based IDS. In this context, the developing subject of FL has demonstrated feasible solutions for protecting confidentiality in smart medical care systems7. FL is a kind of distributed AI that permits the distributed methods trained by averaging the local techniques upgraded from several IoMT systems without admitting the local information8. FL is an emerging theory that allows the collaborative training of a DL technique for thousands of participants. The primary objective of FL is to establish a joint ML technique over localized datasets while offering a confidential guarantee that is an attractive model for several developing backgrounds like crowdsourced systems and edge computing9. Consequently, possible hazards of disclosing consumer preferences and sensitive patient data might be lessened by utilizing the FL method. Furthermore, the FL method increases medical training performance by gathering computation resources and massive datasets from local IoMT gadgets, which may not be possible when utilizing the centralized AI method10. Generally, the FL model guarantees data confidentiality by permitting individual IoHT gadgets to cooperatively train a global method without sharing local information, thus keeping patient privacy.</p><p>This study presents an Adversarial Attack Detection Framework Using Federated Learning Empowered IoT Medical (AADF-FLEIoTM) model.

These approaches mostly face difficulty with the scalability of federated models in large, dynamic networks and the computational cost of training complex models in distributed settings. Furthermore, there is a lack of universal applicability across diverse IoT systems, as many methods are tailored to specific environments (e.g., medical devices or smart cities). Moreover, while privacy-preserving methods, namely differential privacy and blockchain, are utilized, the trade-off between data privacy and model performance remains challenging, as overly stringent privacy measures may impact detection accuracy. Finally, the efficiency of these methods in real-time, resource-constrained environments remains underexplored.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p>This study presents a novel AADF-FLEIoTM model. The main intention of the AADF-FLEIoTM model is to improve adversarial attack detection using FL and an advanced hybrid model. To perform that, the AADF-FLEIoTM technique contains data normalization, MPA-based feature selection, attack classification using SA-CNN-BiLSTM, and parameter selection. Figure 1 depicts the workflow of the AADF-FLEIoTM technique.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Workflow of AADF-FLEIoTM model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data normalization: Min-Max</emphasis></p><p>At first, the data normalization stage executed min-max normalization to scale and transform data into a consistent range29. This model is chosen for scaling data as it usually transforms features to a fixed range [0, 1]. This technique ensures that all features contribute equally to the model, preventing features with more extensive numerical ranges from dominating the learning process. It is specifically effectual when the data is bounded, and the model assumes all features should have a similar scale, such as neural networks or algorithms sensitive to distance metrics. Compared to other methods, namely Z-score normalization, Min-Max is simpler and more intuitive, particularly when the minimum and maximum values of the data are known and consistent. However, it can be sensitive to outliers, a trade-off related to methods less affected by extreme values.</p><p>Data standardization is essential for making calculations easier, which the data normalization model achieves. Min-Max normalization is applied to perform the data normalization and is specified as follows:1</p><p>The data applied to the process is exposed as , and the normalized data is presented as . The lowest value is shown as , and the highest as . Formerly, the essential features were selected from the normalized data utilizing the presented optimization model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feature selection process: MPA</emphasis></p><p>For the feature selection process, the proposed AADF-FLEIoTM designs an MPA to identify and retain the most relevant features30. This technique is highly efficient for feature selection as it replicates the search for optimal solutions in a complex search space, making it appropriate for identifying the most relevant features in high-dimensional datasets. Compared to other approaches, MPA is robust against local minima, giving fast convergence, and adapts well to non-linear feature relationships. It also needs fewer parameters to be fine-tuned, which simplifies its implementation. The merit of the MPA model is in its balance between exploration and exploitation, enabling it to efficiently search large feature spaces and improve the performance of ML models. Furthermore, the global search capability of the MPA method outperforms conventional greedy-based methods or simple filters, providing improved accuracy and scalability. Figure 2 describes the steps involved in the MPA method.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Steps involved in the MPA method.</p><p>A marine predator optimization algorithm is presented using the predominant foraging strategies used by marine predators, especially the Brownian and Levy movement patterns, and the optimum rate of encounter tactics examined in predator-prey biological interactions. The MPA is a population-based model, while the primary solutions, related to those in other meta-heuristic methods, are uniformly distributed through the search space:2</p><p>Whereas  and  represent the lower and upper limits of the variables inside the problem area,  indicates a uniformly distributed random variable range between -1).

The component ,  signifies the  size of the  prey. The matrices Prey and Elite share similar measures.</p><p>The optimization procedure of the MPA is structured into three stages, defined by changing speed ratios: the exploration stage, the transitional stage among exploitation and exploration, and the exploitation stage. In the first stage, after the iteration count is below one-third of the maximal iterations. After the speed ratio is higher , or after the predator\u2019s velocity surpasses that of the prey, this stage is associated with the initial phases of the optimizer iterations. The mathematic expression for this stage is as shown:</p><p>Whereas 5.</p><p>On the other hand,  means vector made from arbitrary numbers originating from normal distributions, which characterizes Brownian motion.

The  product and the elite mimic the predator\u2019s movement in Brownian motion, whereas the prey upgrades its location according to this movement. In the third stage of the model, considered by a lower speed ratio , the predator travels quicker than the prey. The subsequent mathematical pattern characterizes this stage:</p><p>However  ter8.</p><p>Environmental aspects, like the formation of vortices or the effects of fish aggregating devices (FADs), can considerably change marine predators\u2019 behaviour. Besides the impact of these features, predators might be required to carry out lengthy leaps through various dimensions to find environments with other prey distributions. FADs can signify local bests inside an exploration region, and setting long leaps in the model optimization procedure can prevent getting stuck in these local ideals. In this regard, FADs represent the probability that affects the model optimizer procedure, generally set at 0.2.  denotes a binary vector sequence randomly produced as  or 1, whereas  denotes a randomly generated number amongst (,1).

This integration provides a robust model for detection and classification tasks, particularly in time-series and sequential data. CNN outperforms extracting spatial features from input data, while BiLSTM captures past and future dependencies, improving the model\u2019s understanding of sequential patterns. Adding Self-Attention allows the model to concentrate on crucial parts of the input sequence, enhancing its capability to capture long-range dependencies and relevant data. This hybrid approach outperforms conventional models by utilizing the merits of each component, presenting improved accuracy and efficiency in detecting complex patterns in data. Compared to simpler models, SA-CNN-BiLSTM is more robust, adaptive, and capable of handling diverse, large-scale datasets with improved performance. Figure 3 depicts the infrastructure of the SA-CNN-BiLSTM model.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Architecture of SA-CNN-BiLSTM method.</p><p>A CNN is a multi-layer feedforward NN.

It mimics human vision and splits dissimilar areas with several weights to illustrate the difference. AM has recently been extensively applied in the domain of DL because it can strengthen main information and weaken incorrect data. The computation method for the AM is separated into 3 phases. In the initial phase, the attention score related to all keys is gained by computing the similarities between the key and the query. In this second phase, the attention scores are standardized utilizing the function of Softmax to get the weight coefficients. In the third phase, dissimilar weighting coefficients are summed and weighted to underline the main information and disregard insignificant details.

This model was chosen due to its nature-inspired exploration-exploitation balance, which makes it highly effective for optimization tasks. The algorithm replicates the predatory behaviour of hawks, allowing it to explore vast search spaces while refining solutions through targeted exploitation. Compared to conventional optimization methods like grid search or gradient-based techniques, RTH can handle complex, non-linear, and multi-modal problems better. Its capability to adapt dynamically to diverse problem landscapes improves its robustness and efficiency in tuning model hyperparameters. Furthermore, RTH is less likely to get trapped in local optima, giving a more global search strategy and yielding better results, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. This flexibility and resilience make RTH a robust choice over other techniques. Figure 4 demonstrates the structure of the RTH approach.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Architecture of RTH methodology.</p><p>In general, the conventional and mathematical optimizer models frequently fail to acquire the best values of the systems.

The main intention of the AADF-FLEIoTM model is to enhance adversarial attack detection using FL and an advanced hybrid model. At first, the data normalization stage utilized min-max normalization to scale and transform data into a consistent range. The proposed AADF-FLEIoTM employed an MPA model to identify and retain the most relevant features for the feature selection process. Besides, the hybrid of the SA-CNN-BiLSTM technique was utilized for the detection and classification process. Finally, the RTH optimizer model optimally alters the hyperparameter values of the SA-CNN-BiLSTM approach, resulting in more excellent classification performance. The AADF-FLEIoTM approach is examined on the IoT healthcare security dataset. The performance validation of the AADF-FLEIoTM approach illustrated a superior accuracy value of 98.24% over existing models. The limitations of the AADF-FLEIoTM approach comprise various key areas. Firstly, the model is evaluated utilizing a single dataset, which may limit its generalizability to other IoT/IoMT scenarios with diverse attack types or data distributions. Secondly, while the system performs well in controlled environments, it may face difficulty to adapt to real-time conditions where data might be noisy or incomplete. Furthermore, the computational complexity of certain algorithms could affect their scalability in large IoT networks with limited resources. Future work could concentrate on expanding the evaluation of the model to encompass diverse real-world datasets and explore optimization techniques for improved scalability and real-time adaptation. Moreover, the integration of anomaly detection methods could be examined to improve system robustness against previously unseen attack patterns.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia under grant no.

According to news reporting originating from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The global increase in wildfires due to climate change highlights the need for accurate wildfire mapping.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Organismo Autonomo Parques Nacionales; Ministry of Universities. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Instituto de Oceanografia y Cambio Global: \"This study performs a proof of concept on the usefulness of SuperDove imagery for wildfire mapping. To address this topic, we present an automatic methodology that combines the use of various vegetation indices with clustering algorithms (bisecting k-means and k-means) to analyze images before and after fires, with the aim of improving the precision of the burned area and severity assessments. The results demonstrate the potential of using this PlanetScope sensor, showing that the methodology effectively delineates burned areas and classifies them by severity level, in comparison with data from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Thus, the potential of the SuperDove satellite sensor constellation for fire monitoring is highlighted, despite its limitations regarding radiometric distortion and the absence of Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands, suggesting that the methodology could contribute to better fire management strategies.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Automatic Methodology for Forest Fire Mapping with SuperDove Imagery.

As a huge wildfire continues to burn in central New Jersey on April 24, smoke from the blaze is expected to reach residents in New York City some 60 miles away, prompting an air quality alert. The air quality will be unhealthy for sensitive groups and residents will start to smell and see smoke, New York City Emergency Management predicted. The alert covered Manhattan along with the Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland. The Jones Road wildfire, which started the morning of April 22 in southern Ocean County, New Jersey, burned 13,250 and was 50% contained as of the evening of April 23. Officials said that while firefighters had made progress on containing the blaze, it was expected to keep burning until the area sees a soaking rain, likely not until the end of the week. Heavy smoke from the fire was affecting visibility in the neighboring townships, where residents have been allowed to return to their homes after about 5,000 people were evacuated. Authorities in New Jersey arrested 19-year-old Joseph Kling of Ocean Township and charged him with arson for allegedly causing the fire after leaving a bonfire improperly extinguished. More: Man arrested for arson after bonfire ignites Jones Road wildfire, authorities say Fire could be one of New Jersey's biggest The blaze was threatening to become the biggest in New Jersey in 20 years, officials said. Shawn LaTourette, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said the damage is expected to spread, but in uninhabited forest areas. Embers from the fire sparked several small blazes near a decommissioned Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in Waretown, according to state officials. \"New Jersey has some of the most volatile wildland fire fuels in the entire country,\" New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief Bill Donnelly said at a news conference. \"Everybody's used to seeing California and things like that, that chaparral that burns up the hills and goes crazy. These Pine Barrens out here are the exact same type of fuel model. They're just like having napalm spread across the ground.\" Business destroyed in wildfire: 'Gut-wrenching' There were no reported injuries in the fire, but multiple officials said a building in Lacey Township's industrial park was destroyed, along with multiple outbuildings and vehicles. Twelve structures remained under threat. Bob Nosti, owner of Liberty Door and Awning, arrived the morning of April 23 to find his business burned to the ground. He wasn't worried about it a day earlier, because the flames were two towns away, Nosti told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network. But the blaze moved quickly. \"Then all of a sudden, my building was gone an hour later,\" he said. \"It's gut-wrenching for sure, but we'll be all right. We'll rebuild - and we'll build it bigger and better.\" More Americans are breathing polluted air The air quality alerts on April 24 come as smoke and smog from wildfires have caused tens of millions of Americans to breathe toxic air, even though man-made pollutants have decreased, a study by the American Lung Association found. The study found that 25 million more people in the U.S. than last year's report are breathing air that scores a failing grade in terms of pollutants that can cause premature death, impair cognitive abilities and trigger asthma attacks. It's also more than any other report in a decade. Read more: Tens of millions more Americans are breathing polluted air. What places have it the worst? Nearly half of the country lives in areas that received a failing grade for either particle pollution - fine particulate matter created when things burn - or ozone pollution, according to the report. Almost 43 million live in places that failed both pollution measures. Many of the hotspots for such pollution are along the West Coast.

The prolonged dry spell comes after the UK experienced its wettest ever 18 months in the period through March 2024, resulting in <url normalizedValue=\"https://ahdb.org.uk/news/are-uk-grain-imports-slowing-grain-market-daily\">record wheat imports</url> for a nation that's usually close to self-sufficiency.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/04/15/819801.htm\">Europe's Hottest Year Turbocharged Extreme Weather Across Region</url></p><p>Climate change has seen Europe warm twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, triggering wild weather swings from wilting heat to the torrential downpours and flooding that hit the region last year. Now, after just three months of 2025, both the UK and Ireland are on track for one of their worst wildfire seasons in decades.</p><p>There were just six days of measurable rainfall in March, the fewest in more than 70 years, Met Office figures show.</p><p>Spring crops are struggling to germinate in parched fields, said Ben Cooper, a grain and cattle farmer in Wiltshire, England. While winter crops have been able to develop, they need a \"solid day or two of steady rain\" to make up for the lack of moisture, he added.</p><p>About 90% of spring wheat crops were either not yet planted or hadn't emerged in March, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://ahdb.org.uk/cereals-oilseeds/crop-development-report\">Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board data</url>.

The conditions helped the region recover from a wet winter, but additional spring rain is \"essential\" to avoid a drop in crop yields, it said.</p><p>Wildfire Threat </p><p>The dryness has led to <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/METclimate/status/1912166623324328159\">partial droughts</url> in Ireland, while river levels in northern and western parts of the UK are exceptionally low. Average flow in at least five rivers, including the Tyne, Dee and Mourne, dropped to the lowest ever recorded for March, according to the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. At least nine areas in central and southern England saw their driest ever soils.</p><p>The conditions are fueling wildfires, with an estimated 121 square miles (313 square kilometers) burnt across the UK so far this year. That's the most in at least 20 years, according to satellite estimates from the European Forest Fire Information System.</p><p>Almost 150 fires have already been recorded across the UK this year, putting the country on track for the highest number of blazes in decades.</p><p>It's unclear how long the dry spell will last.</p><p>Parts of Ireland have seen heavy rains in recent weeks, but the country had only received 70% of the norm, according to government forecaster Met \u00c9ireann. The story is similar in the UK, which has seen strong local rains, but is still tracking well below long-term averages, according to the Met Office's Stephen Dixon.</p><p>Some wetter and stormier periods are forecast in the weeks ahead, which could revitalize UK crops. But another high-pressure pattern could block the moisture and mean more warm, dry conditions in early May, according to the Met Office.</p><p>\"It is still very much too early in the season\" to know how production will fare, said Millie Askew, AHDB Cereals and Oilseeds lead analyst. \"If there was no rainfall up to the end-May, then it may be a different story.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Photograph: Firefighters tackle a wildfire in Surrey, UK, in 2023.

As a legacy of past fires, the contribution of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) to carbon cycling in these peatlands remains poorly understood. Here, we assess PyC accumulation variability using six cores spanning peatlands in northwestern Amazonia using hydrogen pyrolysis. We also estimate the PyC stock for the entire Amazonian peatlands by combining our field dataset with published sources. The PyC to total organic carbon ratio averaged 1.2% across our sites and increased with peat age. We estimate a total peatland PyC stock of 0.73 \u00b1 0.61 Pg for the Amazon Basin, representing 1.6% of their TOC stock. Due to the slower turnover of PyC in peatland ecosystems, our findings indicate the importance of PyC generated by past fires and highlight the potential long-term carbon sequestration role of PyC in the future carbon cycle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Peatland pyrogenic carbon from past fires in the Amazon plays a key role in the global carbon budget, accounting for 1.6% of the total organic carbon in Amazonian peatlands, based on an analysis of six cores from northwestern Amazonian peatlands using hydrogen pyrolysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The Amazon Basin contains ~150\u2013200 Pg C in biomass and soil1, representing a carbon pool of global importance2. In recent years, increased drought-related wildfires have led to significant loss of carbon from human-modified landscapes, and this carbon loss also extends to intact forests during extremely dry years3, 4\u20135. Peatlands are one of the most carbon-dense ecosystems within the basin and store substantial carbon in the underlying layers, which have developed in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions over decades to millennia6,7. Undisturbed Amazonian peatlands are not necessarily fire-prone, as they maintain almost permanent waterlogged conditions in their soils and exist mostly in areas of sustained rain throughout the year. However, fire risk can change once peatlands are impacted by land use change or droughts8. Though the current human activities on Amazonian peatlands have limited impact, ongoing large-scale land conversion to meet commercial and subsistence needs9 combined with intensified climate anomalies10,11, represent an increasing fire risk to this long-term carbon sink. In other parts of the tropics, large-scale drainage and land use changes for oil palm plantations and agriculture in Southeast Asia have made this peatland-rich region susceptible to fires12. The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation phenomenon induced a prolonged dry season in Indonesia in 1997, drying the already disturbed peatlands to such an extent that they burned, releasing between 0.81 and 2.57 Pg C13.</p><p>During wildfires, pyrogenic carbon (PyC), which includes a wide range of sizes and compounds of pyrogenic origin, such as slightly charred biomass, black carbon and soot, is simultaneously produced from the incomplete combustion of biomass14,15. Owing to its persistence in the environment, PyC is divided into labile, semi-labile, and stable fractions, representing the degradation time of years, decades, and centuries to millennia, respectively14. While most PyC remains initially on the site of burning, it can later be partly relocated or distributed through terrestrial and marine ecosystems by erosion and/or leaching16,17. Additionally, a portion of aerosol-sized PyC can be dispersed in smoke plumes over long distances14,18. The temperatures of fires in tropical forests and savannas can exceed 500 \u00b0C19,20; under these conditions, 80% of the PyC produced is likely to exist in a relatively stable form with highly condensed aromatic ring structures14. Because of the slow decompositional anoxic environment in intact peatlands, both stable and more labile PyC generated from peatland and/or wider landscape burning can be preserved for longer compared to soils that are exposed to oxic conditions. Thus, PyC stored in peatlands may represent an important slow-cycling fraction as a legacy of past fires.</p><p>PyC has been largely ignored in global soil carbon estimates over the years; however, a growing number of studies have focused on this carbon pool, and these have emphasised its global importance. The most recent PyC estimates suggest that the global PyC stock lies within the range of 80\u2013450 Pg C21, which equals ~5\u201326% of the total soil carbon stocks globally (1700 Pg22). This range is comparable to previously reported values14,23,24. Yet, until recently, large uncertainties and limitations have remained when estimating global PyC stocks. This mainly stems from a lack of agreement between various methods used to estimate PyC stocks and a limited exploration of controls on the spatial and vertical distribution in PyC, especially in tropical regions where the data is generally sparser than in temperate or higher latitude regions23. This is the case even though biomass burning in the tropics was the source of ~91% of fire-induced PyC between 1997 and 201621.</p><p>Fire regimes vary across the tropics, and this impacts PyC production. For tropical regions, a PyC to total organic carbon ratio (PyC/TOC) of 15% is assumed for the most flammable moist and dry ecosystems, while in the least flammable, tropical wet ecosystems, values of 1% PyC/TOC have been suggested14. The latter amount was considered the case for the majority of the Amazon Basin, especially for the wettest northwestern portion11,25. However, this percentage is likely to be an underestimation, especially for deep soil layers, where TOC is low26, 27\u201328. A more recent study26 reported an average PyC storage of 11% of TOC for the 0\u2013200 cm soil depths in the whole Amazon Basin, based on sampling from permanent plots in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">terra firme</emphasis> natural forest (non-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">terra preta</emphasis>) with no history of recent fire. This study was the first basin-wide PyC estimate and revealed an increasing PyC/TOC trend down to 2 m as TOC declined faster with depth than PyC. This emphasises the importance of PyC in TOC stored in deeper layers.</p><p>There are very few studies estimating peatland PyC. The only study of PyC stored in peatlands is from high-latitude northern peatlands and reported a total PyC stock of ~62 Pg based on PyC-age relationships29. The age of the peat provides information on long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation. This facilitates the temporal comparison of carbon dynamics for large datasets on the regional scale30 and possibly allows linking broader climatic controls at the same temporal scale31.</p><p>Peatlands in Amazonia were first documented in the 1950s32, and scientific studies on peat properties have only recently been conducted6,33, 34, 35, 36\u201337. Insights into Amazonian peatlands stem mainly from studies of the Peruvian peatlands, with the Pastaza-Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Foreland Basin (PMFB) being considered the largest peatland complex identified so far7,35,37. Many areas remain largely unexplored, mostly due to accessibility constraints, such as the Rio Negro Basin in Brazil, where extensive peatlands could potentially exist38,39. Although some progress has been made in understanding carbon cycling in lowland Amazonian peatlands, such as those in Peru, based on intensive fieldwork36, our understanding of specific processes, such as PyC accumulation and dynamics, is very limited.</p><p>To our knowledge, there have been no studies of PyC storage in Amazonian peatlands. An accurate estimation of PyC in the Amazon Basin that accounts for peatlands is required to broaden our understanding of the role of PyC in influencing future regional and global carbon dynamics. In this study, we use hydrogen pyrolysis (HyPy) to quantify PyC in six peat cores from northwestern Amazonia and further upscale the results to estimate the basin-wide peatland PyC stocks based on available peat properties (peat depth, dry bulk density, carbon content and peat basal age). This study addresses the following questions: (a) Is there an age-dependent vertical distribution of PyC in the studied peatlands, and if so, what is the pattern? (b) What is the PyC stock in basin-wide peatlands, representing the total PyC accumulated during peat formation in the Amazon Basin? (c) Does PyC storage in peat soils differ from forest soils in the Amazon Basin, considering the area of each soil type?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TOC and PyC variability with age</emphasis></p><p>TOC and PyC/TOC varied significantly between sites (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). TOC values ranged from 16.1 to 62.2% with an average of 38.3% across all sites (Table 1), while PyC/TOC ranged from 0 to 17.1% with a mean value of 1.2%. INI, the northernmost site (Fig. 1) located in flooded forests, had the highest average PyC/TOC values, while CAN (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mauritia</emphasis>-dominated palm swamp), as the closest site to the centre of the Amazon forest, exhibited the lowest levels, approximately 300 times lower than INI. Zero values are considered an indication of no fire and are observed for more than half the time for the entire fire history at two <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mauritia</emphasis>-dominated palm swamps: CAN (spanning ~600 years) and QUI (spanning ~2600 years), suggesting that fire has been infrequent at these sites and/or the surrounding areas. Significant spatial autocorrelation was found in PyC/TOC (Supplementary Fig. 1a), while a cluster of low values appeared to be located at southern sites (QUI, JEN, and CAN) (Supplementary Fig. 2).

These estimates were based on the peatland area within the Amazon Basin (462,833 km2 39), peat depth (183.9 \u00b1 116.1 cm) obtained from 1095 observations at 127 sites, and peat bulk density (0.13 \u00b1 0.07 g cm\u22123) and carbon content (40.8 \u00b1 9.5%) calculated from 344 and 263 observations from 53 and 43 sites, respectively (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table 1).

Recent efforts to investigate the deep storage of PyC26,40 demonstrate its notable contribution to the carbon pool in forest soils. In peatland ecosystems, large amounts of carbon accumulate throughout all layers, compared to forest soils. The presence of carbon-rich deep layers is more common in peatlands, as seen in Peru, where thick peat can reach up to a depth of 7 m and the average peat thickness is ~2 m37. PyC, as the result of peatland burning or wider landscape burning, can be well preserved with peat materials under anoxic conditions. However, there is very little knowledge about this deep store of PyC in peatlands. Our analysis of PyC storage in Amazonian peatlands reveals a much higher PyC stock per unit area than in forest soils in the basin. The calculations of basin-wide PyC peatland stocks are based on northwestern Amazonia, where fires have been rare due to very wet conditions and limited human intervention; thus, this storage estimate may be an underestimation. Our findings highlight the critical role of PyC sequestration in carbon-rich peatland ecosystems and suggest the necessity of incorporating PyC in peatlands into regional and global carbon dynamic models. This is particularly the case because the residence time of PyC in peatlands (and mineral soils) is very different from non-PyC fractions in TOC, and this needs to be explicitly taken into account in these models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pyrogenic carbon stock in Amazonian peatlands</emphasis></p><p>We provide a first PyC estimate in Amazonian peatlands, equivalent to 1.6% of the peatland TOC stock, while the estimated value for northwestern Amazonia is 1.2%. These values fall within the global range of 0-60% in soils, below the global average of 13.7%23, and are consistent with the previously estimated values of 1% for tropical wet regions with infrequent fire14. Previous studies of PyC in forest soils in the Amazon Basin showed a similar order of magnitude to our study, ranging from 1.3 to 7.3%26, 27\u201328,40. Compared to the global average of 13.7%23, these low PyC values in the Amazon Basin reveal the generally low incidence of fire in the Amazon Basin in a global context.</p><p>With a high TOC stock in Amazonian peatlands, our best estimate of PyC stock in these peatlands (16 Mg ha\u22121) is four times higher than forest soils in the basin (Table 3). Our peatland PyC stocks are much smaller than those reported for high-latitude northern peatlands29, which could be linked to either the higher flammability of peat in high-latitude peatlands or differences in fire regimes for these regions7,41. The generally high-water content of undisturbed peatlands prevents wildfires from occurring most of the time. However, whenever peat becomes dry, it can burn for long periods as smouldering ground fires can occur at depth42, with dry peat layers acting as additional fuel. For example, during the 1997 peatland fires in Indonesia, peat combustion to a depth of 51 cm was reported13. During such fires, large amounts of PyC can be expected to be produced from its precursor biomass and buried in the peat43. Although newly produced PyC globally accounted for ~12% of carbon emissions between 1997 and 2016, which may benefit long-term carbon sequestration, the combustion of deep organic soils, such as in degraded peatland ecosystems, was not included in this assessment21. Given the considerable carbon stocks stored in peatlands and the large emissions that could be released in the short term when drained, mitigating related emissions from peatlands could be achieved by preserving these intact peatlands, combined with effective fire management.Table 3</p><p>Estimates of PyC stock and PyC/TOC in Amazonian and high-latitude northern peatlands and Amazonian forest soils</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ecosystem type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Study region</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">PyC stock based on area (Mg ha?1)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">PyC/TOC (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">PyC method*</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Peatland</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Amazon Basin (this study)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">16</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.6</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">HyPy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Northwestern Amazonia (this study)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Peatland</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">High-latitude northernpeatlands29</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">156</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">14</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">NMR</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Forest(non-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Terra preta</emphasis>)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Amazon Basin (0?30 cm)26</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4.7</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">HyPy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Amazon Basin (0?100 cm)26</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">7.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Forest(ombrophilous, deciduous and semideciduous)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Northern Brazilian Amazon (0?100 cm)40</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">CTO-375</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Forest</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Southern Amazonia (0?30 cm)28</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4.3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">HyPy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Forest fragments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Forest-savanna matrix in Roraima, Brazil (0?100 cm)27</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">CTO-375</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>*<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">HyPy</emphasis> hydrogen pyrolysis, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NMR</emphasis>13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CTO-375</emphasis> chemo-thermal oxidation method.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pyrogenic carbon and age: vertical variability</emphasis></p><p>The general increase in PyC/TOC values with peat age in our study indicates that PyC is playing a progressively more important role in the deeper, older layers compared to other forms of TOC, although the trend is not significant, possibly due to the small number of PyC/TOC observations. A similar increasing trend was observed in intact high-latitude northern peatlands29, as well as in soil ecosystems to a depth of 1\u20132 m at similar latitudes, in Amazonia <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">terra firme</emphasis> forests26 and in intact forests and forest fragments located in the northern Brazilian Amazon27,40. A similar result has also been observed in soils at higher latitudes, such as on the Chinese loess plateau44. However, no significant difference between depths was detected in a comprehensive global compilation of PyC/TOC that gathered 569 individual PyC/TOC values from 55 different studies across different ecosystems23. That study used only topsoil (top 10 cm) and subsoil (the depth below 10 cm) as the categorical factors rather than considering a continuous depth profile with only 2 sites identified as peat. Our current knowledge of this possible trend, therefore, remains uncertain due to the limited number of studies on peatland ecosystems.</p><p>On a regional level, aligning with the increase in PyC/TOC ratios with peat age in most of the studied sites, higher charcoal values between 2500 and 2000 cal yr BP in lake sediment compared to more recent ages in northwestern Amazonia were observed45. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">terra firme</emphasis> forests in northern and southern Peru showed a total of four to six unique fire events over the past 2000\u20134000 years, with no fires occurring within the past ~700\u2013850 years46. Charcoal abundance in the American tropics showed a general increase from 3 to 2 ka, followed by a decline into the industrial era47, suggesting more frequent fires in the millennia before the industrial age. This pattern could be associated with the wetter climate in the Amazon Basin during the late-Holocene, coupled with the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, boosting the intensity of the South American summer monsoon and bringing more rainfall into the basin48,49. For example, a continuous rise in water levels was documented in Lake Titicaca, a high-altitude lake in the central Andes, over the last 4000 years50.</p><p>After PyC is produced, its vertical distribution will depend on preservation and stabilisation processes in sediment and soils51,52. Oxygen availability is a key factor regulating the degradation of all carbon molecules, including PyC, which will eventually result in different preservation potential in peatlands and mineral soils. Due to the waterlogged conditions that are pervasive in peatlands, oxygen concentration, especially at depth, tends to be low, while the surface peat, with greater input of fresh organic matter, can be exposed to more aerobic conditions. This favours higher microbial activity in the upper layers of tropical peatlands53,54. Additionally, microbes preferentially degrade other forms of carbon that can be more easily used. Therefore, PyC will be selectively preserved over time and undergo relative accumulation in peats52. The downward movement of PyC, including the translocation of the particulate PyC form and dissolved PyC form as a result of leaching, could also enrich PyC with depth. This downward transport has been observed in mineral soils17,51 and in drained peatlands where high movement rates of 0.6\u20131.2 cm yr\u22121 have been reported55. These possible mechanisms may together contribute to the higher PyC in the study at greater depth and over time. The lack of a spatial pattern in PyC/TOC over time in our study sites may indicate that each site is differently influenced by local conditions (e.g., hydrology, topography, remote PyC sources, and peat accumulation rates) and these local factors are more important than regional phenomena in driving PyC spatial patterns. This issue needs to be investigated in future research to gain a clearer understanding of the main drivers of PyC accumulation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial variability of pyrogenic carbon</emphasis></p><p>PyC directly reflects the incidence and intensity of fire in an ecosystem, and the occurrence of fires in tropical peatlands is normally related to alterations in hydrological conditions8. In recent years, increased fire largely coincides with a combination of climate and human-induced drying56, while in the past, with limited human impact, it is typically linked to drought events57. Peatlands located in northwestern Amazonia have experienced less severe drought stress during the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation-induced basin-wide drought events that occurred in 1982\u20131983, 1997\u20131998, 2015\u2013201658, and 2023\u2013202459. This lower fire activity may have been the case for much of the Holocene compared to other regions in the Amazon Basin, as demonstrated by charcoal records from lake sediments45. The median fire return interval (~450 years) from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">terra firme</emphasis> Amazonian forest sites in seasonally wetter northern and seasonally drier southern sites in Peru46 also suggests less fire over past millennia for the forests in western Amazonia. Hence, the PyC/TOC values for the entire basin here generated mainly from the northwestern region are only likely to underestimate PyC/TOC in the wider Amazonian peatlands when they share similar peat inception ages.</p><p>The different PyC values across our study sites are likely attributable to varying fire histories at the locations or in their surrounding environment. This is reflected in the higher PyC/TOC values at sites closer to the natural forest limits in INI, PLL and CAQ, compared to those located in the central part of the forest cover (QUI, JEN, and CAN) (Fig. 1). The forest edge is surrounded by more fire-prone ecosystems, such as savannas. Aerosol deposition from smoke from surrounding areas or locations that are further afield, and for example as far away as Africa, could bring additional PyC into the Amazon Basin, although this process is restricted by distance and seasonality60. Yearly fire burn fraction (per grid cell) between 1997 and 2016, from Global Fire Emissions Database with small fires61 shows more frequent burning in our northern sites and surrounding areas that are closer to the edge of the basin than QUI, JEN, and CAN, where the lower clusters of PyC/TOC were observed (Supplementary Fig. 2). This suggests peatlands that are surrounded by drier environments at the edge of the Amazon Basin (e.g., areas adjacent to the Cerrado or Llanos) potentially receive higher PyC inputs from nearby fire-prone environments, which contribute to higher PyC deep storage at those sites.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mauritia</emphasis>-dominated palm swamps of three southern sites (QUI, JEN, and CAN), presented significantly lower PyC values compared to all the other ecosystem types in this study, including mixed palm swamps, palm swamps and flooded forest (Supplementary Fig. 3). It is worth noting that PyC/TOC values in the INI site are much higher than in the other sites, which may partly be explained by this site experiencing more variable water levels in flooded forest than in palm swamps62. Therefore, there is greater potential for being affected by lower water levels during droughts or prolonged dry periods, which would increase the likelihood of local fires occurring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uncertainties and future research</emphasis></p><p>Our dataset provides an important step towards understanding the role of PyC in carbon storage in Amazonian peatland ecosystems; some uncertainties and limitations could be addressed with future work (see Supplementary Discussion for details). To estimate peatland PyC stocks, we assumed that TOC is equally distributed across the peat vertical profile and that the median value from our compilation of peat basal ages represents the general age of peat inception across the basin. These two assumptions were based on TOC values (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> = 3741) from high-latitude northern peatland30 and a global compilation of peat basal ages (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> = 1097)63, providing a conservative estimate of PyC stock. Comparing PyC results generated by different quantification methods is challenging due to non-systematic offsets between the current approaches64,65. However, considering this methodological difference66, our HyPy-derived PyC/TOC still indicates lower values in peatlands compared to reported values in Amazonian forest soils. Furthermore, the lack of accurate and detailed peat maps across the basin could add extra uncertainties, although some regions where field campaigns have been more extensive have more reliable maps36,37. The recently published field data-driven peatland map for the basin38 would provide a lower estimate of 0.40 Pg of PyC (based on a different boundary of the Amazon Basin from our study). Uncertainties remain regarding the coupling between PyC/TOC and peat inception ages. Addressing these data gaps through future research is needed to improve the accuracy of PyC stock estimates in Amazonian peatlands.</p><p>The conservation of intact peatlands has been key to reducing fires and controlling PyC dynamics within the basin. Extensive construction projects are planned for peat-rich areas of the Amazon Basin9, where PyC would become more prevalent due to the high flammability resulting from lowered water tables in the potentially affected areas. Our findings that PyC/TOC is relatively low in intact Amazonian peatlands, both regionally and globally, suggest that these intact ecosystems are naturally resistant to wildfire. Area-based PyC stocks in Amazonian peatland ecosystems are higher than forest soils in the basin and lower than reported for high-latitude northern peatlands. This highlights Amazonian peatlands\u2019 crucial role in the local PyC budget for short periods and over millennia; however, their distinctive character differs from high-latitude northern peatlands. The reconstructed historical fire patterns provide insights into trajectories of the fire frequency and carbon cycling in these water-logged environments under changing land use and increased drought severity in a drier future Amazon10,11.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sample collection</emphasis></p><p>There is pronounced hydroclimatic variability within the Amazon Basin, with precipitation during the three driest months of the year following a geographically decreasing trend from the northwestern basin towards its southeastern portion67. Our study region is located in northwestern Amazonia, which is characterised by a tropical rainforest climate68 that experiences the least climatological water deficit throughout the year of anywhere in the entire basin (Fig. 1a).</p><p>One core was collected from each of the six lowland peatland sites in Colombia (In\u00edrida-INI, Puerto Lleras-PLL, Caquet\u00e1-CAQ and Cananguchal-CAN) and northern Peru (Quistococha-QUI and Jenaro Herrera-JEN) between 2018 and 2022 using a Russian D-section corer to the base of the peat or the maximum depth that could be reached in the field (Supplementary Table 3). All sites are permanently water-logged, and classified as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mauritia</emphasis>-dominated palm swamps (CAN, QUI and JEN), mixed palm swamps (CAQ), palm swamps surrounded by agricultural land (PLL) and tree-dominated swamps within flooded forests (INI) based on their modern vegetation. These peatlands have maintained their integrity and have not experienced land use changes or alterations of their hydrological conditions, although selective harvesting of the most dominant species (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mauritia flexuosa</emphasis>) could have occurred in the past at the Peru sites69. There have been no reports of recent fires at any of our sites.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chronology</emphasis></p><p>Twenty sub-samples at different depths covering the length of each of the six cores were prepared for AMS 14C analysis (Supplementary Table 4). For INI, PLL, CAQ, and CAN, bulk samples were sieved through a 63 \u03bcm mesh, and the &lt;63 \u03bcm fraction underwent hydrochloric acid pre-treatment for analysis at the 14CHRONO Centre in Queen\u2019s University Belfast. For QUI and JEN, macrofossil samples were hand-picked and submitted to the National Environmental Isotope Facility (NEIF) Radiocarbon Laboratory and analysed at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) AMS Laboratory with acid-alkali-acid pre-treatment. All 14C dates were reported as uncalibrated year before present (yr BP, present = 1950 CE) and then calibrated using CALIB 8.270 with a 50:50 mix of the IntCal20 and SHCal20 mixed calibration curve due to the influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone71.</p><p>210Pb measurements were performed only for QUI and JEN at contiguous 1 cm intervals for the topmost peat layers (Supplementary Table 5). Samples were spiked with 209Po, digested with HNO3\u2013H2O2\u2013HCl and electroplated onto silver planchets. 210Pb activity was determined using alpha spectrometry, measuring the decay of 210Po, the daughter product of 210Pb, at the Geography Radiometry Laboratory, University of Exeter. Bayesian chronological models were used to construct age-depth relationships from the calibrated 14C dates using the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">rbacon</emphasis> package72. For QUI and JEN, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">rplum</emphasis> package was used to combine the different dating methods, 210Pb and 14C dates73. These two packages were built by the same authors, and thus, there remains a degree of overlap in the methodology. For PLL and INI, due to age reversal at deep depths, only dates for the top 300 cm and 42.5 cm were used for age-depth models, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pyrogenic carbon quantification</emphasis></p><p>For PyC analysis, ~200 mg bulk samples from 5 to 20 cm intervals, depending on the total length of cores, with a total of 67 samples, were weighed and treated overnight with 2 M HCl to remove any potential inorganic carbon. Samples were then water-washed, dried, and hand-ground into a fine powder. The PyC analysis was carried out in the Advanced Analytical Centre at James Cook University following the standard procedure for HyPy74. Briefly, the powdered sample was loaded with ~10% Mo catalyst and heated to 250 \u00b0C at 300 \u00b0C min\u22121, then 8 \u00b0C min\u22121 to 550 \u00b0C and kept for 2 min under a 150 bar of hydrogen with 5 L min-1 sweep gas flow in the reactor. Stable PyC with aromatic rings greater than seven is isolated for analysis using this technique66. The carbon content before and after HyPy was measured using an Elementar PrecisION IRMS at the Stable Isotope Geochemistry laboratory, The University of Queensland, and was then used to calculate PyC abundance. Final PyC values were corrected to eliminate the effect of in situ PyC production in the HyPy reactor74 and reported as PyC/TOC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PyC-age model selection</emphasis></p><p>To assess how PyC/TOC varies with the age of the peat and to apply the generated relationships to a wider geographic range, simple linear and polynomial regressions were applied via the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">stats</emphasis> package75. Linear mixed-effects models for each site over age via the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">lme4</emphasis> package76 were also used.</p><p>The best model was determined by evaluating the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) index (the smaller, the better) with \u0394AIC = 0 using the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bbmle</emphasis> package77. We compared four models for two different time periods by: (1) keeping all observations (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> = 67); and (2) only considering PyC/TOC up to an age of ca. 3500 cal yr BP, as there was only INI data older than this date (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> = 64) (Table 2). Notably, for both time periods, the slope in most models, except for model 1 (the best-performing model), was significant, indicating PyC/TOC increased significantly with increasing age. However, the disappearance of significance in the best-performing model (model 1, which includes site as a random factor) suggests that the significance could be mainly driven by site differences.</p><p>To test the robustness of our models, we used a rank-based linear model implemented via the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rfit</emphasis> package78 with non-parametric analysis, and the slope shows a similar but slightly larger magnitude (0.46% PyC/TOC ka\u22121) to the best-performing models under both conditions. To capture the relationship between PyC/TOC and age for the longer period, we chose to continue further analyses using the best-performing model with all ages covered. The final model presents no significant violations of the analytical assumptions, as shown in the residual errors and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q</emphasis> plots (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Timing of peat initiation across the Amazon Basin</emphasis></p><p>To assess the timing of peatland initiation across the Amazon Basin, a total of 70 radiocarbon dates from 52 sites were gathered from published sources and our study sites (Supplementary Table 2). A 1 km buffer for each site was generated using the Buffer tool in ArcGIS Pro 3.1.0 (ESRI Inc.) to reduce the influence of sites referring to the same peatland (within the buffer zone). A single average age was used for sites located in the same peatland area. For Ogle Bridge in Guyana, where the calibrated age was reported79, we used it as provided in that publication. For Laguna Huatacocha in Peru, we calibrated the radiocarbon date using the SHCal20 curve due to its location. All other basal dates were calibrated using the same methods as our radiocarbon dates with a mixed calibration curve in CALIB 8.270, and with the SHZ3 post bomb curve in CALIBomb80. All calibration ages were reported as median probability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Estimation of the PyC stock and associated uncertainty</emphasis></p><p>Since measured PyC was reported as PyC/TOC, a total stock of organic carbon is required for the entire Amazonian peatlands to convert this ratio to a PyC stock. We compiled related peat properties (peat depth, dry bulk density and carbon content, Supplementary Table 1) from publications to calculate the TOC stock for Amazonian peatlands using Eq. (1)7. To include sufficiently robust data, we retained only sites with peat thickness &gt;30 cm, and used sites defined as peatlands by authors or that could be shown to be peat from the available geochemical data, as LOI &gt; 30% or C% &gt; 15%, which is the same criterion that applied to our sites.1Where TOCp is the total organic carbon pool (Pg, Pg = 1015 g), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis>p is peatland area (km2), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis>p is peat depth (m), DBDp is dry bulk density (g cm-3), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>p is carbon content and expressed as a fraction. Peat depth, dry bulk density and carbon content were obtained from the literature, and the peatland area was calculated based on PEATMAP39.</p><p>Then, the PyC stock was estimated using Eq. (2) by calculating PyC stock for each age class separately, as they have different PyC/TOC, and then summing them. Given the lack of comprehensive regional compilations of TOC in the Amazon Basin and limited information as to its vertical distribution, we have assumed that TOC is equally distributed across the age classes. Additionally, instead of using a weighted peat age (age with relative frequency) or a simple average age from our collected peat basal ages, we chose to use the median age to represent a basin-wide peat initiation time to reduce the bias from very old dates (for examples, Mera and Ogle Bridge), and then infer cumulative PyC stock along the peat profile using this median age.2Where PyCp is the total pyrogenic carbon pool (Pg), TOCp is the total organic carbon pool, PyC/TOC is the percent of PyC in TOC (%), which changes with peat age, n is the total number of age classes.</p><p>The uncertainty of the PyC estimates was calculated using the law of error propagation in Eq. (3). In this process, we consider the uncertainties from peat depth, carbon content and PyC/TOC. The uncertainty from bulk density is not included because this parameter is closely associated with carbon content81,82. The uncertainty of peat area is also not included, as is the case in the calculations of TOC stock.3Where PyCp is the total pyrogenic carbon pool (Pg), is its related standard deviation,  and  are standard deviations for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis>p, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>p, respectively.  is the uncertainty obtained from the maximum values of upper and minimum values of lower confidence levels of the PyC-age model across all age classes (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bootMer</emphasis> function in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">lme4</emphasis> package76).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Statistical analysis</emphasis></p><p>Kruskal\u2013Wallis rank sum test (non-parametric test) was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between sites for both TOC and PyC/TOC, as neither is normally distributed. A non-parametric Dunn\u2019s post hoc test was applied to check the influence of site location and type on PyC/TOC. All analysis was conducted using R 4.3.075. Spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I</emphasis>) was used to assess spatial patterns of mean TOC, mean PyC/TOC, and the relationship (slope from simple linear regression model) between PyC/TOC and age among our sites based on Euclidean distance, using South America Albers Equal Area Conic as the projected coordinate system in ArcGIS Pro 3.1.0 (ESRI Inc.). While Global Moran\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I</emphasis> Index was calculated using the tool Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I</emphasis>), Local Moran\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I</emphasis> Index was then calculated to identify spatial clusters using the tool Cluster and Outlier Analysis (Anselin Local Moran\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I</emphasis>) when there is a significant relation in Global Moran\u2019s I Index.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was supported by a PhD scholarship via the QUEX Institute (The University of Queensland and The University of Exeter) for Yuwan Wang.

According to news reporting from Rajasthan, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"When data collected at the local nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN) are volumetric in nature, there is a need for local processing, then distributed clustering plays an important role. Traditional clustering algorithms based on K-means, K-medoid are not effective in these scenarios for accurate data segregation.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Malaviya National Institute of Technology, \"Further, there is a requirement of techniques that can effectively handle outliers and noise present in the sensed data. Thus, there is a need to design robust distributed data clustering algorithms. Multi-Task Optimization (MTO) has taken the attention of researchers in the last couple of years after the introduction of Multi-Factorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA). The MFEA can handle several single objective tasks usually related to one another and share implicit knowledge or abilities common to them. In this manuscript, the MFEA is employed to solve two tasks: 1) outlier detection and 2) perform distributed clustering at the nodes of WSN. The resultant algorithm, termed as Distributed MFEA (DMFEA), effectively removes noise and segregates data present at multiple nodes of WSN. Simulation study reveals the superior performance of DMFEA over benchmark algorithms like distributed versions of K-means, particle swarm optimization, and moth-flame optimization on two synthetic and six real- life datasets based on forest fire monitoring, air pollution indexing, Intel laboratory environment sensing, agriculture soil quality labeling, river water quality analysis, and land mine detection. The superior performance of DMFEA is demonstrated based on the Silhouette Index of obtained clusters and the percentage of outliers detected.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Additionally, the DMFEA average rank in Kruskal Wallis test, is better over the three comparative algorithms.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Distributed Robust Multitask Clustering In Wireless Sensor Networks Using Multi-factorial Evolutionary Algorithm.
