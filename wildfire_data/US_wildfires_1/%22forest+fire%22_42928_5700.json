Airports have been significantly affected, experiencing major decreases in traffic over the past 15 months. Despite these consequences, airports have played a crucial role since the start of the pandemic by continuing to provide essential air services, including traveling to medical appointments, air ambulance services, community resupply, getting goods to market, search and rescue operations, and forest fire response.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, launched two new contribution funding programs to help Canada's airports recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic:</p><p>The Airport Critical Infrastructure Program (ACIP) is a new program providing close to $490 million to financially assist Canada's larger airports with investments in critical infrastructure-related to safety, security or connectivity;</p><p>The Airport Relief Fund (ARF) is a new program providing almost $65 million in financial relief to targeted Canadian airports to help maintain operations.</p><p>In addition to launching these two new funding programs, the Minister announced that Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) is receiving a funding top-up of $186 million over two years. The ACAP is an existing contribution funding program which provides financial assistance to Canada's local and regional airports for safety-related infrastructure projects and equipment purchases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124451060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62N9-HNJ1-DYTH-G0H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"260\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 11, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He pilots drones to take aerial photographs, monitor construction projects and to perform thermal imaging for his business, which he runs solo out of his home. Crandall is a licensed unmanned aircraft pilot as certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a news release from Hannah Grimes on the Revolving Loan Fund.</p><p>\"Mostly realtors and people of that sort [hire me],\" Crandall said. \"The biggest part of this business was actually getting it out there that this technology exists and that you can do this. With a lot of footwork, knocking on doors and pitching to people to give an idea of what's possible and what's out there, that's helped.\"</p><p>Eagle Eye Air Support's thermal imaging capabilities have helped local firefighters find the source of fires before they spread, as in the case of a forest fire near Route 63 between Hinsdale and Chesterfield that Crandall detected via drone.</p><p>\"I was at my brother-in-law's showing him the drone and spotted it up on the hillside,\" he said. \"They had trouble locating it and I pinpointed for them using latitude and longitude. When I get a call for them I do it all for free; I don't charge anything for public service.\"</p><p>But, Crandall hit a roadblock considering the future of his venture with what he felt was outdated equipment that would have put him behind potential competition if anyone else started a similar business in the region. He was interested in applying for a cash investment but his short company history stymied plans.</p><p>\"Trying to do small business loans, [lenders] want to see six months' revenue and everything and I was like, 'I don't have that,' \" he said.</p><p>Then, he learned of the newly-developed Revolving Loan Fund via a contact with the Small Business Administration. Crandall found that the program is open to financing new business as long as he adequately laid out his business plan and what he would use the loan for if chosen as a recipient.</p><p>Hannah Grimes Center Executive Director Mary Ann Kristiansen said the partnership with REDC formed after Hannah Grimes felt there was a need for a loan program to encourage future new business in the region but said it was something her organization wouldn't be prepared to manage alone.</p><p>\"REDC has an amazing reputation for providing really wraparound services and technical assistance to these entrepreneurs that aren't quite bankable yet,\" Kristiansen said. \"We fundraise locally, so [program funds] came from our community.\"</p><p>After Hannah Grimes and the REDC reviewed Crandall's application, they contacted him in July about issuing him the loan and sent it July 15. Crandall said he received $20,000 in working capital to be repaid in installments up to five years.</p><p>REDC President Laurel Adams said a five-year term is standard for \"micro loans,\" which are those under $50,000.</p><p>\"We go through a full review of the uses of the fund including for the budget for those and projections for how the company will be able to support repaying the debt,\" Adams said. \"Once the loan is made, especially in the case of a startup, they get a quarterly review to check and see how they're doing against their expenses and projections.\"</p><p>In Crandall's case, the need for a loan was two-fold.</p><p>\"The biggest expense was new equipment, batteries and everything like that for it,\" Crandall said of his intent for the loan. \"A second chunk of [money] went into marketing, building a website, business cards, advertisements and apparel, and the the vehicle repairs and lettering.\"</p><p>Crandall said he hopes to repay his loan in full within three years, if possible, to avoid additional interest that would be accrued if he took the full five-year time allowance.</p><p>Other businesses are currently applying for the program, and REDC and Hannah Grimes will evaluate applicants once a month, Adams said. As they review other prospective borrowers, she said the hope is the Revolving Loan Fund can continue to be a financial opportunity for business owners who can't access loans otherwise because of factors like limited experience.</p><p>\"We feel like we're getting them into the business pipeline earlier, they're building personal wealth earlier, they're paying taxes earlier [and] it's helping our economy all the way around,\" Adams said. \"The partnership with Hannah Grimes helps us bring that to a deeper level in the greater Keene area.\"</p><p>Trisha Nail can be reached at 352-1234, extension 1436, or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tnail@keenesentinel.com\">tnail@keenesentinel.com</email> Follow her on Twitter</p><p>@byTrishaNail.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Keene Sentinel (Keene, N.H.)

My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vermilion Energy Q2 Conference Call. All lines that in place don't mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Dion Hatcher. You may begin your conference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thank you, Julie. Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. I'm Don Hatcher, President and CEO of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars Glemser, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerwin, Vice President, International and HSE; Bryce Kremnica, Vice President of North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President of Investor Relations. We'll be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss our Q2 2023 results. Presentation can be found on our website under Invest with Us and Events and Presentations.</p><p>Please refer to our advisory and forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today, and outlines the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>Production during the second quarter averaged 83,152 BOEs per day, which was at the top end of our Q2 guidance range of 80,000 to 83,000. We revised our Q2 production guidance in mid-May to reflect the temporary shut-in of approximately 30,000 BOEs a day in West Central Alberta due to forest fires. In the impact of Q2 volumes from the wildfires and the Australia downtime was approximately 8,000 BOEs per day. Our team was quick to respond to the fire situation in Alberta and was able to safely restore all of the production within weeks of the initial shut-in, which minimized the impact of the fire. In addition, we achieved strong operational performance across many of our other assets.</p><p>We generated CAD247 million of fund flows and invested CAD167 million of E&amp;D capital, resulting in CAD80 million of free cash flow, of which we returned CAD40 million to shareholders via the base dividend and share buybacks, representing a return of capital payout of approximately 50%. During the first half of 2023, we have declared CAD33 million in dividends and repurchased CAD54 million of our common shares representing CAD87 million return to our shareholders. We continue to target shareholder returns of 25% to 30% of free cash flow for 2023 with debt reduction remaining the priority until we achieve our next net debt target of CAD1 billion.</p><p>Net debt at the end of Q2 decreased slightly to CAD1.3 billion, representing a trailing net debt to fund flow ratio 1 times given the front-end weighting of our capital program, combined with higher forecast production and cash flows in the back half of the year, we anticipate generating more free cash flow in the second half, which should translate to accelerated debt reduction.</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 54,064 BOEs per day in Q2, a decrease of 10% or 6,000 BOEs per day from the prior quarter, mainly due to the disposition of approximately 5,500 BOEs a day of higher cost assets in our Southeast Saskatchewan and approximately 4,000 BOEs a day of fire-related downtime in West Central Alberta. We're able to partially offset this impact with organic production growth from Mica, Montney, Southeast Saskatchewan and the U.S. assets, which added approximately 3,400 BOEs a day combined in Q2. All the production that was temporary shut-in as a result of the wildfires has been restored, thanks to the hard work of our employees and contractors. Although there was no major damage to our facilities or well sites, we will continue to monitor the forest fire and take any necessary action to ensure the safety of our people and assets. We again want to thank our operations staff for the safely restoring production during this difficult period.</p><p>In West Central Alberta, we completed one and brought on production five, Mannville liquid-rich gas wells. By Mica, we drilled two, completed four, brought on production one Montney liquid rich gas well. In Saskatchewan, we drilled, completed and brought on production one oil well. In the US, we drilled seven, completed 10 and brought on production five oil wells in Wyoming. As part of our activity in the quarter, we participated in the drilling of two non-operated Parkman wells and one non-operated Niobrara well. We continue to evaluate these formations as it relate to future development prospects on our Powder River Basin, acreage in Wyoming. Across North America, we are seeing strong overall performance from our capital program and ongoing operations, which has helped in mitigating the impact of fire-related downtime in Alberta.</p><p>Our recent BC Montney wells at Mica continued to perform very well, with minimal decline seen over the first 120 days of production. BC pad results validates our Tier 1 inventory in BC and presents an opportunity for future down spacing. Our 2024 program will be focused exclusively on our BC lands with approximately 10 wells on or offsetting the 16 to 28 pad. We recently received the final permit required for the construction of the 16,000 BOE a day battery on the BC lands and are planning to start site preparation later this year. The majority of this construction will occur in the first half of 2024, and we fund it through a financing agreement with a third-party midstream company. This agreement was part of the Mica acquisition. We're excited to execute the next expansion phase and look forward to providing future updates in the quarters ahead.</p><p>Production from our international operations averaged 29,087 BOEs per day, an increase of 30% from the prior quarter, mainly due to the acquisition of additional working interest in Corrib, which closed on March 31 of this year. This acquisition added approximately 7,000 BOEs per day of premium priced European natural gas production. Ireland's production more than doubled in Q2 to an average of 11,251 BOEs a day -- due to the closing of this acquisition as well as better-than-forecast operational run rates. In the Netherlands, we completed one conventional gas well from our Q1 drilling program. In Germany, we continue to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans as we prepare for our first well we drilled in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>In Australia, we completed all remaining inspections and repair work within the primary systems of the platform at the end of Q2 and made preparations to restart the facility. As a result, we expect higher operational run rates with less online downtime in the future. Inspection and repair work completed on the platform was conducted in a safe and efficient manner without incident. We would again like to thank our staff and contractors for their diligence in executing a safe and successful program.</p><p>After completing all inspection repair work within the primary systems on the platform, we proceeded to function test all systems as part of the facility restart in early July. During the step, we noted that leak supplying seawater to a secondary area of the deluge fire suppression system to ensure we have addressed any offsetting items, we elected to replace the COR piping at this time, which will delay start up to the end of Q3. This is the longest period that Wandoo platform has been offline since Vermilion has operated it. The scope of the repair work itself was mainly pipe valves and fittings and replacements. It was time-consuming process given the logistics associated with working on an offshore platform. In particular, there are a limited number of beds to accommodate workers and the work itself require the assembly and the disassembly of complex gaffing through the platform. All the major work is now behind us. Systems on the platform are function tested and ready for start-up once the seawater piping is replaced.</p><p>With these delays in back short-term production and cash flow, it is the right long-term decision as it enhances the safety and the integrity of our asset while improving future operational runs rates. The Wandoo asset has been in our portfolio since 2005 and has generated significant amount of free cash flow over this time frame. 2022 Wandoo crude sold at a US $14 [Phonetic] premium to Brent, which drives very strong netbacks. Under current strip pricing, we are forecasting over CAD100 million of free cash flow from Australia in 2024.</p><p>I will now pass it over to Lars to discuss our guidance and financial outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Dion. As a result of the increased scope of repair work on the Wandoo platform in Australia as well as the planned turnaround at the core facility in Ireland, we expect Q3 volumes to be consistent with Q2 guidance of 80,000 to 83,000 BOE a day. As we complete the Australia integrity work and core turnaround, we will be positioned to deliver Q4 production in the range of 86,000 to 89,000 BOE a day. As a result of strong operational execution and performance across our portfolio, we are maintaining our 2023 annual production guidance of 82,000 to 86,000 BOE a day as we have been able to offset much of the impact from the Alberta wildfires and extended Australia downtime. The rest of our annual financial guidance remains unchanged from our last revision.</p><p>Our disciplined approach towards debt reduction, combined with our asset high-grading initiatives over the past three years has made Vermilion a more resilient business today. By the end of this year, we will have nearly cut our debt in half while also funding over CAD1 billion of strategic acquisitions and have significantly increased our average annual FFO from pre-COVID levels. While strong commodity prices have contributed to this improvement, we believe the company is much better positioned. Our top decile netbacks, low-base decline, diversified commodity exposure and capital-efficient asset base, combined with our modest base dividend payout, translates to a very resilient business that could be managed through low commodity cycles and is well positioned for increased return of capital to shareholders as debt is reduced.</p><p>As we look out to 2024, we are currently forecasting a significant increase in FFO to over CAD1.4 billion, assuming a flat production profile. With this, we expect to achieve our next net debt target of CAD1 billion during the first half of 2024. Consistent with our previous messaging, we plan to increase shareholder returns upon achieving this debt target, and we'll communicate the method and targeted payout range at that time. We anticipate that share buybacks will remain the primary mechanism for returning incremental capital beyond the base dividend. And as such, we renewed our normal course issue bid in early July and continue to buy back shares. Since July of last year, we have bought back 5.7 million shares.</p><p>Lastly, I wanted to provide a brief update on our hedge position, in particular, our European gas hedges. European gas has been trading at elevated levels for the past few years and we believe there has been a structural positive shift in European gas fundamentals as you can see in our forward price on this chart. European gas prices are currently trading approximately 7 times higher than AECO gas prices and the forward curve is holding in at around CAD20 per MMBtu. This is a very attractive price as it generates high project returns and significant free cash flow from our European gas assets. As such, we have been actively hedging our forward European gas production at or above these levels. For the upcoming periods on European gas in Canadian dollar terms, we have 51% hedged for second half of 2023 at an average price of CAD30 per MMBtu, 30% hedged for the first half of 2024 at an average floor of CAD47 per MMBtu and 16% hedged for second half 2024 at an average floor of CAD25 per MMBtu. We have also been starting to layer in some oil hedges and intend to increase our corporate hedge position from current levels with a view to lock in a reasonable amount of cash flow to provide greater certainty in achieving our debt targets and in support of executing our operational and return of capital plans.</p><p>With that I would like to pass it back to Dion for his closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. To further expand on Lars' comments on free cash flow generating capacity. I would like to highlight the following chart, which shows our free cash flow allocation over the past few years. The blue bar shows the total amount of free cash flow generated by the stack partials, how this free cash flow was allocated in each of the years. As you can see, the majority of our free cash flow, a total of CAD1.6 billion between 2021 and 2023 was allocated to debt reduction and acquisitions. It's aligned with our strategy of ensuring a strong balance sheet and robust asset base. Going in 2024, most of that heavy lifting on debt reduction will be behind us, which means we have more free cash flow to allocate the shareholder returns in the years ahead. As you look into 2024, we are positioned to generate significantly higher free cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, we intend to increase the amount of return to our shareholders once we achieve our CAD1 billion debt target expected during the first half of 2024.</p><p>Well, that concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, we would like to open it up for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Amir Arif from ATB Capital. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a few quick questions. First of all, just on the Montney side. I think you're planning 10 wells next year. Were you planning on drilling those currently with the construction in the first half. So should we expect Montney production to start being meaningful in the second half in terms of growth? Or is it all the drilling be happening once you've got better clarity on start-up of the facility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe I can take that high level question here. This is Dion. Thanks for the question. As noted on the call, the construction of the battery itself will some of that site prep work will initiate second half of this year, but the bulk will be in the first half of 2024. So from a planning point of view, we would initiate that drilling. But realistically, I think the timeline for that production coming on would be closer to midyear. So that's our assumption or plans right now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then so Dion, would you drill all 10 wells in the first half? Or the 10 is spread throughout the year for next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>These -- well, there's basically two -- mainly two pads, and so this would be back-to-back drilling. As you can imagine, there's some cost synergies and efficiencies. So yes, we would look to drill those pads back to back and line it up for midyear.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Appreciate that. And then just a quick question on the Germany. I know you continue to drill that deep exploration gas well over there. Can you just give us an update on when you expect to head TD? And when do you expect to have some results on that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I'm going to pass it over to Darcy Kerwin, our Vice President of International. Darcy, do you want to take that one?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks, Amir. As you know, we've been excited about the deep gas exploration potential in Germany. We have successfully drilled deep gas wells there before we drilled Burgmoor Z5 in 2019, that well is still producing nicely for us. And so we're kind of after some pause during the COVID downturn, we put renewed focus on that exploration program, both on the geo side and on the permitting side. So we have a number of interesting prospects to look out there in Germany, and we'll kick off kind of the first of that set of prospects starting here in Q4 2023 with the first exploration well that we plan to drill.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>So I guess from a TD point of view, Darcy, we're really looking at early next year with the time we take to spud the well and get those well results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we'll spud the well in Q4, and then that well will drill through the end of the year and TD early in 2024 [Phonetic].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. I appreciate that. And just a final question on the windfall taxes. The TTF gas price was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter, yet windfall taxes were up. Can you just help me understand why would it move with the TTF prices? Is there just a lag in terms of the payments?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, let me pass over to Lars to address that question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks, Amir. The big reason for the increase in windfall taxes from Q1 to Q2 of this year is the fact that we closed the Corrib acquisition on March 31 of this year. And so in Q2, we started to recognize the production and FFO or free cash flow impact of the incremental 36.5%. So that would explain the bulk of the increase Q1 to Q2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>I appreciate that thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed with your closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>With that, thank you again for participating in our Q2 conference call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-aa5fb570ec1051b9abd3cfc738a04784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB8-WWW3-RTMS-H3M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 AlphaStreet Inc.

Following this, he said, space technology is now being used in diverse sectors including Railways, Roads and Bridges, Medical management/telemedicine, procurement of timely Utilization Certificates, disaster forecast and management etc.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh said, in agriculture, satellite driven seasonal cropping pattern, experiments on yield estimation, estimation of net-sown crop area and agricultural drought assessment studies are being conducted. Similarly, in the area of Soils, land degradation maps were generated and are useful for planning soil conservation / reclamation programs, land use planning, for bringing additional areas into cultivation and also to improve productivity levels in degraded lands. Maps of salt affected and water logging area, soil erosion maps are provided in BHUVAN portal. He said, Satellite data from IRS sensors are being used to generate soil maps through monoscopic (non-stereoscopic) visual interpretation and computer-assisted digital analysis approaches</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh stated that in the field of Forestry, apart from other activities, analysis of forest cover change, spatial biomass estimation, Community Biodiversity characterization, Forest fire alert system, inputs to working plan and wildlife plan preparation, Forest carbon sequestration, Inputs to UNFCCC etc are being carried out in close collaboration with MOEF and CC, DBT, FSI and State Forest Departments. In the area of Disaster Management, current activities are : Near Real Time Flood and Cyclone monitoring and mapping in the country, Flood Hazard/Risk Zonation for Flood prone states, Spatial Flood Early Warning, forest fire alerts, landslide zonation and inventory, agricultural drought studies among others, he added.</p><p>On Rural Development, Dr Jitendra Singh said that there are several initiatives/projects, which are taken up by State and Central Government departments at micro and macro level to enrich the assets required in the rural sector. Some examples are Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) (collected information on 3.5 crore assets), Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), Integrated Watershed Management, Programme (IWMP) (collected information on 1.5 Lakh points), and On Farm Water Management (OFWM), National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) Project, Rural connectivity, Sanitation, which uses the latest remote sensing and GIS technologies in operational modes.</p><p>Striking a note of appreciation, Dr Jitendra Singh said, it is not a widely known fact that ISRO had been providing Liquid Oxygen continuously on a large scale to several State governments from their own manufacturing facilities or from the existing stock during the COVID pandemic. Not only this, he said, ISRO also engaged in repurposing existing resources, scaling up of capacity of their facilities and also transferred technology to supplement the country's fight against the second wave of COVID-19, when the wave was at its peak.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124564635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:632T-Y8F1-DYTH-G036-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 5, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. I'm Don Hatcher, President and CEO of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars Glemser, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerwin, Vice President, International and HSE; Bryce Kremnica, Vice President of North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President of Investor Relations. We'll be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss our Q2 2023 results. Presentation can be found on our website under Invest with Us and Events and Presentations.</p><p>Please refer to our advisory and forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today, and outlines the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>Production during the second quarter averaged 83,152 BOEs per day, which was at the top end of our Q2 guidance range of 80,000 to 83,000. We revised our Q2 production guidance in mid-May to reflect the temporary shut-in of approximately 30,000 BOEs a day in West Central Alberta due to forest fires. In the impact of Q2 volumes from the wildfires and the Australia downtime was approximately 8,000 BOEs per day. Our team was quick to respond to the fire situation in Alberta and was able to safely restore all of the production within weeks of the initial shut-in, which minimized the impact of the fire. In addition, we achieved strong operational performance across many of our other assets.</p><p>We generated CAD247 million of fund flows and invested CAD167 million of E&amp;D capital, resulting in CAD80 million of free cash flow, of which we returned CAD40 million to shareholders via the base dividend and share buybacks, representing a return of capital payout of approximately 50%. During the first half of 2023, we have declared CAD33 million in dividends and repurchased CAD54 million of our common shares representing CAD87 million return to our shareholders. We continue to target shareholder returns of 25% to 30% of free cash flow for 2023 with debt reduction remaining the priority until we achieve our next net debt target of CAD1 billion.</p><p>Net debt at the end of Q2 decreased slightly to CAD1.3 billion, representing a trailing net debt to fund flow ratio 1 times given the front-end weighting of our capital program, combined with higher forecast production and cash flows in the back half of the year, we anticipate generating more free cash flow in the second half, which should translate to accelerated debt reduction.</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 54,064 BOEs per day in Q2, a decrease of 10% or 6,000 BOEs per day from the prior quarter, mainly due to the disposition of approximately 5,500 BOEs a day of higher cost assets in our Southeast Saskatchewan and approximately 4,000 BOEs a day of fire-related downtime in West Central Alberta. We're able to partially offset this impact with organic production growth from Mica, Montney, Southeast Saskatchewan and the U.S. assets, which added approximately 3,400 BOEs a day combined in Q2. All the production that was temporary shut-in as a result of the wildfires has been restored, thanks to the hard work of our employees and contractors. Although there was no major damage to our facilities or well sites, we will continue to monitor the forest fire and take any necessary action to ensure the safety of our people and assets. We again want to thank our operations staff for the safely restoring production during this difficult period.</p><p>In West Central Alberta, we completed one and brought on production five, Mannville liquid-rich gas wells. By Mica, we drilled two, completed four, brought on production one Montney liquid rich gas well. In Saskatchewan, we drilled, completed and brought on production one oil well. In the US, we drilled seven, completed 10 and brought on production five oil wells in Wyoming. As part of our activity in the quarter, we participated in the drilling of two non-operated Parkman wells and one non-operated Niobrara well. We continue to evaluate these formations as it relate to future development prospects on our Powder River Basin, acreage in Wyoming. Across North America, we are seeing strong overall performance from our capital program and ongoing operations, which has helped in mitigating the impact of fire-related downtime in Alberta.</p><p>Our recent BC Montney wells at Mica continued to perform very well, with minimal decline seen over the first 120 days of production. BC pad results validates our Tier 1 inventory in BC and presents an opportunity for future down spacing. Our 2024 program will be focused exclusively on our BC lands with approximately 10 wells on or offsetting the 16 to 28 pad. We recently received the final permit required for the construction of the 16,000 BOE a day battery on the BC lands and are planning to start site preparation later this year. The majority of this construction will occur in the first half of 2024, and we fund it through a financing agreement with a third-party midstream company. This agreement was part of the Mica acquisition. We're excited to execute the next expansion phase and look forward to providing future updates in the quarters ahead.</p><p>Production from our international operations averaged 29,087 BOEs per day, an increase of 30% from the prior quarter, mainly due to the acquisition of additional working interest in Corrib, which closed on March 31 of this year. This acquisition added approximately 7,000 BOEs per day of premium priced European natural gas production. Ireland's production more than doubled in Q2 to an average of 11,251 BOEs a day -- due to the closing of this acquisition as well as better-than-forecast operational run rates. In the Netherlands, we completed one conventional gas well from our Q1 drilling program. In Germany, we continue to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans as we prepare for our first well we drilled in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>In Australia, we completed all remaining inspections and repair work within the primary systems of the platform at the end of Q2 and made preparations to restart the facility. As a result, we expect higher operational run rates with less online downtime in the future. Inspection and repair work completed on the platform was conducted in a safe and efficient manner without incident. We would again like to thank our staff and contractors for their diligence in executing a safe and successful program.</p><p>After completing all inspection repair work within the primary systems on the platform, we proceeded to function test all systems as part of the facility restart in early July. During the step, we noted that leak supplying seawater to a secondary area of the deluge fire suppression system to ensure we have addressed any offsetting items, we elected to replace the COR piping at this time, which will delay start up to the end of Q3. This is the longest period that Wandoo platform has been offline since Vermilion has operated it. The scope of the repair work itself was mainly pipe valves and fittings and replacements. It was time-consuming process given the logistics associated with working on an offshore platform. In particular, there are a limited number of beds to accommodate workers and the work itself require the assembly and the disassembly of complex gaffing through the platform. All the major work is now behind us. Systems on the platform are function tested and ready for start-up once the seawater piping is replaced.</p><p>With these delays in back short-term production and cash flow, it is the right long-term decision as it enhances the safety and the integrity of our asset while improving future operational runs rates. The Wandoo asset has been in our portfolio since 2005 and has generated significant amount of free cash flow over this time frame. 2022 Wandoo crude sold at a US $14 [Phonetic] premium to Brent, which drives very strong netbacks. Under current strip pricing, we are forecasting over CAD100 million of free cash flow from Australia in 2024.</p><p>I will now pass it over to Lars to discuss our guidance and financial outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Dion. As a result of the increased scope of repair work on the Wandoo platform in Australia as well as the planned turnaround at the core facility in Ireland, we expect Q3 volumes to be consistent with Q2 guidance of 80,000 to 83,000 BOE a day. As we complete the Australia integrity work and core turnaround, we will be positioned to deliver Q4 production in the range of 86,000 to 89,000 BOE a day. As a result of strong operational execution and performance across our portfolio, we are maintaining our 2023 annual production guidance of 82,000 to 86,000 BOE a day as we have been able to offset much of the impact from the Alberta wildfires and extended Australia downtime. The rest of our annual financial guidance remains unchanged from our last revision.</p><p>Our disciplined approach towards debt reduction, combined with our asset high-grading initiatives over the past three years has made Vermilion a more resilient business today. By the end of this year, we will have nearly cut our debt in half while also funding over CAD1 billion of strategic acquisitions and have significantly increased our average annual FFO from pre-COVID levels. While strong commodity prices have contributed to this improvement, we believe the company is much better positioned. Our top decile netbacks, low-base decline, diversified commodity exposure and capital-efficient asset base, combined with our modest base dividend payout, translates to a very resilient business that could be managed through low commodity cycles and is well positioned for increased return of capital to shareholders as debt is reduced.</p><p>As we look out to 2024, we are currently forecasting a significant increase in FFO to over CAD1.4 billion, assuming a flat production profile. With this, we expect to achieve our next net debt target of CAD1 billion during the first half of 2024. Consistent with our previous messaging, we plan to increase shareholder returns upon achieving this debt target, and we'll communicate the method and targeted payout range at that time. We anticipate that share buybacks will remain the primary mechanism for returning incremental capital beyond the base dividend. And as such, we renewed our normal course issue bid in early July and continue to buy back shares. Since July of last year, we have bought back 5.7 million shares.</p><p>Lastly, I wanted to provide a brief update on our hedge position, in particular, our European gas hedges. European gas has been trading at elevated levels for the past few years and we believe there has been a structural positive shift in European gas fundamentals as you can see in our forward price on this chart. European gas prices are currently trading approximately 7 times higher than AECO gas prices and the forward curve is holding in at around CAD20 per MMBtu. This is a very attractive price as it generates high project returns and significant free cash flow from our European gas assets. As such, we have been actively hedging our forward European gas production at or above these levels. For the upcoming periods on European gas in Canadian dollar terms, we have 51% hedged for second half of 2023 at an average price of CAD30 per MMBtu, 30% hedged for the first half of 2024 at an average floor of CAD47 per MMBtu and 16% hedged for second half 2024 at an average floor of CAD25 per MMBtu. We have also been starting to layer in some oil hedges and intend to increase our corporate hedge position from current levels with a view to lock in a reasonable amount of cash flow to provide greater certainty in achieving our debt targets and in support of executing our operational and return of capital plans.</p><p>With that I would like to pass it back to Dion for his closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. To further expand on Lars' comments on free cash flow generating capacity. I would like to highlight the following chart, which shows our free cash flow allocation over the past few years. The blue bar shows the total amount of free cash flow generated by the stack partials, how this free cash flow was allocated in each of the years. As you can see, the majority of our free cash flow, a total of CAD1.6 billion between 2021 and 2023 was allocated to debt reduction and acquisitions. It's aligned with our strategy of ensuring a strong balance sheet and robust asset base. Going in 2024, most of that heavy lifting on debt reduction will be behind us, which means we have more free cash flow to allocate the shareholder returns in the years ahead. As you look into 2024, we are positioned to generate significantly higher free cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, we intend to increase the amount of return to our shareholders once we achieve our CAD1 billion debt target expected during the first half of 2024.</p><p>Well, that concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, we would like to open it up for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Amir Arif from ATB Capital. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a few quick questions. First of all, just on the Montney side. I think you're planning 10 wells next year. Were you planning on drilling those currently with the construction in the first half. So should we expect Montney production to start being meaningful in the second half in terms of growth? Or is it all the drilling be happening once you've got better clarity on start-up of the facility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe I can take that high level question here. This is Dion. Thanks for the question. As noted on the call, the construction of the battery itself will some of that site prep work will initiate second half of this year, but the bulk will be in the first half of 2024. So from a planning point of view, we would initiate that drilling. But realistically, I think the timeline for that production coming on would be closer to midyear. So that's our assumption or plans right now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then so Dion, would you drill all 10 wells in the first half? Or the 10 is spread throughout the year for next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>These -- well, there's basically two -- mainly two pads, and so this would be back-to-back drilling. As you can imagine, there's some cost synergies and efficiencies. So yes, we would look to drill those pads back to back and line it up for midyear.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Appreciate that. And then just a quick question on the Germany. I know you continue to drill that deep exploration gas well over there. Can you just give us an update on when you expect to head TD? And when do you expect to have some results on that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I'm going to pass it over to Darcy Kerwin, our Vice President of International. Darcy, do you want to take that one?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks, Amir. As you know, we've been excited about the deep gas exploration potential in Germany. We have successfully drilled deep gas wells there before we drilled Burgmoor Z5 in 2019, that well is still producing nicely for us. And so we're kind of after some pause during the COVID downturn, we put renewed focus on that exploration program, both on the geo side and on the permitting side. So we have a number of interesting prospects to look out there in Germany, and we'll kick off kind of the first of that set of prospects starting here in Q4 2023 with the first exploration well that we plan to drill.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>So I guess from a TD point of view, Darcy, we're really looking at early next year with the time we take to spud the well and get those well results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we'll spud the well in Q4, and then that well will drill through the end of the year and TD early in 2024 [Phonetic].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. I appreciate that. And just a final question on the windfall taxes. The TTF gas price was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter, yet windfall taxes were up. Can you just help me understand why would it move with the TTF prices? Is there just a lag in terms of the payments?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, let me pass over to Lars to address that question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks, Amir. The big reason for the increase in windfall taxes from Q1 to Q2 of this year is the fact that we closed the Corrib acquisition on March 31 of this year. And so in Q2, we started to recognize the production and FFO or free cash flow impact of the incremental 36.5%. So that would explain the bulk of the increase Q1 to Q2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amir Arif:</emphasis></p><p>I appreciate that thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed with your closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>With that, thank you again for participating in our Q2 conference call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-fd6fe9206c3859a2b76f5d4f6caf769f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB8-WWW3-RTMS-H3KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 AlphaStreet Inc.

Recommendations from this Plan identified significant growth and critical needs of the High School as the top District priority. The High School Expansion Planning process has just begun, a Planning Committee was formed, and they are at the onset of identifying needs, setting priorities, and developing a long-term plan that best addresses growth. The Planning Committee is asking you to give your insights and feedback to launch this process by responding to the following survey.</p><p>The Whitefish School District adopted a new Long Range Facility Plan in the fall of 2021 and the plan identified increased enrollment and the need to expand the high school facilities as a top priority. In the spring, the district began its planning process for a potential high school building expansion that would include creating additional learning spaces as well as an activities complex.</p><p>In May, the Whitefish School Board unanimously approved the selection of the Cushing Terrell architect firm out of Missoula to lead the preliminary design and planning for the project. In the fall the school district in conjunction with the architects hosted a community meeting and then in early November, they promoted a community survey to help identify the needs and priorities of the high school to aid the direction of the expansion project.</p><p>The survey asked several questions, some including asking what should be the top guiding principles of the planning process as well as the highest priorities for the new facility to include. The survey also asked community members to rate the importance of expanding the high school learning facilities and rate the importance of the district having its own athletic complex, as well as additional questions or feedback.</p><p>Means emphasized that the district is at the onset of gathering information and identifying needs that the expansion would address. The survey, put together by Cushing Terrell, was due back on Nov. 11.</p><p>The district plans to have additional community meetings and ways of gathering feedback as the process continues.</p><p>Emergency Operations Plan</p><p>The Whitefish School Board also unanimously approved the 2022-23 Emergency Operations Plan that guides the school district's response to various emergency situations that could arise.</p><p>The school board held a work session in October where administrators and board members worked on the new document.</p><p>\"This document really outlines our procedures and our process related to our emergency operations... it focuses on our incident command structure, our goals and responsibilities related to that,\" Superintendent Dave Means said.</p><p>Means added that the process of creating the document is unique as the district was able to include not only school administrators and personnel in the planning process but also the Whitefish Police and Fire Departments. With the police and fire departments on the same page with the schools, it will help the organization of handling an emergency on school grounds.</p><p>\"We're very fortunate that we get to work so closely with them in the development of something like this...\" Means said. \"We're following a similar process and procedure in terms of communication in all of our roles and responsibilities.\"</p><p>The plan details the procedure for a variety of potential emergency situations, such as fire or forest fire, flooding, active threat, severe storms and more.</p><p>At the beginning of the document, it states the purpose of the Emergency Operations Plan.</p><p>\"The purpose of the Whitefish School District Emergency Operations Plan (School EOP) is to identify and respond to incidents by outlining the responsibilities and duties of Whitefish Schools and their employees, students, and families. Developing, maintaining, training, and exercising the plan empowers everyone involved in an incident to act quickly and to be well informed,\" the document reads.</p><p>You can view the full document on the Whitefish School District website <url normalizedValue=\"https://wsd44.org\">https://wsd44.org</url>/ under the latest school board meeting.</p><p>Transportation route extension</p><p>The school board also voted unanimously to extend a school bus route that would stop at a newer subdivision and would serve at least one family now with more in the future.</p><p>Josh Branstetter, principal at Whitefish Middle School, is also the district's transportation liaison with Rocky Mountain Transportation which provides the school busses for the Whitefish School District. Branstetter presented the proposed route extension, which he said would add 5.2 miles of extra driving per day. With 128 remaining school days, the route extension would be an extra $1,044 this year.</p><p>There was an identified need in Route Two, which picks up kids along Highway 93 South. The new bus stop is at Harvest View Lane in a subdivision off Church Drive. Branstetter says it would serve four WMS students and one Muldown student currently and help ensure more consistent school attendance.</p><p>After the Whitefish School Board approved the extension, Branstetter now takes the proposal to the Flathead County Transportation Committee to get approval before they can go ahead with the route extension.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Whitefish Pilot (Whitefish, Mont.)

In a new study, a team of Michigan State University scientists designed and fabricated a remote forest fire detection and alarm system powered by nothing but the movement of the trees in the wind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As detailed in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the device, known as MC-TENG short for multilayered cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator generates electrical power by harvesting energy from the sporadic movement of the tree branches from which it hangs.</p><p>As far as we know, this is the first demonstration of such a novel MC-TENG as a forest fire detection system, said lead author Changyong Cao, who directs the Laboratory of Soft Machines and Electronics in MSUs School of Packaging and is an assistant professor in the Packaging School and Departments of Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p><p>The self-powered sensing system could continuously monitor the fire and environmental conditions without requiring maintenance after deployment, he said.</p><p>For Cao and his team, the tragic forest fires in recent years across the American West, Brazil and Australia were driving forces behind this new technology. Cao believes that early and quick response to forest fires will make the task of extinguishing them easier, significantly reducing the damage and loss of property and life.</p><p>Traditional forest fire detection methods include satellite monitoring, ground patrols, watch towers, among others, which have high labor and financial costs in return for low efficiency.</p><p>Current remote sensor technologies are becoming more common, but primarily rely on battery technology for power.</p><p>Although solar cells have been widely used for portable electronics or self-powered systems, it is challenging to install these in a forest because of the shading or covering of lush foliage, said Yaokun Pang, co-author and postdoc associate at Caos lab.</p><p>TENG technology converts external mechanical energy such as the movement of a tree branch into electricity by way of the triboelectric effect, a phenomenon where certain materials become electrically charged after they separate from a second material with which they were previously in contact.</p><p>The simplest version of the TENG device consists of two cylindrical sleeves of unique material that fit within one another. The core sleeve is anchored from above while the bottom sleeve is free to slide up and down and move side to side, constrained only by an elastic connective band or spring. As the two sleeves move out of sync, the intermittent loss of contact generates electricity. The MC-TENG are equipped with several hierarchical triboelectric layers, increasing the electrical output.</p><p>The MC-TENG stores its sporadically generated electrical current in a carbon-nanotube-based micro supercapacitor. The researchers selected this technology for its rapid charge and discharge times, allowing the device to adequately charge with only short but sustained gusts of wind.</p><p>At a very low vibration frequency, the MC-TENG can efficiently generate electricity to charge the attached supercapacitor in less than three minutes, Cao said.</p><p>The researchers outfitted the initial prototype with both carbon monoxide (CO) and temperature sensors. The addition of a temperature sensor was intended to reduce the likelihood of a false positive carbon dioxide reading.</p><p>Other co-authors include doctoral candidate Shoue Chen, undergraduate Junchi An, Keliang Wang, and engineering professors Yiming Deng, Andre Benard and Nizar Lajnef.</p><p>Cao hopes the team will be able to field test a production device to monitor forest environmental conditions and test scenarios, making use of materials that mimic a real fire. The team also aims to add additional functionality, allowing the device to be adapted for the weather and environmental conditions where it is deployed.</p><p>This research was partially funded by the U.S. Department of Agricultures National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Michigan Economic Development Corporation, American Society for Nondestructive Testing Faculty Grant Program, and MSU and MSU Technologies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123781458</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606V-XP81-JCBF-S40K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 24, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I would now like to turn the meeting over to Chantal Melanson. Please go ahead, Ms. Melanson.</p><p>CHANTAL MELANSON, EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT, MAJOR DRILLING GROUP INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned, we would like to welcome you to Major Drilling's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On the call, we will have Denis Larocque, President and CEO; and Ian Ross, our Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>Our results were released yesterday evening and can be found on our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.majordrilling.com\">www.majordrilling.com</url>. We also invite you to visit our website for further information.</p><p>Before we get started, we'd like to caution you that during this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements about future events or the future financial performance of the company. These statements are forward-looking in nature, and actual events or results may differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements.</p><p>I will now turn the presentation over to Denis Larocque. Please go ahead.</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; NON-INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, MAJOR DRILLING GROUP INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Chantal, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We had another strong quarter as we continued to see steady growth month by month throughout the quarter. As expected, we saw increased activity from copper, lithium, silver and nickel customers, which helped offset the reduced demand from junior exploration companies as capital markets fundraising remains a challenge for some of those companies.</p><p>Early in the summer, project delays due to permitting and forest fires impacted their North American operations. However, by the end of the quarter, we saw the return of strong activity levels. We were particularly pleased with the result from our South American and Australasian operations, which are seeing a pickup in activity that bodes well for the future.</p><p>The strong EBITDA generation, combined with our now completely debt-free position allows us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders, as we initiated our share buyback program, executing on it at a very attractive level this quarter. Including these initiatives, we still ended the quarter with a net cash position of CAD 60.8 million.</p><p>With that, Ian will walk us through the quarter's financials and then I'll discuss the market outlook further. Ian?</p><p>IAN ROSS, CFO, MAJOR DRILLING GROUP INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Denis. Revenue for the quarter was CAD 198.9 million, relatively flat from revenue of CAD 199.8 million reported in the same quarter last year. Activity levels remain elevated despite some challenges in North America with forest fires and customer delays relating to permitting issues. The favorable foreign exchange translation impact on revenue and net earnings for the quarter, when comparing to the effective rates for the same period last year was approximately CAD 6 million and CAD 1 million, respectively.</p><p>The overall gross margin percentage, excluding depreciation, was 30.1% for the quarter, compared to 30.8% for the same period last year. We were able to maintain strong margin performance with inflation impacts continue to be covered by pricing adjustments in most markets. We are starting to see some stability with inflation in some of our direct costs as supply chains continue to improve.</p><p>G&amp;A costs were CAD 16.5 million, an increase of CAD 300,000 compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was driven by annual inflationary wage adjustments implemented at the start of the new fiscal year. Foreign exchange loss was CAD 1.6 million compared to a loss of CAD 700,000 for the same quarter last year.</p><p>While the company's reporting currency is the Canadian dollar, various jurisdictions have net monetary assets or liabilities exposed to various other currencies. The company strives to limit its exposure to the Argentine peso. However, Argentina generated a significant portion of the loss during the current quarter as the currency faced continued devaluation.</p><p>The income tax provision for the quarter was CAD 7.2 million compared to CAD 7.3 million for the prior year period. The income tax expense for the quarter was impacted by lower utilization of previously unrecognized tax loss. Net earnings were CAD 21.8 million or CAD 0.26 per share for the quarter compared to net earnings of CAD 24.2 million or CAD 0.29 per share for the prior year quarter.</p><p>EBITDA is CAD 40.3 million compared to CAD 43.5 million in the prior year quarter. The operational leverage in our business model continues to deliver strong EBITDA results as we progressed through these elevated activity levels.</p><p>Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter in a very strong net cash position of CAD 60.8 million. With the continued high interest rate environment, the company repaid the remaining CAD 20 million of its long-term debt. The facility remains available to us, if needed, providing a tremendous competitive advantage and flexibility as we continue to focus the company on either organic or strategic M&amp;A growth opportunities. Company also took the opportunity at current valuations to make use of its normal course issuer bid, spending CAD 1.3 million on share buybacks at an average price of CAD 8.89 per share. We will continue to be opportunistic with our buyback plan with current valuations at historic lows.</p><p>We remain committed to reinvesting in the business by spending CAD 16.3 million on capital expenditures adding 5 new drill rigs and support equipment while disposing of 4 older, less-efficient rigs, bringing the total rig count to 601. The new breakdown of our fleet and utilization is as follows: 287 specialized drills at 46% utilization, 115 conventional drills at 49% utilization, 199 underground drills at 54% utilization for a total of 601 drills at 49% utilization.</p><p>As we've mentioned before, specialized work in our definition is not necessarily conducted with a specialized drill. Rather, it is work that requires we meet the rigorous standards of our customers in terms of technical capabilities, operational and safety standards and other related factors. These standards are becoming increasingly important to our customers.</p><p>In the first quarter, revenue from specialized work accounted for 65% of our total revenue as we continue to see increased demand for our specialized services. Conventional drilling, which is mostly driven by juniors, made up 11% of our revenue for the quarter while underground drilling revenue remained consistent at 24% of our total revenue.</p><p>Seniors and intermediates continue to drive our business, representing 76% of revenue this quarter as they value the high-quality specialized services Major Drilling offers and remain committed to partnering on their drilling programs. With the continued challenges accessing capital, revenue derived from juniors remained constant from last quarter at 24%.</p><p>In terms of commodities, following on trends seen in previous quarters, there has been a shift to battery metals with copper, nickel, lithium and silver projects combining for approximately 40% of our revenue. Gold, which historically represents 50% of our revenue dropped to 41% this quarter, while iron ore contributed 11% of our revenue.</p><p>With that overview on our financial results, I'll now turn the presentation back to Denis to discuss the outlook.</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: Thanks, Ian. As we move in our second quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect to see the monthly growth that we experienced from the beginning of this calendar year to continue throughout the quarter. The need to replenish supply shortfalls on most metals remains a priority for mining companies despite the fluctuations we see in commodity prices. Those prices have remained well above the level needed to support exploration and we are already in discussion with several senior customers regarding their calendar 2024 program, with many looking to book rigs early.</p><p>I think it's important to highlight the reasons why Major Drilling is extremely well positioned for the future as the world continues to look to find new supplies of minerals to meet the growing demand in the world of electrification. First of all, Major Drilling is the leader in specialized drilling, meaning we are the go-to drilling company for many mining companies with technically challenging programs whether it's remote, deep, high altitude, Arctic or directional. As a reminder, Major Drilling drilled the longest diamond drill hole ever drilled in Canada at the Osisko Mining Windfall Project site in 2020. As well, the company is now a significant player in the underground services sector, growing our underground drilling revenue by 275% as compared to peak levels of 2012.</p><p>By being the largest pure-play drilling company in the industry, it gives us access to many technologies from our suppliers where we often become first adopters, which helps keep our leadership division in specialized drilling but also as an innovative company in our industry. All of this wouldn't be possible without an experienced management team, which is the key to our success as this industry relies on expertise when faced with challenging projects.</p><p>Finally, and importantly, financial discipline has permitted us to position ourselves as the -- with the strongest balance sheet in our industry, which allows us to have the resources ready to mobilize on some of the most demanding projects out there and maintain our position as both the operator and employer of choice in our industry. We are seeing more and more customers recognizing the impact of the higher quality of our services that can have -- on their overall drilling costs. Completing each hole and safe production are more important to most of our customers than the pure price per meter as these items can make a huge difference on their drilling program, especially when dealing with a specialized project. That is why we are keeping our commitment to investing in the development of our people and investing in our fleet.</p><p>Looking forward, the global demand for electric vehicles continues to grow and will require an enormous amount of copper and battery metals, which will increase the pressure on the existing supply-demand dynamic. We expect all of this to lead to substantial additional investments in copper and other base metal exploration projects as we help our customers discover the metals that will allow the world to accelerate its effort towards a green economy.</p><p>Many of the new mineral deposits in question are located in areas challenging to access, requiring complex drilling solutions and continued demand for specialized services. Despite the urgent need to replenish mineral reserves, both for gold and base metal, the industry is still early in the exploration cycle. We are only in the third year of this cyclical upturn and the last upturn lasted 10 years. The mining industry is still in the discovery phase and will have to go through an intense multiyear infill drilling period to develop new mines in order to fill the projected supply gap in the different commodities.</p><p>With these fundamentals still firmly in place, the long-term outlook for our company remains extremely positive. Major Drilling remains in a unique position to react to and benefit from these market dynamics.</p><p>With that, we can open the call to questions. Operator?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We have a first question from Gordon Lawson from Paradigm Capital.</p><p>GORDON LAWSON, ANALYST, PARADIGM CAPITAL INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you please provide some more color on the wildfires in terms of how many operations were affected? And how much of these issues spilled into the current quarter?</p><p>IAN ROSS: Yes. So for us in the quarter, the wildfires weren't a huge impact, in terms of number of projects. We had a few -- it was more of the permitting was probably the bigger impact on the quarter. Since then, the forest fires have subsided for us, our operations in Canada. We estimate approximately CAD 5 million in revenue or 5% of that region's revenue was impacted in Q1 versus permitting and forest fires combined.</p><p>GORDON LAWSON: Permitting specific to North America? Or are you also referencing Mexico there?</p><p>IAN ROSS: Mainly North America.</p><p>GORDON LAWSON: Okay. Okay. And one more, if I may. Are you able to break down your Mexican operations in terms of Major versus junior as well as gold and silver?</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: We don't go in that granular detail. But obviously, Mexico typically is gold and silver driven for the most part, that would be -- the majority of our revenue comes from that. And it's pretty much balanced between junior and senior, but the Mexico typically has a bit of a higher balance of junior projects typically than the rest of the world.</p><p>GORDON LAWSON: So you expect a bigger impact there to be the junior financing rather than the mining legislation? Or is that too difficult to predict at this point?</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: Well, I mean, one leads to the other, it's going to make it probably a bit more difficult to raise money for juniors with the government. So the juniors are going to be impacted from that. But as well, like you say, the financing -- overall financing issues are probably affecting Mexico a bit more than other regions, yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We have a question from Ryan Hanley from the Laurentian Bank.</p><p>RYAN HANLEY, DIRECTOR &amp; MINING ANALYST, LAURENTIAN BANK SECURITIES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a couple of quick ones for you on some of the regional operations. I guess maybe to take it a step further on the forest fires. Have you gotten any indications that maybe some of the juniors are looking to ramp up their programs heading into the end of the calendar year? Like are there guys that might be looking to add another rig or 2 to try to get caught up a bit after some of the forest fire-related shutdowns?</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: It's too early to tell at this point. There's the odd one here and there. Now is that going to be -- is that going to be a trend? It's too early to tell at this point, but every year it seems like you get to the fall and budgets that -- whether it's junior or senior, budgets that were not spent during the year tends to -- that's where sometimes you get the phone call in a panic and they want 1 or 2 more drills because they're behind on budget and they want to make sure the budget is spent before the end of the year. So you do get that, but it's too early to tell at this point in terms -- because those typically happens in late September, October.</p><p>RYAN HANLEY: Okay. Makes sense. And then in South and Central America, obviously, Mexico is pretty challenging. But in some of the other countries in the region, I think there's been a few other elections especially on the regional level, lately. Has there been any other impact in any other countries down there where things have gotten a bit more challenging over the last, call it, 3 to 6 months?</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: Well, the Mexico one that Gordon referenced the new law there. We're going to see what kind of impact that's going to have. The only other one that will be interesting to watch is Argentina. There's an election coming in October. Other than that, things are -- in our other markets, things are going well. Chile, I think the investment climate there has improved with a bit more certainty or less uncertainty, I guess, around mining with things getting clarified and things put behind us on there. So I think we're going to be -- things are going to be fine going forward in Latin America. Like I said, Argentina is the one where we're going to watch the election in October and see what kind of impact that might have.</p><p>RYAN HANLEY: Perfect. That's really helpful. Maybe just quickly switching gears to the finance side. Can you remind me on that contingent consideration, what period is that payable over? Or what's the kind of timeframe I should be looking at for that to be kind of wound down?</p><p>IAN ROSS: Yes. So there's one, as I said it was over 3 years and the second year payout would be due in the second quarter coming up and then 1 year from then is the last payout.</p><p>RYAN HANLEY: Perfect. And then the last one because I'm guessing this is probably going to come up anyway because it does on most calls. But given the great cash flow generation, you've now got no long-term debt. I guess you're kind of somewhat limited in buybacks because you don't want to hurt your liquidity too much. Any updates you can provide on potential dividend in the future?</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: At this point, there's no plan of that. I mean it's always something that is discussed internally. But at this point, there's no plan.</p><p>RYAN HANLEY: Okay. Fair enough.</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: Yes. And by the way, Ryan, that's because our focus is still on growth, and we're still very positive on the future and the possibility. So for us, we're still very much focused on growth and also what could come out over the next couple of years with, as I mentioned, we're just, right now, it's just exploration for the most part, but there's going to be a lot of infill drilling to bring those projects and those -- to turn those into mines. So we want to make sure that we're well positioned to take advantage of that.</p><p>RYAN HANLEY: Well, congrats on a great quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Dennis Scannell from Rutabaga Capital.</p><p>DENNIS J. SCANNELL, PRINCIPAL, LEAD PARTNER &amp; PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RUTABAGA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC: Yes. Just a quick thing for me. Looking at the segment information. So Ian, I think you talked about permitting issues kind of hitting revenues by about CAD 5 million, if I heard you correctly. We're still seeing a negative compare even if you add that back on the sales side. And I'm just wondering, is that reflective of just some lower activity by your customers or maybe some share loss to other operators? Just additional color on what's going on in North America.</p><p>IAN ROSS: Yes. The bulk of that other piece that, as you mentioned, is related really to juniors. There's a bigger -- especially early on in the cycle, the juniors are more present in the big markets, Canada, U.S. and Australia. And with the financing issues that basically those companies are facing. North America was more impacted about -- for the -- those junior projects. And in fact, S&amp;P Global, I think, has mentioned that exploration globally, they were forecasting, I think, would be down 20% this year. And so -- and I think the bulk of that would be related to the lack of financing for juniors, which again impacts mostly North America.</p><p>DENNIS J. SCANNELL: Yes. Okay. So and just kind of thinking then comparisons start to get easier, what in calendar '24 or just in terms of kind of your year-over-year comps, just out of curiosity?</p><p>DENIS LAROCQUE: Yes, it probably with the drop because we had a very good year in terms of junior. The junior financing, the juniors were able to raise money in late 2020 and 2021, which then fueled exploration projects by these companies in 2021 and 2022. So that's where we saw a big uptick from juniors in those years. And now if the slowdown we're seeing right now, then -- so there's a bit of a reduction. So yes, so when you go to 2024, things should be fairly stable. If everything remains the same, you're right, we -- then we should be on an even playing field, if I might say, in terms of comparisons.</p><p>OPERATOR: There is no further question registered at this time.

In light of the recent investigation by CapRadio and the California Newsroom and the billions of dollars that Congress has recently provided for hazardous fuels projects we request that you provide us with a detailed briefing regarding the failed implementation of the Trestle Project, which experts have determined could have saved the town and spared its residents.</p><p>As highlighted in the investigation by CapRadio and the California Newsroom, the Forest Service warned the residents of Grizzly Flats decades ago that a blaze such as Caldor could destroy their town, which is surrounded on three sides by the Eldorado National Forest. Fire modeling from the Forest Service highlighted that a severe wildfire could engulf the town in as little as 24 hours. The Forest Service then spent nearly 10 years developing the Trestle Forest Health Project to protect Grizzly Flats by removing fuels on 15,000 acres of forest by 2020 to prevent a catastrophic fire using a combination of commercial thinning, hand thinning, and prescribed fire. However, the recent investigation found that the Forest Service neglected priority areas at the highest risk for fire, delayed the deadline for the projects completion, only completed 14% of the intended work, and only implemented the commercial thinning elements of the project that produce revenue for the forest unit.</p><p>On the other hand, the residents of Grizzly Flats took immediate action after being presented with the fire risk modeling. A volunteer Grizzly Flats Fire Safe Council was formed following that modeling and raised over $2 million dollars through grants and grassroots funding to protect their community. Over the next 15 years, the council created fire breaks on the north, east, and west sides of the town with the understanding that the Forest Service would complete its forest management and fire mitigation plan that included a fuel reduction project on the towns highly-combustible southern side, a promise that the Forest Service ultimately never fulfilled.</p><p>On August 17, 2021, the entire town of Grizzly Flats was destroyed by the Caldor Fire. The fire followed the southern path that had been predicted by the modeling and that would have been mitigated by full implementation of the Trestle Forest Health Project.</p><p>It is unacceptable that the towns proactive efforts and calls for aggressive fire mitigation assistance were met with inaction and delays from the Forest Service. Though we understand the administrative and environmental hurdles facing forest management projects including staffing shortages, funding challenges, climate change, and endangered species concerns the length of delays with regard to the Trestle Forest Health Project are particularly egregious and raise broader concerns.</p><p>In light of this example and in anticipation of billions of dollars being spent on similar projects throughout California and the West in the coming years we request a full explanation for the delays on the Trestle Forest Health Project and a thorough overview of the uncompleted components of the project, the misplaced focus on the commercial thinning elements of the project, the lack of prescribed burns, and any administrative delays that ultimately resulted in the project being left incomplete. We also ask that you name any other communities in California for which the Forest Service has identified a high risk of catastrophic wildfire and is in the process of preparing a plan or has prepared a plan but not yet fully implemented it.</p><p>We look forward to your response, and we hope to continue working together to increase the efficiency and funding for crucial wildfire mitigation projects to prevent further tragedies.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125568038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XD-Y2S1-JCBF-S393-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These piles will eventually be burned, leaving behind an uncrowded stand of larger trees, which is an easier place for firefighters to stop a blaze. <br/>Since May 2023, the Missoula Ranger District has been working to establish similar fuel breaks along 37 miles of road in the Fish, Graves, and Howard creek drainages just north of Highway 12. The goal is to improve firefighter and public safety and minimize the chance of a landscape-scale wildland fire. The use of fuel breaks as a fire management strategy is not uncommon, but there is something unique about these particular control lines: Their location was determined using a new risk-assessment tool. <br/>Missoula District Ranger Crystal Stonesifer stands on a dirt road in the Lolo National Forest near a shaded fuel break created to minimize wildfire risk. Before becoming district ranger, Stonesifer worked for the Rocky Mountain Research Station, where PODs were developed, for 11 years. 'When we were talking about implementing a shaded fuel break and we talked about where we would do it, I said let's make sure that we align our work with our POD boundaries,' Stonesifer said. Credit: Sarah Mosquera / MTFP<br/>Potential Operational Delineations, also known as PODs, is the name of a collaborative risk-based framework designed to help fire managers and landowners get on the same page before fires start. Drawing from a combination of spatial analytics and local expertise, PODs aims to identify where to best suppress fire when it threatens people, property or critical infrastructure, and also where opportunities exist to leverage fire to support fire-adapted landscapes and reduce future risk. <br/>To create PODs, stakeholders are assembled and first tasked with drawing lines on a map. The lines correspond to places where fires can often effectively be stopped, like a ridge, river, road or burn scar. Connected, POD lines create 'containers' on the landscape within which stakeholders can assess risk and make plans for what to do if and when a fire starts. Depending on the risk to people, property and other values inside the POD, decisions can be made to suppress fire, conduct fuel treatments like prescribed burns or mechanical thinning, or manage a natural or human-caused ignition for ecological benefit. <br/>Developed by the U.S. Forest Service, the PODs approach has been growing across the West since 2017. The framework is supported by a $100 million federal investment as part of the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law[1] and is now being used by an estimated 109 national forests and regional partners. Following a series of workshops, POD lines have been drawn as of late June 2023 for all units in USFS Region 1, which includes all seven national forests in Montana. <br/>But full-scale embrace of the PODs framework also faces obstacles. In Montana and other western states, fire management strategies that deviate from fast and full suppression have become politically unpopular, especially as climate change fuels larger, more frequent wildfires[2] and an increasing number of homes are built in the wildland-urban interface[3]. At the same time, most forests across the western U.S. have evolved in conjunction with fire and depend on it for regeneration and ecosystem health. Without fire, forest composition shifts[4] and fuels build up, which in turn increases the risk of severe wildfire, creating a dynamic known as the wildfire paradox[5]: The more wildfire is suppressed today, the more extreme, costly and hard to contain future fires will become. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.org/montana-fire-report-2023\">https://montanafreepress.org/montana-fire-report-2023</url>/ <br/>The PODs framework presents a middle path oriented toward learning to live with fire by identifying its hazards and benefits through the lens of risk. But implementing PODs also requires the consideration of a range of strategies that not all land management agencies are willing (or empowered) to pursue. In Montana, the tool is slowly gaining ground, both contributing to and relying on a broader cultural shift in fire management. <br/>A TEST IN THE TONTO <br/>The PODs framework was developed in 2016 by a group of researchers from the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula. <br/>The idea of PODs built on previous work in California's Sierra Nevada mountains that proposed a risk map to inform fire management decisions. The original concept came from a fuels planner named Phil Bowden, who, in partnership with RMRS research forester Matthew Thompson, published a 2016 paper that introduced 'strategic response zones,'[6] or categories assigned to each POD based on the potential benefits or losses associated with wildfire. The idea was that strategic response zones could offer a risk-based starting point for future fire management strategies. The RMRS research group, officially known as the Wildfire Risk Management Science Team, took the concept one step further and decided to combine the risk assessment process with feedback from on-the-ground fire managers and spatial analysis tools. <br/>The research team developed two models \u2014 Potential Control Locations and a Suppression Difficulty Index \u2014 that helped predict where fires could be safely and effectively stopped on the landscape. <br/>Then, in the spring of 2017, a wildfire in Arizona's Tonto National Forest presented an opportunity to test the PODs framework on an actual fire. <br/>Notably, another wildfire in the Tonto \u2014 called the Juniper Fire \u2014 had been managed to reduce fuels and future fire risk a year earlier. Months before the Juniper Fire ignited, fire managers had decided to conduct an experiment. Implementing a protocol similar to PODs, they pre-identified areas in one part of the forest that offered the best vegetative and topographic conditions to stop a wildfire. Then, when lightning sparked the Juniper Fire in May 2016, fire managers felt comfortable allowing it to burn to restore ecosystem health, confident that they could corral the fire along the predefined boundaries. <br/>At the end of the 2016 fire season, RMRS research ecologist and WRMS team member Kit O'Connor was visiting the Tonto when he learned about the outcome of the Juniper Fire. With the PODs framework recently completed, O'Connor floated the idea of working with local fire managers to develop PODs for the entire forest. They agreed. <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 09.19.202309.19.2023  <br/> 09.18.202309.19.2023  <br/> 09.18.202309.19.2023  <br/><br/><br/>'We said, 'What if you could [create PODs for] your entire landscape so you had a plan for every square inch and it was appropriate for the risk that was there?'' O'Connor said, recalling the initial conversation.  <br/>Luckily, a quantitative wildfire risk assessment had recently been completed for all USFS lands in Arizona and New Mexico. That assessment identified where the forest would be harmed, or benefited, by wildfire, essentially creating a landscape-level risk profile that WRMS researchers could then overlay with POD lines. The resulting map defined a network of 138 spatial fire 'containers' across the forest, with each container, or POD, assigned a strategic response based on the risk identified within its boundaries. In other words, if fire were to start anywhere in the forest, fire officials had a risk-based, science-informed plan ahead of time for how to manage it. <br/>Kit O'Connor, research ecologist at the Rocky Mountain Research Station, points at a printed map of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona. The map is overlaid with the Potential Control Locations model, which is a spatial tool that uses AI to identify the best locations to stop a wildfire. In general, red-colored areas are difficult places to control a fire, while areas in blue or green have a higher probability of containment.

Using PODs and the forest's strategic planning efforts to back up their decision-making, the district fire management officer was able to get buy-in from surrounding partners \u2014 including the mayor of the nearby community of Globe \u2014 to manage the fire simultaneously for ecological benefit and risk reduction, a strategy that ultimately created a 7,500-acre burn scar that restored pine forest and chaparral brush ecosystems and limited the risk of future fire, according to a 2019 Wildfire Magazine article[7]. The article, which O'Connor co-wrote, attributes the success of the Pinal Fire response to understanding the risks, making a plan beforehand, and communicating that plan to partners on the landscape. <br/>The Pinal Fire, along with two other wildfires on the Tonto that season, became a test case for the potential impact of PODs. Researchers, including O'Connor, credit that initial effort[8] with helping to refine the PODs framework and spur its adoption across the western U.S., where it is now in use on an estimated 109 national forests. <br/>WHERE MACHINE LEARNING MEETS ON-THE-GROUND KNOWLEDGE <br/>The USFS is now leading the effort to get even more fire managers engaged with PODs. <br/>While use of the PODs framework is not mandatory anywhere, it has received strong support from the highest levels of the agency[9] and $100 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. <br/>If a federal, state or tribal agency wants to develop PODs, the first step is completing a workshop ahead of fire season. Local fire management staff and area partners are invited to participate and POD lines are drawn, creating a vetted network of control locations where managers are confident a fire can be stopped. Spatial analytics, like Potential Control Locations and the Suppression Difficulty Index, can then enhance on-the-ground knowledge by using landscape characteristics, transportation networks and historical fire behavior to model where conditions are safest for firefighters and control lines most likely to hold. The PCL model uses a machine-learning algorithm \u2014 a type of artificial intelligence \u2014 to estimate the probability of holding a fire in a given location based on 20 years of data, while SDI summarizes spatial data to anticipate risk to firefighter safety. <br/>What the algorithm generates can never replace human knowledge, O'Connor said, but its success rate also speaks for itself. <br/>'Fire managers sometimes trust [the algorithm] better than their own judgment, which is scary because it's just a model,' O'Connor said. 'But at the same time, that's the track record that it has.' <br/>Ideally, prior to a PODs workshop, a risk assessment will have been created for that landscape, as was the case on the Pinal Fire. The assessment can then be overlaid with PODs to inform a plan for how fire will be managed if and when it occurs. <br/>In addition to blending local expertise with data, fire managers and researchers have identified several other benefits of the PODs process. <br/>Carl Seielstad, fire and fuels program manager and associate professor at the University of Montana FireCenter, started working as a firefighter for the USFS in 1990, later becoming a hotshot and then a smokejumper for 11 seasons. Seielstad currently works at UM, but also staffs and oversees the response to large, complex wildfires. <br/>For Seielstad, what he calls 'the power of PODs' is twofold. First, the PODs framework can empower fire managers to think differently and potentially implement new strategies. Second, and perhaps more important in the short-term, PODs can be an effective tool for explaining changes in fire management to the public. For example, PODs can help the public understand fire managers' rationale for pursuing a less-than-full-suppression approach, or offer a framework for discussing the need for fire in certain areas. <br/>'If we're ever going to get over the hump in fire management of being more proactive about allowing certain fires to burn and putting other fires out, you have to think about these things and plan for them before the fire happens.' Carl Seielstad, fire and fuels program manager and associate professor at the University of Montana FireCenter <br/>'[It] takes years to get the public on board, but the public's not resistant,' Seielstad said. 'They just need to think about it, and PODs lets them think about it in a way that is sensible, in my opinion.' <br/>Another noted benefit of the PODs process is that it enables fire managers to be more proactive, rather than reactive, by offering a way to plan before fire is on the ground. Identifying control locations on a map is common practice when managers are assessing how to approach a wildfire; the difference with PODs is that the maps are available year-round, rather than created in the moment. <br/>'If we're ever going to get over the hump in fire management of being more proactive about allowing certain fires to burn and putting other fires out, you have to think about these things and plan for them before the fire happens,' Seielstad said. <br/>Knowing where to control fire ahead of time can also reduce some of the uncertainty inherent in fire management, said Brad Pietruszka, an RMRS wildfire management specialist who is also part of the WRMS Team. <br/>In addition, the PODs planning approach lends itself to greater buy-in from entities that fire managers have to collaborate with in fire-prone landscapes. WRMS researchers found that having conversations with neighboring federal, state, tribal and private landowners is critical, because jurisdictional boundaries are often ineffective locations to stop a wildfire. <br/>The location of the shaded fuel break project on the Lolo National Forest as viewed through the Risk Management Assistance dashboard. The black lines indicate places where fire can often effectively be stopped. The colors correspond to the probability of holding a fire in that location based on the Potential Control Locations model. Credit: Bowman Leigh/MTFP<br/>'It's a very low-pressure situation when nothing's on fire,' O'Connor said. 'If you can get people to agree to a plan before smoke is in the air, before that fire ignites, it's much easier to bring them back around and say, 'Remember, we talked about this. This is what we're doing and this is why we're doing it.'' <br/>PODs can also inform where fuels are treated, like the shaded fuel break project on the Lolo National Forest, and offer a quick way for firefighters to get acclimated when assigned to an incident in an unfamiliar location. Once PODs are drawn for a landscape, the data is digitized and any firefighter or fire manager can view POD lines and spatial analytic tools on the publicly available Risk Management Assistance[10] dashboard, which is hosted by the USFS Fire and Aviation Management program. <br/>Lastly, aligning with one of the framework's central goals, PODs can identify the right place for the right fire at the right time. <br/>Promoting 'good' fire on the landscape is not a new idea. Historically, wildfire played a critical role in forests and grasslands across western North America. Fires resulting from lightning strikes and Indigenous burning practices cleared out accumulated fuels and also stimulated new growth, increased soil fertility and improved wildlife habitat. In addition, natural and human-caused fires left behind a fire footprint that reduced the future risk of severe wildfire. <br/>A burn scar from the Lolo Peak Fire, a lightning-caused blaze that burned more than 53,000 acres in the Lolo and Bitterroot national forests in early July 2017. Climate scientists expect wildfires to increase in size and frequency as the climate warms. Credit: Sarah Mosquera / MTFP<br/>Today, while prescribed fire and mechanical treatments help to address fuel buildup and wildfire risk, O'Connor says the pace and scale of these approaches will never catch up to the current fire deficit. <br/>'What we need to do is also focus on opportunities to leverage natural ignitions and grow fires out to the right places at the right time when conditions are right for that,' O'Connor said, adding that recently burned areas are generally the most effective control locations for future fires. <br/>By doing so, O'Connor argued, PODs can set the landscape up for success. <br/>'The goal isn't necessarily to keep fire small, isn't necessarily to limit fire spread, but very much to change the type of fire itself,' O'Connor said. 'It becomes a fire that is critical to the system functioning, protecting our watersheds, and basically limiting the impacts of these extreme fires that could happen.' <br/>THE LAW OF THE LAND <br/>When a wildfire occurs, fire managers face the challenge of weighing threats to personnel, public safety and property against what a 2023 study calls the 'inevitability and necessity of wildland fire[11].' Additionally, managers must grapple with a warming climate that favors more frequent and intense wildfire. <br/>Proponents of the PODs framework argue that it offers a pathway to better protecting firefighters, proactively developing risk-based fire management plans, and identifying where fire can be monitored and allowed to burn under low-risk conditions to improve forest health. <br/>But there are also obstacles to using PODs to inform fire management strategies \u2014 especially strategies that diverge from full suppression. <br/>'It's a very low-pressure situation when nothing's on fire. If you can get people to agree to a plan before smoke is in the air, before that fire ignites, it's much easier to bring them back around and say, 'Remember, we talked about this. This is what we're doing and this is why we're doing it.'' Kit O'Connor, research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station <br/>In general, federal, state and tribal land management plans are the law of the land that dictate the suite of options available to a fire manager. Even if PODs have been drawn and risk assessments completed, a land management plan will override any strategy suggested via the PODs process that conflicts with the plan's prescribed approach. <br/>In Montana, fire management strategies vary depending on the location. <br/>The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes' 2021 Flathead Reservation Fire Management Plan[12] allows lightning-caused fires to be managed for ecological benefit in specific areas with high elevation timber. In other areas, where fire spread poses a greater threat to communities and valuable resources, CSKT fire managers use a combination of strategies including initial attack, prescribed burning and mechanical treatments. <br/>The Lolo Forest Plan[13], which was last updated in 1986, requires that all unplanned ignitions on the Lolo National Forest be controlled, confined or contained. <br/>In other national forests in the state, plan language may allow for the use of natural, unplanned fires as a management tool, but Seielstad said in an email that those documents 'tend to lack specificity.' High-profile wildfires may involve higher levels of the USFS, but otherwise fire management decisions are typically made by a forest unit's district ranger and fire management officer based on current conditions and assessed threats to life or property. Considering the growing number of severe wildfires[14] and the legacy of fire suppression in federal wildfire policy[15], cultural and political pressures can also impact those decisions. <br/>'There's intense pressure [against] deviating from the [full suppression] status quo in fire. And I'd say that's most of Montana, honestly,' Seielstad said. <br/>Outside of the USFS, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation has a mandate to suppress all wildfires on state and private lands. The DNRC's approach to wildfire is directed by the 2020 Montana Forest Action Plan[16], as well as a constitutional obligation to protect commercial timber grown on state trust lands \u2014 timber that generates profits that help fund Montana schools[17]. The Forest Action Plan permits prescribed fire and mechanical fuel treatments, but does not allow for management of wildfire based on ecological benefits. <br/><br/>At this year's annual preseason fire briefing in May, Gov. Greg Gianforte made the state's approach to wildfire management abundantly clear. <br/>'We must pursue a policy of aggressive attack on all fires until they are extinguished, so long as firefighter safety is not at risk,' the governor said, adding that keeping fires small results in less damage, requires fewer resources and is more cost-effective. According to a 2015 paper[18], such pressure to suppress creates an incentive for fire managers to avoid allowing certain fires to burn for longer-term ecological benefits and risk reduction. <br/>But despite cultural and political pressures and the limitations of some land management plans, PODs are starting to gain traction. <br/>DNRC Forestry and Trust Lands Division Administrator Shawn Thomas confirmed that the Forest Action Plan determines the state's fire management strategy, but also left the door open for supporting federal partners' use of the PODs framework. <br/>Debris piles at a shaded fuel break on the Lolo National Forest, where smaller fuels have been cleared to reduce wildfire risk. The shaded fuel breaks in the Fish, Graves and Howard creek drainages are aligned with POD boundaries because fire managers have determined that these locations are most likely to stop a wildfire. Credit: Sarah Mosquera / MTFP<br/>'I can't say we're going to adopt the PODs as our strategy because we already have the Forest Action Plan, but certainly whatever direction the PODs create for our federal partners will be sort of part and parcel to how we're working together,' Thomas said. <br/>On the Lolo National Forest, Missoula District Fire Management Officer Jesse Kurpius also acknowledged that he has noticed a change in the way fire managers are thinking about risk management. <br/>'I've seen a shift probably in the last eight to 10 years of approaching [fire] from a more strategic point of view,' Kurpius said. 'Tools like [PODs] are aiding those decisions and backing the firefighters and the decision makers on managing risk appropriately.' <br/>The Lolo is currently one year into a four-year revision process[19] for its forest management plan. Once the revision is completed, Missoula District Ranger Stonesifer said, the forest will have a plan rooted in the best available science. So far, it is unclear if the revised plan will incorporate PODs. <br/>For Stonesifer, who is a former member of the WRMS team and worked at the RMRS for 11 years before becoming a district ranger, what sets PODs apart from other management approaches is the orientation toward risk, which gives fire managers an opportunity to consider different values on the landscape and how they might be impacted by fire. <br/>'It's a holistic way of looking at the landscape through a risk lens. And that's the cultural shift,' Stonesifer said. <br/>'I think PODs is a piece of it, but it's a bigger cultural shift. And cultural shifts take time.' <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.fundjournalism.org/donate/?campaign=7018Y000001m2oPQAQ\">https://montanafreepress.fundjournalism.org/donate/?campaign=7018Y000001m2oPQAQ</url><br/>Montana Free Press is a public-powered nonprofit newsroom, and it's thanks to readers just like you that we can bring Montanans quality, independent journalism.

The HAPS launched at 6:07 AM MST from the company's New Mexico facility and landed at 8:34 AM MST.</p><p>\"The automation performed flawlessly and at no point did our control team need to take over and command the system manually,\" said Stephanie Luongo, Sceye Chief of Mission Operations, \"We let the system do the driving.\"</p><p>Today's launch tested a newly developed software capability that increases the reliability of the HAPS during its most critical phases of flight-the launch and ascent. It was the first of a flight test program focused on rapid prototyping of new technologies that include automation and flight safety enhancements.</p><p>\"With every successful test flight we're getting closer to providing broadband and earth observation from the stratosphere,\" said Sceye CEO and Founder, Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen. \"We're very pleased with the results of this demonstration and will continue to advance flight testing throughout 2022.\"</p><p>There are 6 test flights planned for 2022, of which 4 are part of Sceye's R&amp;D test program. The program will determine optimized technologies for sustained flight in the stratosphere, scaling operations and lowering operational costs.</p><p>Last October, Sceye was the first to connect a Massive MIMO antenna with 3D beamforming from the stratosphere directly to smartphones on the ground over 140 km distance-a world record in Open RAN. The company also joined a consortium of New Mexico-based telecommunications companies and tribal entities to pilot delivery of universal broadband access to the Navajo Nation.</p><p>Sceye has partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EDD, and New Mexico Environment Department on a five-year study to monitor air quality in the State of New Mexico. Sceye's HAPS will track methane emissions with a sub 1 m resolution, allowing them to determine pollution levels as well as pinpoint individual emitters.</p><p>About Sceye</p><p>Sceye is a material science company founded in 2014 to unleash the possibilities in the stratosphere by uplifting and connecting all people, and protecting our planet. The company has developed a new generation of stratospheric platforms to provide universal and equitable connectivity, improve climate change monitoring, natural resource stewardship, forest fire monitoring and better detect and contain disasters before they spiral out of control.</p><p>Sceye continues the humanitarian work of founder &amp; CEO Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen. As owner and former CEO of the public health companies Vestergaard and LifeStraw, he led innovations in material science that have saved millions of lives. LifeStraw water filters have helped nearly eradicate Guinea worm disease, and PermaNet, bed nets made from innovative fibers that release microscopic doses of insecticide, have helped reduce global malaria deaths by more than half.</p><p>View source version on businesswire.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220312005055/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220312005055/en/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: Anastasia Grinberg<br/><url normalizedValue=\"mailto:press@sceye.com\">press@sceye.com</url></p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BWIRE-20220312005055</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6505-5651-DXY3-02P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7924</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Business Wire, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Business Wire</publicationName><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businesswire.com\">http://www.businesswire.com</url><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 12, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The activity also provides technical assistance to local actors in the areas of public forest governance, wildfire management and carbon monitoring. Through these efforts, the activity is advancing biodiversity conservation, improving natural resource governance, and reducing carbon emissions caused by deforestation and wetland degradation. This activity runs from June 2020-June 2023.</p><p>Colombia is the second most biodiverse country on earth, and over 50 percent of its territory is covered by natural forests. These forests provide key ecosystem services like carbon storage, soil formation, and water purification. However, land appropriation, agricultural expansion and illicit activities like illegal mining are driving land use changes in Colombia's forests and wetlands. In turn, the loss of these ecosystems is increasing carbon emissions and threatening the health and stability of Colombia's natural resources and communities.</p><p>COMPONENTS</p><p>STRENGTHENING FOREST AND NATURAL RESOURCES GOVERNANCE</p><p>The Colombia Forests and Wetlands Activity works with local communities and the Government of Colombia (GOC) to identify and address the main drivers of deforestation and biodiversity loss. It does this by providing these actors with technical assistance needed to perform environmental assessments and to understand institutional and legal frameworks. The activity also trains Colombian youth on environmental conservation, leadership and volunteerism.</p><p>IMPROVING FOREST FIRE MANAGEMENT</p><p>The Colombia Forests and Wetlands Activity trains GOC officials in the skills and knowledge needed to prevent, suppress and respond to forest fires. Within this training, the activity prioritizes supporting women's leadership and skill-building opportunities.</p><p>CONSTRUCTING FOREST AND WETLAND MAPS</p><p>The Colombia Forests and Wetlands Activity builds Colombian academic and government actors' capacities to perform forest and wetland mapping. This mapping is needed to develop a national forest inventory, map forest cover changes, and identify the best models and technologies for agriculture, forestry and greenhouse gas capture projects.</p><p>EXPECTED RESULTS</p><p>* Improve GOC officials' capacity to govern public forests and protected areas;</p><p>* Strengthen GOC agencies and Colombian universities' wildfire management capacities;</p><p>* Train Colombian youth living in targeted rural areas in natural resources conservation and sustainable livelihoods;</p><p>* Unify existing Colombian forest fire forecast systems with the goal of establishing an integrated, interagency system unique to forest fires;</p><p>* Advance the scientific methods used by Colombian institutions to understand wildfires' impact on land cover change; and</p><p>* Help GOC agencies and academic institutions develop national maps of the country's forests and wetlands, and their respective changes overtime.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7222952 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7222952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-3DD1-DYG2-R3XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Mike Huckabee's educational ventures, a series called The Kids Guide from Ever Bright Media, the children's publishing company he founded. The company launched its children's guide to climate change this spring, and has spent thousands of dollars on TV and social media advertising that prominently features Huckabee himself. The guide argues that the climate crisis is not as dire as mainstream media would have you believe, but it does not list its authors or what their credentials might be. And though its title claims to present the \"truth,\" science educators and climate researchers have found the guide to be full of factual inaccuracies.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's propaganda,\" said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting fact-based science education, including about evolution and climate change. \"It's highly slanted with a clear ideological message, and it's very unreliable as a guide to climate change for kids.\"</p><p>As climate debates remain polarized and politicized, Huckabee's guide is part of a small but determined contingency of climate disinformation materials marketed to children and families. It also fits into a new niche in the broader landscape of climate skepticism. In recent years, efforts to erode public confidence in mainstream climate science-which have long been orchestrated by the fossil fuel industry-have trended away from outright denial of the climate crisis to a more nuanced narrative that doesn't deny that the planet is warming but instead suggests it's been overblown by scientists, politicians and mainstream media, and advocates for continued use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Climate skeptics' arguments have been consistently <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23082022/experts-debunk-viral-post-claiming-1100-scientists-say-theres-no-climate-emergency/\">debunked</url> by scientists, but misinformation from the oil and gas industry and its proponents has continued to <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22122017/big-oil-heartland-climate-science-misinformation-campaign-koch-api-trump-infographic/?utm_source=InsideClimate+News&amp;utm_campaign=ed83d411fe-Weekly+Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_29c928ffb5-ed83d411fe-327504013\">proliferate</url> and seek out new audiences.\u00a0</p><p>Grimmett said her coworker bought the guides-including The Kids Guide to the Truth About Climate Change-for his eight- and 11-year-old children. She borrowed them to show her own 12-year-old son, and was alarmed by what she understood to be blatant misinformation.</p><p>\"There's not enough truth mixed in with the lies for me to even think that something like this should be published,\" Grimmett said.\u00a0</p><p>The Kids Guide series is being marketed to parents as an alternative to mainstream education, which Huckabee's ads claim will send their children into a false panic about climate change. Branch said the guide ignores key scientific advances and uses factual information in a misleading way-on one page, it notes that China's greenhouse gas emissions are 2.5 times higher than the U.S., ignoring the fact that per capita emissions in the U.S. are actually close to twice those in China, and that the U.S. remains the largest historic emitter of climate warming gasses.\u00a0</p><p>The visuals used in the guide are even more blatantly misleading than its text, Branch noted. One graph, titled \"Thousands of Years of Carbon Dioxide Levels,\" spans 400,000 years ago until \"present day,\" and is summarized with the conclusion, \"looking back in time, carbon dioxide levels have always gone up and down.\"</p><p>But the data the graph labels as \"present day\"-peaking at a little over 280 parts per million-actually represents levels from 2,300 years ago, around 391 BC, Branch pointed out. The vast majority of the carbon dioxide driving climate change has been emitted only since the Industrial Revolution, with atmospheric CO2 concentrations currently over 420 parts per million, higher than any data point included on the graph, which has a scale that only goes up to 300 parts per million.</p><p>The guide's rhetoric fits into recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-sustainability/article/discourses-of-climate-delay/7B11B722E3E3454BB6212378E32985A7\">trends</url> in select media that seek to minimize the severity of climate change and delay action, accepting that the climate is warming, but downplaying the magnitude of impacts and disputing human influence on the climate, said Syracuse University Biology and Earth Science Professor Jason R. Wiles.</p><p>\"What science is presented is cherry-picked and used to cast doubt on what is actually a very robust and well-evidenced scientific consensus,\" Wiles said. \"Apart from its being very misleading, my main concern is that it fosters complacency by promoting the notion that climate change is not as dire a problem as it truly is.\"</p><p>\"You may have heard from your kids that the earth is soon going to be an uninhabitable hellscape,\" says Huckabee in one of The Kids Guide's ads, standing in front of what looks like a greenscreen of a blazing forest fire. \"That's because some of their teachers and the media have an agenda.\"</p><p>The advertisement goes on to describe how the guide will answer kids questions about climate change \"truthfully,\" and sends viewers to keepkidscool.com, where they can sign up for a \"free\" gift bundle that includes the guide, with an advertised shipping cost of only $1. Ever Bright Media, however, has faced frequent customer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/boca-raton/profile/training-videos/everbright-media-0633-90090619/complaints\">complaints</url> and accusations of hiding fees and charges, obscuring terms and agreements and automatically enrolling people into a magazine subscription program that costs $19.95 plus sales tax every three to four weeks, plus a monthly magazine charge of $7.95.\u00a0</p><p>Since Huckabee's term as governor of Arkansas ended in 2007 he's had two failed bids for president but has mostly worked in media. His talk show, Huckabee, ran on Fox News from 2008 to 2015 before moving to Trinity Broadcast Network, a Christian outlet.\u00a0</p><p>Huckabee, who is an ordained Southern Baptist minister, founded Ever Bright Media in 2009, and launched The Kids Guide in 2020. The series has more than forty guides focused on history and current events, plus a series on the Bible. According to data <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/climate-deniers/fox-news-runs-ads-mike-huckabees-climate-denial-book-targeted-children\">gathered</url> by Media Matters-a nonprofit research center that monitors misinformation in U.S. media-the company spent $83,300 on Facebook ads from January 1 to June 6, 2023 and has appeared hundreds of times in ads on Fox News.</p><p>In 2015, Huckabee jokingly compared climate change to \"a sunburn.\" Last year, in a video on his TBN talk show's YouTube channel, he derisively belittled a doctor for citing climate change as a factor in a heat related illness, despite scientific consensus that increased frequency and severity of heat-related illnesses and death are in fact tied to global warming.\u00a0</p><p>Allison Fisher, who reviewed the guide for Media Matters, said one of the main dangers of materials that deny the severity of climate change like Huckabee's guide is that they deliberately undermine children's scientific education. Such materials also take away crucial context for a generation that is already experiencing the impacts of climate change, she added.</p><p>\"They're not just trying to create climate skeptics,\" Fisher said. \"They're actually eroding trust in science and the scientific community.\"</p><p>Branch said that the guide seems to be targeting a small but receptive audience, so its impact may not be widespread. But for some educators, Huckabee's stamp of approval is a green flag.</p><p>One Washington state educator, who asked to remain anonymous, uses various Kids Guides with her middle school students, and said she was initially interested in the guide because of Huckabee's involvement.</p><p>\"I consider myself middle class, and he comes across as a middle class kind of person,\" the educator said, adding that she felt Huckabee seemed reliable based on past speeches. \"If he would recommend something, I would look into it.\"</p><p>When asked about the reliability of the guides' sourcing, the educator said she uses them with her students as a jumping off point for research, not as a definitive source, and noted that her students found them fun and engaging.</p><p>\"It doesn't go into all the scary stuff,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>The main thesis of the climate change guide seems to be that scientists and media are trying to create unnecessary panic, and this rhetoric fits into a broader effort to introduce materials denying the severity of climate change into American education.</p><p>In 2017, the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and the health impacts of smoking, sent 350,000 copies of its publication, \"Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming,\" to teachers across the country. The campaign had mixed results, as some teachers <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22122017/science-teachers-heartland-institute-anti-climate-booklet-survey/\">used</url> the materials to teach about the dangers of propaganda. This year, Heartland <url normalizedValue=\"https://heartland.org/opinion/press-release-heartland-institute-ships-climate-at-a-glance-book-to-thousands-of-teachers-across-america/\">sent</url> out copies of a new publication called \"Climate at a Glance,\" which the institute claims \"provides the data to show the earth is not experiencing a climate crisis,\" to 8,000 teachers. Other groups, like the CO2 Coalition, a nonprofit foundation that focuses on CO2's benefits, and Prager University, a conservative advocacy and media organization, have also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.levernews.com/prageru-the-propaganda-machine-masquerading-as-an-online-education-hub/\">targeted</url> children with materials questioning the existence or severity of the climate crisis.\u00a0</p><p>Big Oil's climate misinformation machine has been operating for decades, despite the industry's early awareness of the crisis. In 1965, American Petroleum Institute (API) President Frank Ikard gave a speech directly acknowledging that burning fossil fuel would cause climate change, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.desmog.com/2018/11/20/american-petroleum-institute-1965-speech-climate-change-oil-gas/\">saying</url> \"there is still time to save the world's peoples from the catastrophic consequence of pollution, but time is running out.\" In 1978, Exxon Mobil's own scientists published an internal report confirming that rising carbon emissions would lead to global warming, and by 1980 industry giants were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/climate-denial-machine-how-fossil-fuel-industry-blocks-climate-action\">discussing</url> the \"globally catastrophic effects\" of temperature rise.</p><p>Instead of pulling back operations, the oil industry outwardly denied the science it had internally confirmed, continuing to chase growth and profits and funding a widespread campaign of disinformation that infiltrated government, research institutions, media and schools. In 1998, as climate action drew global attention with the Kyoto Protocol, the API wrote in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatefiles.com/trade-group/american-petroleum-institute/1998-global-climate-science-communications-team-action-plan/\">memo</url> that \"unless 'climate change' becomes a non-issue, meaning that the Kyoto Protocol is defeated and there are no further initiatives to thwart the threat of climate change, there may be no moment when we can declare victory for our efforts.\"</p><p>Today, Big Oil continues to pour <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05062017/exxon-climate-change-fraud-investigation-eric-schneiderman-rex-tillerson-exxonmobil/\">billions</url> of dollars into anti-climate legislation, funnel high dollar donations to candidates in both major parties and market pro-industry curriculum to teachers in need. Huckabee is no exception: like many candidates, his failed 2016 presidential campaign's top donors <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contributors?id=N00007539\">included</url> oil and gas companies and private equity firms that are heavily invested in fossil fuels. And the fossil fuel industry's misinformation machine has <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22122017/big-oil-heartland-climate-science-misinformation-campaign-koch-api-trump-infographic/\">spawned</url> a slew of independent organizations and individuals driving their own misinformation campaigns on the climate crisis.</p><p>For the most part, Huckabee's materials don't seem to be targeting schools, instead providing parents with alternatives to mainstream education and doing <url normalizedValue=\"https://myemail.constantcontact.com/A-Gift-For-Your-Homeschool-From-Mike-Huckabee-s-Learn-Our-History.html?soid=1102655467814&amp;aid=BT55ZhRQhH0\">outreach</url> to homeschoolers. Still, in 2020, the Arkansas Department of Education used emergency COVID funds to strike a $260,000 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-mike-huckabee-childrens-books-masquerading-as-education\">deal</url> with Ever Bright Media for \"The Kids Guide to Coronavirus,\" one version of which reportedly quoted incorrect information about the effectiveness of wearing masks to inhibit transmission of the disease. The Arkansas DOE also purchased a constitutional booklet from Ever Bright Media, according to their communications department.</p><p>Other aligned materials, however, are making it into public school classrooms. Melissa Lau, an Oklahoma science educator with over two decades of teaching experience, said she's seen a general lack of climate change-related materials in classrooms. The vast majority of teachers in her state avoid the topic, she said. Still, she added that under-resourced schools and teachers often jump at free curriculum or equipment opportunities for lack of better options, even when they come with unreliable or harmful information.</p><p>Lau, who is a teacher ambassador for NCSE, said many of her colleagues receive free lab equipment and curriculum material from the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board (OERB)-an oil and gas-funded advocacy organization that offers teachers free educational materials with pro-petroleum messaging and $50 stipends in exchange for attending events.\u00a0</p><p>Like many of her students, Lau has family working in the oil and gas industry, she said, so she understands that discussions around the energy transition are often personal or delicate. But the fear tactics around job losses that are central in some pro-industry materials can obscure scientific fact, she said.\u00a0</p><p>\"That's the hard part about disinformation,\" Lau said. \"Unless you're just attuned to it, it's difficult to identify cherry picking of data.\"</p><p>At a moment when children as <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/6289898/montana-climate-lawsuit-us/\">young</url> as five are suing their governments for inaction on climate change, it seems like materials denying the severity of global warming would face an uphill battle. But information provided in educational contexts can still have significant influence, according to researchers.</p><p>In California's Bay Area, a 2021 study by North Carolina State University Professor K.C. Busch found that students who read texts that framed the climate crisis with uncertainty reported lower levels of certainty themselves, regardless of how much prior knowledge they had around climate change.</p><p>Even the best science textbooks lag behind current research, though Busch said the textbooks she encountered about climate change-even in the liberal Bay Area-went beyond being out of date and were genuinely inaccurate.\u00a0</p><p>De-briefing with the students who participated in her study, Busch found that students hadn't considered the possibility that their textbooks might not be entirely accurate.</p><p>Busch said this makes it even more important not only to ensure accurate information in textbooks, but also to teach students critical thinking and how to evaluate the credibility of sources themselves.</p><p>\"It kind of blew their minds that the textbook from their [class] might not be accurate,\" Busch said.\u00a0</p><p>Lau is working to address the problem of scientific literacy within her own district, running a workshop with other high school science teachers on how to determine if instructional materials are high-quality enough to use in the classroom.</p><p>Barbara Denson, a civil engineer who writes under the name B.B. Denson, has written two children's books that advocate for the continued burning of fossil fuels and pushes a message she calls \"climate defiant.\" Denson doesn't deny that climate change is happening, but she said she does not believe that human influence is a primary driver of these changes.</p><p>Denson worked in the oil and gas industry before becoming an advocate for clean energy. Now, she advocates against renewable energy. One turning point was listening to a presentation by Patrick Moore, director of the CO2 Coalition-a nonprofit organization that argues for the importance of carbon dioxide, Denson said. Moore, who was an early leader with Greenpeace, left the environmental advocacy organization in 1986 due to political disagreements and has since consulted in the timber, mining and nuclear industries, among others.</p><p>Denson decided to write children's books because she felt her message needed to be simplified to a level that a child could understand, and she didn't see anyone doing that. She said she doesn't expect children reading her books to form opinions about climate change, but instead hopes to influence families.\u00a0</p><p>\"99.99% of what everybody hears is the other side of the story, so there's only a handful of us scientists that are kind of digging in our heels,\" the engineer said. She added that she believes mainstream climate science is only a theory rather than documented fact.</p><p>\"The fact that we are releasing carbon dioxide and making plants healthier is a really good thing,\" Denson said.</p><p>One of Denson's books, called \"Carbon Comes Out of the Closet,\" follows Gary the Go-Cart, an anthropomorphic car that drives around while learning about carbon dioxide. First, Gary is bombarded with messaging that calls for sequestration and taxation of CO2, and he tries to sequester his own emissions. Later in the story he comes across a tree of apples that tell him they need more carbon-meaning CO2-to grow bigger, so Gary decides to \"spray\" carbon into the air and onto the ground around the trees and other plants.\u00a0</p><p>\"The plants were all much healthier,\" the text reads. \"With carbon in the atmosphere, everybody wins.\"</p><p>This is an argument often used by the CO2 Coalition, one of Denson's main influences, whose founders previously worked in the research laboratories of <url normalizedValue=\"https://co2coalition.org/teammember/roger-cohen/\">Exxon</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://co2coalition.org/teammember/rodney-w-nichols/\">Shell</url>.</p><p>\"It's one of those grains of scientific truth opening up an avalanche of misinformation,\" Wiles said, explaining that carbon dioxide emissions from human activities have reached a rate that's far greater than our forests and plant communities can sequester, while deforestation and biodiversity loss only add to that discrepancy.</p><p>Huckabee's guide acknowledges the warming effects of CO2, but argues that its fluctuation is natural and that the U.S., \"thanks to capitalism, free thinkers and investors,\" has \"helped turn the climate tide.\"</p><p>The U.S., which houses a little over 4 percent of the world's population, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/\">contributed</url> 20 percent of global emissions since 1850.</p><p>As book banning and partisan calls to censor current and historic events from public school curriculums grow, climate misinformation is only one piece of a broader politicization of information in education. Grimmett, who returned The Kids Guides to her coworker after looking through them at home, said it makes her fearful for her son's generation.\u00a0</p><p>\"So much of my heart and hope is hanging on the kids,\" Grimmett said. \"These materials...will make that generation be just as split as we are now.\"</p><p>Mike Huckabee's office and Ever Bright Media did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCLNE-72579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCLNE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68V5-7RV1-JDVS-F3T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">462782</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3047\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 InsideClimate News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Climate News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 31, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>books</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>children</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Denial</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Business &amp;

The new resources are strategically allocated to improve and develop the indigenous communities of the forests, particularly:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Infrastructure works in the fields of Communication,SchoolsWater treatmentHospitals and health centersHousingTransportation</emphasis></p><p>As changes and developments take time, theBluegrace holdings Groupadditionally committed to distribute food and water through direct deliveries to help the most vulnerable communities of the area.</p><p>\"We want to empower the local communities so that they can make a living that does not involve damaging the forest \u2013 which more often than not, unfortunately, is not a matter of choice nowadays,\" says Richard Granier, CEO of Bluegrace Holdings and Bluegrace Energy.</p><p>This way, by adopting a forest Bluegrace Energy empowers the indigenous communities that can help keep the forests save, which will in turn help us all mitigate the global warming and protect the environment and its biodiversity. To better do this, Bluegrace Energy signed earlier this week an inter-institutional cooperation framework agreement withCIDOB(the Confederation of Nations and Indigenous Peoples of the Chaco, East and Amazon of Bolivia), which is constituted by the 34 indigenous peoples that inhabit the entire Lowlands region, that is, 7 of the 9 Departments that make up Bolivia (Santa Cruz, Pando, Tarija, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba Tropics and North of La Paz). CIDOB, whose accreditation is recorded in the election act of the Great National Assembly of Indigenous Nations and Peoples of Bolivia held in San Borja \u2013 Beni on March 14, 2021, is legally represented by Mr Justo Molina Barrancos, as President, and Mr Rosendo Alpiri Nomine, as Vice-President.</p><p>Food Deliveries<br/>Last week Bluegrace Energy delivered a provision of 50 tons of food to feed indigenous communities in Bolivia, in the regions of Concepci\u00f3n and Monte Verde. As in previous occasions, the food was delivered in trucks led by Mr Montenegro.</p><p>\"Of course we could have just sent the food, but it is not the same,\" said Mr Montenegro. \"Seeing the impact these food deliveries have on families is worth all the hours of work and travel.\" In fact, in addition to leading the food transfers and delivery, Mr Montenegro and the team also aided in the bagging and sealing of the products, to ensure that each bag would contain exactly what was intended \u2013 and no less.</p><p>The first delivery of 2022 was in early May, with two food trucks loaded with supplies intended to feed 1,000 indigenous families in the Bolivian region of Bajo Isoso, which was followed by deliveries in San Antonio de Lomer\u00edo and Charagua.Bolivia has one of the highest levels of extreme poverty in Latin America, and indigenous people, who are the poorest and most vulnerable population in Bolivia, represent approximately 65% of the country's estimated 11.2 million people.</p><p>\"At least these families won't have to worry about food for a while,\" notes Mr Montenegro.</p><p>Fire Control<br/>In addition to food, Bluegrace Energy is also making another kind of delivery \u2013 one of water. Delivered in person by our President in Latin America, Mr Julio Montenegro, our team stopped by the headquarters of the indigenous forest fire brigade of Chiquitania los Jaguares \u2013 the defenders of the Chiquitania.</p><p>\"Without them I am sure these forests will cease to exist,\" said Mr Montenegro. \"If we want to preserve the Amazon in Bolivia, it is of the utmost importance that we support these heroes.\" It is the second time this year we have made this sort of delivery, and it will not be the last. \"Bluegrace Energy has now signed a formal agreement with the fire brigade of Chiquitania,\" informs Mr Montenegro. \"We will be providing these fighters with as much equipment as we can afford.\"</p><p>\"Each minute, each drop of sweat counts when it comes to fight for those whose voices aren't heard,\" closes Mr Montenegro.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Julio Montenegro, Bluegrace Energy, 1 9726173,<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:g.angel@bluegraceholdings.com\">g.angel@bluegraceholdings.com</email></p><p>SOURCE Bluegrace Energy</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=UN62931&amp;Transmission_Id=202209050830PR_NEWS_USPR_____UN62931&amp;DateId=20220905\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-UN6293120220905</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:669V-KN51-DXP3-R4K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 5, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The first poster of the still unnamed bear showed it pouring a bucket of water on a campfire and saying, \"Care will prevent 9 out of 10 fires.\"</p><p>Smokey finally got his name in the spring of 1950 after a young bear cub found himself caught in a burning forest in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico. He took refuge in a tree, and while managing to stay alive, was left badly burned.</p><p>The firefighters who retrieved him were so moved by his bravery, they named him Smokey. This nationally recognized symbol has been depicted in many advertising media through the decades that Smokey has been the official image for the National Forest Service.</p><p>Today's image was printed on the 40th anniversary in 1987 and recently sold on eBay for $80.</p><p>If you have an item and you would like to know what it is worth, send digital pictures, with a brief description to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:paulhconnor@gmail.com\">paulhconnor@gmail.com</email>; or make an appointment to visit 201 N.

Open burning creates the risk of an escaped fire and puts pressure on emergency personnel. Given that Vermont is currently experiencing community-wide spread of COVID-19, there is a need to minimize any additional pressure on emergency personnel both in terms of response and unnecessary potential contact with people who may have COVID-19.</p><p>To date, very few wildland fires have been reported in Vermont this year. However, April and May are historically the most active months for wildland fires in the state, and most of these fires occur as a result of escaped debris burns. Looking ahead, temperatures are predicted to be above average and precipitation below normal through mid-April. Given these forecasted conditions, the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation's Wildland Fire Program anticipates that this spring has the potential to be an active wildland fire season.</p><p>Postponing open burning until conditions improve will eliminate the need for emergency personnel to respond to an unnecessary event. In cases where written permission for an open burn and a site visit are required through a \"Permit to Kindle Fire,\" both the permittee and Town Forest Fire Warden are put at an increased risk of exposure to the virus. Vermont's Town Forest Fire Wardens have the statutory authority to stop issuing burn permits and many fire wardens throughout the state have taken this precautionary step. Please check in with your local Fire Warden and be considerate and patient when assessing the need to conduct any open burning. The Vermont Wildland Fire Program appreciates the public's support in fire prevention and reducing the need for unnecessary emergency response during the COVID-19 pandemic.

From 1952 until late 1963, Greece was governed by conservative parties, the Greek Rally of Marshal Alexandros Papagos and its successor, the National Radical Union, or ERE, of Constantine Karamanlis. In 1963, the Center Union Party of George Papandreou was elected and governed until July 1965. It was followed by a succession of unstable coalition governments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On April 21, 1967, just before scheduled elections, a group of colonels led by Colonel George Papadopoulos seized power in a coup d'etat. Civil liberties were suppressed, special military courts were established, and political parties were dissolved. Several thousand political opponents were imprisoned or exiled to remote Greek islands. In November 1973, following an uprising of students at the Athens Polytechnic University, General Dimitrios Ioannides replaced Papadopoulos and tried to continue the dictatorship.</p><p>General Ioannides' attempt in July 1974 to overthrow Archbishop Makarios, the president of Cyprus, brought Greece to the brink of war with Turkey, which invaded Cyprus and occupied part of the island. Senior Greek military officers then withdrew their support from the junta, which toppled. Leading citizens persuaded Constantine Karamanlis to return from exile in France to establish a government of national unity until elections could be held. Karamanlis' newly organized party, New Democracy, or ND, won the elections held in November 1974, and he became prime minister.</p><p>Following the 1974 referendum that resulted in the rejection of the monarchy, parliament approved a new constitution on June 19, 1975. The parliament then elected Constantine Tsatsos president of the republic. In the 1977 parliamentary elections, New Democracy again won a majority of seats. In May 1980, Prime Minister Karamanlis was elected to succeed Tsatsos as president. George Rallis was then chosen party leader and succeeded Karamanlis as prime minister.</p><p>Political Chronology from 1980s to 2000:</p><p>In 1981, Greece became the 10th member of the European Community, which is now known as the European Union or EU. In parliamentary elections held on Oct. 18, 1981, Greece elected its first socialist government when the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, also known as PASOK, led by Andreas Papandreou, won 172 of 300 seats. On March 29, 1985, after Prime Minister Papandreou declined to support President Karamanlis for a second term, the Greek parliament elected Supreme Court Justice Christos Sartzetakis as president and head of state.</p><p>Greece had two rounds of parliamentary elections in 1989, both of which produced weak coalition governments with limited mandates. Party leaders withdrew their support in February 1990, and elections were held on April 8. In the April 1990 election, \"Nea Dimokratia\" (New Democracy or ND) won 150 seats and subsequently gained two others. The new prime minister, Mitsotakis, fired his first foreign minister, Andonis Samaras, in 1992; Samaras then formed his own political party, Political Spring. A split between Mitsotakis and Samaras led to the collapse of the New Democracy government and new elections in September 1993.</p><p>In October 1993, Papandreou was re-elected prime minister when PASOK won 170 seats. After his election, Prime Minister Papandreou focused on improving Greece's relations with its northern neighbors. The PASOK government also reversed two major privatization projects undertaken by Mitsotakis involving the national telephone system and the Athens bus system.</p><p>On Jan. 17, 1996, following a protracted illness, Prime Minister Papandreou resigned and was replaced by former Minister of Industry, Costas Simitis. In elections held in September 1996, Costas Simitis was elected prime minister after PASOK won 162 parliamentary seats over New Democracy's 108 seats.</p><p>The Simitis government faced severe opposition to its fiscally strict budget, which was devised to obtain Greek entry into the Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU. Throughout 1997, millions of public workers went on strike protesting the PASOK government's economic program.</p><p>Prime Minister Costas Simitis called for elections in April 2000 - six months before the end of the maximum term of four years. The Simitis government had been in office during several major foreign policy events and had also overseen significant domestic political and economic developments.</p><p>Two major foreign policy events in particular affected the Simitis government's popularity and the electoral fortune of PASOK. First, Greece had participated in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization action against its neighbor Serbia from March until June 1999, despite widespread domestic opposition to the war. Second, following the Abdullah Ocalan affair, there was an initial deterioration of relations with Turkey. In brief, Greece attempted to harbor Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish rebels, whom the Turks wanted to stand trial. Greek-Turkish relations subsequently improved after Greece and Turkey provided mutual aid after each experienced devastating earthquakes (in August and September 1999). The substantial diplomatic rapprochement led Greece to be somewhat more accepting of Turkey's possible future accession to the European Union, historically a point of much contention. Relations between Greece and Turkey have also been affected by developments in Cyprus -- a matter which will be discussed below.</p><p>On the domestic front, the Simitis government had overseen the steady improvement of the Greek economy, after implementing unpopular economic reforms, and had applied for membership in the Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU, which would allow Greece to adopt the European single currency, the euro. Greece wanted to join the EMU in 1999, but failed to meet the economic criteria (limits on the budget deficit, public debt and inflation) necessary for membership.</p><p>Political Developments from 2000 to 2004</p><p>In 2000, while the Simitis government enjoyed popular support, PASOK faced substantial competition from the conservative New Democracy.</p><p>PASOK maintained its parliamentary majority in the April 2000 elections, winning 43.8 percent of the vote and, due to the reinforced proportional representation electoral system, 162 of the 300 seats in parliament. New Democracy, however, substantially increased its electoral fortunes from the 1996 elections, winning 42.7 percent of the vote for 125 seats, having previously won 38.1 percent and 108 seats. The \"Kommounistiko Komma Ellados,\" the (Communist Party of Greece or KKE), won 5.5 percent of the vote and kept its 11 parliamentary seats. The socialist \"Sinaspismos tis Aristeras ke ti Proodu,\" the Coalition of the Left and Progress or SIN, experienced something of a decrease in electoral support, winning 3.2 percent of the vote and six seats, having won 5.1 percent and six seats in 1996. The socialist \"Dimokratiki Kinoniku Kinima\" (the Democratic Socialist Movement or DIKKI) also failed to improve its electoral standing, winning only 2.7 percent of the vote and no seats, after winning 4.4 percent and nine seats in 1996.</p><p>A major goal of the Simitis government was met when Greece was formally accepted into the EMU on Jan. 1, 2001. The decision to allow Greece entry was reached at a meeting of EU finance ministers in June 2000. As noted above, the Simitis government had implemented a number of austerity measures to bring the Greek economy more into line with the other members of the EMU. While attaining EMU membership was a great success for the Simitis government, its fellow EMU members warned Greece that further reforms to the Greek economywould benecessary. Thus, maintaining fiscal discipline and further privatizing state-owned industries, especially in utilities, transportation, and communications, would continue to be the main domestic public policy issues on the second Simitis government's agenda.</p><p>One area slated for reform involved the system of taxation. Greece had the same taxation system for 50 year untilApril 2002 whenthe Greek government announced plans to reform the tax structure in an effort to stimulate the economy. The government's goal with the new systemwas to simplify Greece's complex taxation regime.</p><p>The government was also faced with balancing the need to maintain its \"stability pact\" with the rest of the EMU with the increasingly pressing need to address ailing social services, especially the health, education, and pension systems. Because PASOK had typically drawn significant electoral support from those groups most likely to bear the costs of rationalizing these systems (for example, labor unions), Prime Minister Simitis' job was not to be easy and his objectives would not be painlessly realized.</p><p>A more symbolic success for the government occurred when Greece won its bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Since winning the bid, however, Greecewas criticized internationally for its lack of progress in improving its infrastructure. Olympic officials had even threatened to award the games to a different country if Greece failed to improve its ability to house, transport, service, and protect the thousands of athletes and visitors that accompany the games. The slow pace of preparations had been partiallyblamed on political infighting among the government's supporters. Indeed, Prime Minister Simitis was compelled to replace the culture minister in charge of preparing for the games due to criticism of the government's policies.</p><p>By 2002, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that Greece had made some progress. However, the IOC still strongly encouraged the Greek government to meet its agreed-upon deadlines for Olympic construction projects. The Greek government continues to promise to have all the venues ready in time for the Games.</p><p>The potential for acts of terrorism also had many concerned about the games being held in Athens. Previously, in June 2000, a group known as \"November 17\" assassinated the British military attach\u00e9 in Greece. The \"November 17\" group first became public in 1975 andwas blamed for an estimated two-dozen deaths. By 2003, 18 men and one women were arrested and faced trial in regard to the killings. The group's strong anti-Western sentiments (including anti-European Union and anti-NATO sentiments) were of significant concern to Greek and international officials responsible for the Olympic Game preparations. The September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon also heightened the security concerns of the Greek government and the International Olympic Committee.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2002, relations between Greece and Turkey improved when the Greek and Turkish governments signed an agreement to build a gas pipeline along which Turkey would supply Greece with gas. Then, in 2003, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey offered remarks at a joint news conference held at Kas, in Turkey's southwestern Antalya province, where the Turkish foreign minister had been hosting all the foreign ministers of the European Union. The two ministers announced their respective countries could work together with regard to the Ottawa Treaty, which prohibits anti-personnel landmines. Although Athens and Ankara had yet to ratify the treaty, they were tosubmit documents on their joint agreement to the United Nations, which would make both Greece and Turkey party to the Ottawa Treaty. The concurrence and willingness to work together in regard to the landmine treaty was intended to symbolize strengthened bilateral relations.</p><p>In 2003, relations between the two countries were challenged by the matter of Cyprus. The island of Cyprus has been divided into the GreekCypriot and TurkishCypriot sides since 1974 when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island, following a short-lived coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. Cyprus' northern third has been occupied by Turkish Cypriots ever since and is backed by the government of Turkey. For its part, Greek supports the GreekCypriot government, which is also recognized by the international community. The United Nations tried to broker the reunification of Cyprus butnegotiations failed. Recent decisions to lift restrictions on passage from and to the two sides of Cyprus were well-received by the Greek government in the wake of failed unification talks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Greece held the European Union presidency. Turkey has applied for membership in the regional body and George Papandreou -- in his role as the European Union president -- said that he hoped for a positive outcome for Turkey in 2004.</p><p>On the issue of the war in Iraq, in April 2003, the European Union -- headed by a Greek presidency as noted above -- stated that the United Nations should have a \"central role\" in rebuilding Iraq, while noting that the United States-led forces in the country should have the responsibility of restoring stability. The function of the European Union, however, was left unspecified until further details could be determined in regard to the roles of the coalition forces and the United Nations, respectively.</p><p>In May 2003, two informal texts -- one dealing with European Union participation in Iraq's reconstruction, and the other with the prospective common European security and defense policy -- were prepared by the Greek Presidency of the European Union. They were then presented to the informal European Union General Affairs and External Relations Council. In regard to participation in Iraq's reconstruction, the text restated the European Union's intent to assist in the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq. Included was a provision for humanitarian aid on the day after which sanctions against Iraq were lifted. The second text presented by the European Union Presidency was a prioritization of a European security and external relations policy.</p><p>On the domestic agenda, despite speculative reports that Costas Simitis would step down from the leadership of PASOK, the prime minister's office stated he would remain as the head of the party, at least until the next national elections,which were scheduled for2004. In fact, inearly 2004, when Simitis called for elections in March, he also stated he would not stand as PASOK leader and that Minister of Foreign AffairsGeorge Papandreou would insteadhold the reins as the head of that political party. Papandreou came from a Greek political dynasty as the son and grandson of former Greek leaders.</p><p>One the rationales behind the call for elections was the impetus for reaching a settlement on the matter of Cyprus ahead of the May 1, 2004, date for that country to join theEuropeanUnion.Domestic concerns, however, were of paramount importance to the Greek citizenry as people complained aboutinflation,unemployment, the sense of a decreasing standard of living, as well as apparent corruption.Indeed, with these issues burning in the consciousness of voters,and with the opposition New Democracy party offering an economic program that included tax cuts, that partyseemed to have an eight point advantage ahead of the incumbents in polls leading up to the election.</p><p>On election day in March 2004, PASOK's dominance in Greekgovernment for over a decade ended whenthe conservative New Democracy party, led by Konstantinos Karamanlis, won the vote.The victory for Karamanlis and New Democracy heralded a significant shift in Greek politics. Expressing jubilation about his success, Karamanlis said, \"This is a victory for democracy. We've been handed a mandate to move the country forward.\"He went on to become prime minister and formeda government.</p><p>The actual results of the election were as follows: \"Nea Dimokratia\" or New Democracy (ND), conservatives -- 45.4 percent and 165 seats;Panellino Socialistiko Kinima or Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK, socialists/social-democratics -- 40.5 percent and 117 seats;Kommounistiko Komma Ellado or Communist Party of Greece (KKE), communists -- 5.9 percent and 12 seats; Sinaspismos tis Aristeras ke ti Proodu or Coalition of the Left and Progress (SIN),left-wing socialists -- 3.3 percent and6 seats; Laikos Orthodoxos Synagermos or Populist Orthodox Rally (LAOS), right-wing populists -- 2.2 percent and0 seats; Dimokratiki Kinoniku Kinima or Democratic Social Movement (DIKKI), left-wing socialists --1.8 percent and 0 seats.</p><p>In May 2004, apolice station in Athenswas the target ofthree bomb attacks as fears of terrorism again emerged ahead of the Olympics.Leading up to August of that year,attention in Greece was on the preparations for the Olympics. (See \"Special Entry\" below for details about the Olympics.)</p><p>Meanwhile, inJune 2004, indications from the European Union (EU) parliamentary elections suggested there had been a record low turnout of only 44.2 percent for the EU. Reports also suggested that turnout among the 10 new member states was even lower than the overall average at only 26 percent.In some countries such as Greece, sunny weather was deemed to have been the culprit as people left their homes and headed for the coast rather than toward the polls. Still, officials from the Interior Ministry of Greece claimed that turnout had exceeded 60 percent.</p><p>In December 2004, the European Commission issued a warning toGreece after it was discovered that the country had falsifieddata regarding its budget deficit in the period prior to joining the Eurozone.</p><p>Special Entry on the Olympic Games:</p><p>From Aug. 13, 2004 to Aug. 29, 2004,the XXVIII Summer Olympic Games were held in the Greek capital city of Athens. Greece is the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games, dating back to 776 BC, according to the historic record. These Olympic Games marked the second time Greece has hosted the Olympics in modern times. Athens played host to the first modern Olympics in 1896.</p><p>\"Phevos\" and \"Athena\" were the Olympic mascots whose symbolism were rooted in the legacy of an Olympian god and an Olympian goddess. \"Phevos\"was known asthe god of light and music, also known as Apollo in Greek mythology. His sister, Athena,was regarded asthe goddess of wisdom. Fittingly, shehas also beenknownas the patron of the city of Athens. The choice of \"Phevos\" and \"Athena\" were illustrative of the rich and compelling history and culture of Greece and Greek civilization. The concept of Olympic mascots first came into being during the Winter Olympic Games in Grenoble in 1968. Greek history and culture were also emblazoned on the Athens Olympic torch which was designed to resemble an olive leaf. As well, the emblem of the Olympic Games depicted the \"kotinos\" or an olive wreath. The olive tree was considered to be of great cultural importance and going back to the ancient Olympic Games, the \"kotinos\" was awarded to the champion.</p><p>In these modern games in Athens, 28 sporting eventstook place at 38 venues. Three hundred and one medal ceremonies also took place. More than 10,500 athletes competed in the Olympic Games, representing more than 190 countries. Notably, the country of Afghanistan participated in the Olympics following a suspension, in some measure due to the now-ousted Taliban regime's refusal to allow female athletes to compete.</p><p>On the ground in Athens, security was a major concern. Approximately 45,000 security personnel wereon duty during the course of the games along with 60,000 trained international volunteers.</p><p>Developments from 2005 to 2007</p><p>InMarch 2005, the domestic scene in Greece was dominated by the launch of a spate of strikes bytrade unions across the country. The strikes were carried out to protest against the country's increasing unemployment rate, in conjunction with the rising rate of inflation.ByDecember 2005, strikes were ongoing with a specific focus on protesting the parliament's approval ofchanges to labor laws, which wouldessentially end lifetime employment tenure within the public sector. (See \"Recent Developments\" below for information about further strike activity.)</p><p>The year 2005 was also marked by ratification of the European constitution among Greeks. In April 2005, Greece's parliament voted during a special session in favor of the proposed constitution of the European Union (EU). The proposed constitution was backed by 268 votes in the 300-member parliament, with 17parliamentarians voting against it and another 15 abstaining. According to European Union mandates, all member states must vote in support of the documenteither by public referendum or parliamentary vote.</p><p>Also in 2005, Karolos Papoulias became the country's new president after being elected by the \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" or parliament for a five-year term.</p><p>The first part of 2006 was marked by strike action undertaken by a constellation of public and private sector unions in Greece. In March, the 24-hour general strike led to disruption in services across the country, including public transportation in the capital city of Athens, but also affecting banks, hospitals, schools and government offices. Cities such as Athens were particularly hard-hit with log-jammed streets filled with workers marching to government facilities to attend rallies.</p><p>The strike was called by the unions in order to protest the conservative government's economic reform program. Among the Greek people, there is an increasing sense of frustration regarding high prices of goods and services, along with low wages. Indeed, the union leaders have argued that the minimum wage in Greece is half that of the European Union average. At the broader level, there was intensifying uneasiness about the government's intent to privatize state enterprises amidst a climate of high unemployment.</p><p>For its part, the government had to go forward with these plans in order to bring the Greek economy in line with European Union mandates to cut the budget. It is a mandate that is more stringent for countries that do not use the Euro as the currency. As well, the government has argued that its economic reforms have been intended to increase Greece's competitiveness within the global economy</p><p>The first part of 2006 was also marked by a brewing phone tapping scandal. In March 2006, George Koronias, the head of mobile phone company Vodafone Greece, began giving testimony before a parliamentary committee's inquiry into the apparent surveillance of various officials. A month prior, the government of Greece acknowledged that the mobile phones belonging to the prime minister and over 100 other officials, including politicians, security personnel, and journalists, had been bugged. The surveillance was said to have begun before the Olympics held in Athens in 2004 but continued after until it was detected in 2005. Once the matter came to light, there was increased suspicion that the matter involved United States intelligence agents in some manner.</p><p>The alleged suicide of a Vodafone network manager just days after the surveillance was revealed only added to the sense of scandal surrounding the matter. The company's denial that the man's death was connected to the scandal seemed to have had little effect in minimizing public concern.</p><p>Parliamentarians participating in the committee's inquirytried to determine why it took a year for the surveillance to be uncovered. Clearly, issues surrounding the death of the Vodafone manager were also expected to be addressed. As well, parliamentarians on the investigating committee were hoping to determine how the sophisticated software, which was used for intercepting calls, was able to be installed and activated in a clandestine manner within the Vodafone system shortly before the Olympics.</p><p>Indeed, it has been this very question that led to allegations that the United States may have been involved, as expressed by Liana Kanelli, a Member of Parliament. Kanelli's charges were not out of the mainstream. In fact, there has been a widespread belief among the Greek public that the Vodaphone tapping scheme was orchestrated by agents of the United States in the first place. The claim by a former American diplomat that the United States was involved has only bolstered that perception. The diplomat, who was based at the United States embassy in Athens until his resignation, said that the United States did not believe the Greek authorities could be trusted to protect the Olympics from a possible terrorist attack, hence their involvement, which including the phone surveillance.</p><p>In response to the phone tapping scandal, Prime Minister Karamanlis announced that there would be strict rules regulating mobile phone operations. The new regulations would be oriented toward ensuring a higher level of privacy in communications, along with harsh punishments for violators.</p><p>In May 2006, apowerful bomb exploded in the Greek capital city of Athens. Although there were no casualties, the bomb was apparently aimed at Greek Culture Minister George Voulgarakis. There was, however,no claim of responsibility. The former Public Order Minister took on the Culture portfolio following a cabinet shuffle that some have said was a demotion of sorts. The shuffle appeared to be associated with the telephone tapping scandal (discussed above) that had been the center of the political purview in Greece for some time. That issue aside, Voulgarakis was also associated with claims made by 28 Pakistani immigrants that they were abducted and tortured by Greek authorities at unknown locations following the 2005 terrorist attacks in London. For his part, Voulgarakis denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Also in May 2006, Greek and Turkish fighter planes collided in the air andcrashed into the Aegean Sea. The Greek pilot died in the incident although the Turkish pilot ejected safely and was rescued. It was believed that the collision, which ensued near the island of Karpathos, may have occurred as a result ofefforts by theGreek authorities toscramble a jet in order to intercept a Turkish aircraft.</p><p>The area in the Aegean has been the site of a prevailing territorial dispute betweenGreece and Turkey becauseboth countries do not agree about the jurisdiction of air space. There were some fears that the incident might hinder thetrend toward improved bilateral relations that had been ongoing in recent years. Putting some rest to these anxieties,Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gulimmediately extended his country'ssympathies to his Greek counterpart, Dora Bakoyanni.For its part, the Greek Foreign Ministry released a statement that read, \"The two foreign ministers expressed their regret at today's incident and agreed that this should not affect the two countries' efforts to improve their relations.\"</p><p>February 2007 saw the conservative government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis survive a non-confidence motion in parliament and stave off the possibility of fresh elections. The motion, which was brought by the Socialist opposition, was defeated by a 164-122 vote in parliament after three days of debate. The Socialists accused the government of incompetence over the three years it held office.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Karamanlis said that his New Democratic government would complete its term. He also promised to move forward with his reform agenda, saying, \"We will continue our reforms in health, education and the economy, and nothing will stand in our way.\"But, in fact, for his reform agenda to move ahead, it would require a constitutional amendment. It would also have to withstand popular opposition, as evidenced by mass protests in the capital of Athens in January 2007, which were intended to register opposition to such changes.</p><p>Special Note</p><p>In August 2007, forest fires ravaged significant portions of Greece. The affected areas included Athens, Evia Island and the Peloponnese. More than 50 people had died at the times of writing. The fires have left several revered cultural sites, artifacts and other historic interests at grave risk of destruction. Among the vulnerable sites was the ancient Olympia, renowned for being the birthplace of the Olympics. Firefighters were attempting to keep the site from being affected, however, flames were edging close to the original Olympic stadium as well as the yard of the museum housing some of Greece's greatest archaeological artifacts. As a result, fire engines were deployed to the area to stand ready to defend the country's cultural legacy. As well, a new fire protection and sprinkler system, which had been installed prior to the 2004 Olympics, was turned on.</p><p>Elections of 2007</p><p>The Greek people went to the polls to vote in parliamentary elections on September 16, 2007. Voter turnout was in line with normal levels, however, there was a reduced rate of participation in the Peloponnese peninsula south of Athens, which suffered terribly as a result of forest fires a month earlier. That region saw dozens of people killed as a result and the government came under fire for its slow reaction and poor handling of the crisis.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the shadow of the forest fire crisis, exit polls indicated that the governing New Democracy party of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was expected to win over George Papandreou's socialist party, Pasok. With most of the votes counted, it appeared that the outcome would be in line with the exit poll data. Indeed, New Democracy had about 43 percent of the vote share over Pasok, which took 38.5 percent of the vote share. The result meant that New Democracy would have the most seats in the 300-seat parliament -- albeit with a reduced majority. Indeed, control over 154 seats meant that it had an advantage of four seats in parliament -- far fewer than the situation following the previous elections but enough to claim an absolute majority.</p><p>As such, Prime Minister Karamanlis claimed victory saying that his government had a \"clear mandate\" from the people to continue its reform agenda. His policy program was thus expected to concentrate on economic development, poverty alleviation, pensions increases, and the creation of a social state for the future. In a gesture intended to rectify the government's handling of the forest fire crisis, Prime Minister Karamanlis promised that the government was committed to helping victims. He also expressed his sense of responsibility saying, \"I feel doubly responsible to be more effective and avoid mistakes.\"</p><p>On the other side of the equation, Papandreou thanked his supporters for their \"love and trust\" in him and his party, but conceded defeat saying, \"Pasok fought a battle and lost it.\" Attention then turned to the question of whether Papandreou would resign as Pasok leader. Former Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos was mentioned in the public purview as a possible successor.</p><p>The Macedonia Controversy</p><p>Although there were hopes that the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia (FYROM)and Greece would find their way toward an improved and allied relationship, difficulties have continued over questions of names and insignias used by FYROM. This country, FYROM, has looked to Greece's historic enemy, Turkey, for diplomatic support. Greek refusal to recognize FYROM under the name \"Republic of Macedonia\" has been an important issue in Greek politics since 1992.</p><p>Greece was adamantly opposed to the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the government in Skopje, claiming that the name is intrinsically Greek and should not be used by a foreign country. Furthermore, Greece believes that an independent \"Republic of Macedonia\" bordering the Greek region of Macedonia would fuel irredentist tensions in FYROM. The dispute led to a Greek trade embargo against FYROM in February 1994.</p><p>Mediation efforts by the United Nations, United States and European Union brokered an interim solution to some of these differences in September 1995, leading to the lifting of the Greek embargo. Since the signing of these interim accords, the two governments have concluded agreements designed to facilitate the movement of people and goods across their common border and improve bilateral relations. Talks on remaining issueswere still being held under United Nations auspices several years later.</p><p>That said, the issue emerged strongly in the spring of 2008 when FYROM was moving toward accession to the European Union and NATO. Greece, which is a member state of both organizations and holds the power of veto, has strenuously objected to FYROM's accession, again on the basis of the \"name\" controversy, objecting to new forms of the country's name. On the other hand, FYROM has said that it has gone the extra mile in trying to assuage Greece's anxieties over the issue by changing its flag and amending its constitution tomake clear that it heldno territorial aspiration against any neighbors, including Greece.Nevertheless, in March 2008, Greece blocked FYROM's bid to join NATO over the ongoing controversy.</p><p>Special Entry:</p><p>Global credit crisis; effects felt in Europe</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A financial farrago, rooted in the credit crisis, became a global phenomenon by the start of October 2008. In the United States, after failure of the passage of a controversial bailout plan in the lower chamber of Congress, an amended piece of legislation finally passed through both houses of Congress. There were hopes that its passage would calm jitters on Wall Street and restore confidence in the country's financial regime. However, a volatile week on Wall Street followed, most sharply characterized by a precipitous 18 percent drop of the Dow Jones. With the situation requiring rapid and radical action, a new proposal for the government to bank stakes was gaining steam. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Europe, with banks also in jeopardy of failing, and with no coordinated efforts to stem the tide by varying countries of the European Union, there were rising anxieties not only about the resolving the financial crisis, but also about the viability of the European bloc. Nevertheless, European leaders were able to forge an agreement aimed at easing the credit crunch in that region of the world. Following is an exploration, first, of the situation in the United States, and, second, of the situation unfolding in Europe.</p><p>Report:</p><p>On Sept. 28, 2008, as the United States was reeling from the unfolding credit crisis, Europe's banking sector was also hit by its own woes when the Dutch operations of the European banking and insurance entity, Fortis, was partly nationalized in an effort to prevent its ultimate demise. Radical action was spurred by anxieties that Fortis was too much of a banking and financial giant to be allowed to fail. The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg forged an agreement to contribute more than 11 billion euros (approximately US$16 billion) to shore up Fortis, whose share price fell precipitously due to worries about its bad debts.</p><p>A day later, the mortgage lender -- Bradford and Bingley -- in the United Kingdom was nationalized when the British government took control of the bank's mortgages and loans. Left out of the nationalization scheme were the savings and branch operations, which were sold off to Santander of Spain. Earlier, the struggling mortgage lender, Northern Rock, had itself been nationalized. The head of the British Treasury, Alistair Darling, indicated that \"big steps\" that would not normally be taken were in the offing, given the unprecedented nature of the credit crisis.</p><p>On the same day, financial woes came to a head in Iceland when the government was compelled to seize control of the country's third-largest bank , Glitnir, due to financial problems and fears that it would go insolvent. Iceland was said to be in serious financial trouble, given the fact that its liabilities were in gross excess of the country's GDP. Further action was anticipated in Iceland, as a result.</p><p>On Sept 30, 2008, another European bank -- Dexia -- was the victim of the intensifying global banking and financial crisis. In order to keep Dexia afloat, the governments of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg convened talks and agreed to contribute close to 6.5 billion euros (approximately US$9 billion) to keep Dexia from suffering a demise.</p><p>Only days later, the aforementioned Fortis bank returned to the forefront of the discussion in Europe. Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme said he was hoping to locate a new owner with the aim of restoring confidence in Fortis, and thusly, preventing a further downturn in the markets. Leterme said that the authorities were considering takeover bids for the Belgian operations of the company (the Dutch operations were nationalized as noted above.)</p><p>By Sept. 5, 2008, one of Germany's biggest banks, Hypo Real Estate, was at risk of failing. In response, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would exhaust all efforts to save the bank. A rescue plan by the government and banking institutions was eventually agreed upon at a cost of 50 billion euros (approximately US$70 billion). This agreement involved a higher cost than was previously discussed.</p><p>Meanwhile, as intimated above, Iceland was enduring further financial shocks to its entire banking system. As such, the government of Iceland was involved in intense discussions aimed at saving the country's financial regime, which were now at severe risk of collapse due to insolvency of the country's commercial banks.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Sept. 4, 2008, the leaders of key European states -- United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy -- met in the French capital city of Paris to discuss the financial farrago and to consider possible action. The talks, which were hosted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, ended without consensus on what should be done to deal with the credit crisis, which was rapidly becoming a global phenomenon. The only thing that the four European countries agreed upon was that there would not be a grand rescue plan, akin to the type that was initiated in the United States. As well, they jointly called for more greater regulation and a coordinated response. To that latter end, President Nicolas Sarkozy said, \"Each government will operate with its own methods and means, but in a coordinated manner.\"</p><p>This call came after Ireland took independent action to deal with the burgeoning financial crisis. Notably, the Irish government decided days earlier to fully guarantee all deposits in the country's major banks for a period of two years. The Greek government soon followed suit with a similar action. These actions by Ireland and Greece raised the ire of other European countries, and evoked questions of whether Ireland and Greece had violated any European Union charters. An investigation by the European Union was pending into whether or not Ireland's guarantee of all savings deposits was anti-competitive in nature.</p><p>Nevertheless, as anxieties about the safety of bank deposits rose across Europe, Ireland and Greece saw an influx of new banking customers from across the continent, presumably seeking the security of knowing their money would be safe amidst a financial meltdown. And even with questions rising about the decisions of the Irish and Greek government, the government of Germany decided to go down a similar path by guaranteeing all private bank accounts. For his part, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that his government would increase the limit on guaranteed bank deposits from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000.</p><p>In these various ways, it was clear that there was no concurrence among some of Europe's most important economies. In fact, despite the meeting in France, which called for coordination among the countries of the European bloc, there was no unified response to the global financial crisis. Instead, that meeting laid bare the divisions within the countries of the European Union, and called into question the very viability of the European bloc. Perhaps that question of viability would be answered at a forthcoming G8 summit, as recommended by those participating in the Paris talks.</p><p>A week later, another meeting of European leaders in Paris ended with concurrence that no large institution would be allowed to fail. The meeting, which was attended by leaders of euro zone countries, resulted in an agreement to guarantee loans between banks until the end of 2009, with an eye on easing the credit crunch. The proposal, which would apply in 15 countries, also included a plan for capital infusions by means of purchasing preference shares from banks. The United Kingdom, which is outside the euro zone, had already announced a similar strategy.</p><p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy argued that these unprecedented measures were of vital importance. The French leader said, \"The crisis has over the past few days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach.\" He also tried to ease growing frustration that such measures would benefit the wealthy by explaining that the strategy would not constitute \"a gift to banks.\"</p><p>While these developments were aimed at restoring confidence in the financial regime in Europe, Iceland continued to struggle. Indeed, the country's economy stood precipitously close to collapse. Three banks, including the country's largest one -- Kaupthing -- had to be rescued by the government and nationalized. Landsbanki and Glitnir had been taken over in the days prior. With the country in a state of economic panic, trading on the OMX Nordic Exchange was suspended temporarily, although it was expected to reopen on October 13, 2008. Iceland's Prime Minister Geir Haarde said that his country was considering whether to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund to weather the crisis.</p><p>In early 2009, according to the European Commission, European banks werein need of as much as several trillion in bailout funding. Impaired or toxic assets factored highly on the European Union bank balance sheets, with credit default swaps on Irish debt running at 355 basis points higher at the time of writing -- the highest rate in Europe and well on its way down the path of Iceland. Anxieties were so high in Dublin that tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest the growing financial crisis.</p><p>Meanwhile, the fallout from the housing bubble was deleteriously affecting the United Kingdom, with anxieties being stoked about whether British banks could at all be saved.</p><p>In Spain, unemployment was in double digit territory and industrial production plunged 20 percent from where it was a year earlier. It was anticipated that credit default swaps for Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece would double over the course of the next year. In other parts of Europe, according to economist Nouriel Roubini, the economies of Ukraine, Belarus, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania appeared to be on the brink of disaster.</p><p>Regarding Ukraine, there were fears that it would might not abide with terms of a loan from the International Monetary Fund and thusly default on its debt. Meanwhile in Poland, the currency was falling and in Russia, even as the rouble fell, the Kremli warned of economic contraction.</p><p>Overall, Eastern European countries borrowed heavily from Western European banks. Thus, even if the currencies on the eastern part of the continent collapse, effects will be felt in the western part of Europe as well. For example, Swiss banks that gave billions of credit to Eastern Europe cannot look forward to repayment anytime soon. As well, Austrian banks have had extensive exposure to Eastern Europe, and can anticipate a highly increased cost of insuring its debt.</p><p>German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has warned that as many as 16 European Union countries will require assistance. Indeed, his statements suggest the need for a regional rescue effort. Of consideration is the fact that, according to the Maastricht Treaty, state-funded bailouts are prohibited.</p><p>By the close of February 2009, it was announced that the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe would receive a rescue package of $31 billion, via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank. The rescue package was aimed at assisting the survival of small financial institutions and included equity and debt financing, as well as access to credit and risk insurance aimed at encouraging lending.</p><p>Also in February 2009, with the global financial crisis intensifying, leaders of European Union countries backed sweeping financial regulations. Included in the package of market reforms were sanctions on tax havens, caps on bonus payments to management, greater hedge fund regulation, and increased influence by the International Monetary Fund. European leaders also backed a charter of sustainable economic activity, that would subject all global financial activities to both regulation and accountability by credit rating agencies.</p><p>These moves were made ahead of the Group of 20 summit scheduled for April 2, 2009, in London. It was not known whether other countries outside Europe, such as the United States, Japan, India and China, would support the new and aggressive regime of market regulation. That said, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin that Europe had a responsibility to chart this track. She said, \"Europe will own up to its responsibility in the world.\"</p><p>Recent Developments</p><p>In the spring of 2008, Greece was gripped by public sector strikes and other forms of mass action, aimed at protesting the government's pensionreform plan.Despite the public's outcry over the proposed reform proposal, the Greek parliament narrowly passed thelegislation oriented toward putting the plan into action.</p><p>In October 2008, further strikes and mass action ensued by both public sector employyes and professionals in reaction to proposalsfor privatization andcaps on compensation.</p><p>The start of December 2008 in Greece was marked by violence as masses took to the streets in Athens to protest the shooting death of a youth -- Alexandros Grigoropoulos -- by police. Students took to the streets, even throwing gas bombs, rocks and stones at a police station during more than a week of ongoing violence. Police retaliated with tear gas but the crowds were only deterred temporarily, rallying again to set three banking institutions ablaze and damaging cars. About 400 people were detained as a consequence of the chaotic situation on the ground, which also resulted in injuries to at least 70 people. As the protests entered mid-December, an uneasy calm returned to Athens. That said, student protestors said they intended to launch a demonstration outside police headquarters.</p><p>By mid-month, the situation was ongoing and Athens continued to be the site of further violent clashed between protestors and police. The protestors, most of whom were youthful students, were using the National Technical University of Athens, known locally as the Polytechnic, as their base of operations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the general sentiment in Greece was that the protests, which began in reaction to the shooting of Grigoropoulos by police, had evolved into a broader social uprising. Of particular note was the fact that a substantial number of the young people involved in the protests were unemployed and further unrest could be in the offing, with more loss of jobs anticipated in 2009.</p><p>The situation had political implications for the government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, which was viewed as having handled the situation poorly, according to polling data on the matter. Seizing upon the popular sentiment of discontent, George Papandreou, the leader of the opposition Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), called for fresh elections. He accused the government of being \"incapable of steadily driving the country towards change.\" For his part, Prime Minister Karamanlis rejected calls for either his resignation or early elections. Instead, he said that Greece was in need of a \"steady hand\" to deal with the economic strife.</p><p>Primer on 2009 Parliamentary Electionsin Greece</p><p>Background</p><p>On Sept. 2, 2009, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis announced that a snap general election would be held in the near future. The Greek head of government said he would meet with President Karolos Papoulias to discuss this decision to hold early elections ahead of the expected 2011 date when the tenure of his ruling conservative New Democracy government would normally come to an end. A day later, it was announced that the snap election would be held a month later on Oct. 4, 2009.</p><p>Prime Minister Karamanlis explained that his decision to call the snap election was \"an act of responsibility,\" and it had been advanced in the country's best interest. Prime Minister Karamanlis said that Greece was in need of significant reforms to deal with the after-effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, as well as enduring challenges in the domestic economy and public sector. Indeed, Greece has seen a sharp rise in its unemployment rate, negatively matched by declining economic growth, in recent times -- both of which Prime Minister Karamanlis said had been the result of the previous Socialist government's mismanagement. Accordingly, the Greek head of government called for strict fiscal discipline, structural reforms, and a \"war\" on tax evasion -- a problem that has plagued the country and added to its economic woes. Prime Minister Karamanlis wasted no time in calling for the public to give his party a \"fresh mandate\" to address these issues.</p><p>Some critics surmised that despite this noble agenda, the Karamanlis government was under pressure due to a number of scandals and criticisms for handling various crises, and was thusly acquiescing to the call for an early vote. Complicating the matter was the fact that Socialist leader George Papandreou was agitating for another early poll. He said he wished to force an early presidential election.</p><p>Election Issues</p><p>The main issue surrounding the election was the path to dealing with Greece's economic challenges. Whereas Karamanlis advanced an austerity measure program to tackle this issue, Papandreou promised a significant stimulus package, movement toward the building of a green economy, and the introduction of technocratic experts to help Greece tackle its problems.</p><p>Polling Data</p><p>Polling data indicated that Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party was trailing the Socialists by six percent in the month ahead of the election.</p><p>Results</p><p>After the votes were counted following the October 4, 2009 parliamentary elections, it was clear that Greece's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) had won the country's snap general elections. The results showed that the Socialists garnered more than 43 percent of the vote count, while New Democracy obtained 35 percent. The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) remained as the third largest party in parliament, winning 7.6 percentage of the vote. The right People's Orthodox Rally (LAOS) was estimated to have received 5.6 percent of the vote. The Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) was expected to garner 4.5 percent of the vote. While the Green Ecologists party secured 2.5 percent of the votes, it would not enter parliament due to the three percent threshold required by electoral law.</p><p>Outgoing Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis conceded defeat, resigned as leader of the conservative New Democracy party, and congratulated Socialist leader, George Papandreou. In this way, the Socialists ended their five-year stay in opposition and prepared to take the reins of government once again. In an address to jubilant supporters in Athens, Papandreou said: \"We stand here united before the great responsibility which we undertake.\"</p><p>Daysafter the election, Socialist leader, was sworn into office as Greece's new prime minister by Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens and All Greece, andin the presence of President Karolos Papoulias. The new head of government paid tribute to the contributions of his predecessor, Costas Karamanlis. For his part, Karamanlis congratulated Papandreou and wished him \"all the best for the benefit of the country.\"</p><p>The process of government formation was expected to follow with Prime Minister Papandreou's impending announcement ofthe composition of the new cabinet. To that end, the new head of government noted that the cabinet would be both small and include several women. Attention was also focused on the leadership race for the New Democracy party, which was now officially in opposition.</p><p>Weeks later, the incumbent Greek President Karolos Papoulias was asked by newly-elected Prime Minister George Papandreou to serve a second term as Greece's head of state. In response, Papoulias said, \"I accept the nomination for my re-election to the Presidency of Greece.\" With both the ruling PASOK party and the main opposition New Democracy party backing Papoulias' second term, the actual parliamentary vote in March 2010 was expected to formalize the second term in office.</p><p>Briefing on 2010 Presidential Election in Greece</p><p>On February 3, 2010, Greek President Karolos Papoulias was re-elected to a second term in an internal vote in parliament with an overwhelming majority. Papoulias won 266 of the votes cast in the 300-seat parliament. The incumbent president was supported by the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the main opposition New Democracy (ND), as well as some smaller opposition parties. Parliamentarians belonging to the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the Coalition of the Radical Left abstained from the vote.</p><p>Note: Papoulias was born in 1929 and served as a former government minister and member of parliament.</p><p>Special Entry on Greece's Debt Crisis</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Since late 2009, attempts to resolve Greece's economic crisis have been at the forefront of the national agenda. There have also been serious concerns about Greece\u2019s economic viability on the regional landscape across Europe and internationally. At issue have been deep anxieties about Greece defaulting on its debt, along with subsequent speculation about whether the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have to step in to prevent such an outcome. By April 2010, the prospects of Greece resolving the matter without help from some transnational body came to a head when the Papandreou administration formally said it would accept the EU-IMF financial rescue package to ensure debt service.</p><p>Crisis Landscape:</p><p>In December 2009, the new Greek head of government, Prime Minister George Papandreou, announced a series of harsh spending cuts in order to address the country's economic woes. He warned that without action such as a hiring freeze on public sector jobs, closure of overseas tourism offices, and decreased social security spending, Greece was at risk of \"sinking under its debts.\" He also said that his country had \"lost every trace of credibility\" on the economic front and would have to \"move immediately to a new social deal.\"</p><p>Fears of a government debt default in Europe emerged in the first week of February 2010, with all eyes focused on Greece. Of concern was the rising cost of insuring Greek debt against default, and fears were rising that a bailout by the International Monetary Fund might be in the offing.</p><p>For its part, the Greek government pledged to reduce its budget deficit by three percent of gross domestic product by 2012. That move was welcomed by the European Commission but met with the threat of strikes by Greece's largest union, which has railed against the prospect of austerity measures. By Feb. 10, 2010, the strike by the country's largest public sector union in Greece was going forward. Simultaneously, Prime Minister George Papandreou promised to \"take any necessary measures\" to reduce Greece's deficit including a freeze on public sector pay, increased taxes and the implementation of changes to the pension system.</p><p>The next day, leaders of the European Union said that while Greece had not asked for assistance, they stood ready to help ensure stability within the euro zone. A statement issued from a summit in Brussels read as follows: \"We fully support the efforts of the Greek government and their commitment to do whatever is necessary, including adopting additional measures to ensure that the ambitious targets set in the stability program for 2010 and the following years are met.\" The statement, however, did not specify the nature of such support although there were indications that a loan might be in the offing. Following a meeting of European leaders on Feb. 11, 2010, Austria's Chancellor Werner Faymann explained the need to support fellow European Union member states saying, \"It is important to have solidarity.\" However, he added, \"We are not going to give the money as a present, it will be as loans.\"</p><p>Only a few days later, however, the news emerging from Europe was more grim as regards to Greece's situation. As reported by the British publication, the Telegraph, the council of European Union finance ministers issued an ultimatum to Greece, warning that if that country did not comply with austerity measures by March 16, 2010, it would lose sovereign control over its tax and spend policies. The council also warned that the European Union would invoke Article 126.9 of the Lisbon Treaty to take control from Athens and impose requisite cuts. This threat was likely to have more of a practical effect on Greece than an earlier move by the European Union to suspend Greece's voting rights, although both measures indicated a severe blow to Greek sovereignty within the European bloc. From the point of view of the European Union, the verdict was that Greece's austerity plan contained insufficient spending cuts and uncoordinated measures, and compelled the need for such drastic action.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, Greece took a different view. Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou argued that his country was \"doing enough\" to reduce its public deficit from 12 percent to eight percent of GDP in 2010 by undertaking emergency fiscal cuts. Accordingly, Greece has also been reticent about taking further austerity measures, such as an increase in the value added tax or VAT, as well as further public sector wage cuts, which the European Central Bank has said might be necessary. But the rest of Europe was unlikely to receive Greece's claims on faith alone, given the emerging revelations that Wall Street likely helped Greece hide its balance sheets problem for the purpose of advancing euro zone accession.</p><p>By the third week of February 2010, as talks in Brussels commenced about the financial crisis in Greece, there was no consensus on the possible path toward helping stabilize the situation in that country. In fact, member states of the European Union appeared divided on the issue. Germany has said it wants to protect its own financial interests by constructing a \"firewall\" to prevent Greece's debt crisis from spiraling out of control. It was not known if that \"firewall\" was distinct from, or an actual euphemism for, a bailout for Greece funded by German funds. Certainly, Germany has been careful not to expressly state that it supports some sort of bailout measure for Greece, under the aegis of the European Union , using Germany funds. Indeed, Berlin would have to contend with an outraged domestic reaction, as well as a resistant coalition partner in government whose libertarian inclinations would leave them far from sanguine about such a move.</p><p>At the start of March 2010, in the face of pressure from the European Union, the Greek government agreed to a new package of austerity measures, including tax increases and spending cuts, aimed at resolving the budget crisis. The new package was met with approval from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, who respectively hailed the move as evidence that Greece was taking necessary measures to reduce its precarious debt. The reactions of these two bodies were regarded as crucial, since Greece was hoping for German-funded assistance from the European Union, with the International Monetary Fund in line as an alternative avenue of assistance.</p><p>Nevertheless, since the measures included reductions in holiday bonuses paid to civil servants as well as a pension freeze, it effectively raised the ire of public sector workers and trade unions. From their point of view, the financial package would exact a punishing toll on the workers of the country. Not surprisingly, the country was hit by strikes with workers angrily protesting the deficit-cutting government measures detailed above. With schools closed, public transportation, flights and ferries at a halt, and garbage left uncollected, it was clear that the strike was in full-force. On the streets of Athens, striking workers registered discontent, while riot police were deployed across the city.</p><p>Regional Considerations:</p><p>Also at issue have been the fiscal challenges of Portugal and Spain, which like Greece, have to contend with debt and weakened public finances. One challenge for Spain is the fact that the central government (leaving the social security administration aside) controls only one third of public sector spending. Accordingly, while the central government can set guidelines for the regional and municipal authorities, it has a fairly limited effect on overall fiscal policy. In Portugal, the government does not command a majority in parliament, effectively complicating the process of implementing fiscal policies, and necessitating broad national consensus on the matter of the country's economic health. Ireland, like Greece, suffers from budget deficits that exceed 12 percent of their economic output. However, Ireland's record in navigating difficult economic times (late 1980s, early 1990s) was believed to be in that country's favor.</p><p>Thusly, at the broader level, the European Union has been faced with the moral hazard of having to consider going down a similar path with Spain and Portugal, not to mention other European countries. Clearly, the European Union had no appetite for such a precedent being set in Greece. Not surprisingly, non-euro zone European Union members, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, were recommending the International Monetary Fund route. They argued that an entity such as the IMF possessed the technocratic acumen and experience to orchestrate and supply a loan bailout to Greece.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fitch ratings agency decided to downgrade Greece's credit rating two notches amidst anxieties that the country will be unable to solve its financial farrago without assistance from external parties.? The downgrade was significant since Greece was now at risk of losing its investment grade status, at least according to Fitch.? Greece retains marginally higher ratings with Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Earlier, Portugal's credit rating was also downgraded by the Fitch ratings agency over concerns regarding its debt woes.? Ironically, the move by Fitch came weeks after Portugal passed an austerity budget aimed at reducing its high budget deficit.? At the broader level, the decision to downgrade the credit ratings of both Greece and Portugal, along with attention on the possible rescue package for Greece,? renewed anxieties about the? problem of heavily indebted economies across the continent.</p><p>The situation in these European countries -- specifically on their debt burdens -- has focused attention concomitantly on the European Union where countries of the euro zone share currency but not economic policies, and whose collective fates would be affected by a devalued euro. Indeed, the euro itself has seen its value slide as a result of rising economic anxieties, and questions have once again surfaced regarding its viability.</p><p>Last Resort:</p><p>By late March 2010, a proposal was advanced to address Greece's debt crisis. The rescue package proposal was intended to be a last resort for Greece, should that country fail to borrow sufficient funds under normal conditions. It would require all euro zone countries to vote unanimously to fund individual loans to Greece, although not all countries would be required to contribute. No actual dollar amount was specified for the possible rescue package although there were suggestions that it would be valued at around 22 billion euro, with the lion's share of the funding being derived from the European Union (EU), and a small remained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>On April 10, 2010, euro zone countries agreed to fund up to 30 billion euros -- above the amount originally envisioned -- in emergency loans for debt-hit Greece.? The price of the loans would be about five percent and in line with IMF formulas. The loans would not be activated by the euro zone; instead, it would be up to Greece to decide whether or not to avail itself of the funds, which would be co-financed by the IMF, although to what degree was unknown. For its part, Greece has said it does not want to go down the road of such loans, preferring to auction treasury bills. Greece was hoping that the very notion of an EU-IMF rescue package would ease volatile markets and advance an economic recovery, without actually having to activate the loans. However, such a path was viewed as potentially unavoidable, given the fact that Greece has no choice but to finance its debt obligations. As well, there have been the wider considerations at play -- that is, the impact on markets across Europe and the confidence in the euro.</p><p>By the close of April, 2010, Greece officially requested that the EU-IMF \"last resort\" loan package be activated, in order to deal with its debt-ridden economy and to prevent the unacceptable outcome of default by a sovereign European country. The EU and IMF responded by noting that they believed the details of the rescue plan could be worked through quickly. That being said, since much of the funding for the package will go through the EU, several eurozone countries will have to ratify the use of funds. For example, France would have to garner parliamentary approval for its contribution to Greece's rescue package. In Germany, where -- as discussed above -- the political ramifications of such a plan were expected to be pronounced -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel was warning that there would be \"very strict conditions\" attached to her country's contribution of assistance. As well, it was still to be determined how much the IMF would itself finance, along with interest rates by both the IMF and EU. With such hurdles yet to be crossed, it was unlikely that Greece would be in receipt of the much-needed funds until the second week of May 2010.</p><p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister George Papandreou was expressing confidence in the path going forward. Speaking from the Aegean island of Kastellorizo, he said: \"Our partners will decisively contribute to provide Greece the safe harbor that will allow us to rebuild our ship.\" But the Greek people were not easily assuaged by these words or the EU-IMF rescue package. Instead, they were still railing against the austerity measures enacted by the Greek government with tens of thousands of Greek civil servants taking to the streets to participate in mass strike.</p><p>Further reluctance by Germany to to fund the largest portion of the rescue package for Greece did not help the situation. In fact, with Greece acknowledging that it cannot service its forthcoming debt obligations without the EU-IMF loan, plus the realization that German funds will likely not come quickly, there were escalating fears that Greece could well default by May 19, 2010 -- a significant deadline when billions in bond payments would be due. Although Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou insisted his country would \"absolutely and without any doubt\" service that debt, prevailing anxieties led another credit rating downgrade for Greece. Indeed, Standard and Poors downgraded Greece's credit rating to junk status. That move, in addition to a slight downgrade to Portugal's debt on the basis of heightened risks, renewed attention to euro zone stability.</p><p>Regional Considerations as regards the euro</p><p>In May 2010, the European Union (EU) agreed on a euro stability package valued at 500 billion euros, aimed at preventing the aforementioned Greek debt crisis from deleteriously affecting other countries in the region. Countries within the EU's euro zone would be provided access to loans worth 440 billion euros and emergency funding of 60 billion euros from the EU. As well, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would earmark an additional 250 billion euros. The European Commission would raise the funds in capital markets, using guarantees from the governments of member states, for the purpose of lending it to countries in economic crisis.</p><p>In addition, it was announced that the European Central Bank (ECB) was prepared to participate in exceptional market intervention measures, such as the purchase of euro zone government bonds, for the purpose of shoring up the value and viability of the euro currency.</p><p>These moves were aimed at defending the euro, which has seen its value drop precipitously as a result of the Greek debt crisis has gone on, and as anxieties have increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to other EU member states, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland. These mostly southern European economies were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural economic weakness.</p><p>But even these overtures, as drastic as they might appear, would do little to address Europe's soaring public debt, according to some economic analysts. Indeed, among this core of economists, the argument resided that this rescue package could actually exacerbate the situation. Of concern has been the collective impact of low economic growth, high unemployment, and governments unwilling to take requisite austerity measures to not only decrease spending but also increase productivity. Rather than relying on heavy government spending to spur growth, governments in euro zone countries have opted to decrease their debt levels -- or at least to make the promise of moving in that direction. However, another core of economic analysts has argued that too much debt reduction -- without government stimulus -- could itself stymie economic growth. To this latter end, Daniel Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies warned that \"the patient is dead before he can get up and walk.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the economic crisis in Europe was spreading to the domestic political sphere in Germany. With the German cabinet of Chancellor Merkel poised to approve that country's part in the euro rescue deal, German voters issued a punishing blow to Merkel's conservatives in the state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. The voters' reaction appeared to register discontent over the German federal government's decision. Germans, according to polling data, were already incensed over funding of the bail out plan for Greece. That separate package was also approved by the government and parliament.</p><p>Vulnerable countries take action:</p><p>In a move aimed at addressing its troubling debt, the Spanish government on May 20, 2010, approved an austerity plan. The move was also aimed at soothing fears that Spain would devolve into the same type of debt crisis that had gripped Greece, with deleterious consequences for the value of the euro and the stability of the entire euro zone. A month later in June 2010, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was hailing Spain for taking corrective measures to move the country on the path toward economic stability. However, as was the case in Italy (see below) and Greece, the citizenry and unions were railing against the harsh actions.</p><p>Italy moved on May 25, 2010 to address its debt challenges by launching its own austerity program on the heels of Spain doing the same. Like Spain, Italy wanted to hold the confidence of international investors and prevent sliding into a Greek-style debt crisis. To these ends, the Italian government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi approved austerity measures worth 24 billion euros for the years 2011-2012. Ultimately, Italy''s government was hoping to reduce its deficit down to below three percent of GDP by 2012. In response, Italian unions took to the streets in protests. Indeed, Italian civilians, particularly those from the public sector, were expected to rail against these moves.</p><p>Special Report</p><p>Letter bombs in Greece sent to embassies and foreign governments</p><p>In the first week of November 2010, a series of letter bombs were sent to embassies in Greece as well as some foreign government, prompting the Greek authorities to stop deliveries of foreign mail. More than a dozen such incidences occurred during this period. In one case, a letter bomb dispatched to the French embassy in Athens had to be safely detonated after an explosive device was found hidden in a book. In another case, a courier was injured when a bomb exploded in her hands. Devices were found at the embassies of Switzerland and Russia. Bombs were earlier mailed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and the International Criminal Court in The Hague.</p><p>Since the level of explosives contained in the devices was small, the consensus was that the mailed bombs were not intended to fatally kill anyone. Nevertheless, two Greek men were arrested and charged with terrorism, belonging to a criminal organization, and possession and use of bombs and explosives in regard to the dispatching of these letter bombs. It was believed that they were members of a far-left extremist organization carrying out domestic terrorism. To this end, Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said, \"All evidence shows this is a clear domestic case, with no connection with international terrorism.\u201d</p><p>On December 23, 2010, mail bombs exploded at the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome. Two employees of the respective embassies were seriously injured as a result. Concerns about security reached new highs at diplomatic missions across Europe since only a month prior, mail bombs targeted embassies in the Greek capital of Athens. Suspicions rested on anarchists, with authorities suggesting a connection between Italian and Greek anarchists in regard to the spate of mail bomb attacks.</p><p>Political Update:</p><p>On November 7, 2010, following a favorable outcome in local Greek elections, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou ruled out the possibility of calling a snap parliamentary election. The local elections were regarded as something of a referendum on the handling of the dire state of the Greek economy by Papandreou's socialist party (PASOK). Elected only a year prior, PASOK has been beset by policy challenges as Greece has tried to survive devastating economic conditions, on the brink of default, and requiring both harsh austerity measures and assistance from the European Union. With the local elections ending without massive losses for PASOK, the Greek prime minister was interpreting the election results as measured approval from the Greek citizenry. To that end, Papandreou said, \"Today voters confirmed their will for change. We will continue our work.\" Indeed, he was making it clear that his government had a mandate to move forward with necessary budget cuts, austerity measures and related reforms, and accordingly, there was no need to call snap elections.</p><p>In mid-December 2010, Greek protesters took to the streets in the Greek capital of Athens to register their anger regarding the government's austerity measures. Those measures, that included caps of salaries of workers in state-run entities, were enacted as part of the economic reform agenda, associated with a massive bailout package funded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That bail-out package was intended to save Greece from default. A general strike was also taking place with transportation at a standstill, schools closed, and flights grounded at Greek airports. The protests and general strike had been organized by labor unions; they grew violent as demonstrators threw petrol bombs at buildings close to the parliament and set luxury hotels ablaze. As well, one former conservative government minister, Kostis Hatzidakis, was attacked by an angry mob screaming \"Thieves! Shame on you!\" The violent clashes resulted in Greek police using tear gas to try to disperse the crowds.</p><p>In February 2011, Greek protesters took to the streets in the Greek capital of Athens in a 24-hour general strike. The protesters, numbering more than 30,000 in total, rallied toward the parliament building. At issue for the protesters has been their anger over the government's austerity measures. Those measures, which included caps of salaries of workers in state-run entities, were enacted as part of the economic reform agenda, associated with a massive bailout package funded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That bail-out package was intended to save Greece from default. The protests and general strike had been organized by labor unions; they grew violent as demonstrators threw petrol hurled petrol bombs and stones, prompting police to respond with the firing of tear gas. Meanwhile, the city public transport system was left paralyzed, at least 100 flights were cancelled, and schools, hospitals and businesses were forced to close. The deputy leader of one of Greece's most important unions, Stathis Anestis, said in an interview with the Associate Press that the government measures were disproportionately hurting working people. He said, \"We are facing long-term austerity, with high unemployment and destabilizing our social structure.\" He also promised that mass actions of this sort would not only continue but increase. Anestis said, \"What is increasing is the level of anger and desperation... If these harsh policies continue, so will we.\"</p><p>Special Report:</p><p>The Greek Debt Crisis and Effects on the Euro Zone</p><p>Summary:</p><p>An ongoing debt crisis has plagued Greece, leading to the need for a rescue plan from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default. In a separate but related development, the euro zone approved an expansion of the euro bailout fund, breathing life into the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). Despite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, though, the European Union has not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package. To that end, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou initially advanced the idea of a national referendum aimed at ratifying the debt relief plan. However, with the angry and outraged Greek citizenry unlikely to ratify the plan, the prime minister ultimately withdrew the referendum idea. Prime Minister Papandreou also resigned from office, and made way for the formation of a national unity government, tasked with pushing through the necessary legislation to implement austerity measures and reforms, and securing a further tranche of rescue funds aimed at averting default. Without the enactment of the debt relief plan, Greece would fail to service its debt commitments -- essentially defaulting on its sovereign debt, yielding to deleterious effects for the euro zone and European banks. At the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy. In the backdrop of these developments remain the prevailing fears of contagion emanating from the Greek debt crisis, and extending to other countries, such as Italy and Spain in the euro zone, and the global economy at large. Debt woes in Italy and Spain were already leading to political consequences.</p><p>Background:</p><p>In Greece, protesters were taking to the streets in strikes and mass action to register their rejection of the government's plan to implement austerity measures. Such measures were associated with the loans extended to Greece to prevent an ongoing debt and default crisis, which stands at the forefront of the national agenda in that country. At issue have been deep anxieties about the country of Greece defaulting on its debt, the rising cost of insuring Greek debt against default, along with subsequent speculation about whether the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have to step in to prevent such an outcome.</p><p>Fears of a government debt default in Europe emerged in the first week of February 2010, with all eyes focused on Greece. By April 2010, the prospects of Greece resolving the matter without help from some transnational body came to a head when the Papandreou administration formally said it would accept the EU-IMF financial rescue package to ensure debt service.</p><p>In May 2010, the European Union (EU) agreed on a euro stability package valued at 500 billion euros, aimed at preventing the Greek debt crisis from deleteriously affecting other countries in the region. Countries within the EU's euro zone would be provided access to loans worth 440 billion euros and emergency funding of 60 billion euros from the EU. As well, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would earmark an additional 250 billion euros. The European Commission would raise the funds in capital markets, using guarantees from the governments of member states, for the purpose of lending it to countries in economic crisis.</p><p>In addition, it was announced that the European Central Bank (ECB) was prepared to participate in exceptional market intervention measures, such as the purchase of euro zone government bonds, for the purpose of shoring up the value and viability of the euro currency.</p><p>These moves were aimed at defending the euro, which has seen its value drop precipitously as a result of the Greek debt crisis has gone on, and as anxieties have increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to other EU member states, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland. These mostly southern European economies were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural economic weakness. The situation in such European countries focused attention concomitantly on the European Union where countries of the euro zone share currency but not economic policies, and whose collective fates would be affected by a devalued euro. Indeed, the euro itself had seen its value slide as a result of rising economic anxieties, and questions had once again resurfaced regarding its viability.</p><p>Events from May 2011-June 2011</p><p>A year later in May 2011, the Greek debt crisis was ongoing. Mass action, strikes, and protests had become regularized fare as Greek citizens railed against the requisite austerity measures to be implemented as part of the agreed up rescue package.</p><p>Indeed, May 2011 saw Athens in negotiations with the EU and the IMF to receive a fifth tranche of its rescue package, valued at 110 billion euros. Ahead of the meeting, the chairman of the body that makes up finance ministers in the euro zone, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned that the latest installment of the bailout might not be advanced if Greece could not make the case for its solvency within the next year. The public's clear rejection of austerity measures -- manifest in the aforementioned mass action, strikes and demonstrations -- was not helping Greece to demonstrate that it could achieve this end.</p><p>Given this landscape, by the start of June 2011, the credit ratings agency, Moody's, downgraded Greece from B1 to Caa1 -- just short of default and indicated a 50 percent possibility that the country would default on its debt. Moody's explained that it was highly concerned about Greece's \"highly uncertain growth prospects.\" In this way, Greece's credit rating had fallen in tandem with the rising fears that the country was not capable of stabilizing its debt burden in a timely fashion. Moody's additionally held its outlook for Greece in the negative column, indicating that further downgrades could be in the offing. Now, though, Greece was now located at the bottom of the Moody's ranking -- below Montenegro -- in a listing of Europe's credit-worthy countries. As mid-June 2011 approached, yet another credit ratings agency -- Standard &amp; Poor's -- downgraded Greece from B to CCC, effectively pushing the country to the bottom of the list of the 131 monitored countries.</p><p>Faced with these emerging challenges, as well as the prevailing burden of debt servicing and ultimate solvency, attention refocused on strategies to address the crisis. One option that surfaced was the restructuring of Greece's debt. As suggested by Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker, repayments on Greece's shorter-term debt could be postponed, if lenders would agree to terms. This type of \"debt re-profiling\" would be voluntary and would not be classified as default by credit ratings agencies. The European Central Bank (ECB) has indicated that while typical restructuring schemes would be opposed, a voluntary debt re-profiling arrangement might be deemed acceptable.</p><p>Note that by the second week of June 2011, the Greek cabinet had backed budget cuts as part of a fiscal and structural adjustment program required by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, as part of the conditions associated with the aforementioned rescue package. The plan would now have to be voted on in parliament; that vote was expected to take place by the end of the month (June 2011) -- the deadline specified for the next tranche of rescue loans to be made available.</p><p>Meanwhile, early June saw public sector unions take to the streets in a mass strike in protest of harsh austerity measures to come. By the second week of June, the anti-austerity riots continued with thousands of people involved in demonstrations. Syntagma Square in Athens was becoming \"ground zero\" of the protest movement. That being said, protest action was spread across other terrain. Ports and state-run companies were shut down, public transportation was disrupted, while banks and hospitals could only offer limited service. The scene eventually devolved into violent territory, forcing police to fire teargas to disperse crowds outside the parliament building. This scene erupted as members of parliament were about to debate the new fiscal and structural adjustment program (discussed above), which the Greek cabinet had already passed, and which was a required condition for the EU and IMF bail-out packages. Further strike action was expected by protesters, self-termed \"the Indignants,\" and calling for \"resistance\" ahead of the parliamentary vote.</p><p>At the political level, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was facing an all-out revolt from his own Socialist Party (known by the acronym, PASOK), the members of whom were reacting to the scene on the streets of Athens. In fact, at least one member of PASOK defected to the opposition to register his personal protest against the austerity measures, while another PASOK member warned that he intended to vote against him. Several other PASOK members of parliament were making it known that their votes were not assured. It was apparent that they were showing solidarity with \"the Indignants\" in the streets.</p><p>While the members of parliament were accountable to the citizens of the Hellenic republic, the fact remained that Greece -- as a sovereign state within the EU -- was itself accountable to the economic bloc of which it is a member. Understanding the gravity of the political situation and the potentially devastating economic fallout -- not only for Greece nationally, but for its standing in the EU, and the future of the euro -- Prime Minister Papandreou proposed the formation of a unity government, with an eye on passing the measures in the national interest. To this end, the prime minister convened talks with Greek President Karolos Papoulias, arguing passionately that \"a national effort\" was required at this \"historically crucial moment\" to resolve the situation. Prime Minister Papandreou, therefore, met with conservative New Democracy Party leader, Antonis Samaras, to discuss the possible formation of a power-sharing government. For its part, the conservatives demanded that Papandreou step aside and that the rescue package be renegotiated. While Prime Minister Papandreou made it clear that he would be willing to resign as the head of government, the notion of a potentially protracted process of renegotiating the bail-out terms was viewed as untenable at a time of dire instability. Thus, the prime minister abandoned the idea of a unity government and instead announced that he would reveal a new cabinet. The new government, which could very well exclude Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou, the architect of unpopular austerity budget, would have to be ratified via a vote of confidence in the parliament.</p><p>Indeed, on June 17, 2011, as Prime Minister Papandreou unveiled his cabinet changes, it was apparent that Finance Minister Papaconstantinou would no longer be in that role; instead, outgoing Defense Minister Evangelos Venizelos would take on the finance portfolio. Having moved forward with a cabinet shuffle, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou was calling for \"national accord\" in parliament to address the crisis. In a speech to parliament, the Greek head of government said, \"I have asked for a renewal of confidence in the government, because the country finds itself at a crucial point.\"</p><p>The move to appoint Venizelos as the new finance minister was geared toward assuaging the rising tide of discontent among the prime minister's party, PASOK; however, the elimination of Papaconstantinou was simultaneously delivering a negative message to the international community about Greece's ability to seriously and effectively tackle its economic problems. Venizelos statement that he would forge a deal with Greece's bail-out lenders that would allow Greece to implement a less painful reform package indicated that the incoming finance minister would be a weaker voice in the austerity thrust.</p><p>The crisis was seeping outside Greek borders as finance ministers of the euro zone failed to find concurrence on the measures associated with garnering contributions from private creditors towards a second Greek rescue package. Of concern was the potential destabilization of the financial markets as this process played out -- and failed -- in the Belgian capital in Brussels. Now other \"secure\" countries were being affected as news emerged that Moody's might downgrade some French banks -- BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generaledue -- due to their exposure to Greek debt. With an eye on calming the situation, the French government made it clear that its position was consistent with that of the European Central Bank (ECB), which warned that the German plan to convince bondholders to share part of the costs in a new Greek aid package could be risky and lead to default. It was also announced that French President Nicolas Sarkozy would meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on June 17, 2011, to address and resolve the matter.</p><p>On June 19, 2011, finance ministers of the euro zone were meeting in Luxembourg to discuss the anticipated approval of the latest tranche of funds associated with the EU/IMF rescue package for debt-ridden Greece. The group was also expected to consider a second bail-out package for Greece. The new Greek finance minister, Venizelos, attended the meeting and said that his country was committed to meeting the targets of the EU/IMF agreement. In an interview with the media, Venizelos said, \"It is a great opportunity for me to repeat the strong commitment of the Greek government and the strong will of the Greek people for the implementation of the program.\" That being said, recent surveys of the Greek citizenry suggested that the vast majority of Greeks at home were in fact opposed to the austerity measures associated with the rescue package and were increasingly saying that the country should just default. Of course, such a fate would increase exposure of other euro zone countries, increasing the possibility of default elsewhere in the region.</p><p>Note that as June entered its fourth week, the newly-shuffled Greek government was set for a confidence vote. To that end, the government indeed survived the vote with a comfortable majority. Indeed, Prime Minister George Papandreou's new cabinet was approved by 155 votes to 143, with two abstentions. Another vote in parliament on the austerity budget had yet to transpire by the close of June 2011. Release of the EU/IMF rescue package funds would only be released if the austerity measures were passed into legislation in the parliament. Accordingly, the finance ministers of the euro zone postponed their decisions regarding the release of the funds as well as a second rescue package until after the anticipated vote. The new head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, called on the Greek members of parliament to act to avoid default saying: \"If I have a message this evening about Greece, it is a call to the Greek opposition... to join in national unity with the party which is currently in power. The country's destiny is at stake.\" Warning of global consequences, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said, \"The coming hours will be decisive, crucial for the Greek people, but also for the euro zone and the stability of the world economy.\"</p><p>On June 28, 2011, ahead of the parliamentary vote on the austerity budget, thousands of people had gathered outside the parliamentary building as part of an anticipated mass strike. To that end, as before, transportation and other public services, hospitals, banks, and the Athens international airport, were all either closed down or severely curtailed. In a corner of Syntagma Square, the protest movement, which was intended to be a peaceful gathering, took a violent turn as anarchist youth dressed in black hoods hurled stones, bottles, debris, and even sledgehammers at police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. As well, protesters set mobile telecommunications transmitting vehicles were set ablaze, seemingly having been mistaken for being satellite television trucks. Members of trade unions tried to persuade anarchists to stop their violent actions and exit Syntagma Square; they argued that the violence only hurt the objectives of the protest movement. However, the scene had already devolved into some degree of chaos. Indeed, several people were injured in the fracas, including 20 police officers, while a number of demonstrators were detained by authorities.</p><p>With the vote in parliament set to go forward on June 29, 2011, regardless of the chaos in the streets, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou warned that without affirmative action, and further, without being able to secure new loans, the Greek national coffers would fall empty before long. Newly-installed Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos admitted that the austerity measures were \"unfair,\" but argued that there was no other alternative. Greece's Central Banker George Provopoulos warned that a negative vote against the austerity budget vote would constitute \"suicide\" for the country. But on the other side of the equation, the main opposition leader, Antonis Samaras of the New Democracy party, was not keen to assent to the austerity package as it stood (including tax hikes), saying that tax rates should be lowered in order to stimulate the economy. In addition to resistance from the opposition, Prime Minister Papandreou would also have to deal with the aforementioned revolt from within his own PASOK party.</p><p>Nevertheless, on June 29, 2011, when the much-anticipated vote on the austerity budget was held in parliament, the measure passed with a slim majority of 155 votes in its favor to 138 votes against it. Ultimately, only one member of parliament form the ruling PASOK party voted against the bill, although there were a handful of abstentions and \"non\" votes. Contained in the austerity budget were tax increases, cuts to salaries, as well as action on privatizations and public sector redundancies. Greek Prime Minister Papandreou welcomed the passage of the legislation as \"a crucial step\" for Greece. At the multilateral level, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy issued a joint statement that hailed the vote as a measure of national responsibility. The statement included the following sentence: \"The country has taken an important step forward along the necessary path of fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing structural reform.\" However, the vote outcome prompted an angry renewal of violence by protesters in the streets of Athens. A second vote ensued a day later on June 30, 2011, and passed with a majority of votes in its favor. The second bill would reform laws and effectively facilitate the implementation of the rescue package.</p><p>Status of Events in mid-2011</p><p>All eyes were on the deadline in the first week of July 2011 for the euro zone whereby the EU would have to approve the latest rescue loans to Greece. It was assumed that with the parliament voting favorably on the austerity and privatization program, the funds by the EU and IMF would, indeed, be released. To that end, on July 2, 2011, finance ministers of the euro zone said that they would clear the release of the funds for Greece. Yet to be decided were the details surrounding a second bailout package for Greece.</p><p>Note that in mid-July 2011, at an emergency euro zone summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel cast the second rescue package for Greece in some degree of doubt when she said that there would be no \"spectacular\" measures aimed at resolving Greece's debt crisis, such as the restructuring of Greek debt. The German chancellor made it clear that there needed to be a concrete plan for a second Greek rescue package, if there was any hope that the debt crisis in that country would be prevented from spreading across the euro zone. Merkel's statement appeared to reflect an ongoing disagreement between her country and the European Central Bank (ECB) over the matter of private investors sharing the costs of another rescue deal. Germany, backed by Finland and the Netherlands, has made it clear that private investors need to share the pain, rather than only burdening taxpayers. On the other hand, the ECB has held the view that forcing private investors to take losses on their loans would be akin to a default by Greece on its debts. This impasse did not bode well for the core objective in bailing out Greece in the first place -- the prevention of contagion across the euro zone.</p><p>Ultimately, though, concurrence was reached on July 21, 2011, with a rescue package of about 109 billion euro. Early drafts of the plan indicated that it would entail several proposals to reduce Greece\u2019s debt, including exchanging existing bonds for new lower interest rate bonds, and could result in short-term or \"partial\" default for Greece. To be clear, the plan provides for the Germany-endorsed position that private lenders, including banks, would have to do their part in contributing to the package. Any measures that would allow Greece easier repayment terms could be viewed by credit rating agencies as acknowledgment that its borrowing was unsustainable -- and therefore, \"partial default.\"</p><p>Given this possibility, it was perhaps not surprising that on July 25, 2011, the credit ratings agency, Moody's, cut Greece's rating further, this time from Caa1 to Ca -- only two notches short of a default rating. Moody's said that the plan discussed above to exchange existing bonds for new lower interest rate bonds, would constitute default. Meanwhile, the ratings agency, Fitch, said that this very deal would be understood as \"selective debt default\" by Greece. Already, as noted above, Standard &amp; Poor's had downgraded Greece from B to CCC, effectively pushing the country to the bottom of the list of the 131 monitored countries. Then on July 27, 2011, Standard &amp; Poor's further downgraded Greece from a CCC rating to CC, reflecting its view that the euro zone restructuring debt plan discussed here would constitute a \"selective debt default\" by Greece. Fitch indicated it would follow in a similar direction.</p><p>Recent Developments (Sept. 2011)</p><p>On Sept. 22, 2011, Greek labor unions convened a 24-hour mass action strike to register discontent over further austerity measures instituted by the government. The unions targeted the public transport sector with workers from bus, taxi, train services involved, as well as air traffic controllers stopping work for several hours. Teachers and other civil servants were additionally joining the strike. Athens was expected to shut down, including the airport.</p><p>At issue were the additional strict measures to be taken up by the Greek government to cut pensions and suspend certain civil service jobs, in an effort to satisfy the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and thus procure the latest installment of loan funding intended to assist Greece in paying its massive debt and avert default. To date, the European Commission, the EU, and the IMF have been unimpressed by Athens' slow pace of reform and have warned that further measures would be needed to qualify for the funding. For the people in the streets, though, there was no appreciation for the need to meet the terms set forth by the EU and the IMF, with many of them disconnected from the financial realities of the scenario, such as default avoidance and maintaining EU status.</p><p>As stated by Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, \"The situation is extremely critical and I could say dangerous. There is great nervousness in the euro zone, the European banking system and the world economy.\" Whereas Finance Minister Venizelos was saying that the Greek government was prepared to do \"anything\" to avoid deleterious consequences, many Greek citizens were under the impression that they were being faced with years of austerity in order to pay French and German banks, with Greek newspapers striking populist tones and accusing the government of placing Greek citizens on the \"sacrificial altar.\"</p><p>As September 2011 drew to an end, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was engaged in talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the efforts by the Greek government to reduce its budget deficit. With Germany funding the bulk of the EU rescue package, support from German quarters was essential. To that end, the Greek head of government also delivered a speech to German business leaders, in which he made his case for German funding assistance in resolving the Greek debt crisis. That being said, the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF were yet to travel to Athens to review Greece's progress in reducing debt levels, and to make a decision on the release of the latest tranche of bailout funds. See below for information related to the decision made on that matter.</p><p>Status of Greek Debt Crisis (Oct. 2011)</p><p>At the start of October 2011, the Greek government in Athens adopted its 2012 draft austerity budget. That news was somewhat overshadowed by the Greek government's announcement that the country was likely to miss its deficit reduction targets. Athens blamed its shortfall on meeting deficit reduction targets on the country's deepening recession, pointing toward an economic contraction of 5.5 percent in 2011 rather than a rate of 3.8 percent, as expected months earlier. A statement from the Greek Finance Minister read as follows: \"Three critical months remain to finish 2011, and the final estimate of 8.5 percent of GDP deficit can be achieved if the state mechanism and citizens respond accordingly.\" But the Greek citizenry was in no mood to respond favorably and, instead, continued to take to the streets in strikes and protests.</p><p>In an attempt to cast the scenario in the most positive light, the Greek finance ministry said that it was moving forward with its highly unpopular austerity measures, regardless of the outrage coming from the Greek citizenry. Included in the austerity provisions was a plan to put 30,000 civil service staff on \"labor reserve\" by the end of 2011, as well as cuts to salaries and wages, and a package of tax increases. These austerity measures were intended to show the economic rescue \"troika\" of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU), and the European Central Bank (ECB) that Greece was taking on necessary measures to address its debt crisis.</p><p>To this end, representatives of the IMF, the EU, and the ECB, were set to review Greece's progress in reducing debt levels, and to make a decision on the release of the latest installment of bailout funds. However, before a decision could be made, the finance ministers from the euro zone put the metaphoric \"brakes\" on the decision-making. After hours of talks in Luxembourg, the finance ministers from the 17-nation euro zone urged Greece to take on more sacrifices and warned that banks in region should prepare for further challenges.</p><p>With a delay on the decision on releasing the latest tranche of bailout funds for Greece, it was yet to be seen if the IMF, EU, and ECB would ultimately recommend the release of eight billion euros in bailout funds for Greece. Some deadlines of significance included mid-October 2011, when the decision would finally be made, and the actual release of funds to come (pending approval) at the close of October 2011. However, the current scenario suggested that Greece might not receive its needed installment of rescue funds until November 2011. Presumably with the aim of preventing a sense of panic, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos wasted no time in stating that the Greek government would have no funding problems until November 2011. Of course, Greece had earlier indicated it would be in need of funds by the middle of October 2011.</p><p>Note that as October 2011 entered its final week, finance ministers of the euro zone finally approved the tranche of rescue funds needed for Greece to escape disastrous default. The International Monetary Fund would also have to sign off on the release of the bail out money, but all expectations were that Athens would receive the much-needed funds by mid-November 2011.</p><p>Should Greece fail to service its debt commitments, there would be deleterious effects for the euro zone, European banks, and at the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy.</p><p>Chairman of the euro zone finance ministers (known as the euro group), Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, foreclosed the possibility of a debt default by Greece, while simultaneously warning that Greece's private sector creditors should anticipate further losses on their Greek sovereign debt holdings \u2013 indeed, greater than the 21 percent \"haircut\" that was previously agreed upon months earlier. At that time in July 2011, private sector creditors had agreed to join the euro zone and the IMF in providing a second bailout package for Greece.</p><p>The European Financial Stability Facility</p><p>In mid-October 2011, all euro zone countries had ratified a plan to expand a rescue fund for Europe's heavily indebted countries, known as the European Financial Stability Facility. By the end of the month, European leaders announced that an agreement had been reached to help to resolve the euro zone debt crisis. Central to the agreement was acceptance from the banks that they would take a 50 percent loss on the face value of their Greek debt. Banks would also have to raise more capital to protect them against losses resulting from any future government defaults. As well, the actual rescue or \"bail out\" fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), would be boosted to one trillion euros.</p><p>The hope was that the move would aid in reducing Greek debt to 120 percent of GDP by the year, 2020. While this remained a significant enduring debt, it was deemed to be far more sustainable for a recession-plagued economy undertaking harsh austerity measures. It was hoped that the accord would contain the debt crisis and prevent contagion into other vulnerable euro zone countries, such as Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. It was also hoped that the deal would serve to revitalize the credibility of the euro.</p><p>The issue has been an extremely contentious one, with the participants of the global economy anxious for action to be taken in response to the debt crisis, but with stakeholders in various euro zone countries infuriated that they would be funding bailout packages that would benefit countries, such as Greece. It should also be noted that there was a growing chorus of complaints about the slow and protracted political response to the debt crisis and concomitant euro zone challenges, which was largely due to the EU's institutional structure.</p><p>Referendum for Greece?</p><p>By the start of November 2011, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was seeking national consensus for the implementation of the series of harsh and unpopular austerity measures, which were required elements of the debt relief plan to stabilize Greece and the euro zone. To that end, the embattled Greek head of government was considering seeking the public's ratification of the European Union plan in a national referendum. However, all indications pointed toward a definitively negative outcome at the polls, given the incensed Greek citizenry's antipathy toward the massively unpopular austerity measures, and the belief that the country should simply default and exit the euro zone. The international community reacted in a state of collective horror, given the likely outcome of this risky move. Clearly, a \"no\" vote would return Greece to the brink of economic disaster, as it would effectively be a rejection of the debt relief plan. Prime Minister Papandreou was also facing by a rebellion in his own government and in parliament, with various players outraged at the various options going forward -- austerity or bankruptcy.</p><p>Accordingly, Prime Minister Papandreou on Nov. 3, 2011 backed away from the controversial referendum notion and, instead, suggested that he would pursue coalition talks, with the intention of forming a stable unity (or \"salvation\") government that would be tasked with bringing the Greek economy from the precipice of crisis. Prime Minister Papandreou said, \"We had three alternatives, to call general election, hold a referendum, or achieve a wide consensus.\"</p><p>With the main Greek opposition party reversing course, and now expressing support for the European Union debt relief deal (discussed above), Prime Minister Papandreou was pursuing the third option. The beleaguered Greek head of government said that he had no intention of resigning from office, but that he would seek a confidence vote in parliament, and then move forward with the formation of \"a national salvation government.\"</p><p>Two days later on Nov. 5, 2011, Prime Minister Papandreou survived the crucial confidence vote in parliament and promised to form the aforementioned \"national salvation government.\" Despite open rebellion among the ranks of the ruling Socialists (known by the acronym, PASOK), all PASOK members of parliament stood in solidarity with the prime minister on the confidence motion discussed above. The final vote result was 153 favorable votes and 147 against the Papandreou government. Clearly, it was a narrow victory and may have averted the another potentially negative outcome -- immediate elections, which clearly would have been politically catastrophic for Greece, which was already dealing with economic crisis.</p><p>New Government for Greece</p><p>With the confidence vote behind him, Prime Minister Papandreou pledged that he would commence negotiations to form a national unity (re: \"salvation\") government immediately, saying that he would soon visit Greek President Karolos Papoulias to start the process, and indicating that he was even ready to step aside as head of government, if necessary. After that meeting, the Greek head of government said, \"I informed the president on my intention to seek wide consensus in order to proceed with the implementation of the historic decisions of October 26 upon which depends our membership inthe euro zone.\" The outcome of the negotiations, though, remained hazy.</p><p>At issue was a brewing disagreement on the tenure of the interim government and the timeline leading to fresh elections. Antonis Samaras, the head of the main opposition New Democracy (ND) party, was insisting that the interim government have only a limited term, given the immediate objective at hand (re: rescuing Greece from the brink of economic disaster under the aegis of national consensus), with snap elections to be held by the year's end. Samaras argued, \u201cThe masks have fallen. Mr. Papandreou has rejected our proposals in their entirety. The responsibility he bears is huge. The only solution is elections.\u201d</p><p>It was possible that Prime Minister Papandreou could form a coalition government with two minor opposition parties, whose leaders have expressed their willingness to join a temporary coalition. These two right-wing parties appeared more amenable to a longer timeline of cooperation with Papandreou, expressing doubt that any coalition government would be able to easily push through parliament the necessary legislation to enact the provisions of the European Union debt relief deal. They were particularly skeptical that the interim government would be effective without the involvement of the ND, which was emphatic in its demands for snap elections by the end of 2011.</p><p>By Nov. 6, 2011, opposition leader Samaras of the ND was demanding that Prime Minister Papandreou resign from office, arguing that the head of government was taking too long to enact reforms. In an interview with the media, Samaras said, \"The prime minister must decide what he wants to do, as by not resigning he hampers any solution.\" Samaras also made it clear that his party would not participate in a national coalition plan if Papandreou remained as prime minister. For his part, Prime Minister Papandreou had made it clear that he was willing to relinquish his post -- but only after a national unity government was formed, rather than as a condition of that possible outcome. It was evident that the two main political parties in Greece -- PASOK and the ND -- were embroiled in a high-stakes game of political brinkmanship, with the national, and indeed, the international community as the metaphoric victims in the center of the political cross-fire.</p><p>Nevertheless, later on that very day, the office of the Greek Presidency announced that a new coalition government had been formed, without Prime Minister George Papandreou, who had agreed to step down as the head of government. Once a new prime minister was named, President Papoulias would prevail on all parties to join the new government. All eyes were on current Finance Minister Venizelos or former Deputy President of the European Central Bank Lukas Papademos, as possible candidates to head the new national government.</p><p>Ultimately, on Nov. 7, 2011, it was Papademos who was tapped to be the interim leader of the new transitional Greek administration. With academic gravitas as an economist who has written extensively about the debt crisis as well as macroeconomic theory, the structure and functioning of financial markets, monetary analysis and policy, economic performance, financial stability, and economic policy in the European Union, Papademos was regarded as a credible choice to guide the interim \"national salvation\" government. Papademos' background at the helm of the European Central Bank augured the possibility of a cooperative relationship with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during this time of crisis.</p><p>Note that Prime Minister Papademos' government won a confidence vote in parliament on Nov 16, 2011. The governing coalition garnered a substantial majority of 255 favorable votes. The successful vote was a significant development for the new government, despite strong concerns from opposition parties -- the conservative New Democracy party and the far right Laos party -- regarding the austerity measures that are part of the plan to address the Greek debt crisis.</p><p>It was hoped that the concurrence on the new interim government would bring an end to the climate of turmoil and uncertainty gripping Greece and the overall euro zone. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos was warning that the Greek economy remained in \u201cmortal danger,\u201d ultimately requiring that the interim government toremain in power long enough to ensure the full implementation of all necessary procedures to stabilize the Greek economy. Indeed, the interim government would be tasked with implementing the full slate of required procedures needed to stabilize the Greek economy. It would have to ensure the release of the next European Union / International Monetary Fund loan installment in the near future, and would also have to finalize legislation for the new rescue package. Most importantly, that legislation would have to be passed into law. Moreover, Greece would have to look to private creditors for assistance in writing off its debt.</p><p>Recent Developments --</p><p>By the start of December 2011, the leaders of the two biggest players in the euro zone -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- issued a joint call for serious changes to Europe\u2019s governing treaties, aimed at ameliorated economic governance for the 17 countries that make up the euro currency bloc. French President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel met for talks on the matter in Paris as the euro zone countries continue to grapple with the regional debt crisis, emanating from Greece but extending across the euro bloc.</p><p>Included in their proposal were: (1) the creation of a monetary fund for Europe, (2) automatic penalties for countries that exceed European deficit limits, and (3) monthly meetings of European leaders. The proposal entailed compromises by both European leaders. President Sarkozy had to accept the notion of automatic sanctions for countries in violation of debt limit rules, while Chancellor Merkel had to accept that the European Court of Justice will not be empowered with the power of veto over budgets. Meanwhile, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which was intended to replace the European Financial Stability Facility in 2013, would be advanced earlier in 2012.</p><p>President Sarkozy said that they were looking to March 2012 to complete negotiations on the new treaty. Ideally, the new treaty would be ratified by all 27 member states of the European Union. However, if concurrence at that level proved impossible, then the 17 states of the euro zone would have to approve it. It should also be noted that European Council President Herman Van Rompuy has said that tougher budget rules for the euro zone may not require changing any existing European Union treaties. To that</p><p>President Sarkozy emphasized the imperative that such a crisis not re-emerge in the future. He said, \"We are conscious of the gravity of the situation and of the responsibility that rests on our shoulders.\" For her part, Chancellor Merkel said her country, working in concert with France, was \"absolutely determined\" to maintain a stable euro. She also advocated for \"structural changes which go beyond agreements.\"</p><p>While the new measures would certainly go a long way to addressing the issue of improved economic governance in the euro zone, they did not deal with the question of how many euro zone countries would deal with their debt challenges in a climate of low growth. Nevertheless, in the short run, the steadfast and unified message of intent by the two European leaders was, at least. expected to calm markets and facilitate lower borrowing costs for debt-ridden economies such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Dec. 5, 2011, the credit ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, placed the countries of the euro zone on a \"credit watch\" with negative implications. Even power house economies of Germany and France were included in the move, which presaged a downgrade to come in the future. A day later, Standard and Poor's even warned that the euro zone bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- could lose its own AAA rating. These moves have raised eyebrows across the world as regards the credibility of the ratings agency, which failed to warn the world of the sub-prime meltdown in 2008 that ultimately let to the global financial crisis. There were suggestions that this downgrade threat to euro zone countries, in conjunction with the downgrade of the United States months earlier following a particularly ferocious debt ceiling debate in that country, were evidence that the credit ratings agency was trying to \"save face\" by proving its tougher standards at this time. However, Standard and Poor's newly-discovered hard-line stance was being questioned by analysts, who pointed to the timing of the warning against euro zone countries. Indeed, this warning came precisely at a time when France and Germany were leading the charge in the European Union to solve the regional debt crisis emanating from Greece, which has left the euro vulnerable, risked fragmenting the currency union, and which could yet imperil the fragile global economic recovery.</p><p>In January 2012, the credit ratings agency, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, downgraded the status of a number of European countries. That being said, Greece's rating was already at \"junk status.\"</p><p>Special Report:</p><p>Greece on the brink; Athens in flames as Greek members of parliament vote to approve austerity measures</p><p>Background</p><p>In recent years, an ongoing debt crisis has raged across the euro zone countries of the European Union (EU). Since 2010, Greece has stood as \"ground zero\" of the crisis, evoking deep anxieties about that country defaulting on its debt.</p><p>Anxieties also increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to other EU member states, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland. There were prevailing fears of contagion emanating from the Greek debt crisis, but extending to these mostly southern European economies, which were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural economic weakness.</p><p>The crisis in Greece led to the development of a rescue plan by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which was aimed at averting sovereign default by Athens. In a separate but related development, the euro zone approved an expansion of the euro bailout fund, breathing life into what has been known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).</p><p>Despite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, the European Union has not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package.</p><p>A new technocratic government was formed and tasked with pushing through the necessary legislation to implement the required austerity measures and reforms, and securing a further tranche of rescue funds aimed at averting default. But no government can function divorced from the reality of the political realm, and the political scene in Greece was one in which the politicians -- fearing the reaction of an infuriated citizenry -- were not going to easily assent to the stringent transformations needed to secure rescue funds.</p><p>Of course, without the enactment of the debt relief plan, Greece would fail to service its debt commitments -- essentially defaulting on its sovereign debt, and yielding deleterious effects for the euro zone and European banks. At the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy.</p><p>Just past midnight on Feb. 13, 2012, Greek members of parliament voted to approve the austerity and reform package needed to secure rescue funds. But outside the parliament in the streets of Athens, the city was literally ablaze as rioters and protesters set fire to buildings to register their outrage.</p><p>Landscape at the start of 2012</p><p>In late January 2012, Greek authorities were set to meet with private creditors to forge a debt write-off agreement that would reduce Greece's debt. At issue was the lack of concurrence over an interest rate on new bonds that would replace existing debts. The Institute of International Finance ( IIF), which was representing Greece's private creditors in negotiations with the Greek authorities, said that it desired a four percent interest rate on newly-issued bonds. Athens, however, sought a lower rate. Should an agreement be reached, Greece would be positioned for additional rescue funding. Indeed, forging an agreement with private creditors has been mandated before further rescue funds can be dispatched by the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. Of course, without those funds, Athens would default on its forthcoming loan repayments.</p><p>There remained questions about whether the intervention of the private creditors would be enough to provide Greece with relief. Accordingly, Christine Lagarde -- the head of the International Monetary Fund -- said that if the level of Greek debt held by the private sector was not sufficiently renegotiated, then public sector holders of Greek debt should also participate in the effort. An unfavorable outcome to this process could result in Greece being forced to exit the euro zone.</p><p>It should be noted that in January 2012, credit ratings agencies downgraded the status of a number of European countries. That being said, Greece's rating was already at \"junk status.\"</p><p>By the start of February 2012, there was no consensus within the Greek leadership regarding the terms of certain reforms and austerity measures needed to secure an aid package. While Greek politicians agreed to cut significant government jobs in 2012, there was also no consensus over reductions in salaries. Indeed, Greek politicians were refusing to yield to the demands of the European Union that severe austerity measures be implemented. There were rumors circulating that interim technocratic Prime Minister Lucas Papademos might consider resigning from office if he failed to gain the support of the three political parties backing the coalition administration. That objective became harder to accomplish when Greek unions closed ranks with management groups and made it clear that they were opposed to proposed salary reductions. They said that wage reductions were unacceptable. Moreover, two of the largest trade unions in Greece were set to commence strikes to register discontent over the plans for pay cuts.</p><p>Given the lack of progress made regarding necessary reforms and austerity measures, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos blasted the political parties for failing to approach the talks with a sense of urgency. He said, \"Instead of looking at this tragic dilemma... there are many who spend their effort on a conventional, outdated, party confrontation as if nothing has happened. Sadly, we are distracted and we are not telling the Greek people the truth,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Euro zone leadership frustrated by Greece's lack of action</p><p>At the broader level, other countries of the European Union were making it clear that Greece needed to immediately take the necessary steps -- already agreed upon -- to avoid default. As stated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, \"Greece's leaders have made commitments and they must respect them scrupulously.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned the refusal of Greece to take the necessary steps toward austerity and reform threatened \"the entire euro zone .\" The German Chancellor said, \"There can be no new Greece program if agreement is not reached... All those who bear responsibility in Greece must know -- we will not deviate from this position.\" She also expressed frustration over the slowness of Greece to take action, saying, \"I honestly can't understand how additional days will help. Time is of the essence. A lot is at stake forthe entire euro zone.\"</p><p>Likewise, Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the euro zone group of finance ministers, said in an interview with Der Spiegel that he had lost his patience with Greece. He warned that if Athens failed to move forward the required reforms and austerity measures, and failed to forge a debt write off agreement with private creditors, \"Then there would not be a new program and that would mean that in March a declaration of bankruptcy would occur.\"</p><p>Latest Developments (February 2012)</p><p>On Feb. 9. 2012, Greek political leaders finally announced they had reached an agreement by which a package of harsh austerity and reform measures would be enacted into law, as demanded by Greece's financial backers.</p><p>The package included 15,000 public-sector job cuts (as discussed above), the lowering of the minimum wage by 20 percent (a key sticking point that was now going to go forward), the liberalization (or reform) of labor laws, and negotiations aimed at a debt write-off with banks. The package was presented to a gathering of euro zone ministers in Brussels; there, leaders of the European bloc expressed the view that the package was short on savings and that they needed \"strong political assurances\" on the implementation of the packages.</p><p>To that latter end, attention was soon refocused on the approval of the associated legislation by the Greek cabinet and final passage in the Greek parliament.</p><p>While approval in the Greek cabinet occurred, five government ministers resigned from office presumably to show disapproval for the harshness of the measures. Now, the action shifted to the parliament where the bill had to passed if Greece hoped to receive funds needed to avoid bankruptcy in March 2012.</p><p>On Feb. 11, 2012, Prime Minister Papademos took to the air waves in Greece to warn the Greek citizenry that failure to pass the legislation would be \"disastrous\" for the country. He said, \"The social cost of this program is limited in comparison with the economic and social catastrophe that would follow if we didn't adopt it.\" Prime Minister Papademos warned that without the passage of the bill and the infusion of rescue funds, the Greek government would be unable to pay wages, and there would be disruptions to the importation of fuel, medicine and machinery. He argued affirmatively for the legislation asserting, \"It would be a huge historical injustice if the country from which European culture sprang ... reached bankruptcy and was led, due to one more mistake, to national isolation and national despair.\"</p><p>By Feb. 12, 2012, members of parliament were soon ensconced in the process of debating the bill and introducing the legislative measures. The general consensus was that the legislation would be passed since PASOK, along with its coalition ally, New Democracy, controlled more than 230 seats in the 200-seat unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" or parliament. Members of the Greek legislative body would also have to vote on an additional bill dealing with the debt write-off agreement with private banks.</p><p>As members of parliament debated the legislation, Greeks outside of parliament were opposing the move. While the international community understood that default in Greece could imperil the financial stability of Europe, Greek citizens had a different perspective. Greek citizens, by and large, haveviewed themselves to be already suffering under the weight of an economic disaster and have vociferously opposed further measures that would worsen their living conditions. Indeed, large swaths of the country believed that Greece should exit the euro zone, return to a devalued \"drachma\" (the former currency), and dealing with the consequences with less of an acute stranglehold. Of course, the wishes of the Greek masses and decision makers in Athens and across Europe were on a collision course.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to voice their outrage over the proposed austerity and reform legislation. Indeed, for successive days, mass protests rocked Athens. The scene turned violent in Athens on Feb. 12, 2012, as black-masked protesters protesters hurled stones and petrol bombs, leaving buildings damaged and scores of people injured. Battles between protesters and security forces were ongoing throughout the capital. Meanwhile, riots were breaking out in other parts of the country, such as the northern city of Thessaloniki, but also spreading to islands such as Corfu and Crete.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Papademos condemned the breakdown of social order saying, \"Vandalism, violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country and won't be tolerated.\"</p><p>Just past midnight on Feb. 13, 2012, Greek members of parliament voted to approve the austerity and reform package needed to secure rescue funds. The economic reform and austerity bill passed overwhelmingly with 199 votes in its favor, 74 votes against it, and 27 abstentions. After the vote, Greece's coalition government expelled 43 members of parliament from its ranks for voting against the cuts. Members of parliament also voted affirmatively to give Prime Minister Papademos' interim government authority to sign a new loan agreement with foreign lenders, and to forge debt write off deal with private banks.</p><p>But outside the parliament in Syntagma Square -- the center of Athens -- tear gas filled the air as security forces tried to disperse angry crowds. In the streets of Athens, the city was literally ablaze as rioters and protesters set fire to buildings to register their outrage. Among the facilities set on fire were cafes, theaters, banks, and historic buildings -- all necessary interests in a country reliant on tourism for revenue. The irony seemed lost of demonstrators who were intent only on expressing their rage at the situation. Left unstated, however, was the fact that Greece has had a long history of tax evasion -- a phenomenon that led to the fact that there has been insufficient means to fund the very social welfare programs and benefits that the citizenry wants to preserve.</p><p>In an interview with Reuters, Costis Hatzidakis, a conservative member of parliament, called on his fellow legislators to stand strong in favor of the austerity and reform package saying, \"We are facing destruction. Our country, our home, has become ripe for burning, the center of Athens is in flames. We cannot allow populism to burn our country down.\"</p><p>On Feb. 18, 2012, the Greek cabinet approved the final austerity package, which aimed to secure further international financing. Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos -- speaking during the extraordinary meeting of the cabinet -- expressed confidence for a positive outcome. As before, Greek activists took to the streets and rallies in front of parliament and at Syntagma Square to register their opposition to the austerity and reform agenda, which they argued has placed an undue burden on the shoulders of the poor and the working class of the country.</p><p>The Rescue Deal</p><p>A meeting of the finance ministers of the euro zone took place on Feb. 20, 2012; participants there would decide whether or not to approve the funding needed for Greece to avoid bankruptcy. Reports were emerging that some euro zone finance ministers needed further assurances of Greece's commitment to actually implementing all necessary measures. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro group, called for further oversight regarding Greece's implementation of its austerity plans. That spirit of skepticism left the likely outcome of the meeting very much in doubt.</p><p>Late into the night, euro zone finance ministers were holding talks aimed at securing rescue funds for Greece. Early on Feb. 21, 2012, Reuters reported that an agreement had been forged on a 130 billion euro rescue package, and a 121 percent debt to GDP ratio; the deal also included strict conditions and aimed to avert imminent Greek bankruptcy. Still, many economists argued that the deal might serve only to delay default, with recovery of the Greek economy expected to take up to a decade to accomplish.</p><p>According to Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, the deal meant that his country would avoid a nightmare scenario. He also cast the agreement as the most important in Greece's post-war history. Venizelos additionally urged the rest of cabinet to find ways to implement the measures mandated by international lenders, such as further massive cuts and increased monitoring by the euro zone.</p><p>Since Greece has already been subject to harsh austerity measures due to the previous bailout or rescue package, many in the citizenry were in no mood for further hardship. Not surprisingly, unions were calling for more strikes and other such protest actions.</p><p>On Feb. 29, 2012, the Greek parliament passed a fresh package of spending cuts intended to secure the release of the aforementioned rescue funds, and avoid bankruptcy. The measures -- valued at 3.2 billion euros -- were part of the action plan required by international creditors and suggested by the Greek finance minister, in order to secure the release of the vital rescue package.</p><p>Given the reality of further austerity measures, protesters again took to the streets. The latest round of mass action was organized by Greek labor unions demanding \"employment and social justice.\" Included in the demonstrations and strikes were doctors and nurses from public hospitals protesting the cutbacks on health care and prescribed medicines to slash deficits. They argued that these moves would create risks for patients and consign medical personnel to poverty. They were joined by pharmacists protesting an extension on the working hours, as well as public servants outraged over supplementary spending cuts. Meanwhile, the umbrella trade union of civil servants and private sector employees closed ranks to protest the reduction of the minimum wage in the private sector, which the Greek government said would spur competitiveness and growth. Not to be left out, lawyers, civil engineers, and other professionals participated in a protest facing the Greek Finance Ministry.</p><p>As the first week of March 2012 came to a close, Greek authorities said they were close to forging a debt swap deal with bondholders. Then, on March 12, 2012, Greece said it had forged a debt swap deal with bondholders to avert default. Under the Private Sector Involvement (PSI) scheme sanctioned by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund lenders, old bonds would be exchanged for new ones with lower value, lower interest rates, and extended maturities. The majority of private investors holding bonds gave their assent to the plan. That being said, the collective action clauses (CACs) activated by the Greek government to force losses on reluctant bondholders resulted in further downgrades of Greece's credit ratings by international agencies, which now categorized Greece as being in a state of \"restricted default.\"</p><p>Further Recent Developments:</p><p>On April 5, 2012, a man committed suicide outside the Greek parliament. The 77-year old retired chemist shot himself to death to protest the government's austerity measures, which included cutting his pension. According to Greek media, a suicide note was found in which the man accused the government of reducing his pension to nothing. As reported by the Athens News, the suicide note read as follows: \"The government has annihilated all traces for my survival, which was based on a very dignified pension that I alone paid for 35 years with no help from the state. And since my advanced age does not allow me a way of dynamically reacting... I see no other solution than this dignified end to my life, so I don't find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance.\"</p><p>Flowers were laid in remembrance of the man at the spot where he died, along with notes reading messages such as \"Enough is enough\" and \"Who will be next?\" Meanwhile, enraged Greek protesters took to the streets of the Greek capital city of Athens to register their horror. Violence erupted as the protesters hurled rocks and petrol bombs at the riot police, who used tear gas to disperse the angry crowds.</p><p>With the capital city in a state of uproar, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos issued a statement. He said, \"In these difficult hours for our society we must all -- the state and the citizens -- support the people among us who are desperate.\" Evangelos Venizelos, of the socialist Pasok party that holds a majority in the coalition government, called on colleagues to refrain from \"political commentary\" and \"show solidarity and togetherness.\" Antonis Samaras, the head of the conservative New Democracy party, said politicians had to do more to \"help Greeks escape from despair.\"</p><p>According to a report in Reuters, suicides have increased by 18 percent in Greece in 2010 from the previous year; in Athens alone, the rate of suicide rose 25 percent over 2011 rates.</p><p>Primer on 2012 Elections in Greece:</p><p>Summary --</p><p>Elections were held in Greece on May 6, 2012. That vote yielded inconclusive results, with no one party gaining a majority or able to form a viable government coalition, despite three successive attempts at achieving that end. Accordingly, a new \"re-run\" election was set for June 17, 2012. At stake in the parliamentary elections of Greece would be the 300 seats of the unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" (Parliament).</p><p>Background --</p><p>An ongoing debt crisis has plagued Greece, leading to the need for a rescue plan from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default. Despite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, though, the European Union has not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package.</p><p>To that end, in late October 2011, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou initially advanced the idea of a national referendum aimed at ratifying the debt relief plan. However, with the angry and outraged Greek citizenry unlikely to ratify the plan, the prime minister ultimately withdrew the referendum idea. Prime Minister Papandreou soon resigned from office, as demanded by the opposition, making way for the formation of a national unity government.</p><p>At the start of November 2011, the office of the Greek Presidency announced that a new coalition government had been formed. Once a new prime minister was named, President Papoulias would prevail on all parties to join the new government. Ultimately, it was former Deputy President of the European Central Bank Lukas Papademos who was tapped to be the interim leader of the new transitional Greek administration. With academic gravitas as an economist who has written extensively about the debt crisis as well as macroeconomic theory, the structure and functioning of financial markets, monetary analysis and policy, economic performance, financial stability, and economic policy in the European Union, Papademos was regarded as a credible choice to guide the interim \"national salvation\" government. Papademos' background at the helm of the European Central Bank augured the possibility of a cooperative relationship with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during this time of crisis.</p><p>It was hoped that the concurrence on the new interim government would bring an end to the climate of turmoil and uncertainty gripping Greece and the overall euro zone. As noted above, the new government would be tasked with implementing the full slate of required procedures needed to stabilize the Greek economy. It would also have to facilitate the release of the next installment of European Union/International Monetary Fund loan funds, including the passage of legislation associated with the rescue package. Before that could take place, Greece would have to have its economic affairs in order since the country would run out of money by December 2011, thus risking default. All eyes were on the spring of 2012 for a likely election timetable.</p><p>Pre-election developments (ahead of the May 2012 vote) --</p><p>On March 19, 2012, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos resigned from his cabinet post to take over the leadership of the ruling Greece's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in its campaign for the general elections to be held in late April or early May 2012. Outgoing PASOK President George Papandreou expressed hope for a new beginning, saying: \"This is a new start for both of us ... We will continue to work together for the sake of the country.\"</p><p>It should be noted that the major parties participating in the ruling coalition posted dismal approval ratings ahead of the elections, but all expectations were that the new government would also involve a coalition of various parties.</p><p>As March 2012 came to a close, polling data from the Kathimerini newspaper showed the conservative New Democracy party, which supports the outgoing technocratic government as well as its harsh austerity and structural reform measures, in the lead with 22.5 percent. The socialist PASOK, which was also in the outgoing coalition, followed in second place with 15.5 percent of the vote. The communists and the leftist SYRIZA were posting about 12 percent of support respectively, while the newly-formed Democratic Left, Independent Greeks, the Greek Ecologist Greens, and the far-right neo-Nazi \"Golden Dawn\" were all trailing behind, but still expected to gain parliamentary representation.</p><p>Together, the two main parties -- the conservative New Democracy party and the socialist PASOK -- could collectively secure enough votes to meet the 38 percent threshold required to obtain a parliamentary majority, thus ratifying their coalition for a new term in office. Still, a larger contingent of voters -- 48 percent -- would prefer a left-wing coalition that would oppose the austerity and structural reform agenda.</p><p>Note that in April 2012, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced that elections would be held on May 6, 2012, and called on President Karolos Papoulias to dissolve parliament. With his technocratic government set to end, Prime Minister Papademos said he believed his government left behind \"an important legacy.\" He also urged cabinet ministers and political parties to prevail in their efforts to overcome the debt crisis, and cautioned that any future administration would \"have to make decisions promptly in order to complete the efforts to revive our economy.\"</p><p>Greece's two main parties -- the conservative New Democracy party and the socialist PASOK -- were expected to capture the lion's share of the vote. The main question was whether the two parties -- which support the reform agenda -- could garner the 38 percent threshold necessary to secure a majority in the 300-member parliamentary chamber. There was also some indication that left-wing and right-wing parties, which have been opposed to the unpopular austerity measures associated with the bailout funds, could make significant gains. The leftist SYRIZA coalition, the Democratic Left, the Greek Communist Party, the new Rightist Independent Greeks, and the far-right Golden Dawn could well post historic performances at the polls, given the Greek public's outrage over the austerity programs being put into place. Of course, electoral success for anti-austerity parties could threaten the rescue funding structure currently in place, risk disorderly default for Greece, and thus imperil the entire euro zone.</p><p>In the week ahead of the vote, PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos promised to lead the country out of its debt crisis by 2015 if the party was elected in the upcoming elections. Antonis Samaras, the head of the conservative New Democracy (ND), made the same election promise. Polling data at the close of April 2012 gave Samaras and the ND the edge, although neither party was likely to have enough seats to command a parliamentary majority. Accordingly, a new coalition was likely in the offing.</p><p>Results of the May 2012 election --</p><p>As the votes were being counted, it was clear that the two main governing parties of Greece were suffering significant losses. Samaras' conservative New Democracy party was leading the country's general elections by a narrow margin with 19 percent of vote share. Center-left PASOK had slipped to third place with just over 13 percent. Left-wing SYRIZA was boosted to second place with close to 17 percent. The right-wing Independent Greeks secured ten percent while the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn managed to garner seven percent and could be positioned to enter parliament for the first time.</p><p>The result suggested that the coalition -- composed of New Democracy and PASOK, which formed the outgoing pro-austerity and reform government -- would not command a majority in parliament. The result also showed the ascendancy of SYRIZA , which has argued vociferously against austerity and reform. Indeed, this result for SYRIZA and even Golden Dawn was illustrative of the impassioned anger by the Greek people against the harsh measures, which were imposed in conjunction with the international rescue packages, in order to prevent Greece from defaulting on its debt.</p><p>Government Formation --</p><p>Having won the plurality of the vote share, Samaras and New Democracy would have the first opportunity to try to form a government. To that end, Samaras said he would form a national salvation government, aimed at keeping Greece in the euro zone. He also said he would try to \"amend\" Greece's bailout agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in order to increase economic growth. But if Samaras failed to be able to form a government after a three-day period, then SYRIZA would have three days to form a coalition government. To that end, SYRIZA leader, Alexis Tsipras, said he wanted to form a left-wing coalition that would set aside arrangements related to the Greek bailout scheme. Tspiras said the vote made clear that the Greek party had rejected the path of rescue plans and reform. He explained, \"The parties that signed the memorandum (with the EU and the IMF) are now a minority. The public verdict has de-legitimized them.\" PASOK would have its own chance to form a government if Syria\u2019s effort ended in failure after three days. For his part, Venizelos called for a broad coalition or unity government including pro-European parties.</p><p>The government formation process promised to be difficult since New Democracy and PASOK would likely search for pro-euro zone partners, and those options were limited. Meanwhile, the likes of SYRIZA sought to step away from the euro zone-endorsed rescue package and reforms -- stances that both New Democracy and PASOK do not support. Thus, the path toward a viable new coalition was limited. Should all of the three successive efforts toward government formation fail, then Greeks would have to return to the polls in another election. In this way, the scene in Greece after the May 6, 2012, was one of turmoil and turbulence. Indeed, without a stable government willing to adhere to the arrangement forged with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, Greece would not have access to rescue funds. This would return Greece to its prevailing risk of defaulting and possibly exiting the euro zone.</p><p>Note that on May 7, 2012, after one day of serious government formation negotiations, Samaras, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, said he was not able to forge a workable coalition and that he returned the government formation mandate to President Karolos Papoulias. \"We did everything we could,\" said Samaras. \"It was impossible. I handed back the mandate.\" Although parties actually have three days to try to form a government, Samaras said he did not want to waste any time, given the dire situation for Greece.</p><p>The leftist bloc, SYRIZA , would now be charged with the mandate of trying to form a ruling coalition. Speaking of his task, SYRIZA leader Tsipras said: \"We will exhaust all possibilities to reach an understanding, primarily with the forces of the left.\" But Tsipras then followed in the footsteps of New Democracy and failed to form a ruling coalition. For the SYRIZA leader, it was imperative that his party not compromise its anti-austerity stance. \"The bailout austerity has already been denounced by the Greek people with its vote, and no government has the right to enforce it,\" Tsipras said.</p><p>The charge for forging a workable coalition then fell on the Socialist leader, Venizelos. That effort likewise resulted in a similar manner. PASOK was able to close ranks with New Democracy but unable to find a third coalition partner. Accordingly, Venizelos formally returned the mandate to the president.</p><p>Such an end had been highly anticipated as the combination of seats for certain parties with corresponding ideologies simply did not add up to a workable result. Stated in plain terms, SYRIZA had firmly rejected the terms of the EU-IMF bailout plan, which required the implementation of harsh austerity measures and structural reforms in return for loan funding. Without the participation of SYRIZA , however, it was unlikely any coalition could be forged. Meanwhile, as explained here, SYRIZA was itself unable to form a workable alliance without one of the two pro-bailout parties -- New Democracy and PASOK. The result was a political impasse.</p><p>President Karolos Papoulias convened emergency meetings on May 13, 2012, with an eye on forming some sort of unity government, of a technocratic variety. The president invited the three largest parties -- center-right New Democracy, socialist PASOK, and the far-left bloc SYRIZA -- for talks. That move was not welcomed by the Greek populace who did not look kindly on the outgoing technocratic government of Papademos; they viewed it as not democratically-elected and responsible for ushering in the dark age of structural economic reform. Ultimately, with the parties divided over the key issue of austerity, the last-ditch effort by the president to form a unity technocratic government ended in failure. Indeed, SYRIZA reiterated its uncompromising stance that it would not join any ruling coalition that instituted further cuts or harsh measures.</p><p>Future Course --</p><p>As of mid-May 2012, with efforts at either forming a governing coalition or a new technocratic government ending without resolution, Greek voters would be returning to the polls, possibly as soon as June 2012. There were strong indications that a new vote could end with SYRIZA winning a plurality of the vote share, possible paving the way for a government willing to walk away from the aforementioned EU-IMF bailout plan.</p><p>Of course, such a course would augur default, act as a catalyst for the possible exit of Greece from the euro zone, and facilitate a return to the drachma. The consequences for Greece -- and Europe at large -- could be dire, as predicted by Germany. The head of Germany's central bank, Jens Weidmann, offered this warning: \"For Greece the consequences would be much more grave than for the rest of the euro zone.\" He continued, \"If Athens does not stand by its word, then that's a democratic decision. The result is that there is no more basis for further financial aid.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, credits ratings agencies were predicting that Greece's exit from the euro zone would affect all the remaining euro zone countries. Specifically, the Fitch ratings agency warned that if Greece abandoned the euro, not only would Greece would be deleteriously affected, but all the sovereign ratings of all the 16 remaining euro zone countries would be placed on negative watch in anticipation of a downgrade.</p><p>Ratings aside, the exit of Greece from the euro zone would also be a blow to the entire framework of Europe's monetary union. Although Jean-Claude Juncker -- the prime minister of Luxembourg and the head of the euro zone -- dismissed the notion of Greece's withdrawal from the bloc as \"nonsense,\" the fact that such a prospect was now being openly debated in Europe illuminated the tumultuous landscape.</p><p>According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, fear and doubt about the economic landscape in Greece led to the withdrawal of nearly $900 million from local banks by Greek depositors on May 14, 2012, alone. The withdrawal of funds was confirmed by President Papoulias who said the withdrawals, in conjunction with \"buy orders\" received by Greek banks for German bonds, placed Greece's lenders in a difficult position and that the banks were \"very weak right now.\" $900 million in one day was clearly a concerning event since outflows in the last two years have amounted to between one and two billion on a monthly basis.</p><p>A \"re-run\" election in June 2012 --</p><p>A caretaker government was formed on May 16, 2012, with elections set to be held in mid-June 2012. Panayiotis Pikramenos, the head of one of Greece's high courts, was named to head Greece's caretaker government ahead of the next elections to be held on June 17, 2012.</p><p>There were serious anxieties that the second elections in the span of a month would, likewise, yield an inconclusive result. Indeed, another divided parliament would do little to resolve the state of impasse in the country as it wrestles with its debt crisis. There was an additional dimension to these anxieties from among some national and international factions that leftist parties could eke control of parliament. Such an end would serve a decisive death knell to the austerity and reform agenda required by the EU and IMF rescue funding deal, and could well spell catastrophic default for Greece.</p><p>Polling data in mid-May 2012 showed that the conservative pro-reform agenda New Democracy was on track to win the most votes. PASOK (also pro-reform despite its Socialist leanings) was expected to post another third-place finish after SYRIZA. This time, though, the two parties in favor of the rescue and reform agenda were expected to have enough seats to form a government, effectively avoiding the impasse of the previous elections. This polling result was a shift from polling data the previous week that showed SYRIZA poised to win the elections. It would seem that after having vented their anger against the establishment parties in the May 2012 elections, voters were slowly coming to the realization that the stakes were high.</p><p>Meanwhile, news emerged that New Democracy would forge an agreement with the other conservative party, the Democratic Alliance, to come together for the June 17, 2012, polls and foreclose vote splitting. This agreement between New Democracy and Democratic Alliance would open the door for a wide alliance of pro-European, pro-reform agenda, parties to form a government.</p><p>SYRIZA party leader Tsipras insisted that the terms of the bailout would have to be replaced, and that his party was confident that new terms could be negotiated with international lenders. Explaining his approach as follows: \"We will not go to the table of dialogue aggressively,\" Tsipras was quite sure that SYRIZA could convince international lenders that austerity in return of the two rescue packages would be catastrophic for Greece's economy, and therefore, they would be amenable to the notion of a new deal that would yet furnish necessary rescue funds. Tsipras was undaunted by the prospect of lenders halting the disbursement of further loans to Greece, and dismissed the notion that a chaotic default on the part of Greece would end its that country's exit from the euro zone. In regards to SYRIZA's participation in a future Greek government, Tsipras expected to lead that government, which he said would consist of a \"left-wing coalition\" and would include the Greek Communists and the Democratic Left.</p><p>The Socialists (PASOK) and the Democratic Left were offering similar political agendas, with an eye on the necessary formation of a government of \"shared national responsibility\" after the June 2012 general elections. Both parties appeared to concur that Greece could not be governed by slim majorities during its time of need. As noted by PASOK leader Venizelos at the start of June 2012, a weak government would not be able to push through important reform measures required to solve Greece's debt crisis. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis called for a \"progressive unity government.\" He threaded the political needle carefully as he argued that while Greece could not afford to go down the path of exclusive austerity, he nonetheless rejected the idea of annulling already-established rescue deals and risking default. In this way, Kouvelis was taking quite a different position as compared with SYRIZA leader Tsipras, who has advocated the path of annulment.</p><p>It should be noted that SYRIZA leader Tsipras was winning the rhetorical contest and effectively shifting the debate. As noted just above, Tsipras has consistently asserted that should he win the election and lead a future Greek government, Greece would walk away from the prevailing international agreements concerning billions of dollars in bailout assistance and their associated harsh mandates for the budget, including the abolition of collective bargaining and the reduction of the minimum wage. He has also said that he would suspend the repayment of international loans until Greece, which has suffered from a continuing recession, sees economic growth. Now, ahead of the repeat elections, even the leaders of the two main reformist and pro-rescue package parties, New Democracy and Socialist PASOK, were moving a bit away from the singular pro-austerity agenda, and towards the notion that the rescue deals should -- at least -- be renegotiated on less harsh terms.</p><p>Note that at the start of June 2012, the final set of pre-election polls ahead of the repeat elections showed a tight race between leftist SYRIZA and the center-right New Democracy party. Two of three polls showed the two parties essentially tied, while the third poll showed SYRIZA holding 32 percent over New Democracy with 26 percent. It should be noted that Greece suspends election polling in the two weeks prior to election day, so these results offered the final pre-election picture.</p><p>As the first week of June 2012 came to a close, the drama of the political contest in Greece reached new heights when a member of parliament from the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, Ilias Kasidiaris, was caught on a televised broadcast assaulting a female SYRIZA politician, Rena Dourou, with a glass of water, and then slapping another female left-wing politician, Liana Kanelli of the Communist Party. Although an arrest warrant was issued for Kasidiaris, the Golden Dawn member of parliament placed the blame for the incident on the two female politicians, saying that they provoked him by bringing up his alleged involvement in a 2007 armed robbery case. He also promised to sue them. The wider Greek public appeared shocked by the display and took to the streets on June 8, 2012, in massive protests against Golden Dawn and neo-Nazis. The rallies were organized by left-wing and anti-racism groups in Athens and were attended by thousands of people.</p><p>June Elections</p><p>On June 17, 2012, Greeks returned to the polls to cast their ballots in the second general elections in a month in a renewed attempt to form a government. Exit polls indicated the elections would be a close contest but with the center-right New Democracy in a narrow lead ahead of the leftist SYRIZA, and with the socialist PASOK in third place. With the lion's share of the ballots counted, the Greek Interior Ministry said that New Democracy secured close to 30 percent and was on track to carry as many as 130 seats in the 300-seat parliament; SYRIZA garnered 26.7 percent and was likely to control between 71 and seats; PASOK acquired 12.5 percent and was estimated to win about 33 seats. Several smaller anti-bailout parties were expected to win between 13 and 21 seats; these parties included the Independent Greeks, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, the Democratic Left, and the Communists.</p><p>Accordingly, SYRIZA leader, Tsipras, reportedly telephoned the New Democracy leader, Samaras, to concede the elections and offer congratulations. Given these results, Samaras, at the helm of his New Democracy Party, was expected to commence coalition talks on June 18, 2012. Samaras urged all the major political parties to close ranks and form a national salvation government. Since his financial plan for the country going forward would entail spending cuts and the implementation of other reform measures as required by international creditors he would have to find coalition partners with compatible goals. Such goals clearly ran counter to the position of SYRIZA, which has made clear that it would stand against austerity measures demanded as part of the existing rescue deal. A future coalition led by New Democracy, therefore, was unlikely to include SYRIZA. More likely was the possibility that New Democracy, boosted by an additional 50 parliamentary seats as the winning party, would be able to form a majority coalition with PASOK.</p><p>For Samaras, the election result was a ratification of Greece's continued presence in the euro zone. To this end, he said, \"The Greek people voted today to stay on the European course and remain in the euro zone.\" Samaras promised that his country would \"honor its obligations.\" He also said, \"There will be no more adventures. Greece's place in Europe will not be put in doubt. Samaras continued by noting that the flirtation with default, an exit from the euro bloc, and a return to the drachma -- a possible outcome if SYRIZA had won the election -- was now over.</p><p>To be sure, the election result was likely to calm some of the global fears about a SYRIZA victory and a concomitant Greek exit from the euro zone. It was likely to quell speculation for the immediate future about debt default contagion spreading through the European bloc and adding to the sense of turmoil brewing at the international level. In Greece, however, the public's sense of discontent over the austerity conditions would presumably continue, along with anxieties about the future of the country. In a bid to address these anxieties, Samaras promised light at the end of the proverbial dark tunnel, saying, \"The sacrifices of the Greek people will bring the country back to prosperity.\"</p><p>New Government for Greece</p><p>As attention turned towards the government formation process, the question arose as to whether or not a national salvation government -- composed of as many parties as possible -- would be possible. But such an end was not to happen as SYRIZA made it clear that it would neither join such a government. Indeed, SYRIZA leader, Tsipras, rejected a proposal from Samaras and New Democracy to join a coalition government. For his part, Tsipras indicated that his party's role was to operate as the official opposition saying, \"The main opposition party's role is to be critical and responsible. We will do just that.\"</p><p>By June 20, 2012, three parties were able to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Greek government. As the winner of the June 17, 2012 elections, the main coalition partner would be center-right New Democracy, while the Socialists, PASOK, as well as Democratic Left, would participate in the new government. Speaking of the need to establish a stable Greek administration as soon as possible, and to deal with the political and economic challenges facing the country, Evangelos Venizelos of PASOK said: \"Greece has a government ... that is the message that we need to send abroad.\"</p><p>Note that on that day -- June 20, 2012 -- Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party, was to be sworn in as Greece's new prime minister at a brief ceremony at the presidential palace in Athens, presided over by the archbishop of Greece. After being sworn in as the new Greek head of government, Prime Minister Samaras said that he would demand \"hard work\" from the new government\" and that he intended to \"give hope\" to the Greek people.</p><p>Of course, for the Greek people, they were looking for relief from the harsh terms of the rescue package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). To that end, the new government would seek to renegotiate the bail out agreement. As noted by Fotis Kouvelis, the leader of the</p><p>Democratic Left, he wanted to see the country \"released\" from the \"painful terms\" of the bail out deal. One provision sought by the new coalition government was a change in the schedule for austerity cuts to be spread over four years rather than two years, as currently outlined.</p><p>In truth, however, there was probably limited room for the new Greek government to negotiate a more pleasing agreement. While leaders in Europe were undoubtedly relieved that the political crisis in Greece had abated and there was a reasonably coalition government with which to talk, they were unlikely to offer much flexibility. Germany was certainly making it clear that few concessions were in the offing. As stated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, \"Elections cannot call into question the commitments Greece made. We cannot compromise on the reform steps we agreed.\"</p><p>Update (2012/2013):</p><p>In the fall of 2012, trade unions launched a general strike to register opposition and outrage against the government's stringent austerity measures. The strike attracted the participation of anarchists who gathered outside the parliament, thus compelling security forces to use tear gas to disperse the crowds.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Greek government was crafting the budget for 2013, which was intended to confront the reality that the Greek economy would be subject to further economic contraction as well as a continuing heavy debt burden. Recently-elected Prime Minister Samaras warned the country that his government's coffers would be empty by the end of November 2012 without the infusion of funds -- presumably via international aid.</p><p>With an eye on securing further installments of rescue loans from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, the Greek government passed a 13.5bn-euro austerity plan. The budget provisions included increases to taxes along with cuts to pensions. Not surprisingly, union organizations reacted with ire to these measures.</p><p>Nevertheless, the budget plan achieved its objective as the European Union and the International Monetary Fund agreed to release its latest installment of rescue loans by the end of 2012. The move also achieved the end of preventing Greece from leaving the euro zone.</p><p>Note that as of January 2013, Greece's unemployment rate had increased to 26.8% -- the highest figure recorded in the European Union (EU). Indeed, Greece had the dubious distinction of being the country with the highest unemployment rate in Europe.</p><p>On June 21, 2013, the Democratic Left Party -- a participant in the ruling coalition in Greece -- said it was withdrawing from the government amidst disagreements over the shutdown of the state broadcasting service, ERT. At issue was accusation Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' accusation that ERT suffered from a lack of transparency. Accordingly, ERT transmissions were shut down on June 11, 2013. Efforts to forge an agreement leading to the resumption of broadcasts ended in failure. For its part, Democratic Left criticized the prime minister's handling of the situation, and more importantly, the fact that he did not consult with his coalition partners before making the decision.</p><p>It should be noted that the ruling coalition came to power after the last elections in mid-2012 and was composed of the center-right New Democracy, the Socialists (PASOK), as well as Democratic Left. The coalition government was intended to be a representative and unifying force for Greece, which has been embroiled in a debt crisis in recent years. The loss of any party effectively weakened the coalition government in a country beset by political instability and eager for unity as the government makes difficult decisions aimed at addressing Greece's crushing debt crisis.</p><p>On July 17, 2013, protesters in Greece took to the streets of Athens to rally against a public sector reform bill that would lead to massive job cuts. Under the provisions of the legislation, as many as 4,000 government employees, including teachers, would lose their jobs in 2013. By the end of the year, another 25,000 government employees would be placed in \"mobility pool\" by the end of the year. Those employees in the mobility pool would garner only 75 percent of their salaries for an eight-month period in which they would be expected to seek redeployment; at the end of that period, if they were unable to secure transfers to other government departments, their jobs would be declared redundant and they would thus be unemployed. In a country with an unemployment rate of 27 percent, the path of further joblessness was not welcomed by the people.</p><p>Regardless of the unpopularity of the bill -- especially among public sector employees -- it was regarded by Greek politicians as a necessary measure intended to secure a fresh tranche of bailout funding. As such, the bill was passed with 153 affirmative votes to 140 negative votes in the Greek parliament, with conservative Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras saying that there was no option but to move forward with the painful legislation, in the interests of keeping Greece financially afloat. Previous austerity measures included reductions of public sector salaries and pension cuts. Yet despite this constellation of austerity measures, the fact of the matter was that Greece's debt has continued to be alarmingly high.</p><p>Editor's Note:</p><p>An ongoing GDP-debt crisis has plagued Greece in recent years. Greece's burdensome debt resulted in the need for a rescue plan from the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default. Despite agreeing to the debt relief (or \"bailout\") package, the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund have not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package. But those very austerity measures -- while deemed vital by international lenders in order to release bailout funds to Greece -- have been rejected and condemned by the Greek public.</p><p>Special Entry</p><p>Political turmoil in Greece involves relations with far-right elements and threat of extremism</p><p>In January 2014, two members of parliament from the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party were arrested and jailed pending trial on charges of belonging to a criminal organization. The two individuals placed under arrest -- Panagiotis Iliopoulos and Yorgos Germenis -- denied the charges against them and emphasized the legitimacy of his party's political</p><p>On the other side of the equation, Greek prosecutors have long argued that they possess evidence connecting Golden Dawn to several acts of violence, including the murder of a Greek rapper in 2013. To that end, they have been carrying out a crackdown against the new-Nazi far-right group. The arrests and detainment of Iliopoulos and Germenis were the latest manifestations of that crackdown.</p><p>Going back to September 2013, several far-right members of the Greek parliament were arrested as part of a government crackdown on extremism. Among those taken into custody at the time was Nikos Mihallkiakos, the leader of the neo-fascist party, Golden Dawn. The offices of Golden Dawn were raided, while Mihallkiakos was arrested and charged with forming a criminal organization. Soon thereafter, the party's deputy leader, Christos Pappas, was also taken into custody. Several other members of parliament also faced the same fate.</p><p>The arrests of Mihallkiakos, Papas, and other Golden Dawn members occurred only weeks after a man claiming to be a supporter of Golden Dawn allegedly murdered a Greek rapper, known as \"Killah P,\" whose music protested the rise of fascism in Greece.</p><p>In another case in September 2013, 50 Golden Dawn members wielding crowbars violently attacking members of the Communist Party as they distributed posters in a working-class district of Athens. That incident left nine people hospitalized with grave injuries. The Communist Party of Greece released a statement in regard to the attack that read as follows: \"The way in which they [the attackers] acted and the weapons employed \u2026 are evidence of the murderous nature of the attack. Among the Golden Dawners, some of whom had covered their faces or wore helmets or [party] shirts, were their leaders, well-known fascists and thugs.\"</p><p>Muslims and Jews were not exempt from the apparent campaign of extremism and hatred. On the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, Golden Dawn posted an anti-Semetic message on its website in which it claimed \"world Zionism\" was the \"architect of global terrorism.\" Meanwhile, the Muslim Association of Greece was gifted with a letter in which members were told they would be \"slaughtered like chickens\" unless they left Greece.</p><p>The murder of Killah D, the violent attacks on the Communists, and the hate-filled diatribes against Muslims and Jews sparked mass protests across Greece and may have contributed to the government's decision to take action.</p><p>For its part, the government of Greece has said that the arrests of the Golden Dawn members of parliament were part of its decision to push back against extremism -- with particular attention to the rise of neo-Nazism in Greece. The government also said that it had commenced an investigation into whether or not whether extremists associated with Golden Dawn had infiltrated the country's police and military forces. Prime Minister made it clear that Golden Dawn would not be allowed to \"undermine\" democracy and he emphasized the government's stance that the neo-fascist party should be treated as a \"criminal organization.\" In response, Golden Dawn railed against the arrests of its leaders, and urged supporters to back its \"just struggle against the corrupt system.\"</p><p>On Nov. 1, 2013, a shooting outside the office of the neo-Nazi and far-right Golden Dawn political party in Greek capital city of Athens left two party members dead and a third individual wounded.</p><p>According to accounts from Golden Dawn members of Parliament as reported by the Athens-Macedonian News Agency, two assailants on a motorcycle approached the party's office in the northern suburb of Neo Iraklio and opened fire with a rifle before escaping the scene. The party official claimed that the assailants \"literally emptied their guns\" on the victims, ensuring their deaths. In their post-crime investigation, police were able to recover the motorcycle believed to have been stolen and used in the attack.</p><p>While no Greek official was willing to suggest that the killings were political, it was certainly true that in 2013, politics in Greece have been dominated by acrimonious relations between the government and Golden Dawn.</p><p>In November 2013, in the aftermath of the attack on the Golden Dawn office and the deaths of two party members, it was possible that certain factions of Greek society were carrying out revenge attacks against the neo-fascist party. The Greek government was making it clear that such actions were not welcomed and would only lead the country into the realm of lawlessness. Nikos Dendias, the Greek cabinet minister responsibility for domestic security and order, said that the government would \"not allow the country to become an arena for scores to be settled, for whatever reason.\" Dendias was clearly referencing recent events involving Golden Dawn.</p><p>In the second week of January 2014, two members of parliament from the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party were arrested and jailed pending trial on charges of belonging to a criminal organization. The two individuals placed under arrest -- Panagiotis Iliopoulos and Yorgos Germenis -- denied the charges against them. For his part, Iliopoulos insisted that they were innocent and emphasized the legitimacy of his party's political cause. In front of the media and amidst far-right supporters, he declared: \"Golden Dawn is a legitimate political party taking on a sincere political struggle. We will not buckle. Golden Dawn will be victorious - Greece will be victorious.\"</p><p>It should be noted that Golden Dawn has won representation in parliament, with 18 members holding seats in the legislative chamber. Indeed, the party has enough support, irrespective of its neo-fascist tendencies, to claim being the third most popular party in Greece. While Golden Dawn itself denied being a neo-Nazi organization, its members tend to have pro-Hitler orientations, with Golden Dawn members notorious for participating in Nazi-style salutes, and the group's emblem is reminiscent of the Nazi swastika.</p><p>Human rights groups have warned that Golden Dawn has a record of terrorizing immigrants and political opponents, while Greek police have allowed them to do so with impunity. In fact, as indicated by the aforementioned investigation, there were suggestions that extremist members of the Golden Dawn had infiltrated the security forces. Those suggestions were somewhat backed by news reports in Greece detailing the suspension of several police officers who were believed to be associates of Golden Dawn, as well as the arrest of a police officer who was working as a bodyguard for Golden Dawn itself.</p><p>Presidential Election of 2014</p><p>A presidential election was set to be held in Greece in December 2014. A first round would be held on Dec. 1, 2014, with a second round on Dec 23, 2014, and a third round on Dec. 29, 2014. The elections were not expected to be held until the spring of 2014; however, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos called for the vote to be moved forward. They were looking for an ally to occupy the office of the presidency in Greece, which has been in the throes of a debt crisis in recent years. At issue was an impending debt bailout package review and plans for a negotiated exit from that regime.</p><p>Stavros Dimas, the preferred candidate of the ruling New Democracy\u2013PASOK coalition, for the presidency, was being backed by the prime minister. Dimas' main competition would come from Alexis Tsipras, the candidate of the opposition and anti-bailout party, Syriza. Indeed, with polling data indicating that Syriza, was more popular with the people of Greece that Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy, it was quite possible that this dynamic would play out in the presidential race to Tsipras' benefit and to Dimas' detriment. A survey by GPO for MEGA TV showed support for Syriza at 28 percent while only 23 percent favored New Democracy. PASOK, which was in coaliton with New Democracy had five percent. Still, it was difficult to offer reliable prognostications since as many as 15 percent of Greeks remained undecided.</p><p>Of course, the presidential vote would ensue internally within parliament. But should New Democracy and Prime Minister Samaras fail to see their candidate, Dimas, elected as president by the third round of voting, it was quite likely that snap parliamentary elections would be triggered as a result.</p><p>On Dec. 17, 2014, the first round of voting ended inconclusively with no candidate winning enought votes outright to secure the presidency. With only 160 members of parliament voting for Dimas, 135 against him, and with only five members of the opposition voting with the ruling party, the outcome of Round One was something of an alarm bell for the prime minister ahead of the voting session later in the month.</p><p>Ahead of those subsequent rounds of voting, Prime Minister Samaras suggested that members of parliament discharge their duties seriously, given the stakes. He said, \"Conditions are difficult, Greek lawmakers are aware that the country cannot afford adventures.\" But Alexis Tsipras, the leader and presidential candidate of the opposition and anti-bailout party, Syriza, lauded the poor performance of Dimas in the first round. He noted that the government's \"strategy of fear\" was not working, and added, \"Democracy cannot be blackmailed.\"</p><p>Ultimately, at the end of December 2014 in the third and final round of voting, those aforementioned alarm bells turned out to be prescient. The parliament rejected Dimas -- Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's nominee for president. Indeed, Dimas fell short of the 180 votes in parliament needed to secure the presidency. The defeat of Dimas effectively triggered snap parliamentary elections, which were now set for Jan. 25, 2015.</p><p>Note on Feb. 18, 2015, a new president was elected to a five year term by the parliament. The winner of the presidential election was Prokopios Pavlopoulos.</p><p>Parliamentary Elections of 2015</p><p>Parliamentary elections were set to be held in Greece on Jan. 25, 2015. A presidential election had been held in Greece in December 2014 and ended in the government's failure to elect the prime minster's selection to the post of head of state. This outcome made it clear that the political landscape in Greece was fractious and effectively triggered parliamentary elections to be held at the start of 2015. See discussion of the presidential contest above for details.</p><p>The parliamentary contest -</p><p>At stake in the snap parliamentary elections to be held on Jan. 25, 2015, would be the composition of the unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon.\" That parliamentary body was composed of 300 seats with members elected by a system of reinforced proportional representation from 51 multi-seat constituencies and five single-seat constituencies; there is a three percent threshold to obtain seat and members are elected to serve maximum four-year terms.</p><p>In the previous voting exercise of 2012, there were actually two elections. An initial election was held in Greece on May 6, 2012, but yielded inconclusive results, with no one party gaining a majority or able to form a viable government coalition, despite three successive attempts at achieving that end. Accordingly, a new \"re-run\" election was set for June 17, 2012. At the end of that voting exercise, the center-right New Democracy won the most votes narrowly and formed a coalition government with the Socialists (known by the acronym, PASOK) as well as Democratic Left. The 2012 election result was regarded, at the time, as a ratification of Greece's continued presence in the euro zone, and thus acceptance of the austerity measures needed to guarantee a debt rescue program.</p><p>In 2015, however, the political and economic climate had shifted. While the elections would again be dominated by the debt crisis rocking Greece, the Greek citizenry was now deeply frustrated -- and even angry -- over the austerity terms of a massive bail-out package funded by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union to rescue the country from default. With a review of that package on the horizon, and with hopes for an early exit from the bail-out program looming, the radical leftist Syriza party, which wants to cancel that arrangement, had gained support. Indeed, Syriza was now consistently leading the polls.</p><p>Should Syriza's advantage prevail on election day, Greece could well be positioned to make some radical economic moves, which were sure to send shockwaves through the entire euro zone. For its part, Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy was campaigning on the fact that under its stewardship, Greece had actually turned an economic corner, and were finally posting some growth and had ended a four-year exile from bond markets.</p><p>That argument appeared to hold resonance as in the first week of January 2015, Syriza's polling lead was decreasing and New Democracy was seeing a rebound. The Socialists (PASOK) were trailing far behind -- in fact, behind the far-right xenophobic (regarded as neo-Nazi) Golden Dawn, which was in third place, according to various polling outlets. The Socialists' prospects were not likely to be boosted by an internal split, which was triggered by former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's announcement of a new breakaway party, called \"Movement for Change.\" Since there is a three-point threshold for participation in parliament, if the loyal Socialist voters were split between PASOK and Movement for Change, neither party might end up positioned to participate in parliament.</p><p>In the second week of January 2015, the trend discussed above was holding steady. Syriza had a small but consistent lead of about three percent, according to various polling outlets, over New Democracy.</p><p>In the third week of January 2015, Syriza appeared to be consolidating its advantage with a series of polls showing the anti-bailout party leading Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy party by a margin of at least five percentage points. Of note was the fact that the newly-formed centrist party To Potami (River) had narrowly edged out both the Communists and the far-right xenophobic Golden Dawn to be in third place. Trailing far behind and unlikely to make up enough ground to enter parliament were the Socialists or PASOK (in government with New Democracy) and Movement for Change. Going into the elections, these basic trendlines were holding with Syriza holding a steady and significant lead over the other parties of between five and six percentage points.</p><p>At a final election rally ahead of the vote, Syriza leader, Alexis Tsipras, declared: \"Light has won over darkness. Victory and a majority are within our grasp.\"</p><p>It was to be seen if Syriza's expected victory would come to pass on election day, and if the party would yet gain enough seats to command an outright majority in parliament. Without an outright majority, a governing coalition would have to be formed and it was unclear that Syriza would be the type of entity prepared for compromise.</p><p>On election day on Jan. 25, 2015, Greek voters went to the polls to cast their ballots. After the polling stations closed, the task of counting the ballots commenced. At the time of writing, the results showed a big win for the anti-bailout party, Syriza. In fact, Syriza was holding 36 to 38 percent of the vote share and was on track to win as many as 149 seats -- just two seats short of an absolute majority. The outgoing ruling party, New Democracy, was trailing behind in second place with between 26 and 28 percent. Vying for third place were the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn and the newly-established centrist party, Potami (River). The other parties made up the remainder.</p><p>New Democracy wasted little time in conceding defeat while Syriza said that its victory was \"a return of social dignity and social justice.\" In an interview with Greek media, Syriza spokesperson Panos Skourletis said, \"What's clear is we have a historic victory that sends a message that does not only concern the Greek people, but all European people.\"</p><p>Governance and government formation:</p><p>At the top of the agenda for the new government of Greece would be the matter of attending to the bailout packages. With Greece's arrangement with the euro zone set to expire on Feb. 28, 2015, even with continued support from the International Monetary Fund, Greece would have to be part of a European treaty entity to procure remaining rescue loans and be positioned to receive future support from the European Central Bank. Thus, Greece would essentially have to retain its position as a euro zone country within the European Union. However, Syriza leader, Tsipras, was showing no urgency on the matter of negotiating an agreement to address these collective concerns, insisting that he had at least half a year to negotiate a deal with Greece's creditors.</p><p>Going back to 2010, Greece was in the midst of a debt-to-GDP crisis and at risk of sovereign default. As a result of that crisis, and with the contagion effect on other euro zone countries in the European Union at stake, Greece was the recipient of a rescue package from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). That package was dependent on Greece's agreement to implement austerity measures and other structural reforms, and ultimately repay its bailout funds. These terms have long been regarded as harsh by the Greek citizenry, giving rise to the popularity of Syriza, the anti-bailout party, which emerged as a protest entity to the dictates of the global financial system. Worth noting, however, is the fact that as painful as most countries tend to find austerity measures characteristic of structural adjustment programs, Greece's debt problems have at least partially been due to the fact that a wide swath of the Greek population does not pay its taxes. Without taxes, a country simply does not have sufficient funds in its coffers to service its debts. Also contributing to Greece's debt crisis has been its bloated public sector -- an area targeted for reform to the great consternation of Greeks.</p><p>But for the incoming leader of Greece, the focus was not so much on continuing the work of the previous New Democracy government and reforming the economy; instead, it was on delivering a message of defiance to Greece's creditors. The keystone of Alex Tsipras' victory speech as as follows:</p><p>\"Our victory is of all the peoples of Europe who are struggling. I would like to assure you the new Greek government will be ready to co-operate and negotiate with our friends, with a just and useful solution so that Greece will return Europe to development and social stability and values like democracy and solidarity. In this sincere dialogue, Greece will come with its own proposals, its own national plan of reforms and radical changes with a four-year plan, without shortages, without unrealistic proposals about our debt. The new Greek government will prove the Cassandras wrong. No mutual conflict but no continuation of our submission in front of us. We have a great opportunity for a new beginning a new Europe.\"</p><p>On Jan. 26, 2015, Tsipras was sworn into power as the new Greek prime minister without the traditional accompaniment of a Bible and blessing of basil and water from the Greek Archbishop, opting instead for a secular ceremony in which he promised to uphold the constitution.</p><p>Tsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has opposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program. That was likely the beginning and end of the compatibility between Syriza and the Independent Greeks, given the two arties' divergent views on immigration. In fact, it was the Independent Greeks' \"far-right\" views on immigration that repelled the centrist group, Potami (River), and convinced that party's leader, Stavros Theodorakis, to stay out of the new coalition government.</p><p>Nevertheless, Syriza's 149 seats, in combination with the Independent Greeks' 13 seats, would give the coalition a majority in the 300-seat parliament. Their ideological alliance opposed to austerity and bailouts would likely provide a shared policy vision for moving forward in the immediate future.</p><p>In his first major act as prime minister, Tsipras unveiled his cabinet. The ministerial portfolios were to be held by no shortage of anti-austerity veterans, making clear that he was moving forward with an anti-austerity agenda and his plan to renegotiate Greece's massive debts. Of note was the inclusion in government of the academic economist, Yanis Varoufakis, as the new finance minister. Also of note was the inclusion of Panos Kammenos, the leader of the right-wing Independent Greeks (the junior coalition partner to Syriza), as defense minister.</p><p>Special Report</p><p>Job 1: Servicing Greek debt --</p><p>With its future in Euro zone at stake, Greece finally strikes an agreement with its creditors; new bailout deal filled with harsh austerity measures and major compromises for Greece</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The spring of 2015 saw Greece under pressure as it suffered a \"liquidity crunch\" at a time when several bills and debt obligations were due to be paid. That liquidity crunch could be alleviated by the release of a tranche of rescue funds from Greece's international creditors; however, those creditors - including the finance officials of the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund - were looking for a comprehensive structural reform plan from Greece to be submitted for approval. In that plan, Greece's creditors were looking for serious austerity measures intended to rein in its social welfare spending, such as reductions of civil service pensions. However, the Greek people have made clear that the radical Syriza government they elected to power at the start of 2015 had to keep its election promises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. Clearly, those demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors.</p><p>Faced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government was considering a referendum, which if ratified, would give the government a mandate to move forward with a plan that could meet the demands of other European finance ministers. The referendum idea aside, another option for Greece would be to default on its payments, exit the Euro zone, and re-adopt the Drachma as its currency. Such a path would likely be catastrophic for Greece; however, the Euro bloc was increasingly frustrated by Greece's failure to meet its reform demands and thus concomitantly accepting of the idea of a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable several years prior was now becoming a real possibility on the Euro zone landscape as the clock ticked ever so close to the June 2015 deadline. That deadline would mark the time when Greece would have to advance its reform agenda in order to secure rescue funding.</p><p>As talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit an impasse in mid-June 2015, speculation about either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek exit from the Euro zone. Finally, on the eve of the highly anticipated June 30, 2015, deadline, Greece rejected a rescue proposal set forth by the European Commission intended to prevent a Greek default. Instead, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras said his country would hold a referendum to seek public ratification on the proposal although he urged fellow citizens to vote against it. His government's position was that a strong national \"no\" vote would add to Greece's leverage against its creditors. Those creditors, however, reminded Greece that a failure to forge a deal with them on structural reforms prior to that June 30, 2015, deadline would essentially result in default and augur catastrophic consequences for Greece.</p><p>Greeks were thus set to go to the polls on July 5, 2015, to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the Greek prime minister had already rejected. After the votes were counted, the result showed a decisive \"no\" vote as Greeks overwhelmingly rejected the rescue package by European creditors. This result meant that Greece was now effectively wading into uncharted territory.</p><p>With a sense of urgency at stake and the clock ticking, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present new proposals for consideration. With two hours to spare, Greece met that deadline although the new slate of proposals from Greece were essentially a repeat of the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015. A key distinction in this new blueprint was the inclusion of a call for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece.</p><p>Finally, on July 13, 2015, a deal to rescue Greece from economic crisis had been reached. The new agreement mandated that the Greek government legislatively ratify and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures. There were also harsh demands by hardliners that were sure to raise the ire of Greek nationalists. It was apparent that Greece's creditors were trying to deliver the message that they now held the power. The good news for Greece was that the full meeting of the European Union was cancelled, making it clear that no vote on a \"Grexit\" would be held immediately. But while Greece could sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of the matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be unpopular with the Greece citizenry.</p><p>To that end, by August 2015, the Greek prime minister had carried out a cabinet shuffle to purge the government of disloyal Syriza members; he was also trying to assuage his party regarding the unpalatable reformist path it has taken. That attempt was not yielding desired results. Instead hardliners within Syriza split from the party to form their own breakaway group and Prime Minister Tspiras resigned as the head of government given his loss of a parliamentary majority. While rival parties tried to establish a replacement coalition government, the fact of the matter was that Greek citizens were headed back to the polls later in the year 2015 for repeat parliamentary elections. It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity would be enough to return him to power.</p><p>Background:</p><p>The radical left wing and anti-bailout party, Syriza, won the January 2015 parliamentary elections in Greece. In the aftermath of those polls, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has opposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program.</p><p>At the top of the agenda for the new government of Greece would be the matter of attending to the bailout packages.

The new Greek government will prove the Cassandras wrong. No mutual conflict but no continuation of our submission in front of us. We have a great opportunity for a new beginning a new Europe.\"</p><p>On Jan. 26, 2015, Tsipras was sworn into power as the new Greek prime minister without the traditional accompaniment of a Bible and blessing of basil and water from the Greek Archbishop, opting instead for a secular ceremony in which he promised to uphold the constitution.</p><p>Tsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has opposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program. That shared opposition to the bailout package was likely the beginning and end of the compatibility between Syriza and the Independent Greeks, given the two parties' divergent views on immigration. In fact, it was the Independent Greeks' \"far-right\" views on immigration that repelled the centrist group, Potami (River), and convinced that party's leader, Stavros Theodorakis, to stay out of the new coalition government.</p><p>Nevertheless, Syriza's 149 seats, in combination with the Independent Greeks' 13 seats, would give the coalition a majority in the 300-seat parliament. Their ideological alliance opposed to austerity and bailouts would likely provide a shared policy vision for moving forward in the immediate future.</p><p>Greek seeks rescue funds; Greece's creditors seek reform commitments --</p><p>In his first major act as prime minister, Tsipras unveiled his cabinet. The ministerial portfolios were to be held by no shortage of anti-austerity veterans, making clear that he was moving forward with an anti-austerity agenda and his plan to renegotiate Greece's massive debts. Of note was the inclusion in government of the academic economist, Yanis Varoufakis, as the new finance minister. Also of note was the inclusion of Panos Kammenos, the leader of the right-wing Independent Greeks (the junior coalition partner to Syriza), as defense minister.</p><p>Varoufakis, who was a professor at the University of Texas, gained notoriety due to his vociferous excoriation of the bailout regime, referring to it as \"fiscal waterboarding\" while warning that it was transforming Europe into a \"Victorian workhouse.\" But it was apparent that he was prepared to moderate such language as finance minister, saying to media that he had participated in an \"encouraging and inspiring\" conversation with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers. However, Varoufakis insisted that he would not negotiate with the so-called \"troika\" of global institutions overseeing Greek debt (i.e. the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund). Instead, he suggested that he would look to negotiating with individual European countries and organizations. It was to be seen if such a path was even feasible.</p><p>For his part, Dijsselbloem said that Greeks should not hold on to unrealistic expectations, and that the act of electing Syriza did not change the realities that Greek debt would have to be repaid. He said, \"We all have to realize and the Greek people have to realize that the major problems in the Greek economy have not disappeared and haven't even changed overnight because of the simple fact that an election took place.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, the new Greek government had high hopes that its debt obligations would be forgiven. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who warned Greece that its tactics would not be indulged, including its demands to have its debt written off, quickly dissolved those high hopes. He said, \"There's no arguing with us about this, and what's more we are difficult to blackmail.\"</p><p>Likewise, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear the European Union would not be renegotiating the terms of the Greek rescue package. In an interview with the newspaper, Die Welt, Merkel said, \"I do not envisage fresh debt cancellation. There has already been voluntary debt forgiveness by private creditors, banks have already slashed billions from Greece's debt.\" That being said, Merkel added that she hoped Greece would remain in the euro zone. She said, \"The aim of our policy was and is that Greece remains permanently part of the euro community. Europe will continue to show its solidarity with Greece, as with other countries hard hit by the crisis, if these countries carry out reforms and cost-saving measures.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Athens was showcasing its defiance as it moved forward with its anti-austerity agenda. Prime Minister Tsipras soon halted privatization plans for the Port of Piraeus that had been agreed under the country's rescue package, and said that similar moves were in place as regards the privatization of Public Power Corporation of Greece, Greece's biggest utility company, as well as the refiner, Hellenic Petroleum. In truth, Greece's privatization program had, thus far, yielded far les revenue than had originally been envisioned; thus, a halt in this arena was to be expected.</p><p>In the offing, however, were further measures aimed at reconstituting the welfare state, such as free electrical power and food stamps for Greeks, as well as labor changes, including the reversal of the reduced minimum wage and the restoration of collective bargaining rights for unions. These moves, along with Tsipras' promise to abolish the higher \"crisis\u201d taxes that were implemented in the midst of the Greek debt fracas, have spurred questions as to how exactly the Greek government intended to pay for all the programs mentioned above.</p><p>One measure of funding for Greece was through Germany -- but not via the contemporary European Union channels; instead, it relied on history and the notion of historic debt. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras demanded that Germany pay reparations for World War Two, including the repayment of a loan that the Nazis forced the Bank of Greece to pay when they occupied Greece. According to the Greek prime minister, there was an outstanding \"moral obligation to our people, to history, to all European peoples who fought and gave their blood against Nazism.\" It was to be seen if, in 2015, this argument would be regarded as valid.</p><p>German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier acknowledged the political and moral responsibilities of his country for the \"terrible events\" in Greece during the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944. However, he made clear that Germany had already addressed those responsibilities, saying, \"We are firmly convinced that all reparations issues, including forced loans, are judicially settled once-and-for-all.\"</p><p>In February 2015, weeks after coming to power, Prime Minister Tsipras made clear that his newly-elected government was committed to moving forward with its pre-election promises, irrespective of the questions as to how those social programs would be paid for. In a speech before parliament on Feb. 8, 2015, Tsipras declared that the government's \"irreversible decision is to implement in full our pre-elections pledges.\"</p><p>The prime minister also said that his country was seeking a bridge loan rather than an extension of its current rescue package to service its massive debt. In a speech to parliament, he said, \"The bailout failed. The new government is not justified in asking for an extension... because it cannot ask for an extension of mistakes.\"</p><p>Of course, the European Union had a different view. Already the European Union had made it clear that it was not prepared to renegotiate Greece's bailout terms. Now, in response to Prime Minister Tsipras' call for a loan rather than an extension of the existing bailout package, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers, said that the only option on the table was for Greece to apply for a bailout extension. Dijsselbloem said, \"We don't do bridging loans.\" Placing more pressure on the new Greek government was the move by the European Central Bank making it clear that Greek banks could no longer access ECB credit by using Greek government bonds.</p><p>For its part, Germany, the euro zone's main player and Greece's biggest creditor, maintained its strict stance that Greece would have to go forward with its structural reforms if it wished to have continued support. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble made a point of noting that Greece had lived beyond its means for far too long time. Left unsaid was the reality that German taxpayers should not have to pay for Greek social programs when that country refused to attend to its unsustainable financial regime.</p><p>At home in Greece, the new anti-bailout and anti-austerity government had popular backing for its stance at home. Greeks were taking to the streets to rally in support of the Syriza-led government's position, and polling data showed that as many as 75 percent of Greeks supported the hardline policies of the prime minister. That position was ratified in parliament in the second week of February 2015 when Tsipras won a confidence vote, paving the way for the cancellation of the rescue program discussed here. In an address to parliament, he declared: \"We are not negotiating the bailout; it was cancelled by its own failure.\" He continued, \"I want to assure you that there is no going back. Greece cannot return to the era of bailouts.\"</p><p>In mid-February, Greek Finance Minister said in an article in the New York Times that his country would not be treated as a \"debt colony\" subjected to \"the greatest austerity for the most depressed economy.\" Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos also indicated that if the European Union was unwilling to bow to its demands, then it would look to Russia or China for funding. Seemingly, Greece preferred to become a client state of one of the eastern powers -- Russia or China -- rather than seek a compromise with the West in the form of the European Union.</p><p>By Feb. 16, 2015, talks between Greece and the euro zone finance group collapsed when the government of Greece rejected a proposal by the Euro bloc that would entail a request for a six-month extension to the existing bailout package. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers, said that Greece would have until Feb. 20, 2015, to apply for an extension or the rescue program would expire, on schedule, at the end of February 2015. But the government of Greece rejected the proposal, casting it as unacceptable. With the extension now off the proverbial table, and with the new government committed to reversing austerity measures, it was unclear how Greece intended to service its debt and pay for its social welfare programs.</p><p>A new attempt to address Greece's debt woes was expected to take place on Feb. 18, 2015, when Greece would apparently seek an extension on a loan -- but not one coinciding with the current rescue regime. Stated differently, the \"extension\" would have to be crafted in such a way as to maintain the appearance of continuity while also ending the current austerity programs demanded by Greece. It was to be seen if such a creative resolution could be forged -- and accepted -- by all key parties.</p><p>After days of contentious and intense negotiations, it was announced that an agreement had been reached to extend Greece's bailout package for four months. The deal, which was reached during emergency talks between the Greek government and euro zone finance ministers, would allow Greece to access US$271 billion in rescue funds (roughly 240 billion euro).</p><p>While this agreement would give Greece some time to address its economic woes, it was hardly an enduring resolution for the debt-stricken country. Nevertheless, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers, hailed the agreement, saying, \u201cI\u2019m glad to report to you that the work has paid off. We have established common ground again.\u201d He continued, \"I think tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding trust. As you know trust leaves quicker than it comes. Tonight was a very important, I think, step in that process.\" Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis signaled a similar message, as he said, \"The four-month period will be a time to rebuild new relations with Europe and the IMF.\"</p><p>Central to the deal was Greece's commitment to honor its debt obligations, and its vow to unveil a list of economic reform measures aimed at addressing its debt woes. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said he would be working hard in the following days to come up with a new plan aimed at introducing reforms, presumably not of the type the Greek people would view as harsh austerity measures. That list was presented late on Feb. 23, 2015, and included measures such as combating tax evasion, tacking corruption, pausing on a reversal of the privatization process, eliminating incentives for early retirement, reducing the number of government ministries, and reforming the public sector.</p><p>The European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) responded to the Greek reform proposal by noting that it was a \"valid starting point.\" However, they were still looking for further measures to be implemented. The head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, said that the Greek proposal \"differs from existing programme commitments in a number of areas.\" He added that there would have to be an assessment process by which some listed reforms were \"replaced with measures of equal or better quality.\" The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, struck a similar tone saying, \"In some areas like combating tax evasion and corruption, I am encouraged by what appears to be a stronger resolve on the part of the new authorities in Athens. In quite a few areas, however, including perhaps the most important ones, the letter is not conveying clear assurances that the government intends to undertake the reforms envisaged.\"</p><p>Greece seeks external support -</p><p>In the first part of April 2015, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras traveled to the Russian capital of Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia had been one of Greece's leading trading partners; however, bilateral trade between the two countries had decreased due to sanctions on Russia for its military engagement in Ukraine, and also because of the Greece's own existing economic challenges.</p><p>Tsipras's meeting in Russia sparked speculation about a potential bid by Greece to curry favor with alternative global powers, given its strained relations with the European Union over a financial rescue package. For some time, Greece has argued that it should not be burdened by strenuous structural adjustment and debt reform programs required by a prevailing bailout regime. This position was not shared by Greece's rescue funding creditors at the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, who have insisted that Greece meet its financial obligations. Given this climate of dissonance, in February 2015, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis warned that his country would not bend to the will of the so-called \"troika\" of global institutions overseeing Greek debt (i.e. the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund). Instead, he said Greece would look to other countries for support. The April 2015 trip by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to Russia was thus being viewed as a means to cultivate relations with new international partners.</p><p>Reports from Russia indicated that while Russian President Putin offered moral support to Greece, there was no significant financial aid coming from Moscow. Putin said that Russia would entertain granting Greece loans for join projects, likely in the energy sector, which might be mutually beneficial. To this end, Putin explained, \"We discussed cooperation in various sectors of the economy, including the possibility of developing major energy projects.\" He continued, \"Under these plans, we could provide loans for certain projects.\" One possible arena for energy cooperation could be the extension to the Turkish Stream pipeline, which would transport Russian gas from Turkey to Europe via Greece. Putin also said that bilateral trade relations with Greece should be restored. While Putin might be interested in bringing Western countries into its orbit, the fact of the matter was that Russia had its own financial woes to confront, thus limiting its own capacity to extend a more direct financial hand in Greece.</p><p>Nevertheless, the trip marked a strengthening of overall relations between the two countries. Indeed, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras distanced his country from the rest of Europe in its stance towards Russia, which had become something of a global pariah after the annexation of Crimea and ongoing intervention into the Ukrainian crisis. Tspiras insisted, \"Greece is a sovereign state with an indisputable right to its own foreign policy.\" He then broke ranks with the European Union, condemning the punitive measures imposed by the West on Russia and urging an end to the \"vicious cycle of sanctions.\" Tsipras was also anxious to dismiss suggestions that he had flown to Moscow to ask for financial aid. He said, \"Greece is not a beggar going around to countries asking them to solve its economic problem, an economic crisis that doesn't only concern Greece but is a European crisis.\"</p><p>Negotiating Rollercoaster --</p><p>Greece has insisted that Germany -- the most powerful player in the euro bloc -- should pay war reparations for the Nazi occupation during World War Two, when the Bank of Greece was forced to pay loans to the Nazi-led government of Germany at the time. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras was on the record declaring that there was an outstanding \"moral obligation\" by Germany to address this debt. But German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had already acknowledged the political and moral responsibilities of his country for the \"terrible events\" in Greece during the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944, and he had already reminded Greece that Germany had addressed those war reparations responsibilities. For his part, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel referred to this ongoing argument by Greece as \"dumb.\"</p><p>Mid-April 2015 was the stated schedule for Greece to produce a revised list of reforms that would be needed to secure forthcoming rescue funds. While Greece managed to meet a deadline to repay 460 million euros to the International Monetary Fund earlier in the month, the country would be faced with larger and more pressing debt repayments (to renew Treasury bonds and to repay loans). It was to be seen if it would be able to meet those obligations.</p><p>Following talks in Belgium in mid-April 2015, Euro zone officials were shocked that Greece did not meet this requirement. Instead, Greece produced no serious structural reform plan, and refused to discuss reductions of civil service pensions or any other expensive aspects of the welfare state. Making matter worse, one source said in an interview with the German publication, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, that the Greek representative demanded rescue funds \"like a taxi driver.\" Greece was given a deadline of April 24, 2015, to produce a revised economic reform plan. Euro zone officials warned that the new plan would have to be ambitious. It was to be seen if that deadline would be met and if the proposal would be deemed acceptable by Greece's European creditors.</p><p>In the third week of April 2015, with a loan repayment due the following month, Greece was under pressure to pay its bills. In its desperation to find available cash to pay its bills (public wages and pensions), Greece was tapping into public cash reserves from municipalities. Local governments and opposition parties railed against the move, with local officials threatening to ignore the demand for funds, and with opposition politicians accusing the Syrize government of acting arbitrarily and not respecting the constitution.</p><p>Pressure was also coming from outside Greek borders, with Euro bloc powers demanding that the Greek government submit a substantive reform plan in order to secure future rescue funds, and with a significant repayment to the International Monetary Fund due. There were challenges on both fronts. First, as discussed here, Greece was not actively pursuing a structural reform agenda of the type needed to satisfy the country's creditors. Second, it was reported by the Financial Times that Greece had asked for a delay its loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund but was rebuffed. In truth, a delay in a repayment to a developed country like Greece would be unprecedented, while delays of this sort to developing countries in the past had not yielded positive results. As such, the International Monetary Fund was not inclined to move in this direction.</p><p>Euro bloc powers were eager to remind Greece that it was not likely to find creditors elsewhere, with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble noting that while the Greek government could try to curry favor -- and funding -- from Russia or China, the reality was that it would be difficult to actually secure other creditors. He said, \"The Europeans have said, OK, we are ready to do it [lend money] until 2020... If you find someone else, whether it's in Beijing, in Moscow, in Washington D.C., or in New York who will lend you money, ok, fine, we would be happy. But it's difficult to find someone who is lending you in this situation amounts [of] 200 billion euros.\"</p><p>For his part, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras seemed determined to project an image of optimism as he insisted that the Greek government would reach a deal with its creditors. He said, \"Despite the cacophony and erratic leaks and statements in recent days from the other side, I remain firmly optimistic that there will be an agreement by the end of the month.\" He said that progress had been made in the arenas of tax collection, tax distribution, and corruption. However, he admitted that there remained disagreements in certain arenas, such as privatization, labor and pension reforms, and value-added taxes. Of course, those were the very arenas that the Euro bloc was targeting for Greek structural adjustment.</p><p>It should be noted that Euro zone finance ministers had a completely different tone from the optimism imbued in Prime Minister Tsipras' claims discussed above. Instead, during a meeting with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, Euro zone officials characterized the talks as \"going nowhere.\" Some even suggested that as Greece moved close to the precipice of bankruptcy, it was time to prepare for default, believing that the effort to try to save Greece had gone on long enough. They indicated that Greece's refusal to get serious with a reform agenda made it clear that Greece did not want to be \"saved\" in the first place.</p><p>As April 2015 came to a close, finance ministers from the Euro zone warned Greece that no further financial aid would be advanced without the submission of a comprehensive economic reform and restructuring plan. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister from the Netherlands, said: \"A comprehensive and detailed list of reforms is needed.\" Dijsselbloem also warned that funds to Greece would be frozen until Greece presented a complete reform proposal as he added, \"A comprehensive deal is necessary before any disbursement can take place ... We are all aware that time is running out.\"</p><p>No further meetings between the Greek government and Euro zone officials were scheduled until the second week of May 2015 -- the very deadline when Greece would be expected to make a large repayment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>Ahead of that meeting between the Greek government and Euro zone officials in mid-May 2015, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis acknowledged that an agreement to abate Greece's money woes was not going to be reached easily. In an interview with Greek media, Varoufakis said, \"The Greek government is struggling in a very tough negotiating fight to achieve an agreement that will not only be an agreement to have a disbursement but one that will deliver a substantive hit to the crisis.\" He continued. \"I think the solution will be given in the coming days and not necessarily today. We will do whatever we can to achieve [re: liquidity] relief today.</p><p>But officials of the Euro zone warned that they did not foresee any moves that would allow the European Central Bank to raise the limit on short-term Treasury bills that Greek banks could buy. That was the measure Greece was hoping to achieve in order to avert bankruptcy. Not surprisingly, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis thusly warned that his country's financial situation was \"terribly urgent\" with a liquidity crisis in the offing. He added, \"The liquidity issue is a terribly urgent issue. It's common knowledge, let's not beat around the bush.\" Indeed, Greece's financial coffers were so low that the government was raiding public funds to pay for its commitments.</p><p>To that end, reports from Greece indicated that the country did indeed meet its obligations by the mid-May 2015 deadline for repayment of 750 million euros (approximately US$834 million) to the International Monetary Fund. The Greek finance ministry reported that the order for repayment was executed on May 11, 2015. According to the mayor of the Greek city of Thessaloniki, the funds came from his country's cash reserves. However, some of the money also ironically came from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself.</p><p>Deadlines and Default --</p><p>The end of May 2015 would see Greece needing about 2.5 billion euros funds to pay for its salary and pension obligations. The next major deadline would come in late May-early June 2015 when Greece would be expected to submit a comprehensive reform deal in concert with its international creditors, in order to secure a tranche of rescue funds. That would also be the period when European powers, particularly Germany, would need a viable agreement on the table to be approved in parliament before moving forward one way or another. Increasingly, German lawmakers were turning sour on the idea of saving an unwilling Greece from its own economic perils. As such, sufficient time was needed to persuade a majority of members of parliament to approve the deal. Also of significance was the fact that the actual bailout agreement between Athens and the Euro zone was set to expire at the close of June 2015.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of Euro zone finance ministers, Chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned that any further disbursements of funds to Greece would be contingent on the formation of a complete agreement. He said, \"There are time constraints and liquidity constraints and hopefully we will reach an agreement before time runs out and before money runs out.\"</p><p>In the streets of Greece, the Greek people have made it clear that the radical Syriza government they elected had to keep its election promises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. However, those demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors, who require a comprehensive structural adjustment program to be implemented in Greece before it will provide further rescue funds. Faced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government has said that it might have to hold a referendum in order to ratify any agreement forged with European finance ministers.</p><p>It was an idea that was gaining resonance across the European Union. Euro zone authorities were realizing that Greece -- and specifically the Greek government operating on behalf of the people -- needed a mandate to move forward, while the Greek people themselves had to be committed to its continued participation in the regional monetary body. That commitment required a reshaping of Greek economic behavior, and specifically, required Greece to live within its means rather than repeatedly violating the financial rules set for all Euro zone countries.</p><p>Accordingly, Germany Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaueble said of the referendum idea, \"Maybe this would be the right measure to let the Greek people decide if it is ready to accept what is necessary.\" He expanded on his stance saying, \"If the Greek government thinks it must hold a referendum, then let it hold a referendum. That might even be a helpful measure for the Greek people to decide whether it is ready to accept what is necessary, or whether it wants something different.\"</p><p>But the chairman of the Euro bloc, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, was not so sanguine on the notion of a referendum, warning that the schedule of such an endeavor would slow down the entire process, including the disbursement of billion euros in frozen bailout funds. He said, \"Presumably if you have a referendum you will not start implementing before you have done it and then it doesn't seem to make sense.\"</p><p>It should be noted that polling data by Marc pollsters for the Ton Syntakton newspaper in mid-May 2015 showed that the vast majority of Greeks wished to stay in the Euro zone. Indeed, 76.9 percent of Greeks expressed that view with only 19.2 percent favoring a return to the Drachma. Polling data also indicated some breathing room for the radical Syriza government, with 51.1 percent of respondents saying that the government should continue to govern from the helm even if negotiations with international creditors arrive at an impasse; only 22.8 percent actually favored a referendum on Greece's future in the euro zone, while a small minority -- 16.6 percent -- favored fresh elections.</p><p>Another option available to Greece would be default and a Greek exit from the Euro zone, known colloquially as \"Grexit.\" Some Greek politicians were calling for a default and the withdrawal from the Euro zone, insisting that the terms for continued participation were too onerous for the Greek people. Left unstated by these individuals was the likely catastrophic consequences of this path, which would very likely include capital controls on banks, the collapse of some financial entities, inflation particularly on imports, and the complete collapse of investment.</p><p>Of note was the fact that the year 2015 was quite different from the 2011 period when the notion of a Greek default fueled fears of contagion across the southern countries of the Euro bloc. Since 2011, a bailout fund had been established in the Euro zone, and other banking protections had been introduced. As such, the Euro zone was now better positioned to withstand a theoretical Greek default. Moreover, with other Southern European countries on the brink, such as Spain, where the populist party, Podemas, was gaining steam, a more unwieldy economic crisis was looming ahead with a much bigger economy to consider. For some European countries, a Greek refusal to reform, followed by inevitable default, could function as an economic cautionary tale of sorts.</p><p>As May 2015 came to an end, Greece was in a financially perilous position with no deal on the horizon to be forged with its international creditors. Moreover, Greek Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis admitted that his country had \u201cno money\u201d to fund scheduled repayments to the International Monetary Fund , which were set to commence on June 5, 2015. Ahead of that first repayment deadline, a spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund, William Murray, warned that Greece would be denied additional financing if it missed a loan payment. Murray noted: \u201cAny country that doesn\u2019t meet its commitment with the [International Monetary] Fund... is declared in arrears and they have no access to IMF funding.\"</p><p>In a statement, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, acknowledged that no agreement was imminent; she said, \u201cIt is very unlikely that we\u2019ll reach a comprehensive solution in the coming days.\" Despite some encouraging expositions of rhetoric from various parties following a series of meetings, Lagarde archly noted, \u201cWe\u2019ve been sobered again in the last week.\" Lagarde also admitted that a Greek exit from the euro zone was a real possibility as she said \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated issue and it\u2019s one that I hope the Europeans will not have to face because hopefully they will find a path to agree with the future of Greece within the eurozone.\"</p><p>Lagarde foreclosed any kind of preferential agreement for Greece, fueling speculation that the European Union's euro zone and the International Monetary Fund intended to showcase Athens as a cautionary example for other euro zone countries on the brink and vulnerable to populist notions of opposing austerity measures, economic reforms, and programs of structural readjustment. Reminding all countries that have sought assistance that loans and rescue packages comes with obligations, Lagarde declared: \u201cWe have rules. We have principles. There will be no half-baked program review.\"</p><p>Just ahead of the June 5, 2015, deadline when Greece was due to dispatch its first repayment to the International Monetary Fund, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras angrily rejected what he cast as the \"absurd\" terms of proposed aid from the European bloc. During a speech to the Greek parliament, he said, \"The Greek government cannot consent to absurd proposals. I want to believe that this proposal was a bad moment for Europe or at the very least a bad negotiating trick and will soon be withdrawn by the masterminds themselves.\" The Greek finance minister had an even more vituperative response to the terms proposed by European bloc creditors. In an interview with a Greek newspaper, Finance Minister Varoufakis characterized the reform proposal plan as \"an aggressive move designed to terrorize the Greek government\" and declared that \"this Greek government cannot be terrorized.\"</p><p>Soon thereafter, Prime Minister Tsipras' government in Athens informed the International Monetary Fund that it would delay the 300 million euros due at that time. Instead, Greece would bundle all four of its June repayments to the International Monetary Fund -- totaling 1.5 billion euros in all -- and dispatch the funds on June 30, 2015. Of course, there was no actual understanding of where Greece would procure this money since on the very same day -- June 30, 2015 -- the rescue deal with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union was set to expire. As discussed here, there was no viable deal on the table to provide additional bailout funds.</p><p>As unorthodox as the delaying+bundling tactic might have been, and as unpalatable a prolonged impasse might be, there was, in fact, a precedent dating back to the 1970s. That precedent made it possible for governments to bundle together multiple principal payments due in a calendar month and thus simplfy the process of making multiple payments in a short period. Indeed, in the mid-1980s, the African country of Zambia used the bundling option to repay the International Monetary Fund. Still, the prevailing problem remained at hand for Greece: Even if the schedule of repayment was adjusted, was it even possible for Greece to cobble together the necessary funds?</p><p>The negotiations aimed at staving off default continued to be characterized by conflicting reports of progress. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras insisted that an agreement with his country's international creditors was \"in sight,\" while the finance ministers of the Euro Zone made clear that concurrence was a significant distance away. Indeed, Greece remained unprepared to assent to its international creditors' demands for a reform plan including want pension cuts, reforms to the value added tax (VAT), labor reforms, increased private sector investment, and structural changes to the civil service. In fact, Greece had its own long list of demands that include highly generous debt relief and threats to re-impose collective bargaining rights for Greek workers.</p><p>Suddenly, snap elections were being considered as a possible option as the Greek government might need to gain the public's approval of the difficult path forward. To this end, Greece's Deputy Social Security Minister Dimitris Stratoulis was quoted as declaring: \"The lenders want to impose hard measures. If they do not back down from this package of blackmail, the government ... will have to seek alternative solutions, elections.\" Stratoulis also indicated that the postponement and bundling of the repayment to the International Monetary Fund was a negotiating tactic as he declared, \"The government's move is a message that it wants to wait and see how far they (lenders) will take it, if they will back off from this unreasonable, inhumane, colonialist package they are proposing.\" If Stratoulis was correct, then the response of Greece's international creditors would certainly be instructive.</p><p>With the June 30, 2015, deadline looming ahead for both the repayment bundle due to the International Monetary Fund, as well as the presentation of a comprehensive economic reform plan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed cautious hopes that Greece would remain in the euro zone, while warning that Athens would have to seriously address the concerns of its creditors. She said, \"We want Greece to stay in the euro but in order to achieve that, Greece has to make the necessary efforts, and these are the subject of our ongoing discussions, and I want to see them come to a positive result.\"</p><p>Germany's vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel offered a more harsh assessment as he noted that other countries in Europe were losing patience with Greece. In an article in the German Bild magazine, Gabriel said that while Germany ideally would prefer to see Greece remain in the Euro zone, \"not only is time running out, but so too is patience across Europe.\" In something of a warning to Greece, he added, \"Everywhere in Europe, the sentiment is growing that enough is enough.\"</p><p>As before, Greece appeared unprepared to heed that warning and instead lashed out at its creditors -- presumably in an effort to redirect the blame for its own economic woes. In fact, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras accused creditors of issuing unreasonable demands as he said, \"One can only see a political purposefulness in the insistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts.\" He continued by suggesting that Greece would wait until the rest of Europe zone acquiesced to his country's demands for funds. To this end, Tspiras said, \"We will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism. We do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.\"</p><p>By mid-June 2015, the European Commission had dismissed Greece's proposal to address its debt and repayment woes, saying sharply that the Greek government failed to produce any new and serious plan that would secure the funding needed to repay the International Monetary Fund by the June 30, 2015, deadline. As talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit this fresh impasse, speculation about either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek exit from the Euro zone. However, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis foreclosed the possibility of a \"Grexit,\" asserting that it would not be a sensible solution to the Greek debt crisis. Instead, he was demanding an \"extension\" of the existing bailout terms as as a generous debt forgiveness package. Of note was the fact that Greece's creditors have long said these options were not on the table.</p><p>In the third week of June 2015, Greek said it would default on the 1.6 billion euro debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund due on June 30, 2015, unless it garnered fresh rescue funds from its creditors. But if Greece thought its warning of a possible default would work to its benefit, it was quickly reminded that the pressure was actually on Greece and not its creditor institutions. To that end, the head of the International Money Fund, Christine Lagarde, reminded Greece that there would be \"no period of grace\" related to the debt repayment deadline.</p><p>With the possibility of default looming, a meeting was convened between envoys from the Greek government and European finance ministers but ended in failure with no progress made on a plausible path forward. German media sources indicated that Greece wanted to present its existing reform proposal, which creditors had already said was a \"non-starter.\" Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of the Euro group, explained the situation, saying, \"Regrettably ... too little progress has been made. No agreement is in sight.\" Accordingly, he indicated that it would be incumbent on Greece to advance a new set of proposals.</p><p>The urgency of the situation was laid bare in an address by German Chancellor Merkel to the German parliament in which she said her country would do its part to retain Greece as part of the Euro Zone, but that Greece would have to do its part and make good on its reform obligations. To this end, she said, \"There was an agreement -- the Greek government pledged to carry out structural reforms, and that must be done.\"</p><p>Another emergency meeting was scheduled to be held on June 22, 2015, in an effort to reach an agreement and avert a Greek default. The scene was now at a new level of urgency due to a spate of bank withdrawals (generally referred to as a \"run on the banks\") in conjunction with lowered government revenues. If those withdrawals continued, Greece would be forced to implement capital controls to prevent the flight of cash from the country. Of course, those very conditions were placing pressure on the Greek government to be more agreeable in these latest negotiations.</p><p>To that end, as of June 22, 2015, the government of Greece had advanced a new proposal for reform, which included fresh taxes on businesses and the wealthy, and an increase in the value added tax (VAT) rate in some arenas. But as before, the Syriza-led government insisted that there would be no curbs on pensions or public-sector wages, and maintained that there would be no VAT on electricity and medicine. These issues continued to be sticking points in the negotiations. Nevertheless, the new proposal for reform was being welcomed by Greece's creditors as a step in the right direction. Indeed, European Council President Donald Tusk said the new Greek plan constituted the \"first real proposals in many weeks.\"</p><p>It was thus still possible that a reform deal with Greece's creditors could be forged at the last minute, thus averting default and preserving Greece's place in the Euro Zone. Another option might be an interim agreement that would smooth over the differences, delay default, and keep Greece within the Euro Zone for the immediate future, with a hazier longer term horizon ahead. But the fact of the matter was that there was also a third possibility -- Greece was at serious risk of default and a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable several years prior was now becoming a real possibility as the clock ticked ever so close to the June 30, 2015, deadline.</p><p>Greece rejects rescue proposal and ensures default; Greeks go to polls to vote in referendum --</p><p>On June 26, 2015 -- just days ahead of the June 30 deadline, the European Commission advanced a rescue proposal to Greece, with an eye on averting a default and preserving Greece's participation in the euro zone. The 10-point plan was released by the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the interests of transparency, and was endorsed by both the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Included in the plan were reforms to the sales tax regime, such as adjustments to the value added tax (VAT) and an increased corporate tax rate, significant labor reforms, and fundamental changes to the pension system, which was described as \"unsustainable.\" To this particular end, early retirement would become a thing of the past. The proposal would require Greece to commit to these measures in order to secure further releases of aid funding -- an amount totaling 15.5 billion euros, 1.8 billion euros of which would be made immediately available. German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Greece to accept the \"extraordinarily generous offer,\" which would rescue that country from certain default.</p><p>Greece's Prime Minister Tsipras, however, made a difference assessment, unilaterally rejecting the deal and withdrawing from the negotiations process. In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Tspiras described the plan as \"an insulting ultimatum,\" imbued by \"humiliation,\" and one that would bedevil Greece with \"unbearable\" austerity measures. He said, \"I call on you to decide -- with sovereignty and dignity as Greek history demands -- whether we should accept the extortionate ultimatum that calls for strict and humiliating austerity without end, and without the prospect of ever standing on our own two feet, socially and financially.\" He added, \"The people must decide free of any blackmail.\"</p><p>The Greek leader then announced a referendum, arguing that the public's ratification would be needed to accept the proposal. However, he made it clear that the exercise of ratification was just a performance of sorts since (1) he had already rejected the deal, and (2) he was actually urging Greek citizens to deliver a resounding \"no\" vote. The Greek parliament quickly supported Tspiras' stance by overwhelmingly voting to approve the referendum and a date of July 5, 2015, was scheduled for the vote.</p><p>At the heart of Tspiras' maneuver was his expressed suggestion that a \"no\" vote would bolster Greece's negotiating position, presumably forcing creditor institutions to acquiesce to some of his demands, such as debt forgiveness and leaving the pension system untouched. It appeared that Tsipras believed that by displaying a defiant stance, Greece would gain further time, power, and leverage to pressure creditor institutions to not only extend rescue funding, but also assent to a more favorable deal.</p><p>Throughout, Greece has been convinced that its creditors in Europe would do whatever necessary to prevent a default, due to fears of a contagion spreading across vulnerable southern European countries. However, such anxieties have decreased in recent times. The landscape in 2015 was not the same as 2011; now, with the European Central Bank (ECB) establishing stopgaps measures and emergency funds, the Euro zone was far better positioned to confront a default and even a \"Grexit.\" As well, for some European players, a default by Greece -- as difficult as it might be -- would function as a cautionary tale for other southern European countries also confronting debt-to-GDP crises. Furthermore, there were some voices suggesting that a Euro zone without its weak link -- Greece -- might mean a stronger currency value for the euro.</p><p>Given this background, Greece's creditors quickly made it clear that they would not be manipulated by Greece's \"pretend and extend\" scheme. In fact, they criticized Prime Minister Tspiras' referendum announcement, and warned that there would be no extension to the bailout program past the June 30, 2015, deadline when Greece was due to repay the IMF. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, explained the scenario in an interview with BBC news. Lagarde said that because the prevailing bailout program would expire on June 30, 2015, a referendum five days later would be an irrelevant exercise since any existing proposals and arrangements would no longer be valid. Without settling that IMF obligation, Greece would face default, and an exit from the euro bloc and other catastrophic economic consequences could be in the offing.</p><p>The head of the Euro group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, essentially washed his hands of the situation, indicating that it would be up to the European Central Bank (ECB) to decide whether or not it would provide emergency liquidity funding to Greece's banking and financial system. But such a move -- should it come -- would be subject to criticism from other European countries. Of note was the call by some German politicians for the ECB to stop bailing out Greece's economy with emergency support, which could be a violation of the body's own central banking regulations. Finally, on June 28, 2015, ECB President Mario Draghi convened an emergency meeting, which concluded with the decision to freeze the level of emergency aid available to Greek banks.</p><p>The news that negotiations had ended in failure triggered some panic from among the Greek citizenry, with long lines reported at banks as people tried to withdraw as much money as possible ahead of anticipated restrictions. Lines were also long at petrol (gas) stations and at grocery stores as Greeks stocked up on fuel and food supplies. In response to the rising tide of anxiety and to prevent a continued \"run of the banks,\" it was soon announced that Greece's beleaguered financial institutions would be closed from June 29, 2015. Meanwhile, the Greek authorities moved to implement capital controls making Greece the second European country since Cyprus to follow this path. Aiming to minimize the sense of panic, Prime Minister Tsipras urged calm, saying in a national address: \"The more calmly we deal with difficulties, the sooner we can overcome them and the milder their consequences will be.\" The prime minister's political cachet meanwhile did not seem to be hurt with Greeks placing the blame on the European creditors and not Tspiras for Greece's plight.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tspiras found himself to be the subject of a scathing editorial by the Financial Times on June 28, 2015. In that editorial, the Financial Times accused the Greek leader of misleading the Greek people about just what was at stake in the referendum set for July 5, 2015. A key point made by the Financial Times was as follows: \"His [Tspiras'] tactic has already come unstuck because the eurozone has refused to consider extending their bailout offer to the date of the poll. By Sunday, when the referendum votes are due to be cast, there may be no deal on the table to discuss.\" The Financial Times also accused the Greek leader of being deceptive about the goal of the referendum; the newspaper argued that a \"resounding no vote\" called for by Tsipras would not be a rejection of the rescue proposal by the European Commission but, instead, \"a vote for the euro or the drachma \u2014 no more, no less.\" The Financial Times' conclusion was that while Prime Minister Tspiras had presented the July 5, 2015, as a referendum on the rescue plan, with a fresh (and better) deal to come as a result, in actuality, the referendum was about the so-called \"Grexit.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, European finance ministers declined to extend the existing bailout for Greece, with Dutch Finance Minster and the president of the Euro group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, saying that \"it would be crazy to extend the program.\" An extension would have permitted Greece to meet its obligation; without it, Greece would not have the requisite funds at its disposal. As a result, Greece officially defaulted on its scheduled repayment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30, 2015.</p><p>Now, attention was on the July 5, 2015, date when the Greek citizenry was scheduled to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the Greek prime minister had already rejected.</p><p>Ahead of the vote, Prime Minister Tsipras showed interest in restarting the negotiations process with creditor institutions by dispatching a letter to European leaders. In that missive, he suggested that his government was prepared to accept most -- but not all -- of the terms of the now-expired rescue package. This perplexing move was met with disinterest in Europe where leaders were clearly wary of dealing with Tsipras and the radical Syriza government. Speaking to the German parliament in Berlin, Chancellor Merkel said, \"We will wait for the referendum. There can be no negotiations on a new aid program before the referendum.\" Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group, issued a similar response, noting that new rescue package terms could only be discussed \"after and on the basis of the outcome of\" the referendum.</p><p>Rather than tempering the Greek stance ahead of the vote and certainly ahead of a fresh slate of negotiations, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis lashed out at his country's creditors, accusing them of blackmail. In an interview with the media, Varoufakis: \"This is a very dark moment for Europe. They have closed our banks for the sole purpose of blackmailing what? Getting a \"yes\" vote on a non-sustainable solution that would be bad for Europe.\"</p><p>This tone held resonance among many Greeks who were now blaming creditor institutions for capital controls at banks and other hardships, which were sure to get worse should the \"no\" vote prevail. Long lines of pensioners at banks, limits on cash withdawals, stalled commercial activity, and a sense of confusion began to permeate the Greek landscape, even as ratings agencies downgraded Greek banks to almost junk status. Still, the political power of resistance and rhetoric was strong as angry Greeks took to the streets in mass protests to blame Europe for its financial woes and to call for a strong rejection of the rescue package.</p><p>On the other side of the equation, European leaders were wasting no opportunity to remind the Greek people that despite Prime Minister Tspiras' claims that a strong \"no\" vote would bolster the country's bargaining power, it was actually a vote against participation in the Euro zone. They were essentially redefining the referendum terms so it was instead a ratification or a rejection of the Euro zone -- and a choice between keeping the Euro and returning to the Drachma. Not surprisingly, that message also held resonance, and counter-demonstrations sprouted in the streets of Greece, with people calling for ratification of the bailout terms, and thus a \"yes\" vote.</p><p>In truth, creditor institutions were likely making the calculation that either a \"no\" or a \"yes\" vote would lead to a better outcome. Despite the gamble of the radical Syriza government, a \"no\" vote would augur an exit of Greece from the Euro zone, and while that end would be painful and difficult, it might also be therapeutic. Much as the removal of a malignant tumor could help in the body's recover from cancerous toxins, so too might excising problematic Greece prove to be helpful; indeed, it might very well heal the debt-to-GDP woes infecting the regional body. On the other hand, a \"yes\" vote could potentially be viewed as a vote of non-confidence in Prime Minister Tspiras' government, and could lead to its downfall. European leaders, then, would then have the opportunity to negotiate with another slate of players -- most of whom were guaranteed to be less intransigent than Syriza. As such, there was no reason for creditor institutions to do anything at this point but wait for the referendum to play out.</p><p>For his part, the Greek leadership was in no mood to back down. Prime Minister Tspiras instead delivered a vociferous rallying call for Greeks to vote on the side of democracy and reject the bailout proposal as he declared: \u201cTurn your backs on those who terrorize you daily.\u201d He continued, \u201cOn Sunday, we are not just deciding that we are staying in Europe, but that we are deciding to live with dignity in Europe.\" Prime Minister Tspiras was not the only member of the Syriza government willing to deploy heavily loaded rhetoric. Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis also accused his country's creditors of terrorism. In an interview with the media, he posedthe following question: \"Why did they force us to close the banks? To instil fear in people. And spreading fear is called terrorism.\"</p><p>It should be noted that polling data on the eve of the referendum suggested a close vote. While support for the pro-Tsipras/Syriza \"no\" vote was initially stronger, congnizance of the consequences of such a path was beginning to circulate through the Greek citizenry. As such, the \"yes\" vote was gaining steam and by July 3, 2015, some polling outfits were showing a slight lead for the \"yes\" contingent. While there remained a significant undecided faction, with Greeks overwhelmingly favoring continued participation in the Euro zone, the advantage was certainly not with the Syriza government of Prime Minister Tspiras.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Germany, frustration over being Greece's financial scapegoat was reaching new heights. Already, Germans were growing increasingly outraged over the prospect of working longer to fund a bailout package that might preserve early retirement for Greek pensioners. But that outrage reached new heights as Greeks demonized Germany for the harsh austerity terms attached to the proposed rescue package. Now, Germans were starting to warm to the notion of a Greek exit from the Euro zone, while the German newspaper, Bild, suggested that Germany should hold a referendum of its own, in which continued financial funding of Greece would have to be ratified. The hypothetical referendum would ask the question: \"Should we support Greece with more billions -- yes or no?\" For now, however, the focus would remain on Greece's referendum on July 5, 2015, with its future in the Euro zone at stake.</p><p>On July 5, 2015, Greeks went to the polls to cast their votes in a referendum intended to either ratify the rescue package or to reject it. As suggested here, the vote was widely regarded as a vote on the future of Greece in the Euro zone. After the votes were counted -- and despite pre-referendum polling data indicating a close result -- it was clear that the people of Greece had decisively voted \"no\" vote and rejected the rescue package by European creditors. With almost all the ballots counted, 61 percent of Greeks voted \"no\" while 39 percent voted \"yes.\"</p><p>Greeks, it seemed, had accepted the argument by Prime Minister Tsipras that a strong \"no\" vote would improve Greece's leverage and bargaining power, and thus position the Syriza government to negotiate a better deal. Of course \"better\" by Greek standards was not necessarily better in the minds of Greece's creditor institutions. For Greece's creditor institutions, and certainly for finance ministers across Europe, the \"no\" vote signaled an exit from the Euro zone.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras declared victory and declared in a national address that his fellow Greeks had voted for a \"Europe of solidarity and democracy.\" He signaled a return to negotiations with a strengthened hand as he said, \"As of tomorrow, Greece will go back to the negotiating table and our primary priority is to reinstate the financial stability of the country.\" But Greece's creditors were not necessarily in the mood for that return to negotiations in short order. Certainly, it was hard to envision Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis sitting across the table from other European leaders days after he labeled the Euro zone strategy as \"terrorism\" for productive talks.</p><p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group, signaled disapproval -- and a tacit warning -- over the referendum result, which he characterized as \"very regrettable for the future of Greece.\" German Deputy Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, poured metaphoric cold water on the Greek government's plans for fresh deal-making, noting that negotiations with Greece were now \"difficult to imagine.\" The German deputy leader also excoriated Greek Prime Minister Tsipras and the Syriza government for leading the Greek people along \"a path of bitter abandonment and hopelessness.\"</p><p>The night of July 5, 2015, in Greece was marked by a mix of jubilation and defiance. But even as the Syriza government of Greece and its supporters celebrated their referendum triumph, the reality was that there were serious and pressing financial challenges to be addressed. Of significance was the fact that the Greek banking and financial system was in dire need of an infusion of emergency funds -- and it was not clear that those funds would be available from the European Central Bank. Greece's banks have for some time been insolvent and reliant on the European Central Bank's emergency liquidity assistance program, but it was to be seen if on July 6, 2015, the European Central Bank would provide enough liquidity to rescue the Greek banking system from collapse, or, if it would simply hold emergency funding at the existing restricted level. Should Greece seek funding from an external entity outside the domain of the European Central Bank, Greece would be delivering the message that it was exiting the Euro zone. Another option would be the creation of a parallel currency at an unknown conversation rate, which would be used to get the banking sector and economy moving again, and to pay salaries and pensions. But that path would ultimately come with extraordinarily high cost of living perils -- quite likely in the form of expensive and even unaffordable imported food, medicine, oil products, and other such vital items.</p><p>In the hours following the overwhelming \"no\" vote, it was clear that Greece was effectively wading into uncharted territory. A meeting of the European Commision was scheduled to take place on July 6, 2015, to consider immediate actions.</p><p>Post-Referendum Developments --</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the referendum, Greece was eager to return to the negotiating table with a strengthened hand. To that end, the Greek government insisted that it was ready to talk to creditor institutions the day after the referendum. But Germany was in no mood to be responsive. Indeed, Greece made it clear that there was no basis for moving forward with talks in the immediate future, and instead indicated that it would be up to Greece to advance a new proposal. German Chancellor Angela Mekel said, \"It will be important tomorrow that the Greek prime minister tells us how things should proceed and what precise suggestions he can submit to us for a medium-term program that will lead Greece to prosperity and growth again.\"</p><p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group of finance ministers, warned that any proposal from Greece would have to include serious reforms as he said, \"For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities.\" French President Fracois Hollande issued a similar message, as follows: \"It is now up to the government of Alexis Tsipras to make serious, credible proposals so that this willingness to stay in the eurozone can translate into a lasting program.\" That message even emanated from the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose own country was suffering from a debt crisis, as he said that assistance for Greece \"has to be accompanied by responsibility.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte issued the sharpest warning, as he declared that Greece would have to implement \"deep reforms\" if it wanted to remain in the Euro zone.</p><p>Meanwhile, German Chancellor Merkel was set to meet with French President Hollande to discuss the Greek conundrum on July 6, 2015, with meetings between Euro zone finance leaders the day after, and a full summit of all Euro zone leaders later in the same week. For the German government, there was a political consideration to be made as Germans grew increasingly frustrated by Greek leaders who had demanded rescue funds while insulting Germany. For the German citizenry, the message was clear: Europe was not just about Greece.</p><p>Perhaps congnizant of the previous poisonous negotiating climate, Greece moved to make some changes in government. Significantly, the controversial Finance Minister Varoufakis resigned and was replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos, a British-educated professor of economics. While this change would likely be welcomed by negotiators who found Varoufakis difficult and, at times, bombastic, it should yet be regarded as a change in style and not substance. Tsakalotos was restrained in manner and thus a contrast to the flamboyant motorcyclist, Varoufakis, on the issues; however, there was little daylight between the two men. In fact, Tsakalotos has been regarded as the intellectual \"grandfather\" of Syriza's radical lefitst policies, which embrace inclusion in the European body while eshewing capitalism.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite claims from the Greek Syriza government that banks would open after the referendum, in fact, banks in Greece remained closed in the days after, and capital controls remained in place. With Greek banks running out of money, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that it would maintain emergency support at existing levels; however, with more collateral needed to secure that emergency lending, the actual amount of money available to the banks remained quite limited.</p><p>For its part, the government of Greece was yet to advance a formal slate of proposals as the first week of July 2015 came to a close, and just ahead of the European zone summit in Brussels (Belgium). In the hours prior to that summit, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras met German Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande, but after that meeting, there was no change in the negotiating landscape despite the urgency for Greece to strike a deal. As noted by Merkel, \"We still do not have the basis for negotiations... it is not a question of weeks anymore, but a question of a few days.\"</p><p>Note: On July 7, 2015, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present fresh proposals needed to secure a rescue deal with creditor institutions. The Euro zone also announced that a full European Union summit including all 28 member states would be held on July 12, 2015.</p><p>\"Grexit\" avoided with new deal; new agreement filled with harsh austerity measures and major compromises for Greece --</p><p>Ahead of the July 11, 2015, meeting of Euro zone finance minister and the July 12, 2015, summit of the European Union, Greece put forth a new proposal aimed at garnering rescue funds and averting a \"Grexit.\" That new proposal essentially sought 53.5 billion euro (just over US$50 billion) in loans as part of a three-year bailout package. Additional rescue funds brought the total package to least 74 billion euros in value (US$83 billion). In return, Greece would move forward with reforms, including spending cuts, sales tax increases, unified VAT rates, privatization measures, and controversial changes to Greece's ultra-generous pension program, which has been considered \"off the table\" for the Greek government until this time.</p><p>In many senses, the Greek proposal was not particularly different from the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015, which Prime Minister Tspiras rejected and responded to by calling a referendum, as discussed above. The main difference was that this new blueprint called for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece. As such, Greece was insisting that its new proposal could not be understood as capitulation to creditor institutions. For his part, Greek Prime MInister -- for now -- was sounding the right tone. He said, \u201cI am ready for an honest compromise. We owe it to the people of Europe that want a united, not divided, Europe. We can reach an agreement tonight if the parties involved want it.\u201d</p><p>It was to be determined whether or not Greek Prime Minister Tspiras could garner parliamentary support at home to move forward with negotiating the agreement. It was also to be seen if Greece's creditor institutions would be amenable to this proposal, especially as regards debt forgiveness.</p><p>The answer to the first question came on July 10, 2015, when a majority of the members of the Greek parliament voted in support of the deal. Prime Minister Tspiras actually lost the support of several members of his own Syriza party, who refused to back the plan, denouncing it as further austerity. Prime Minister Tspiras nonetheless gained a majority parliamentary mandate in support of the proposal.</p><p>The answer to the second question was yet to be determined with many European governments at odds on the issue of how to deal with Greece. France and Italy appeared committed to doing what was necessary to keep Greece in the Euro zone. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Rienzi said, \"Now that Tsipras has made proposals substantially in line with the European requests, an agreement absolutely has to be reached.\" He added, \u201cYou can\u2019t humiliate a European partner.\u201d But the hardline wing, led by Germany, had a different view. In fact, Germany was not keen to extend debt relief to Greece. As plainly stated by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble: \u201cDebt relief is impossible.\" Debt relief was not the only area of contention. Some countries appeared ready to accept a \"Grexit\" if only on a temporary basis. To this end, there were reports from Germany suggesting that the government of that country wanted to see Greece suspended from the Euro zone for a period of five years. While the five year \"time out\" was not expressly addressed by German Chancellor Merkel, she did make clear that her country was not prepared to accept \u201cany price\u201d to ensure that an agreement was made. Meanwhile, still other countries were hostile to the idea of negotiating with Greece. One example was Finland, which was reported to be completely opposed to the notion of a bailout for Greece. Another example was Slovakia, with Prime Minister Robert Fico advocating that Greece leave the Euro bloc. He said, \u201cThe Greeks would do best if they left the euro zone on their own, did their homework and then tried to come back. This is just torture for everybody.\"</p><p>The usual issues aside, there was an additional consideration -- the continuing deterioration of the Greek economy. Greece's decision to walk away from an almost identical deal in June 2015 resulted in default, the closure of banks, capital controls, and the stalling of commercial activity. The result has been the exacerbation of an already-dire economic crisis. As noted by Edward Scicluna, the finance minister of Malta, \u201cWe were told that Greek debt was at 125 percent but we are now being told that this debt has spiraled to 200 percent and that is alarming, raising even more questions about its sustainability and a solution.\"</p><p>There was also widespread concern and skepticism over Greece's commitment to moving forward with required reforms, with some finance ministers suggesting that the real problem was the \"trust deficit\" which had only widened since Greece walked away from the negotiating table in late June 2015. To this end, Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb said, \"We need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality, and clear proof that those conditions will be implemented at the end of the day.\" He added, \"The conditionality presented by the Greeks is simply not enough.\" Regardless, the discussions prevailed with all parties trying to find common ground. As noted by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group, \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult, but work is still in progress. The issue of credibility and trust was discussed and also, of course, the financial issues.\u201d</p><p>In what could be regarded as a positive development, the full summit of all 28 European Union member states set for July 12, 2015 was cancelled. Since sanction by all 28 member states would be needed to force a \"Grexit,\" the decision to continue negotiations among Euro zone leaders only was being seen as a reprieve of sorts for Greece. Still, all parties remained quite distant in their positions and an actual deal remained elusive on July 12, 2015. Time was running out and Greece was increasingly desperate for an infusion of cash.</p><p>In addition to austerity measures, which were expected to be included in any new deal, there were other areas of consideration. Some of these demands were as follows: the Greek parliament would also have to pass legislation aimed at ameliorating the bankruptcy code, protecting the autonomy of the statistics office, and automating spending cuts if the budget did not hit its intended targets. It was to be seen if these elements would make it into a final deal.</p><p>Making matters more difficult was the fact that hardliners had been issuing additional demands. Of note was the call for veto power for creditor institutions over relevant legislation, the transfer of approximately 50 billion euros (US$56 billion) of state assets to an independent company for sale, and the firing of workers hired in violation of previous bailout commitments. For the hardliners, only with these provisions could there by a foundation for a fresh bailout; however, it was unclear if these particular -- and controversial -- provisions would make it into a final deal.</p><p>Finally, on July 13, 2015, following marathon talks in Belgium, Euro zone leaders agreed to provide Greece with a new bailout package to rescue that country from economic crisis. As stated by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: \"The agreement was laborious, but it has been concluded. There is no Grexit.\"</p><p>The new agreement mandated that the Greek government legislatively authorize and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures by July 15, 2015. These measures included - but were not limited to - increased taxation, ameliorating the value added tax system, ameliorating the sustanability of the pension system, protecting the legal independence of government fiscal data, and creating a mechanism to automatically reduce spending if budget targets are missed. In the long-term, Greece would have to substantially address pension reforms, enact market reforms and labor reforms including the modernization of collective bargaining rights, and privatize the electrical power network. A particularly controversial measure that made it into the deal was a demand that all draft legislation related to Greece's economic health be reviewed by Greece's creditor institutions in what could only be understood as external oversight.</p><p>Of significance was the fact that the Greek deal was contigent upon the activation of all these measures. A tranche of rescue funds would only be released if Greece passed the required legislation -- and the schedule for that release of funds would be aggressive since Greece was set to make a payment to the European Central Bank on July 20, 2015. Without a doubt, this long list of measures, and in particular, the hardline demands related to external oversight that made it into the final agreement, were likely to be regarded as an affront to Greek sovereignty by nationalists. It was abundantly clear that creditor institutions were intent on delivering the message that they now held the power.</p><p>For his part, Greek Prime MInister Tsipras suggested that the agreement foreclosed the possibility of an exit from the Euro zone, saying that \"the possibility of Grexit is in the past.\" Tsipras admittted that the deal was not optimal but nonetheless excluded a controversial proposal to transfer of approximately 50 billion euros ($56 billion) of state assets to an independent fund. However, that amount would be managed and used to recapitalized Greek banks. To this end, Tsipras latched on to the fact that the fund would not be housed in Luxembourg as originally envisioned, as he said, \"The deal is difficult but we averted the pursuit to move state assets abroad.\" He added, \"We averted the plan for a financial strangulation and for the collapse of the banking system.\" Tspiras also acknowledged that the negotiations constituted a \"tough battle,\" but his country had secured a \"growth package.\"</p><p>In fact, the European bloc would offer Greece 86 billion euros in financing over a period of three years -- an amount exceeding the total called for in the Greek proposal. But the rescue funds would be contingent upon the long list of tough austerity measures, including pension program reforms and increased taxation, discussed above. As well, although Greece had sought debt relief, this agreement would consider -- but not guarantee -- the rescheduling of debt payments, while stopping short of actual debt forgiveness or reduction.</p><p>Greeks at home soon railed in outrage against these harsh conditions, with some characterizing the proposed measures as \"punitive,\" and others casting them as the \"humiliation\" of Greece. People took to the social media outlet, Twitter, to express their anger using the hashtag \"#thisisacoup.\"</p><p>But Germany's leader reminded the world that Greece's standing was deeply tarnished not only by its poor economic stewardship, but also its irresponsible negotiating stances ranging from insults to inconsistency. As noted by Chancellor Merkel, \u201cThe situation is extremely difficult if you consider the economic situation in Greece and the worsening in the last few months, but what has been lost also in terms of trust and reliability.\" Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister Edna Kenny reminded Greece of the urgency of the situation as he declared, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them [the Greeks] demonstrating starting tomorrow in their parliament they\u2019re serious about implementing the changes, legislative and structural, that need to be put in place. Every day that this goes on, the eventual solutions are more costly.\u201d</p><p>Greek policymakers themselves were cognizant of those costs. Daniel Munevar, an adviser to former Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis, said, \u201cThe costs for Greece of staying in the euro are reaching a point where the balance could favor Grexit.\" He added, \u201cThe costs being demanded of Greece are so punitive that they are almost impossible to meet.\u201d Nevertheless, Greece signed onto the deal with an eye on averting economic crisis and a forced exit from the Euro zone. While Greece could be sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of the matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be unpopular with the Greece citizenry. Prime Minister Tspiras would have difficult task of selling the terms of the agreement to the rest of the Greek government as well as the Greek citizenry as something other than surrender.</p><p>Nevertheless, by mid-July 2015, the Greek parliament had approved the austerity measures imposed by Greece's creditor institutions despite the prime minister's own objections to the terms. As stated by Prime Minister Tsipras ahead of the vote in parliament, \"I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek economy, but I'm forced to accept them.\" Apparently, the vast majority of Greek members of parlaiment agreed with him.</p><p>While this outcome could only be understood as a \"win\" for Prime Minister Tsipras, it should be noted that he lost the support of dozens of members of parliament from his own Syriza party, and was instead supported by several opposition parties including the the center-right New Democracy party, the centrist To Potami party and the center-left party, Pasok. Among the Syriza defections were former Finance Minister Varoufakis, who condemned the bailout package, calling it as \"a new Versailles Treaty,\" and also Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labor Minister Dimitris Stratoulis.</p><p>It should be noted that Prime Minister Tsipras soon enacted a cabinet shuffle, which included the sacking of all recalictrant members of his party serving in cabinet and replacing them with more pragmatic individuals. Among those retaining a portfolio was Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos. There were also suggestions of early elections to be held later in 2015 -- presumably in response to the friction and divisions now emerging within Syriza.</p><p>Outside parliament, violent clashes broke out between police and protesters who were angered by the notion that Greece would have to assent to the harsh reform agenda outlined by creditors. As well, civil servants went on a 24-hour strike. With some demonstrators using petrol bombs to attack police, security forces responded with arrests and tear gas in an attempt to quell the unrest. To that end, the scene in Athens calmed down although the national mood remained sour.</p><p>Meanwhile, people in other Euro zone countries were themselves skeptical of a continuing relationship with Greece. To this end, there were ratification votes in the offing for the parliaments of several Euro zone member states. But at the end of the day, even the most hardline players such as Germany, Lithuania and Finland, ratified the move. As such, the stage was set for Greece to commence talks aimed at securing a new rescue package via the European Stability Mechanism.</p><p>As well, Europe re-opened the door to funds for Greece. While capital controls would have to be retained to prevent a so-called \"run on the banks,\" the scene in Greece improved as the European Central Bank increased emergency funding via its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) program for the banks. As well, European Union finance ministers approved bridging loans aimed at keeping Greece's finances afloat and thus able to make pending payments to the ECB and the IMF.</p><p>Political Ramifications of the Rescue Deal --</p><p>In August 2015, the domestic political landscape in Greece was fractious as Prime Minister Tspiras attempted to limit the fallout within his Syriza party rising from the unpopular debt deal with creditors. Tspiras assured his party that he would go no further than the reform measures expressly agreed to with the Euro zone. As noted by Tsipras, \"I know well the framework of the deal we signed at the euro zone summit on July 12. We will implement these commitments, irrespective of whether we agree with it or not. Nothing beyond that.\"</p><p>Of course, for many Syriza members, those very measures were bad enough and a betrayal of the party's anti-austerity platform and core principles. For the far-left flank, a bad deal was worse than no deal, and rather than surrender to the harsh terms dictated by creditors for Greece to remain in the Euro zone, they preferred an exit from the bloc and a return to Greece's drachma currency. Of particular note was the vociferous denunciation of the bailout agreement by former Finance Minister Varoufakis, who has repeatedly accused Greece's creditors of violating Greece's sovereignty. In an interview with the German publication, Stern, Varoufakis said, \"It was a financial war. Today you don't need tanks to beat someone. You've got your banks.\"</p><p>For his part, at a meeting of Syriza's central committee, Prime Minister Tsipras made clear that the deal that was forged in mid-July 2015 was the best possible and was taken in order to avert a national catastrophe. He said, \"We are telling the Greek people, loud and clear and with no remorse, that this is the deal we managed to bring to them and if there is someone who thinks that they could have achieved a better deal, let them come out and say that.\"</p><p>With the far-left hardliners continuing to make clear their objections to the rescue deal, it was clear that a chasm was growing within Syriza and one that could well grow into an ideological civil war of sorts. With an eye on containing the dissention, the prime minister called for an emergency Syriza summit to debate a strategy for the party going forward. He also warned recalcitrant Syriza members of parliament that if he could no longer hold a parliamentary majority, he would be forced to call snap elections. That theoretical poll could yield unpredictable results.</p><p>Technical deal made as new deadline looms --</p><p>By mid- August 2015 a technical deal was arranged with the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Stability Mechanism, which would secure for Greece 85 billion euro in funding, and thus enable that country to make its public payments now in arrears. Most crucially, it would permit Greece to make a payment of three billion euros to the European Central Bank on Aug. 20, 2015. In exchange, Greece would have to implement significant structural reforms to the Greek entitlement system, tax hikes, and spending cuts.</p><p>The proposed agreement would have to be debated and approved by the Greece parliament. With the Aug. 20, 2015, deadline in the offing when the European Central Bank payment would have to be made, Prime Minister Tsipras urged members of parliament to approve the technical agreement, stating in a letter: \"The crucial nature of the situation requires the immediate convening of parliament to proceed with the deal's approval and allow the disbursement of the first installment.\"</p><p>But even with the vote on the deal with creditor institutions hanging in the balance, Prime Minister Tsipras's Syriza party was ensconced in an acrimonious power struggle between the hardline anti-austerity advocates and the pragmatists in the party not wanting to be responsible for taking the country into bankruptcy.</p><p>The dissonance was yielding consequences as Parliamentary Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou -- a Syriza member hostile to the deal -- ignored Prime Minister Tsipras' call for an accelerated schedule to vote on the bill ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers. Instead, Konstantopoulou appeared intent on belaboring the legislative process by advancing no shortage of procedural objections. Those objections, however, could not stop the vote from happening and ending favorable for the head of government. Indeed, despite defections from within his own Syriza party, Prime Minister Tsipras won a political victory with support from the pro-Euro opposition parties. As such, the necessary legislation was passed to approve the deal.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras has steadfastly defended his decisions, including his resolution to compromise with creditor institutions. To this end, he said, \"I do not regret my decision to compromise. We undertook the responsibility to stay alive over choosing suicide.\"</p><p>Political dissonance gives way to fresh elections --</p><p>While Greece had secured rescue funds in mid-2015, the terms of the deal were not acceptable to Syriza hardliners, who blasted Tspiras for accepting the conditions. As a result, a breakaway contingent of Syriza members of parliament was growing with former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis urging that a new radical movement be formed. A statement by Lafazanis and several other Syriza members read as follows: \"The fight against the new bailout starts today, by mobilizing people in every corner of the country.\" While the statement did no expressly call for a party split, it nonetheless included the call for a \"united movement that will justify people's desire for democracy and social justice.\" The Syriza government interpreted the statement as a de facto declaration of independence and cast the move as the final step in Lafazanis' decision \"to choose a different path from that of the government and Syriza.\"</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras defended the deal, arguing that he had no choice but to go down this road since the Greek people made it clear that they wished to remain in the Euro zone -- a goal that could not be achieved in any other way. Acknowledging the rebellion present within his own Syriza party, Prime Minister Tsipras indicated that he would seek a confidence vote later in August 2015 when the scheduled debt repayment to the European Central Bank was made. But the confidence vote could augur the end of Tsipras' tenure at the helm of this particular government, as both the conservative opposition New Democracy party as well as the opposition Socialists (known by the acronym PASOK) respectively made clear that they would not back the head of government. While opposition parties gave support to Tspiras to pass the bill needed to ratify the aforementioned deal for the sake of Greece, that goodwill did not extend to the political fortune of a rival.</p><p>By Aug. 20, 2015, with a rebellion brewing within the Syriza party, Prime Minister Tspiras by-passed the confidence motion and instead tendered his resignation, effectively paving the way for fresh elections. In a nationally-broadcast speech, he said, \"The political mandate of the January 25 elections has exhausted its limits and now the Greek people have to have their say.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the hard-left radical members of parliament from Syriza formed a breakaway group. That group soon established its own political party named Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English) and was composed of 25 members of parliament. In this way, it was to be understood as the third largest bloc in the Greek legislative body -- ahead of both the centrist To Potami and the far-right Golden Dawn, which hold 17 seat respectively. Popular Unity was led by former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was conspicuously at odds with Tspiras over the terms of the rescue agreement and famously declared his desire to \"smash the Euro zone dictatorship.\"</p><p>Since Tspiras' Syriza government had been in power less than a year, constitutional provisions required that the second-largest party in parliament be given the mandate to try to form a government. With the conservative New Democracy occupying the second most seats in parliament, they would likely be given that opportunity; however, it was not clear they would be able to actually cobble together a coalition. Ultimately, the mandate for forming a government could be returned to the Greek president, who would then call for snap elections to be held.</p><p>Assuming that an alternative government could not be forged, then Sept. 20, 2015, was the likely date expected for fresh elections to be held in Greece. That outcome loomed when both the conservative flank and the hard-left flank parties attempted to form new governments and failed. As such, with Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, Vassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate and a Supreme Court judge, was named as the country's caretaker prime minister. Greece's first female prime minister would administer the country on an interim basis until elections could be held a month later in September 2015.</p><p>Rival parties were now refocusing their hopes, and looking at the elections as a new opportunity that would end with them taking the reins of power. But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact that Tspiras remained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership mandate.</p><p>For now, however, Greece had at least secured funding for the immediate future. This agreement, in truth, was just a start to a difficult period of negotiations on how to deal with Greece's debt. That debt agenda, realistically, could not substantially be addressed without some degree of debt forgiveness -- but that was a bridge many of Greece's creditors were not yet ready to cross. Indeed, debt relief would not be entertained until October 2015 when Greece's creditor institutions -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund -- would review the implementation of the Tsipras government's reforms.</p><p>Primer on second slate of 2015 parliamentary elections in Greece</p><p>Voters go to polls in Greece in second parliamentary elections in 2015; will PM Tspiras and anti-austerity party Syriza be re-elected or will Greeks opt for another path forward? Election results indicate decisive win for Tspiras and Syriza; coalition building to be the focus going forward: --</p><p>Summary of Greek Landscape</p><p>The spring of 2015 saw Greece under pressure as it suffered a \"liquidity crunch\" at a time when several bills and debt obligations were due to be paid. That liquidity crunch could be alleviated by the release of a tranche of rescue funds from Greece's international creditors; however, those creditors - including the finance officials of the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund - were looking for a comprehensive structural reform plan from Greece to be submitted for approval. In that plan, Greece's creditors were looking for serious austerity measures intended to rein in its social welfare spending, such as reductions of civil service pensions. However, the Greek people have made clear that the radical Syriza government they elected to power at the start of 2015 had to keep its election promises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. Clearly, those demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors.</p><p>Faced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government was considering a referendum, which if ratified, would give the government a mandate to move forward with a plan that could meet the demands of other European finance ministers. The referendum idea aside, another option for Greece would be to default on its payments, exit the Euro zone, and re-adopt the Drachma as its currency. Such a path would likely be catastrophic for Greece; however, the Euro bloc was increasingly frustrated by Greece's failure to meet its reform demands and thus concomitantly accepting of the idea of a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable several years prior was now becoming a real possibility on the Euro zone landscape as the clock ticked ever so close to the June 2015 deadline. That deadline would mark the time when Greece would have to advance its reform agenda in order to secure rescue funding.</p><p>As talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit an impasse in mid-June 2015, speculation about either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek exit from the Euro zone. Finally, on the eve of the highly anticipated June 30, 2015, deadline, Greece rejected a rescue proposal set forth by the European Commission intended to prevent a Greek default. Instead, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras said his country would hold a referendum to seek public ratification on the proposal although he urged fellow citizens to vote against it. His government's position was that a strong national \"no\" vote would add to Greece's leverage against its creditors. Those creditors, however, reminded Greece that a failure to forge a deal with them on structural reforms prior to that June 30, 2015, deadline would essentially result in default and augur catastrophic consequences for Greece.</p><p>Greeks were thus set to go to the polls on July 5, 2015, to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the Greek prime minister had already rejected. After the votes were counted, the result showed a decisive \"no\" vote as Greeks overwhelmingly rejected the rescue package by European creditors. This result meant that Greece was now effectively wading into uncharted territory.</p><p>With a sense of urgency at stake and the clock ticking, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present new proposals for consideration. With two hours to spare, Greece met that deadline although the new slate of proposals from Greece were essentially a repeat of the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015. A key distinction in this new blueprint was the inclusion of a call for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece.</p><p>Finally, on July 13, 2015, a deal to rescue Greece from economic crisis had been reached. The new agreement mandated that the Greek government legislatively ratify and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures. There were also harsh demands by hardliners that were sure to raise the ire of Greek nationalists. It was apparent that Greece's creditors were trying to deliver the message that they now held the power. The good news for Greece was that the full meeting of the European Union was cancelled, making it clear that no vote on a \"Grexit\" would be held immediately. But while Greece could sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of the matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be unpopular with the Greece citizenry.</p><p>To that end, by August 2015, the Greek prime minister had carried out a cabinet shuffle to purge the government of disloyal Syriza members; he was also trying to assuage his party regarding the unpalatable reformist path it has taken. That attempt was not yielding desired results. Instead hardliners within Syriza split from the party to form their own breakaway group and Prime Minister Tspiras resigned as the head of government given his loss of a parliamentary majority. While rival parties tried to establish a replacement coalition government, the fact of the matter was that Greek citizens were headed back to the polls later in the year 2015 for repeat parliamentary elections. It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity would be enough to return him to power.</p><p>Political dissonance gives way to fresh elections --</p><p>While Greece had secured rescue funds in mid-2015, the terms of the deal were not acceptable to Syriza hardliners, who blasted Tspiras for accepting the conditions.

Indeed, debt relief would not be entertained until October 2015 when Greece's creditor institutions -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund -- would review the implementation of the Tsipras government's reforms.</p><p>Greek voters set to decide which party to reward with new mandate for government --</p><p>Parliamentary elections were to be held in Greece on or around Sept. 20, 2015. Of note was the fact that parliamentary elections had actually been held at the start of the year on Jan. 25, 2015, and new elections were not due until 2019. As such, this early polling exercise should be understood as a snap election. Also of note was the fact that this would be the fourth Greek election to be held in less than three and a half years.</p><p>At stake would be the composition of the legislative branch of government. In Greece, the unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" (Parliament) was made up of 300 members who are elected by a system of reinforced proportional representation from 51 multi-seat constituencies and five single-seat constituencies; there is a three percent threshold to obtain seats. Members of parliament are elected to serve maximum four-year terms although elections may be called early.</p><p>The initial slate of parliamentary elections in January 2015 were dominated by the debt crisis rocking the country and were won by the anti-austerity and anti-bailout radical leftist party, Syriza, and led to Alexis Tsipras becoming the new prime minister. Despite the anti-austerity platform of Syriza, Prime Minister Tspiras was forced to compromise with Greece's creditor institutions in order to secure rescue funding needed to keep the country financially afloat, while also maintaining Greece's membership in the Euro zone. This second slate of 2015 parliamentary elections were expected to be dominated by the debt crisis solution -- specifically, the rescue deal and all of its difficult provisions, which left anti-austerity absolutists in the Syriza government in a state of revolt.</p><p>In fact, hardline rebels from Syriza soon formed a breakaway group and established their own political party named Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English). Composed of 25 members of parliament, Popular Unity held the distinction of being the third largest bloc in the Greek legislative body -- ahead of both the centrist To Potami and the far-right Golden Dawn, which hold 17 seat respectively. Popular Unity was led by former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was conspicuously at odds with Tspiras over the terms of the rescue agreement and famously declared his desire to \"smash the Euro zone dictatorship.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, with hardliners within Syriza splintering away from the party to form their own breakaway group, and with a parliamentary majority now gone, Prime Minister Tspiras had resigned as the head of government and called for fresh elections to be held. Rival parties, including the conservative New Democracy and the newly-formed hard-leftist Popular Unity, tried to cobble together a replacement coalition government -- and respectively failed at that task. Ultimately, the mandate for forming a government was returned to the Greek president, who then dissolved parliament and called for snap elections to be held on Sept. 20, 2015.</p><p>With fresh elections ahead and Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, Vassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate and a Supreme Court judge was named as the country's caretaker prime minister. Greece's first female prime minister would administer the country on an interim basis until the snap elections were held.</p><p>Now, the rival parties were refocusing their goals and hoping that they would have a new opportunity at the polls to take the reins of power. But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact that Tspiras remained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership mandate. It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity -- over 60 percent according to polls in mid-2015 -- would be enough to return him to power.</p><p>Polling data at the end of August 2015 indicated that Syriza -- even with the defections from hardliners -- would likely attract the most votes, although not quite enough to secure a parliamentary majority. For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras made clear that if he had to form a future coalition government, he would not be looking to either of the main etsablishment parties -- conservative New Democracy or the social-democratic Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) -- as likely partners. New Democracy was on track to attract the second most votes, and would thus be in place to form a government if Syriza failed at that task. As before, the far-right and neo-Nazi Golden Dawn as well as the centrist To Potami were attracting the middle tier of votes. The newly-formed Popular Unity was in that middle tier. On the other hand, the Independent Greeks were at the bottom of the pack and were at risk of not meeting the three percent threshold needed to enter parliament. But a large segment of the Greek electorate remained undecided, meaning that the outcome of the elections promised to be a mystery to the end.</p><p>By the start of September 2015, the political landscape had changed and Syriza's advantage had eroded. Most polling data showed Syriza sporting only a neglible lead over the center-right New Democracy party. A survey of several polls showed Syriza hovering around 26 percent with New Democracy close behing with 25 percent. Other polls showed the two parties in a dead heat at 25 percent, while at least one poll gave New Democracy the lead. With at least 10 percent of the Greek electorate undecided, the race could go either way.</p><p>By the second week of September, these types of polling numbers remained in place, showing Syriza in a statistical tie with New Democracy.</p><p>In mid-September 2015, with only days to go until election day, there was a host of polling data -- none of it predictive of a conclusive election outcome. Several polls showed Syriza with a small lead over New Democracy; a handful of polls reversed the dynamic with New Democracy slightly leading Syriza. The data collectively presented the picture of a close and competitive race with no one party likely to win a majority.</p><p>But of significance was the addition of new survey data showing that New Democracy's leader , Vangelis Meimarakis, was gaining on Tspiras in terms of popularity. Analysts were suggesting that his forthright persona was resonating well with Greek voters eager for stability. Not one to squander this advantage, Meimarakis displayed his pragmatism when he declared that he was open to an alliance with Syriza in the interests of national unity. By contrast, Tsipras has foreclosed such an alliance. Since the majority of Greeks -- now weary from divisive politics and socio-economic drama -- were actually looking for cooperation, Meimarakis' stance was gaining him additional support. It was to be seen if it would be enough on election day.</p><p>It should be noted that the leaders of both the center-right New Democracy and the radical leftist Syriza were indicating that they would both make good on the commitments by Greece to secure rescue funds, and move forward with the necessary structural reforms.</p><p>Note: The main parties expected to contest the elections were as follows: anti-austerity and radical leftist Syriza; center-right (sometime referred to as conservative) New Democracy; newly-formed, hard leftist, and anti-bailout Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English); ultra-right and neo-Nazi aligned Golden Dawn; centrist To Potami (or The River in English); leftist Communist Party of Greece; right wing populist and nationalist conservative Independent Greeks; leftist and social-democratic Panhellenic Socialist Movement (known mostly by its acronym PASOK).</p><p>Election results --</p><p>Voters in Greece went to the polls for the second time in 2015 to vote in parliamentary elections. As discussed above, polling data predicted a close race; however, the outcome of this election would serve as a reminder that polls were not guaranteed forecasts. When the ballots were counted, it was clear that Prime Minister Tsipras and his radical leftist Syriza party were on track for victory. Indeed, Syriza had outperformed the polling forecast and secured close to 36 percent of the vote and around 144 seats. The center-right New Democracy party was set to garner 28 percent and about 75 seats. In third place was the xenophobic neo-Nazi entity, Golden Dawn, which took seven percent. The rest of the votes went to other parties.</p><p>As expected, no one party won an outright majority. That being said, the party with the plurality of the vote share -- Syriza in this case -- would be positioned to form a coalition government. Having foreclosed the notion of a grand coalition that would include the center-right New Democracy, Syriza would be looking to other smaller parties, such as the centrist To Potami, the socialist PASOK, or their former partners, the right-wing Independent Greeks, to control a majority of seats in parliament. With the Independent Greeks on track to garner about 10 seats, Syriza could very well reconstitute the same coalition it formed after the previous phase of parliamentary elections in 2015. Such a coalition would now be more stable, given the defection of the most hardline and radical anti-austerity players from Syriza.</p><p>Vangelis Meimarakis, the leader of New Democracy, conceded defeat gracefully and urged Tspiras to form a government. He said, \"The electoral result appears to be concluding with Syriza and Mr. Tspiras in the lead. I congratulate him and urge him to create the government which is needed and come to parliament.\"</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tsipras' victory at the polls for a second time in less than a year stood as a vindication of his anti-austerity stance, and a national ratification of his pragmatic decision to accept the harsh terms of the bailout in order to keep Greece solvent and in the Euro bloc. Moreover, Tspiras' victory at the helm of Syriza also signaled a renewed mandate for his leadership.</p><p>In his victory speech before cheering crowds in Athens, Prime Minister Tspiras said, \"In Europe today, Greece and the Greek people are synonymous with resistance and dignity, and this struggle will be continued together for another four years. We have difficulties ahead, but we are also on firm ground. We wont recover from the struggle by magic, but it can happen with hard work.\" He added, \"Together we will continue the struggle we began seven months ago.\"</p><p>Going forward, Greece would not only have to fulfill its obligations to international creditors, it would also have to deal with the unfolding refugee crisis affecting all of Europe.</p><p>Long-standing naming dispute resolved when Greece agrees to recognize \"Republic of North Macedonia\"</p><p>After years of a long-standing dispute in which Greece refused to recognize the name Macedonia of the country claiming that designation, a resolution was reached in June 2018. To that end, Greece said it would recognize Macedonia as \"Republic of North Macedonia\" or \"Severna Macedonja.\u201d </p><p>At the heart of the dispute was the distinction between the larger historical region referred to as Macedonia and the contemporary country -- a successor state following the fragmentation of the former Yugoslavia -- claiming the same name. As a result of this dispute, the country was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 using the temporary designation \"Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia\" (FYROM) until a permanent resolution could be reached. That United Nations decision, at the time, made clear that the contemporary FYROM was also to be distinguished from the Greek area of Macedonia. In 2018, the Greek and Macedonian leadership reached concurrence and agreed that the country would be referred to as \"Republic of North Macedonia\" or \"Severna Macedonja.\u201d </p><p>The concurrence between Athens and Skopje effectively ended the symbolic conflict between the two countries that had lasted more than quarter of a century. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made the announcement following a meeting with President Prokopis Pavlopoulos.</p><p>Primer on 2019 parliamentary elections in Greece</p><p>(July 7, 2019)</p><p>Snap parliamentary elections in Greece were held in July 2019. Since the previous elections of 2015, Greece was governed by Prime Minister Alexis Tspiras and the left-wing populist Syriza party. It was to be seen if Tspiras and Syriza would be able to hold onto power after governing on an anti-austerity platform.</p><p>Once Greek citizens went to the polls and cast their ballots, it was clear that Greece was following a trend of Europe moving in a rightward direction. To this end, the conservative New Democracy party won Greece's snap general election, handing a defeat to leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who conceded defeat.</p><p>Factoring in the fact that Greece gives the winner 50 extra seats in parliament, projections on election night had New Democracy winning an outright majority. New Democracy captured approximately 39.8 percent of the vote with Tsipras's leftist party, Syriza, coming in second with 31.6 percent.</p><p>New Democracy's pro-business leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was set to be the next prime minister. The party ran on lowering taxes, generating economic growth, and privatizing services throughout the country.</p><p>Tsipras came to power in 2015 by campaigning on a platform to end austerity and Greece's international bailout agreement, although he was ultimately forced to accept a bailout worth $100 billion as a result of pressure from the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the prospect of \"Grexit\" (i.e. leaving the Euro currency). Ever since then, support for Syriza had gradually waned since. Combined with rising unemployment and the economy being a fraction of its former size when the debt crisis began, the conditions were ripe for Syriza's ouster.</p><p>The international bailout program for Greece ended in August of 2018, which meant Greece could self-finance again and use financial markets to fund its activities.</p><p>2020 Coronavirus Pandemic Note</p><p>Note that the year 2020 was marked by the coronavirus pandemic across the world. In mid-2020 in Greece, there were 4,193 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 202 deaths. It was evident that Greece was weathering the coronavirus storm better than many other European countries.</p><p>Note on the presidency of Greece</p><p>An indirect presidential election was held in Greece on Jan. 22 2020 to determine the country's new president. Incumbent President Prokopis Pavlopoulos had been elected by the Hellenic Parliament in 2015 and was eligible for re&amp;; however, the government was not advocating his re-election.</p><p>Instead, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced that the government was nominating Ekaterina Sakellaropoulou for the presidency. Sakellaropoulou had served as the President of the Council of State -- the Supreme Administrative Court of Greece -- since 2018.[</p><p>Ultimately, Sakellaropoulou won 261 of 300 votes within parliament and the presidency. She made history as the first female President of Greece. She was inaugurated into power in March 2020.</p><p>-- January 2022</p><p>Written by Dr. Denise Youngblood Coleman, Editor in Chief, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.countrywatch.com\">www.countrywatch.com</url> .

In person he's a charming raconteur who stuck around Salon's New York studio for several minutes after our interview was concluded, live-streaming an impromptu backstage video on Instagram. He seems relatively good-humored about the fact that his last name is most familiar because of other people who share it. (To be clear, those people would be actor <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2021/10/04/netflixs-the-guilty-isnt-as-progressive-and-critical-of-cops-as-it-pretends-to-be/\">Jake Gyllenhaal</url> and actor-director <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/10/12/maggie-gyllenhaal-on-playing-starving-women-which-is-the-way-many-women-are-feeling-right-now/\">Maggie Gyllenhaal</url>, who are his children.)</p><p>In his new film, \"Uncharitable\" - which he doesn't want to call a documentary, for somewhat inscrutable reasons - the seniorGyllenhaal has adopted a peculiar but arguably important social justice crusade: redeeming the reputation and the transformative possibilities of the nonprofit sector and more specifically of \"charities,\" which as he observes has become a mildly poisonous term. Thanks to the repeated attacks of TV journalists, often in the form of misbegotten \"expos \ufffds\" largely devoid of nuance or context, numerous prominent not-for-profit charitable organizations have either been destroyed or radically downsized in this century, amid the widespread perception that they're wasting money on \"overhead\": executive salaries, marketing campaigns, travel, conferences and consultants and so on. Donors often insist that their dollars must go to \"programs\" - whether that means housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, providing medical care to children with disabilities, funding cancer research or any of a million other worthwhile causes - as if those things could happen in an institutional vacuum, with no professional management, strategy or planning.</p><p>The decidedly unsexy but provocative message of \"Uncharitable\" is that given the realities of a capitalist economy - language Gyllenhaal carefully avoids, both in his film and in conversation - the nonprofit sector is crucial to creating social progress and social change, and is being unfairly hamstrung by made-up standards that no one would ever apply to an ordinary for-profit business venture of any scale or any size. We know what the CEOs and other top executives at major corporations earn (and in most cases it's way too much - another issue Gyllenhaal steers around), and we know that billions of dollars are spent every year on advertising and marketing campaigns for consumer products and services whose social value is, shall we say, debatable. Why should charitable nonprofits have to operate by completely different standards, following some invented monastic code, paying starvation salaries and avoiding the kinds of marketing or advertising campaigns that can help organizations become larger and more successful at doing what they do?</p><p>One might argue that the answer to that question lies in the inherited puritanical ethos of capitalism, which essentially holds that working in order to maximize profit and wealth is inherently virtuous and normal, whereas working for the benefit of others - the poor, the disadvantaged and disenfranchised, the sick and injured (or, for that matter, the whole society) - is inherently suspect, the domain of religious zealots and radicals and other marginal characters, who in any case are fine with tiny apartments and 15-year-old Subarus. \"Uncharitable\" put me in mind of Max Weber's famous quip that all Americans are Protestants, whether they think they are or not. So anyway, Stephen Gyllenhaal stopped by to talk about all this, and despite the earnest nature of the message, it was good fun.</p><p>Watch my \"Salon Talks\" with Gyllenhaal here or read a transcript of the interview below,lightly edited for length and clarity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Let's acknowledge right up top that people may recognize your last name and it is not in fact an accident. You are related to other people with that last name; it appears that two of your children have done pretty well.</emphasis></p><p>I don't know, I'm slightly disappointed. I thought they'd make something of themselves.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's hard to be a parent.</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to face these things, and I've learned - I shouldn't really joke about it because there are a lot of parents that really do struggle, of course. In another part of my life I have my own charity, which is about mental health, but I still think you have to joke about everything, even when you're facing really, really dark stuff. So I'm going to keep joking about my sad kids who have made nothing of themselves. And, I'm not riding on their name in any way whatsoever.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Let's get to the reason why we're here. So the minute you say the words \"nonprofit sector\" to someone, how close to sleep are they?</emphasis></p><p>If they're even awake when you get past the word \"non.\" I mean, you might as well shoot yourself making your sector about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">non</emphasis>-something. I think \"nonprofit\" is one problem. Another problem is \"charitable.\"</p><p>I mean, I'm a charitable human being. I say that, and you want to run out of the room. If you use the word charitable, you're a hypocrite. I think the level of skepticism around this sector, which I had as well, is unwarranted but is deeply ingrained in the culture. If you work in the sector and you go back to your class reunion and you say, \"I work in the charitable sector,\" they just look over your shoulder to talk to anyone else. It would've been me. I'm the Hollywood director that, when I go back to my class reunion I'm the star, until I said I was making a movie about charity. Then they have to remember that somewhere I had a career and also I had these kids, so I was still worth listening to. But a lot of the shine went out of their eyes and what they thought of me.</p><p>In fact, it's been profoundly difficult. imagine you have a lot of money, and I say, \"You want to invest in a movie about charity?\" What would you say? We're not going to make any money and we're going to make it on a wing and a prayer, so it's only going to cost whatever. In the end, the movie did not cost nothing, and the marketing of it has not cost nothing, because we made a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">movie</emphasis>, not a documentary. I take offense to that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oh, I'm so sorry. Personally, I like documentaries.</emphasis></p><p>I love documentaries, but I love <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">movies.</emphasis>I tried to make a movie here that's a real movie because I want people to be entertained. I want them to be moved. I want them to learn something, but \"learning\" is also a bad word when it comes to movies, because you want to learn from the heart, not from the head. That was a complicated process with this movie, but I have to say I have never been happier making it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OK, so you wanted to tell a story. A story has to have characters and conflict, and this one definitely does. Your main character is a guy named Dan Pallotta, kind of a famous and in some ways controversial figure in the nonprofit world. Tell us about Dan and why you focused on him.</emphasis></p><p>Dan first was a friend of mine, because we kind of thought the same way about the world. That's really what our connection was. Whatever you work in, you kind of believe you're not that good at it, particularly if you do it well, because if you do it well, you have to admit to having made a thousand mistakes all the time. All the people I know who are amazingly successful in IMDb or in the real world or whatever, when you hang out with them, they feel humbled and oftentimes humiliated because the reality is, you just don't know what you're doing most of the time.</p><p>The people who are the best filmmakers in the world are the ones who never made a movie. Once you've made a movie, you know you're not the best. Even Steven Spielberg, who is a friend, is real and alive and has doubts about himself.</p><p>Dan and I never really talked about what we did, the fact that he was becoming a very successful activist and that I was becoming a pretty successful filmmaker in Hollywood. I had two kids I was raising - again, we talked about the sadness of how they've turned out. It was a lot of work raising them, so I never went on Dan's AIDS rides. I didn't really pay much attention to it, but I knew he dressed well, for one thing,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dan created the AIDS rides, which were a huge deal in the late '90s into the 2000s, approximately speaking, and also created walks for breast cancer. Hugely successful charitable ventures, for a while.</emphasis></p><p>He raised half a billion dollars in unrestricted funds. \"Unrestricted funds\" is a really important piece about this because that means it was given to organizations, AIDS charities being the most benefited by it, to do with as they thought.</p><p>If you look at a lot of charities, they don't work out so well, and a lot of the movie is about that. AIDS research worked out OK because it really took a disease that, at the time, looked like it was going to destroy a huge amount of the population, and eventually made it highly treatable. Because of those unrestricted funds, at least in part. But at the time that Dan did it, Ronald Reagan was president and there was a whole thing about it. It's their fault.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So there was this invented scandal, basically . . .</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, related to the unrestricted funds, which had profoundly impacted that sector. He was destroyed by it.</p><p>I was actually scouting a location in Canada. I remember I was driving down the coast looking for a location, and we were in a production van listening to NPR, and up came the news Dan's venture had all been destroyed. He'd gone under. I hadn't talked to him in a month or two, and I called him right away assuming I wouldn't hear from him for a long time because usually he'd take a week or so to get back to me. He picked up the phone like that. I said, \"What the hell happened? What's going on?\" And he said, \"Well, it's over. It's finished. I'm finished.\" And he said, \"Oh, by the way, you're the third person to call me today. I am now totally a pariah.\" That was my first real intimate connection with all of this.</p><p>Quite a few years later, Dan had moved to Boston and we were having lunch. It was around 2016, and he said, \"Do you think there's maybe a movie in what happened to me?\" And over a sandwich I said, \"It's interesting, but I'm not sure there's really a movie here. More like a home movie really.\" Then when he told me about some of the other people, [leading figures in the charitable sector] like Steven Nardizzi, Jason Russell and Roxanne Spillett, it became clear to me there was a systemic problem, No. 1, which helped me understand what had happened to Dan, because I didn't really, except that it was very dramatic. Also the stories were dramatic. I went, OK, we've got a Marvel movie here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Had he done his TED Talk at that time already?</emphasis></p><p>He had, and he'd written his book [also called \"Uncharitable,\" and the basis for the film]. I didn't know about either one of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So what happened to him and what has happened to the nonprofit sector or the charitable sector generally is this focus on \"efficiency\" and on not spending money on \"overhead.\" Dan's argument is that if you can't spend money on overhead, you completely destroy the mission. Explain why he thinks that's true?</emphasis></p><p>Well, Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, talked about it in one way. He says, \"OK, you want to give all your money to the cause, the homeless cause. Why don't you just go take a bunch of $100 bills and just give them to the homeless people? Why not? That's what you expect.\" That's what people expect, and not just what what individuals who are uninformed think.</p><p>It takes a little while, although not a lot, to understand that if you have homeless people, you have psychological problems, you have physical problems, you have housing problems. Forty percent of the homeless are military veterans, often suffering from PTSD or other mental health issues.You have to have professionals solving the problem, for instance, of homelessness. You have to have infrastructure to have them taken care of. You have to begin to lay out psychological help, physical help. How do you build the politics of setting up a homeless environment? Where do you get housing? In Los Angeles, this is a huge problem. It demands really smart people doing it. Now, there are a lot of smart people in the sector, but they are so beaten down by having to - has anyone out there ever tried to fill out a grant form? Have you ever done that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yeah, it's a nightmare.</emphasis></p><p>You go, \"I want to shoot myself.\" I tried to do a grant for this movie. First of all, nobody would give a grant in the foundations because making a movie is \"overhead.\" How I got here today, in an Uber, that cost money. That was overhead. Everything in the movie is overhead. Yet the movie may have more impact on changing the sector than anything.</p><p>I tried to fill out one of those grants and yeah, I wanted to shoot myself. That's what primarily these charities have to deal with. Or you have to go out and beg for money. We actually ended up raising almost $2 million to make this movie and to market it, to the point where we are.</p><p>Now I'm trying to raise another million dollars to give out free tickets, and we're in the process of doing that. Charity is about helping people in need. Rich people, middle-class people and poor people all are in need of understanding how charity really works. That's what this movie's really about, so we're giving out free tickets. I'm trying to raise money where we would spend 30% on marketing and 70% on giving away free tickets. We're already starting that process, which is a very complicated process.</p><p>Right now I am booking theaters, we're in 34 cities, and we want to be in more cities. So anyone out there who goes, \"Well, you're not in Cincinnati,\" please go to a theater near you and say to them, \"I want to bring the movie here.\" Connect with our team. They will help set up all the charities in the area to help fill the theaters. We also want to move beyond charities, ultimately, into the mainstream. It's a movie! It's not a boring documentary. OK, documentaries are not boring, but they have their own reputation that's hard to shake. The dynamics of really changing this sector, the dynamics of allowing charities to do their work, is very expensive. All money is energy and we're trying to move energy into this sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dan's argument, if I understand it correctly, is that if nonprofits, charitable organizations, are a type of business, they need to be allowed to operate by the same rules as other businesses. But effectively they are not, because of demands that are put on them that are not put on Coca-Cola or Amazon or Google or Apple or any other giant corporation. Is that fair?</emphasis></p><p>Totally fair. I would say, I'm not sure which version of the movie you saw, because I've been finishing it. I finished it literally a week ago because I'm a crazy filmmaker. I'm one of those people who drive everybody crazy. Did you see the version where the video comes on at the end and Dan says, \"Please donate\"?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I don't think so.</emphasis></p><p>You didn't, because that's just in the last couple of weeks. So what we're doing is: Go see the movie for free, and at the end it asks you to donate so other people can see it for free. We're trying to build a forest fire of energy around the movie. I'm seeing, now that the movie is done, that it helps to have that little video because it tells the audiences there's a call to action. A QR code comes up and you do this whole thing.</p><p>Another piece of it is to sign the Uncharitable Pledge, which is basically about the \"five discriminations\" [against charitable organizations] that Dan lays out. One of those is about competitive compensation. You should get paid as well, or almost as well, as you would in the for-profit sector. If you're a CEO - for instance, Milton Little in talks about how he had a funder who said, \"You can make no more than $65,000 a year.\" He says, \"But I'm running $100 million organization.\" The funder says, \"It doesn't matter, you should only make $65,000.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Which is a demand nobody would ever even consider for a for-profit business that was at that level. Everybody would expect that CEO to be making well into the six figures, or maybe seven.</emphasis></p><p>So why should CEOs make into the six figures? I think sometimes it's too much, but if the company's doing really well, who cares? People have too much money, that's another problem. Too much money. You talk to kids who are from families that have too much money, that's a problem too. But if someone is making a couple of million dollars, you would hope that means the people under them are doing well too. If your CEO is making $65,000, the people under that are making nothing and then it means you need to work with volunteers.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with volunteers, except when you're dealing with profoundly complicated problems. The thing that's interesting about the sector, as I've gotten deeper and deeper into it, it's that one thing to make Coca-Cola or even a Tesla. Those are products. In the charitable sector you are working with people, and working with almost intractable problems that we generally feel pretty hopeless about. We don't really expect them to get better, but what we're talking about is actually solving these problems.</p><p>Billy Shore, who's in the film, has actually made it possible that almost every kid in the United States will not go hungry by using all these various methods. It took a very sophisticated, very brilliant person. You're either going to find them at all the best schools, people who are not working in the sector now who are going into it, or you're going to unleash the ones who are already there. A lot of people in the sector are terrific, but they are so hamstrung by one grant after the other grant after other grant and then having to kiss some funder on the a**. Sorry. But we are on Salon so it's OK.</p><p>I have had spectacular donors on this movie, and they've had their little moments when they've been worried that I don't know what I'm doing, making a movie. Well, I don't know what I'm doing. That's the biggest thing you have to learn when you're making a movie. You don't know what you're doing, so you have to rely on other people. I had great people helping me make this movie. I'm lucky to have had a lot of experience in it and I also know it takes a long time to figure out what the hell you're doing.</p><p>I remember a great moment watching Francis Ford Coppola shoot on Sullivan Street when I lived in the city and he was doing \"Godfather II.\" He had a big megaphone, a lot of people gathered around, maybe like 2,000 people in the street. It was a funeral scene at that church on Sullivan Street and West Houston there was a coffin, and he goes, \"OK, everybody go back three feet.\" Then, \"No, no, go five feet forward.\" \"Oh, s**t. Oh, can we take those three people . . .?\" He went on for like 20 minutes, and that was a huge lesson. He didn't know what the hell he was doing until he kind of figured it out, and that is one of the great movies of all time, in my mind.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's underneath this film, to me a central problem in the way our economy is structured. It's about a word that I don't believe appears in your film, that word being \"capitalism.\" I don't know if that was a deliberate decision. But Dan talks about the fact that making profit is seen as virtuous in our world and doing what charities and nonprofits do is seen as a little bit dubious or marginal.</emphasis></p><p>I would correct one thing which I get caught into. It's not \"nonprofit.\" It's not-for-profit,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Not-for-profit. Thank you.</emphasis></p><p>That's important because I think there are a lot of companies that may make a profit, but it's not for profit, it's for the mission. For instance, Dan talked about it at one point in something I heard recently: The refrigerator changed food. Elon Musk, whatever you think of him, changed the auto business. Steve Jobs and the computer, profound effect. Steve Jobs never did anything for charity overtly, but he changed it.</p><p>So am I a capitalist? Am I a for-profit person? I've been in Hollywood my whole life. There've been some movies where I've been nonprofit, but there've been other movies and things I've done where it's been for-profit. The thing is there's about 10% of the population that don't really have a market, so the capitalist system is better than any other system, not great, but better than any other system. It's sort of like what Churchill said about democracy: It sucks, it's lousy, but it's better than anything else. I think is the same thing true here so far. I think I'm a progressive, I love AOC, all that kind of stuff, but I also am aware and honor the right-wing.</p><p>A couple of examples: one is a lot of my donors, in fact, a majority of my donors are conservatives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">That's interesting.</emphasis></p><p>The reason why is because charity also is not using government. But also the left-wing is very interested because it's involved social programs. So for instance, Bill O'Reilly, who's in the movie who made a mistake about Dan, but Bill O'Reilly supported and brought in Steve Nardizzi around Wounded Warrior and said, \"This is wrong.\" I don't agree with Bill O'Reilly about a lot of stuff, but also I grew up in a very conservative environment, I grew up in a religious environment. I left mainly except I have a lot of friends there and a lot of them are Trumpers and their argument is sort of like the end justifies the means, which is what they used to say the communists said, so it's all complicated. But I think charity is nonpartisan and part of what I think the movie is about more than anything else is how the audience feels.</p><p>You walk out on an unconscious level going, I hope by the end of the movie, we go some dark places, I mean we go down to Bosch, that weird, horrible hell and all the apocalyptic movies and all those things. I really wanted on purpose to take us down, down, down to the worst possible thing, and the despair I think we feel now, the hopelessness we feel and the cynicism that we feel now and then slowly bring you out to a sense of real hope at the end.</p><p>I retired from the movie business. I wanted to let my poor sad kids take it over. They're doing fine, the Gyllenhaal name is doing just fine, I'll retire. But when I got into this, and also I was like, there's no place for me. I'm older now, the whole older thing, and I'm a white guy too. There's a problem. And, I agree there's a problem with us white guys. I got a daughter who's now directing and got a son, but we're all white. I think you were talking earlier about how inexpensive it is now to [make a movie].</p><p>The song at the end, which is a very sophisticated song produced by Joel Sill who started with doing \"Easy Rider\" and has done everything since, he figured out a way to do that song at the end with everyone singing from around the world with iPhones which is 4K. Why is that so important? Because it means that rich white people, used to be men, can make movies. One of the things I've been really aware of is that where are the best stories being told? They're with kids who know cinema. These kids may not be able to do grammar because they have lousy schools and all that kind of stuff. They know film inside out. One of the things that moves me really deeply about homelessness for instance, and the fact, oh, we can't solve the problem of homelessness. Well, we haven't yet. We also haven't solved the problem of fires catching, so do we get rid of fire departments? I don't think it's a smart idea. But in LA there are kids who are homeless who go to the library, the public library, who at night lean up against the wall so they can get wifi.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I've seen that happen in the Bronx, which is where I live.</emphasis></p><p>Those are the kids that are going to solve climate change. Those are the kids who are dealing with really complex issues and are developing minds that if they are just nourished a little bit, which is what these services do now, will solve these problems. That's why this is such an important sector and why it needs to be made far more robust and why I think the film finally is about each of us, rich, middle class, white, trans, anything at all. With all this wonderful mosaic of all of us, if we can feel charity inside of ourselves, if the film can help . . . And I think one of the things I would hope in theaters is the people . . . I'm going to be at the Angelic, I'm going to be wherever I can be at screenings. I've learned you're the director, big deal, if there are three people in there, you speak to them and you're there for them because those are three people are seeing this.</p><p>I want people to talk to each other. I want to really have it be a time when you begin to take the skeptical part of yourself, honor the skeptical part of yourself, that scientific methodology, but begin to allow more in the charitable part, the kind part. And capitalism, coming back to that is a really important piece. But the other piece which is giving and caring is critical. Not just for the species to survive, but for each of us to have fun. I mean, I'm having so much fun doing this now and I'm coming back into the movie business because I'm going, wow, there's stuff to do here. I'm going to keep going until they drag me away or until I'm dead. That's my position.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Would you agree and would Dan Pallotta agree that, OK, unleashing this sector seems really important and you make a really good case for that. There are problems in the world that this kind of essentially private foundation level endeavor cannot solve. We cannot solve climate change through not-for-profit foundations. That has to happen, as one example, that has to happen at a global governmental and intergovernmental scale. Do you think that's true?</emphasis></p><p>Totally. I think first of all, what is going on now though? First of all, let's take it one step at a time. There are trillions of dollars locked up in the charitable sector in which 5% is just spun off in a year. The idea of keeping that money in place is problematic. I've been sort of talking about it as financial constipation. It's like let it go. All these billions of dollars, all this money, all this . . .</p><p>I know so many - I know because I'm very privileged and white and male and in Hollywood, all that kind of stuff - I know many, many, many families who are billionaires who have everything, five houses, all that kind of stuff. They're not happy and their children, it breaks my heart some of the things that happen to those kids, how lost they get believing that stuff solves something. It's not great to be poor. It's not great anywhere right now because we have a feeling of hopelessness. It's not hopeless.</p><p>To come to your question, first of all, there's trillions of dollars that should be let loose. They almost let some of it loose during the pandemic, because they're holding onto it because they're afraid. These people are afraid. We're all afraid. Dr. Gabor Mat \ufffd, who's in the . . . movie that I made, \"In Utero\" said, \"Safety is not in protection. It's in connection.\" Having a gun in your house to protect yourself from thieves may very likely get your child killed. But going to your next door neighbor, having a party hanging out, no matter what neighborhood you, I don't care if you live in a f**king mansion or if you live in next to nothing or if you're even homeless, connect with everyone else. You're going to be much safer, much, much safer.</p><p>It's all about connection and comes back to theaters. So secondly, the connection between the charitable sector and government, for instance or the charitable sector and a mission-driven sector and the for-profit sector is what has to be expanded. If we really make the charitable sector powerful, and this is sort of the strategy behind all this. It's going to, for want of a better word, infect the other two.</p><p>For instance, civil rights and all the laws that changed around civil rights started with nonprofits. All those kinds of things, they were all nonprofits and they were fueled by donations. And as that grew and built in, then there were donations from other sectors, white sectors, Jewish sectors, all those kinds of things that really moved that forward, drove it forward and kept it going.</p><p>\"An Inconvenient Truth,\" which by the way was a movie that really began an impact, Meredith Blake, who's one of the executive producers on the film, was the impact producer on \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" and said, \"This is the next movie that will have as much impact as 'An Inconvenient Truth.'\"</p><p>The problem with \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" the challenge was, it was Al Gore, so it kept half of the world out. It was almost, if you could have just had Ronald Reagan do that thing, then the left wing would've said it's bad, and then the right wing would be doing climate change and going, we got to . . . So it's like you're going, \"Can we get over this thing?\" I think that's a piece of this is that if we are charitable, if we connect, I mean, I had said to someone, when this movie comes out, I want to be on Tucker Carlson show and I want to speak to all that stuff. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2023/04/24/earth-shaking-moment-watch-fox-news-announce-tucker-carlsons-departure-live-on-the-air/\">Well, he's gone</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">He doesn't have a show anymore. So, you're here instead.</emphasis></p><p>But I would go on Bill O'Reilly's show because even though he's in the movie in a bad way, he was also in the movie in a good way because we have to reach across. I think that's where the charitable sector works also, that we're not going to get our senators and congressmen who've got to get elected and are doing all the things they have to do to do it. If we can get to the mainstream, if we can get them to open up, and it has to only be a little bit, all you need is five or six votes and we'll get things through that we need to get through and we have to respect each other.</p><p>I can go on and on and on and on and on and on. You cannot get me out. You got to drag me out of these rooms now. But there's so much to talk about, but it's like the truth is those of us who are progressives can learn a thing or two about family from the conservatives. We can learn a thing or two about the universe is huge. I mean, I am not irreligious, I grew up being religious, but I certainly have kind of gone, well my son, my eight-year-old son who loves Marvel movies and loves all those things, said \"Dad, dad, what was there before The Big Bang?\" \"And what is it all going into?\" And you're going, \"Guys, gals, whatever. We haven't answered that question.\" We live without really any understanding. And the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2023/09/14/webb-telescope-photographs-baby-star-resembling-our-sun-blasting-hot-molecular-material/\">James Webb Telescope</url>, which I adore, which is going, it's way bigger. We can learn. We being I am progressive, can learn a tremendous amount from their efforts to try and make some sense out of it. I disagree with a lot of it, but it opens doors there. So the fact that we go after each other the way we do, or have been forced to go after each other the way we do. And in a way, the battles between the right and the left that go on and the things we get fed are not all that different from what we've been fed about the charitable sector and going after.</p><p>That's why media is so important. That's why this movie is so important. That's why people really should go see it. First of all, it's fun and it's interesting and it's inspiring and blah, blah, blah, blah. And we want to get box office and then it'll be in streamers, it'll be in the educational things. And we are going to probably make a TV show after this.</p><p>What we're going to do, finally, I think I want to get to is something Dan came up with a long time ago having done the AIDS rides and all these things and having seen more than anything else, it wasn't the raising of money for the charity, it was more about the connection between people.</p><p>I think the next piece of all this, and I'm not going to do all this, but I'm going to pull in people who've made a fortune and go, \"What am I doing with my life?\" I'm going to go, \"Come help me, help this, put this together. Go back to creating these big events where people connect with each other.\" And one of the things Dan talked about when he came up with this idea was, you're all walking down . . . Bikes are tough, particularly when you get older. I'm not going to ride a bike. I know. We're almost done. We got to stop. We got to stop. You got to just tell me \"Cut.\" You got to just say \"Cut. We're done with you. We're done. Please go away.\"</p><p>He just said you walk down with a hundred people and there'd be a sign that says, \"Turn to the next person, tell them what most scares you.\" And one person would be a climate change person and the other would be a sex trafficking person, right and left. That's sort of what's going on right now. And you're going, and the two people talk to each other, one is a kid, a teenage kid dealing with whatever. People start connecting with each other and then a little while later, now turn to the other person and say it. So the idea of connection, connection, connection warms us up, and that's really what ultimately this is all about.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69H6-YHX1-JCBN-14F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5442\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Salon.com, LLC.

Across Canada, several provinces and territories are experiencing a severe wildfire season, and the effects are already widespread. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting communities affected by wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources; the Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness; the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services; the Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance; and the Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, provided an update on the actions that the Government of Canada has taken so far to support communities impacted and threatened by wildfires and how it will continue to support Canadians through this year's fire season and future seasons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Current projections indicate that this may continue to be a challenging summer for wildfires in parts of the country. Forecasts for warm, dry weather indicate the potential for increased fire activity across much of Canada. Natural Resources Canada publicly shares forecasting for the fire season with full transparency regarding the uncertainty inherent in these projections.</p><p>The Government Operations Centre is working to coordinate the federal response to the wildfire situation across the country. Officials are working closely with federal and provincial partners to coordinate this assistance. Efforts are ongoing in Alberta to support the province's Request for Federal Assistance, and additional federal support is available to all communities facing the threat and devastation of ongoing wildfires.</p><p>With federal and provincial contributions, the Government of Canada's donation matching program with the Government of Alberta and the Canadian Red Cross has already raised approximately $20 million to support Canadians who have been impacted by wildfires in the province. The Government of Canada will be establishing similar matching programs with Nova Scotia through the Canadian Red Cross and with the Northwest Territories through United Way.</p><p>In addition to providing an update on the present situation, the Ministers also announced that through the Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate Program (FMWCC), the Government of Canada has signed nine agreements through the first phase of the Wildfire Training Fund, a $37.9-million fund designed to hire, train and retain firefighters in communities that need this support the most. These agreements amount to over 300 Indigenous firefighters and 125 Indigenous fire guardians being hired and trained this season.</p><p>In light of the urgent wildfire conditions in Canada, Natural Resources Canada is pleased to be working with the International Association of Fire Fighters to advance a pilot project that would increase Canada's wildfire fire fighting capacity. This project would be focused on training structural firefighters to respond to fires in the wildland-urban interface due to the particular risks those fires pose to homes, communities, and infrastructure.</p><p>This project builds on the Government of Canada's commitment of $256 million over five years to establish the FMWCC program wildfire Equipment Fund, a dedicated federal fund to support provinces and territories in procuring specialized firefighting equipment such as vehicles, mobile units, avionics upgrades, hoses, pumps and enhanced communications equipment. The federal funding has been contributed to six provinces and territories for equipment procured in 2022-2023, and it's expected all provinces and territories will participate in the fund this year.</p><p>Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) continues to support First Nations through the Emergency Management Assistance Program (EMAP) to deal with this especially challenging time. Through EMAP, ISC keeps in close contact with affected First Nations and can advance funds or reimburse them for eligible expenses, as needs are identified during daily communications with leadership and other partners such as tribal councils as well as provinces and territories.</p><p>Through these investments and other ongoing actions, the Government of Canada is committed to supporting Canadians as all orders of government work together during the 2023 wildfire season.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Canadians from coast to coast to coast have felt the impact of intense wildfires. These fires threaten our communities, livelihoods and our environment. That is why the federal government is taking action -- including training more firefighters, helping provinces and territories procure vital equipment, and developing cutting-edge monitoring technology -- to better prepare for, adapt to and fight the effects of wildfires. We will continue to work across government and with Indigenous communities to keep people safe and secure through this wildfire season and seasons to come.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources</p><p>\"In communities right across Canada, we have seen an incredibly difficult and dangerous start to the wildfire season. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with all orders of government and Indigenous communities to support Canadians who have been impacted. Thank you to all the firefighters, Canadian Armed Forces members, first responders, search and rescue personnel and community volunteers on the frontlines for their incredible work keeping Canadians safe.\"</p><p>The Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council and Minister of Emergency Preparedness</p><p>\"First Nations communities are often the first to be affected by climate change. As climate-related emergencies become more frequent, Indigenous Peoples are increasingly facing dangerous, destructive and life changing situations. The unprecedented wildfire season this year is incredibly stressful and emotionally devastating for the many affected communities. We are working with leadership to protect life and property. Indigenous Services Canada will continue to support affected First Nations through the Emergency Management Assistance Program (EMAP), and when the time comes, we will be there to help with the rebuilding effort.\"</p><p>The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services</p><p>\"Albertans and Canadians, including many Indigenous communities, have been devastated by the forest fires raging through northern and central Alberta. Our government continues to work closely with our provincial counterparts to send the resources and help needed to keep Albertans and Canadians safe and fight the wildfires. To all the firefighters and first responders across the country and from abroad who are helping to save lives you have my deepest thanks.\"</p><p>The Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance</p><p>\"The Government of Canada will be there for Nova Scotia and other communities being ravaged by wildfires. The first responders who are keeping us safe are amongst the very best in the world at what they do. Thank you for putting yourselves at risk to keep the rest of us safe. I am so pleased to welcome this investment in training to ensure that you have the resources you need to do this life-saving work.\"</p><p>The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* A Request for Federal Assistance is initiated when an emergency event overwhelms or threatens to overwhelm the resources of a province or territory and additional federal resources are needed to effectively support the impacted region.</p><p>* Should a province or territory make an official Request for Federal Assistance, there is a well-established process in place for managing the request, through the Government Operations Centre, and includes provincial, territorial and interdepartmental consultation and coordination.</p><p>* Provincial and territorial authorities are the first to respond when a major natural disaster occurs in their jurisdiction. If an emergency requires more resources than the affected province has available, it may ask the federal government for additional resources, which can include Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel and equipment. When the CAF responds to such a crisis, known as Operation LENTUS, assistance is provided to complement and enhance provincial and local resources by helping to stabilize the situation and reassure residents in affected areas.</p><p>* Under Natural Resource Canada's Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate program Training Fund, a two-year Training Pilot is being implemented with a focus on providing support to Indigenous communities and organizations to train firefighters and to better understand the needs and barriers in the sector. A fully launched fund in 2024-2025 will be informed by the learning obtained from the projects under the pilot. The following Indigenous communities and organizations are receiving funding for training now:</p><p>- Yukon First Nations Wildfire, to train 130 wildland firefighters, including to the Type 1 firefighter standard, across the Yukon and Northern British Columbia;</p><p>- Mushkegowuk Tribal Council Communities, for three of the Ontario First Nation communities they represent, to train 30 individuals in SP100 standard wildland firefighting;</p><p>- Prince Albert Grand Council, for its Indigenous Wildfire Stewards Pilot Program, to train approximately 125 wildland firefighters as Indigenous Fire Stewards and hire Elder Advisors;</p><p>- Independent First Nations Alliance, to train 45 community members in SP100 and SP103 standard wildland firefighting across five Ontario communities;</p><p>- Manitoba Metis Federation, to train 12 community members to the Type 2 wildland firefighter standard to combat wildfires in Manitoba;</p><p>- Miawpukek First Nation (MFN), to train 34 firefighters with Fire Smart training in the MFN territory in Newfoundland and Labrador;</p><p>- Tsilhqot'in National Government, to train 20 community members to the Type 2 Indigenous Initial Attack firefighter standard in six Tsilhqot'in communities in British Columbia;</p><p>- Innu Nation, to train 13 community members in wildland firefighting in Newfoundland and Labrador; and</p><p>- Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, to train 24 Indigenous firefighters to the Type 2 wildland firefighting standard in two communities in Nova Scotia.</p><p>* Under Natural Resource Canada's Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate program Equipment Fund, provinces and territories can cost-share investments for equipment, such as vehicles, mobile units, avionics upgrades (parts), hoses, pumps, enhanced communications equipment, repair of aging equipment and training. The following six provinces and territories have received funding to date:</p><p>- Alberta, to purchase equipment including water delivery skid units, trailers, drones, personal protective equipment and chainsaws;</p><p>- British Columbia, to purchase equipment including flight simulator computer components, water tanks, generators, pumps, forklifts and trailers;</p><p>- Northwest Territories, to purchase equipment including aircraft, vehicles, dispatch consoles and dust suppressant;</p><p>- Nova Scotia, to purchase equipment including radios, trailers, hoses and chainsaws and to provide Incident Management Team (IMT) training to additional staff;</p><p>- Saskatchewan, to purchase equipment including radios, pumps, sprinklers and hoses; and</p><p>- Yukon, to purchase additional wildfire equipment, hire additional wildland firefighting personnel and increase the capacity and frequency of wildland fire-based training throughout the year.</p><p>* ISC's EMAP reimburses First Nations, provinces and territories and third-party emergency management providers 100 percent of eligible response and recovery costs, including evacuation costs.</p><p>* ISC has so far provided more than $40 million for the current 2023 wildfire season. As of May 31, advance payment funding has been provided to Alberta, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Manitoba and Nova Scotia. These funds are intended to cover costs associated with evacuations including transportation, accommodations and meals. Funds also cover emergency response measures including establishing fire guards and putting in place Emergency Operation Centres where possible. In addition to advance payments, communities seeking reimbursement after an emergency are encouraged to submit estimates or invoices as quickly as possible to help ensure a timely community recovery.</p><p>* As the wildfires are still active, ISC continues to support communities affected and is in daily contact with leadership to discuss the day-to-day plans and supports required, as well as the long-term actions needed to support the communities that have had a loss of infrastructure.</p><p>* FPT partners are working together under the auspices of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers to implement the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy to enable national wildfire resilience.</p><p>* Current information on national fire conditions is available publicly at all times through NRCan's Canadian Wildland Fire Information System. Additionally, during the fire season, the Canadian Forest Service supports emergency and fire management agencies through the development of situation reports (fire weather forecasts, situational awareness) and the delivery of fire growth and behaviour models.</p><p>* The Government of Canada, through Environment and Climate Change Canada, is committed to providing support to all our partners by supplying weather information including detailed precipitation and wind forecasts, smoke dispersion predictions and air quality forecasts. Access the latest weather information with weather.gc.ca.</p><p>* Canada's first National Adaptation Strategy, released in November 2022 for a final 90 days of engagement with provinces, territories, and National Indigenous Organizations, sets an overarching vision for climate resilience in Canada, including with respect to disaster resilience. The Government of Canada Adaptation Action Plan, released alongside the Strategy, announced new funding of up to $284 million over five years to reduce the risks of wildfire in our communities, including by enhancing community prevention and mitigation activities, supporting innovation in wildland fire knowledge and research, and establishing a Centre of Excellence for Wildland Fire Innovation and Resilience.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2023/06/the-government-of-canada-provides-update-on-firefighter-training-and-support-for-canadians-through-the-2023-wildfire-season.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2023/06/the-government-of-canada-provides-update-on-firefighter-training-and-support-for-canadians-through-the-2023-wildfire-season.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8174339 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8174339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CF-9CR1-JC11-14DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2470\"/><timeReceived>11:47 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 2, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They claim wildfire retardant drops are expensive, ineffective and a growing source of pollution for rivers and streams.</p><p>\"There's no scientific evidence that it makes any difference in wildfire outcomes,\" said forester Andy Stahl. \"This is like dumping cash out of airplanes, except that it's toxic and you can't buy anything with it because it doesn't work.\"</p><p>Now, a federal lawsuit in Montana that seeks to stop the U.S. Forest Service from dropping retardant into water could reshape how the agency battles wildfires throughout the western United States.</p><p>The case is being watched particularly closely by officials in California, where an extremely wet winter is likely to stoke the growth of so-called connecting fuels - grasses that can carry small flames from a spark on a roadway to chaparral and forested areas.</p><p>\"This is going to destroy towns and many communities in California, if they allow this to go through,\" said Paradise Mayor Greg Bolin, whose town was razed by the Camp fire in 2018. \"To maybe save a few fish, really?\"</p><p>The lawsuit, filed by the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, of which Stahl is executive director, accuses the Forest Service of violating the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters without a permit.</p><p>The action comes as more retardant is being dropped from the air than ever before amid longer, more active fire seasons. In 2021, 52.8 million gallons of retardant were dumped on federal, state and private land, compared with a 10-year average of about 39 million gallons per year, according to figures provided by the Forest Service. More than half of the retardant the Forest Service used on national forest lands was dropped in California - more than any other state.</p><p>The Forest Service primarily uses ammonium phosphate-based retardant, which is intended to coat vegetation and other fuels around the edges of a fire to deprive advancing flames of oxygen. The goal is to slow fire spread and lessen its intensity so crews on the ground get a chance to directly attack it.</p><p>But the chemical, which is also used as fertilizer, can kill aquatic life. For example, in Santa Barbara County, dozens of endangered steelhead trout were killed in Maria Ygnacio Creek during the 2009 Jesusita fire. UC Santa Barbara scientists documented elevated ammonia levels in the water and concluded the fish kill was likely due to retardant drops.</p><p>The Forest Service has dropped more than 760,000 gallons of retardant into water, both accidentally and under an agency directive that such drops are permissible if they mitigate threats to human life or public safety, according to figures the agency released last year.</p><p>Plaintiffs in the case have asked the court to enjoin the Forest Service from spilling retardant into waterways. However, the Forest Service contends in court documents that the only way to do so is to stop using retardant altogether - an action that they say would deprive the service of a crucial firefighting tool.</p><p>Plaintiffs, however, say the Forest Service could instead increase the width of buffer zones alongside waterways where no retardant can be dropped.</p><p>After the suit was filed, the Forest Service asked the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a general permit to cover the discharge of retardant into waterways. The EPA estimates the process will take about 2? years.</p><p>Facing the potential prospect of the Forest Service not being able to apply retardant from the air for more than two years, more than a dozen communities and interest groups have petitioned to intervene in the case. They include Paradise, Butte and Plumas counties in California and trade organizations representing private firefighting companies, the timber industry and agriculture.</p><p>\"The impacts that everybody is experiencing in California and beyond are so dramatic that we have no option other than to build a coalition to try to cease any action that would result in a higher risk as it relates to wildfire damages,\" said Matt Dias, chief executive of the California Forestry Assn.</p><p>Members of the trade group, which represents lumber mills, veneer plants and biomass facilities in the state, have lost hundreds of thousands of acres to wildfire over the past several years, he said. The effects extend beyond the forest products industry to include the loss of hundreds of lives, the depletion of carbon stocks and recreational opportunities, the degradation of air quality and the economic devastation of rural communities, he added.</p><p>\"My understanding is that fire retardant is not good for waterways, but think of the other side of it,\" said Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter, who lost his home in the Camp fire. \"A massive forest fire burning down a huge amount of acreage is probably worse for the environment.\"</p><p>The Camp fire was the deadliest wildfire in California history, killing 84 people. Although retardant was unable to be used to save Paradise because the blaze moved too quickly, generating 100-mph winds and thick clouds of black smoke that grounded air tankers, retardant did stop the flames from spreading to nearby Chico and Durham, Bolin said.</p><p>The legal wrangling prompted U.S. Reps. Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale, and Jimmy Panetta, D-Carmel, to introduce a bill on March 14 that would explicitly exempt firefighting agencies from having to obtain a permit for retardant use.</p><p>The lawsuit is the latest salvo in a decades-long battle between the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics or FSEEE and the Forest Service over the agency's use of retardant. The nonprofit first sued the Forest Service in 2003 for failing to conduct the appropriate environmental analyses to use aerial retardant; a federal court ruled the agency must do so. The nonprofit again sued the Forest Service in 2008, alleging its environmental analysis was inadequate, and the court ruled the Forest Service had to do a more thorough analysis by the end of 2011.</p><p>That's when the Forest Service agreed to map out exclusion areas where it would refrain from dropping retardant absent a risk to public safety, including buffers around vulnerable species habitat and waterways. The EPA told the agency at the time that if pilots complied with these guidelines, they would not need a permit, as they would not be discharging retardant into waterways.</p><p>But in a report released last year, the Forest Service admitted that it had dropped more than 1 million gallons of retardant into exclusion areas on 459 occasions from 2012 through 2019. Retardant landed in water on 213 of those occasions, representing less than 1 percent of the roughly 56,868 retardant drops the Forest Service made during that time frame, the agency said in court documents.</p><p>While the lawsuit primarily concerns the dropping of retardant into water, the issue of whether it works as intended has also been raised in court documents.</p><p>The Forest Service has argued that a prohibition on discharges of retardant into water would impair its firefighting capabilities and jeopardize safety, doing a disservice to the public interest. The FSEEE has argued, however, that the agency lacks evidence that aerial retardant actually accomplishes those goals.</p><p>Studies performed by Forest Service scientists have concluded that aerial retardant slows fire spread in laboratory-based and experimental fires, but that its effectiveness in the field is dependent on environmental conditions like slope, fuel type, terrain and weather.</p><p>\"Aerial retardant is effective over a narrow range of conditions, and the windows of opportunity for those conditions are narrowing each year due to climate change,\" said Timothy Ingalsbee, a former wildland firefighter and executive director of the nonprofit Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology, which is not involved in the lawsuit.</p><p>Retardant is most effective when used in the cool of the morning on relatively level terrain with sparse vegetation during the initial attack of small fires burning near communities, he said.

Photo: AFP / Sabrina BLANCHARD  <br/> Firefighters told local media their priority was to stop the fires from reaching thick forest in the north of Evia. <br/>Some residents said they had ignored evacuation orders to stay behind and save their homes. <br/>As the sweeping wall of fire laid siege to one village after another in the north of the island, firefighters toiled to protect the town of Istiaia. <br/> Fires on the Greek island of Evia in a satellite image taken last week Photo: Planet Labs / Handout  <br/>Thick and suffocating smoke on Monday also enveloped the coastal region of Pefki, where hundreds of villagers had been evacuated by sea. <br/>The Greek coastguard said over 2,700 people had been evacuated by its forces and by private vessels over the last 10 days, most of them from Evia. <br/>This included some 350 people evacuated from villages around Pefki, many of whom spent the night in a ferry moored near the long beach. <br/> With only branches, residents of Evia island in Greece fight desperately to control wildfires that have charred vast areas of pine forest, destroyed homes and forced tourists and locals to flee.

There's nothing of that left now,\" said Louisa, a pensioner in Pefki. <br/> A house burns as fires approach the village of Pefki on Evia Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>In the town of Aidipsos, collections of basic necessities were organised for villagers who had lost everything in the fire. <br/>While rain brought some respite from the blazes in Turkey over the weekend, Greece has this month suffered an intense heatwave that Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said should show the hard reality of climate change even to doubters. <br/>The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change laid bare the challenges facing the planet with a major report on Monday. <br/>The IPCC said global temperatures would probably hit the level of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by around 2030 -- a decade earlier than it projected just three years ago. <br/>Meanwhile the EU said it was mobilising \"one of Europe's biggest ever common firefighting operations\" to assist Greece and other countries. <br/>The response was needed \"as multiple fires affect several countries simultaneously\", EU crisis management commissioner Janez Lenarcic said. <br/>From July 29 to August 7, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) were burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. <br/>The average area burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/>Some 650 firefighters have so far been deployed on Evia, according to Greek authorities. <br/>Greek opposition parties have accused the government of failing to adequately deploy air support to some of the fires. <br/>\"Local officials and citizens cry out that they are desperately alone... for how long will this drama endure?\" main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras tweeted on Sunday. <br/>Mitsotakis said on Monday he discussed with his Russian counterpart Mikhail Mishustin the delivery of an additional giant BE-200 water bomber. <br/>Neighbour and traditional rival Turkey also pledged two fire-fighting aircraft, the Greek foreign ministry said. <br/>Civil protection deputy minister Nikos Hardalias has said that water bombers have faced \"serious difficulties\" including turbulence, thick smoke and limited visibility. <br/>The civil protection authority on Monday said EU states and other countries had contributed 21 aircraft, 250 vehicles and over 1,200 firefighters, some of whom were expected between Tuesday and Friday. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162852394268025979100121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63B9-8WT1-JCMN-Y4K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 9, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The cockpit voice recorder, which captured communications between the pilots, was found on March 23.

Hope you're all safe and well wherever you are. Thanks. [Technical Issues] Today, we'll follow our usual flow, but this time with a new face. So, I'd like to introduce John Heasley, who started with us this time last week, taking over from Stephen. And technically, today is day eight for John, although for John, I'm sure it feels a little bit like day 80 already.</p><p>Anyway, I'm going to talk to the steps that we are taking to enhance margins and cash generation across the whole of the business, and that drives significant cost reductions for us and then make our business a lot more resilient. And John is going to then take us through some of the guidance numbers. I'll come back and cover the longer-term outlook and our outstanding growth opportunities that we have across the portfolio and in the right products for the major demand trends that we've spoken about before.</p><p>Now, as always, I'm going to start with safety. Our commitment here to ensuring that our workforce returns home safely every day is unwavering and it will remain our number one priority. We've made significant progress here in improving our injury rates this year, but, in two incidents we still sadly had three fatalities. And we know that there's still a lot more to do.</p><p>Safety and operational performance as you heard me say before go hand-in-hand. As we refocus on getting the basics right, adhering to our operating model, and driving accountability of our leaders to spend more time in the field to deliver that operational stability, I do expect that these levers should support continued improvement of our safety performance.</p><p>Across all of our operations, we considered our workforce to be a single team, and that is regardless of whether they are employees or contractors. Everyone is accountable for working safely in line with our performance standards and that is without exception.</p><p>Now we do indeed have a high-quality portfolio that combines a fantastic suite of assets with our deep bench capabilities and our leading positions in certain products. All of this is underpinned by a robust capital allocation model and a pipeline of organic growth options. The long-term outlook for our products has arguably never ever looked better. A lot has changed in the last 18 months though, and different circumstances require different approaches. We are alive to these near-term challenges and we are responding accordingly. We've experienced a period of high and prolonged inflationary pressure that continues to impact costs across the whole of the industry, and we are taking measures to ensure that the business is set up to be resilient over the longer term, and as we work through some of these temporary operational headwinds too.</p><p>Diamonds and PGMs are a lot closer to the end consumer than the earlier cycle products and therefore as we know, more directly and immediately impacted by changes in discretionary spending patterns. This is true in a slowdown and as history has shown us before, it will equally be true in the case of an upturn. We are working towards positioning our assets squarely in the first half of their respective cost curves and in same time continue to look through the cycles and focus on these longer term demand themes.</p><p>Just turning to the '23 operating performance. So this year we expect to land broadly within our existing guidance range, and our focus has been on operational delivery, and we did indeed achieve a stronger second half as we had planned. In copper, we are delighted that Quellaveco has now ramped up to full capacity. Unit costs here are just a little higher than we expected as we land towards the lower end of our planned production range. But having successfully delivered this project and then been able to ramp it up as a new asset in a new country and transition to the operational phase as smoothly as we were able to do I think is absolutely a testament to the capabilities that we have in this organization.</p><p>At the copper assets in Chile and Nickel, all grades were as expected lower and our world class Quellaveco operation had another very, very good year. Although our sales volume is running a little bit behind our production, mainly because of weather impacts, sea swells et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Performance in the PGM business has been solid, both from the mines and from the operating -- process operating assets. The team here has expertly, I believe, navigated load-curtailment with minimal impact. And from what we can see, Eskom seems to have had a better performance in the second half of this year, although I'm afraid we will have to continue to carefully monitor the outlook and the performance of Eskom into the first half of 2024.</p><p>De Beers operationally has had a very, very solid year. But as I've spoken about before, we face significant pressure in the downstream in the second half. Consumer spending on luxury goods has eased in the current macro environment, and China has been a lot slower to recover post COVID than we had expected it to.</p><p>With the most recent sites of $80 million and $130 million respectively, De Beers has been loss making in the second half of this year. We are now forecasting our expected sales volumes to be around 25 million carats for the year, but we continue to believe that the fundamentals for diamonds are strong, and we are positioning ourselves to supply into that inevitable demand bounce back.</p><p>In Iron Ore, Minas-Rio has been our star performer this year, a stonking performance by the team there, on track for the top end of guidance, and we've seen some performance records that they've achieved along the way too. Kumba similarly has been performing exceptionally well at the operating level, but unfortunately, the logistics just haven't been there. As a consequence of this, in the last few weeks, we've been lowering volumes to manage the on-mine stockpile that has been developing over the last year and a bit, and as a result managing therefore the costs too.</p><p>We will now deliver to the lower end of our production range, but it will be for the purpose of managing about 2 million tons out of the stockpile and to the port. At Steelmaking coal, our focus has continued to be on safe and stable operations. However, consistency and predictability there have proven elusive in quite challenging ground conditions, particularly at Moranbah. We will land somewhere at around about the 16 million tonne mark for this year, and that of course has had an impact on our unit costs. We are now expecting these costs to come in at around $115 per tonne for the year. Of course, with prices north of $300 a ton, we are still generating some very good margins here, despite the excess of Queensland royalties.</p><p>And finally, at Woodsmith, we have made significant progress this year and we are delighted to have hosted you to a visit a few months ago. We will be within touching distance of that 27 kilometers on the tunnel, and we did achieve the world record for the longest tunnel on a single tunnel boring machine. So, well done to Tom and the team there.</p><p>Sinking activities in the deep shafts continue to progress well, 680 meters of depth on the service shaft now and 385 meters on the production shaft. We pre-emptively took some action in the first half of this year to reduce our business support costs by $0.5 billion by the mid of 2024. That work is on track and pretty well advanced. We are improving our organizational effectiveness through a simpler, a leaner, more streamlined organization that has fewer layers and clearer accountabilities. We are also taking measures to increase business resilience across the whole board. Within each of our businesses, we are pulling the necessary levers to enhance our financial performance both near and medium term, and at the same time protecting value over the longer term. That will translate into significant OpEx reductions for us of a further $0.5 billion in 2024.</p><p>And our final lever is in the capital that we deploy. We have now reduced CapEx by $1.8 billion over the guidance period. Let me give you a little bit more color on what we're doing in each of these businesses. So firstly, copper. As you hopefully know, we have a truly world class portfolio in copper including Collahuasi, and it has very, very significant growth potential embedded within it.</p><p>Los Bronces, though, I think is a perfect example of the challenges that the whole of the mining industry is facing. Los Bronces itself is 156 years old, and as a result of that is facing quite a lot of cost pressure from depth and grades. With a reserve life of 34 years and plenty of resources to extend that, it is still an incredible ore body. It still accounts for more than 2% of the world's known copper resources. However, the ore at the current mining area is very hard. It impacts throughput and cost and it'll be at least another two years before we can open up other areas of the mine so that we can blend this ore with the higher grade softer ores and maintain historic production levels. The mine development has also been delayed in the last few years due to COVID related and permitting issues.</p><p>Now, while we work through these challenges in the pit, we've decided to place the older of the two processing plants on care and maintenance in order to reduce our operating costs and our CapEx, which will help drive value for the whole of the business. As a result of our actions, unit costs will be 15% lower, and we will continue to invest, however, in critical projects which will enable a swift reopening of the plant at the right time, in the right pricing environment.</p><p>Los Bronces remains an incredible ore body, and it is important to recognize the merits of having a permitted operation in an established copper jurisdiction. And to that end, we will continue to progress the studies of our Los Bronces underground project. At Quellaveco, we have adjusted the mine plan based on the latest geotechnical assessments of a known fault. Safety always comes first, and the consequence of this re-phasing is that 75,000 tonnes of copper has been displaced into 2027. Now the new plan -- the new mine plan actually anticipates slightly higher overall volumes than we had previously forecast over the next five years reflecting further optimization of the mining sequence. Given the current copper market outlook, of course, we may well also achieve some higher real term prices for these deferred volumes.</p><p>Now, as you know, we are well positioned in high grade iron ore producing premium quality products. However, Transnet's logistics performance is currently limiting our ability to rail our mine volumes at Kumba, and we are now unfortunately stock bound. Had that been delivered to port, we would have made significantly more EBITDA this year. That unsold ore is also a significant blow, of course, to the South African fiscus. Now, while the government absolutely recognizes the severity of this situation, and I am convinced it's continuing to make strides to get it resolved and sorted out, it is our view that this is going to take some time for conditions to improve and a longer term solution to be implemented. And as a result, we are going to focus on ensuring that we have a balanced value chain through the reconfiguration of this business, including a revised mine plan and structural cost reductions to protect our margins.</p><p>Minas-Rio has delivered operationally very well this year as I said. We are now focusing on operational stability and optimization to maximize cash flows there. In 2025, we are dovetailing some additional maintenance work into the pipeline inspection process.</p><p>Now, moving on to Steelmaking coal. As always, and as I said right at the beginning of this presentation, safety has to come first for us. The gas, depth and strata issues represent very big, complex geotechnical challenges for us there. While our mining experience has resulted in improvements in procedures and risk management, we are still some way off where we had hoped to be at this stage of the reopening of these mines.</p><p>Our priority needs to be delivering safe and stable production, and we are now focused on reconfiguring our cost structure in the near and the medium term to match our productive output. Operational improvements, debottlenecking and automation all represent opportunities to raise this capacity of these assets towards 20 million tonnes, and we are working now hard on ensuring that we can implement some of these things.</p><p>We have also made a significant improvement in our Australian operations, in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of which, of course, methane is the largest component. So far, we are capturing around 60% of the methane, and our confidence in addressing the balance has significantly progressed over the last year. We are also now -- have managed to secure a 100% renewable energy for these operations, all starting in January of 2025.</p><p>PGMs have been acutely in focus for us with a sharply lower trajectory in prices over the last -- over the last year, although these did come from unsustainably high levels from the previous year and the year before. The basket price is now firmly into the cost curve, with sector returns at the lowest point seen in this industry in the last 30 years. It remains to be seen how long these prices persist and its effect on a number of producers. We are ensuring that our own operations are resilient and that we secure Mogalakwena's highly attractive value proposition for the longer term.</p><p>The team is working hard to identify and implement further cost reduction initiatives to sustainably deliver an all-in sustaining cost at a touch over $1,000 per PGM ounce. There are also a number of purchase of concentrate agreements that are coming to the end of their contract life and these changes are also now reflected in our revised production numbers.</p><p>We are focused on enhancing returns through lower CapEx and near-term asset optimization work, and as a result, we will not be progressing work on the option for the third concentrate at Mogalakwena, nor will we be progressing work for the time being on the expansion opportunities at both Amandelbult and Mototolo.</p><p>At Mogalakwena, we have an exceptional ore body, and as well, in our operations in Southern Africa we have the largest of the PGM processing capacity. Now that gives us significant optionality and flexibility for the future. As we work on the underground opportunity, we have one of the largest drilling campaigns in Africa underway, and results so far have exceeded our expectations here, giving us confidence in the long-term development of that resource at the right time.</p><p>Our value-over-volume approach will enhance the competitiveness of our world-class PGM assets under a range of price scenarios. Our business is positioned in the first half of the margin curve, which means that we do have significant flexibility within this portfolio. Current prices seem to reflect the aggressive consensus view of the rapidity of decline of the internal combustion engine.</p><p>Recently, we've seen a rolling back and a dilution of many of the measures favoring rapid BEV adoption, hearing a lot more commentary on the difficulty of hitting BEV targets, and more awareness of the need for internal combustion engines to play a role for longer. Now, this plays into our very long held belief that hybrid vehicles will play an absolutely critical transition step to cleaner transport systems. And hybrids, as we know, require similar levels of PGMs to the internal combustion engine. Furthermore, we are also seeing how current market challenges are affecting the supply side. Projects that were previously being discussed are now being shelved, deferred or delayed because they are uneconomic at current prices.</p><p>And longer term, we are seeing hydrogen accelerate just a little bit faster than many of us were forecasting, which supports, I think, the outlook for platinum and iridium in particular. And finally, with significant activity in the market development space, we do remain confident that these young metals with their unique properties will find metallurgical and catalytic uses in clean technology, as well as a host of other industrial applications.</p><p>Moving on to diamonds. At De Beers, we're taking a slightly different approach here as the business has performed extremely well operationally. What has gone against us is the market, particularly in the second half of this year. Demand and prices for diamonds have fallen as global GDP growth has fallen, but all cycles end, and we believe that the current weakness is temporary. Indeed, we are working closely with our partners to ensure that we can supply into that demand increase when it comes.</p><p>Already, there are some signs that the market might be beginning to turn. Nonetheless, we are focused on streamlining De Beers, reducing the annual overheads by $100 million in a sustainable manner. We have also reduced our CapEx for next year with our investment focused on the highest value opportunities that we see in Southern Africa from the existing assets as well as on the exploration front.</p><p>We will focus our efforts on the ramp-up of Venetia Underground in South Africa, and we are planning to move forward with the first phase of Jwaneng Underground at -- in Botswana. The long-term fundamentals are strong, and we have access to the world's best diamond assets. Now these include our renewed mining licenses in Botswana where we are progressing as planned towards a full agreement with the government early next year.</p><p>We are also renewing our efforts in the downstream. The return of the iconic 'A diamond is forever' campaign has proven highly successful, and you can see some of the ads on this slide. We are committed to further strengthening demand for natural diamonds, and the launch of our origin story will differentiate our natural, traceable diamond offering and highlight how the journey of our diamonds makes an extraordinary contribution to the producer countries.</p><p>Woodsmith is the next multi-billion dollar greenfield project in our pipeline. I still believe this is a textbook example of a high quality, Tier 1 asset in a low-risk jurisdiction. It is large scale, it is expandable, long life, and it has structural advantages that will position it in lowest quartile of the cost curve and it has the potential to generate very significant cash flows for many, many decades. You want these sorts of assets in any portfolio. For that reason, we are focused on setting it up right from the outset. It'll be a truly modern and sustainable mine with a minimal impact to the surface. It'll hardly be able to tell that it is there. POLY4 plays perfectly into those global demand themes I spoke about earlier.</p><p>Food security for 10 billion people, and delivering that sustainably remains one of the key challenges for the Ags industry today. POLY4 is the crop nutrition solution that this industry needs. It can increase your crop yields by 3% to 5%, and it will have a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional products, because it is a natural product without any requirement for downstream chemical processing. And that also means it is therefore use -- suitable for organic use.</p><p>The nutrients themselves are of course not new, but the way they present in this product is new. And POLY4 can deliver absolutely significant additional benefits to the farmer, well beyond the pure nutrient value. There is an enormous potential here in POLY4, even if we just capture a small slice of that significant upside.</p><p>And with that, John, I'll hand over to you to take us through the guidance for the next few years, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Heasley:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Duncan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here and I look forward to meeting many of you personally over the coming months. My decision to join Anglo American was predicated on a number of things.</p><p>Firstly, my deep rooted personal belief in the criticality of the mining industry to the world's development and energy transition.</p><p>Secondly, a great culture with a focus on doing the right thing for the long term.</p><p>And thirdly, a fantastic set of assets, global leading positions in diamonds and PGMs, high-quality iron ore, and phenomenal copper assets with great growth potential.</p><p>No, as Duncan said, while it's only day eight of the job, I'm pleased to see that my experience thus far has been hugely confirmatory. It's also been timely, given that I've had the opportunity to participate in detailed budget review meetings with each of our businesses. And I've been especially encouraged by the unwavering desire of my Board and executive colleagues to do all that we can to maximize performance and returns from our existing assets to fund our future growth options. And I'm sure as you can appreciate, as a Scottish finance director, that is music to my ears.</p><p>Moving on to the numbers, Duncan has stepped you through the operational performance for 2023. That translates into expected production, up about 3% on last year, with unit costs up around 5%, reflecting higher CPI as well as the impact of lower grades, harder ores and deeper pits. You will see in the appendices some more detail by business if required.</p><p>On capex, we expect to come in under our full year guidance at around $5.8 billion, following general tightening of spend across the Board. Our effective tax rate at around 39% is slightly higher than the range previously indicated and reflects the impact of profit mix, higher contributions from South America and lower contributions from Southern Africa, particularly De Beers. I would like to remind everyone that a lot of other producers, particularly in Australia, for example, pay more of that economic rent and royalties that set an operating costs rather than the tax line. And on an all-in basis, we aren't too dissimilar from those peers.</p><p>Working capital has continued to build through the second half of the year and this will be a particular focus of mine. Inventories are higher than we would like, especially in De Beers and Kumba, given market demand and transportation issues respectively. That said, the key driver of the circa $1.5 billion anticipated increase in working capital this year is payables, with the lion's share being in PGMs, given the impact of lower prices on the valuation of the bulk payables and the customer prepayment. Finally, and of course, subject to Board discussion and approval in the new year, we would expect the dividend payout to be in line with our well established policy at 40%.</p><p>Looking now at production for the next three years, you've heard from Duncan that we are very focused on maximizing the margins and cash generation from our operations. Against this backdrop, we've taken some difficult, but necessary decisions to reconfigure some of the operations in order to capture more value from recovery. This translates into production being lower next year, most significantly in copper, with the older and smaller Los Bronces plant moving into care and maintenance and the rephasing at Quellaveco due to the known fault.</p><p>Our volume guidance is down 7% over the next two years before rising 4% in 2026. These reconfigurations enable significant cost reductions and will ultimately support higher margins and returns. Those cost reductions from our reconfigurations are evident on this next slide. Early action to improve resilience and margins is expected to deliver a 2% reduction in unit costs next year and broadly maintain those over the following two years. With CPI across our geographies at around 5%, you can see the favorable impact of our actions is significant.</p><p>In copper, PGMs and iron ore, we are delivering significant year-on-year cost reductions and should see a resultant move to improve our position on the cost curves. We are rigorously implementing these measures to ensure they are comprehensively embedded into our operational footprint, allowing us to sustain this performance.</p><p>At De Beers, the transition of Venetia to underground operations adversely impacts the unit costs of our managed operations. While we are proposing to change the ramp-up in light of prevailing market conditions and to optimize capital spend, we expect unit costs to return to current levels from 2026 as volumes pick up.</p><p>The Steelmaking coal business is more levered to fixed costs given the nature of longwall mining, and more generally, we're seeing Queensland slip down the rankings of competitiveness as a mining jurisdiction, due to the additional royalty regimes implemented last year. While we have managed to broadly offset the key inflationary pressures, we're still working very hard to find opportunities to lower that cost base. If we can deliver any upside in our production, that represents our greatest margin lever for this business.</p><p>Finally from me, our cost discipline also extends to capex. We've identified opportunities to reduce capex by $1.8 billion from now to 2026. That's $0.2 billion in 2023, $0.8 billion in 2024 and a further $0.4 billion in 2025. 2026 capex gains is now set at $5.3 billion, which is $0.4 billion than our previous budget. These figures now include Woodsmith as we guided earlier in the year to a spend of around $1 billion per annum.</p><p>Safety and asset integrity spend is untouched in these updated numbers. Those are sacrosanct. The savings reflect the refocus of investment. Two such examples are to pursue only the underground at Mogalakwena and PGMs and the technical review of the UHDMS project at Kumba. We will pull similar levers across the balance of the portfolio as required until we reach the FNTP decision on Woodsmith expected in early 2025, current governance processes will continue with ongoing spend remaining subject to annual Board approval.</p><p>As we have said, we will consider potential partnership opportunities for this business at the right time, with the right partners and of course, for value. In summary, we have updated our numbers with a focus on reducing costs, enhancing margins and driving cash generation. I am confident that these are the right decisions for both the near and long term.</p><p>Thank you, and I will now hand back to Duncan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks John. So, turning now to the longer term outlook, we have a highly differentiated investment proposition underpinned by our high quality portfolio very long mine lives, and a -- which is diversified across many critical minerals and metals that are essential for both ongoing global economic development and the transition to cleaner energy. This is supported by a strong marketing capability that maximizes the value of the products that we deliver to our customers.</p><p>Our diversified portfolio works as a whole. Each of the businesses has a very clear role, delivering a balance between cash generation and the funding and execution of our well sequenced sets of growth options. With the current focus on copper and crop nutrients that together are set up to strongly deliver enhanced value in the future.</p><p>The attractive growth options that we have are naturally well sequenced over the next 10 years from a cash generation and a capital allocation perspective. As you all know, permitting timelines are a natural break on bringing on any new supply. The fifth ball mill at Collahuasi is now up and running with some debottlenecking options there to follow. Then permits are expected for the fourth line at Collahuasi in 2027. Once the studies have been completed, it will then follow peak spend at Woodsmith. That's Collahuasi.</p><p>So, permitting is then expected for Sakatti in 2029, with the underground expansion at Los Bronces potentially delivering an annual production increment of 100,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes per annum. Sakatti is the greenfield option in Finland with a relatively low capital cost. It has a high grade, it is a polymetallic ore body, it contains copper, battery grade nickel, platinum gold and some cobalt. Whilst it is relatively small, it could deliver at least 100,000 tonnes of copper equivalent over a mine life that could extend over a couple of decades or so. And the by-products here would, of course, give us a negative cash cost position.</p><p>Our unique project execution capabilities should allow us to unlock the value of this particular ore body. Los Bronces underground could deliver over 10 million tonnes of copper equivalent over 100 years with copper head grades of around 1.5%. Whilst studies are ongoing, significant work has already progressed on optimizing the capital spend and we could deliver those volumes at, I believe, a very competitive capital intensity.</p><p>At Quellaveco, we are progressing the studies of the expansion options that would help sustain production after we are through the initial high grade period. We initially oversized the elements of the plant in order to cater for this increase in throughput rates, and we are studying further expansion potential here, such as the possible third ball mill. Beyond the existing site, there is also additional regional potential that our discovery team are very interested in, including the adjacent Mamut area which is around 10 km away from the current mine.</p><p>Now, while we are taking firm action to respond to the near term pressure, our commitment to responsible and sustainable mining is unwavering. We will continue to apply our value focused approach to delivering on our sustainability ambitions. We have made good progress with the first wave of Envusa renewable energy projects in Southern Africa this year, and we will secure more than enough renewable energy for our own needs, decoupling ourselves from the double-digit cost escalation in the electricity contracts that we have today, and providing a greater grid stability to support broad economic development in the region.</p><p>Envusa makes absolutely good business sense to us. It is strongly NPV positive whilst also at the same time being the right solution for us. It is great for decarbonization goals and it is great for South Africa. We seek out opportunities in challenges. These capabilities are a key enabler for our growth pathway from the delivery of Quellaveco through to the permitting milestones that we have achieved this year at both Los Bronces and Sakatti, as well as the renewal of our long standing partnership with the government of Botswana.</p><p>Understanding our social license to operate remains at the heart of our approach. We have a clear track record of delivering on our promises. Communities and host governments can see that, and they value that. We have been operating in our current jurisdictions for decades, learning, evolving and continuing to refine our approach. We aim to be the development partner that countries choose to work with.</p><p>So, to conclude, the outlook for metals and minerals has never looked stronger, underpinned by the three mega demand trends that you've heard me speak about before. While much of the conversation today seems to be around and focused on decarbonization, lets not forget that poverty remains the number one and most urgent daily challenge of much of the world's population, uplifting global living standards amid a growing global population requires an unprecedented level of economic development.</p><p>For example, giving everyone in the developing world a living standard equivalent to just half that enjoyed in the developed world today would require us to mine an additional 70 billion tonnes of iron ore and an additional 1 billion tonnes of copper. Those numbers are quite extraordinary. To put that in context, that would represent approximately the same amount of iron ore that has been extracted over the entire course of human history and 1.3 times the amount of copper that has ever been mined. And we must remember that we are discovering new applications for materials that we produce all of the time. Similarly, to feed the global population over the next 30 years will require the use of more man-made fertilizers than have been consumed in total over the last 100 years.</p><p>So, our portfolio, with its diversification of high quality and long life assets, I think it's very well positioned to deliver in these trends. We are taking deliberate, decisive and necessary performance interventions in this challenging and dynamic near term environment to improve our resilience, capture value and ensure that we are set up to deliver for the long term. These measures, together with our technical capabilities and our approach to sustainability, position our assets to deliver significant and enduring value for decades to come.</p><p>And with that, I am very happy to take questions. John and I are joined for this session with you -- with Ruben, Temba, Al and Matt Daley. So, Paul, if you would like to master the ceremony of the question session, that would be great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Galloway:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Duncan. If you would like to ask a question, you can see the details on the screen. I would like to hand over to the operator, Ellie, to take the first question, please.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Fairclough:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Jason Fairclough from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the presentation. Some very interesting points. Look, a bit of a big picture question for you. So, Duncan, you inherited a company running a series of tier-1 assets. Today, it feels like we have pressure in at least four major businesses, right. So, in PGMs, in diamonds, at Kumba, and at some of the copper assets. And then on top of that, you are going to be burning about $1 billion a year at Woodsmith for the foreseeable future. And today, you are taking quite aggressive steps to conserve cash. So, how do you think about this? Is there actually an opportunity here to focus the portfolio, perhaps to shed some of the assets that don't have a position in Anglo American longer term? I guess some people would say that diversification is the enemy of simplicity, but just interested in how you are thinking about the portfolio, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Jason. Look I mean you picked up a couple of interesting points there in terms of elements of the business that are exposed to a cycle. Very unusual that we have the confluence of a number of effects like PGMs, diamonds and the transport issues in South Africa related to Kumba, all happening at the same time in a portfolio of this nature. But this is what's happened. And what you're seeing is us take the appropriate level of response to this thing. Certainly from a whole of portfolio position, what we are doing -- I mean a couple of points that I want to reiterate there.</p><p>First of all, every asset in the portfolio has a role. Some are cash generating assets and some we then invest that cash in a value balanced way in accordance with our capital allocation model, including returns to shareholders, in developing other assets over the business. And I think that's how you have to think about a portfolio. Cycles will be cycle, they will come and go and we expect that with the quality and the type of assets that we've got in the portfolio through the long run, there are extraordinary returns that get developed out of this.</p><p>Now, of course, part of what we have to do in response to the current economic climate and some of the issues that we've got temporarily and uniquely in this particular portfolio, we have to be sure that we are conserving cash and we are allocating that cash even more rigorously. That's what we said that we would do and this is what you're seeing us do. In the context of Woodsmith, this becomes part of the portfolio that will replace this portfolio over time. So what we will get in Woodsmith is one of the world's pre-eminent orebodies with a great level of flexibility in the right commodity set to serve the right customer base, that sits at the bottom of the cost curve, spinning off large volumes of cash for multiple decades. Now, that doesn't just happen, it has to be built up over time and therefore, this allocation is very careful and very thoughtful.</p><p>In the context of your question about is this time to review elements of the portfolio. Well, I think all of the time is the right time to review elements of the portfolio. As I said earlier, every asset in the portfolio has a role to play and it is important that that role is effectively played through the lifecycle of those assets and through the holistic cycles of the macroeconomy that affect the business over time. So we do review every single asset and its role in the portfolio on a regular basis. So not just now, but even at the tops of cycles, it is our job to continue to ensure that we have the right mix and suite of assets within the portfolio. So it is ongoing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Fairclough:</emphasis></p><p>And look, Duncan, when we were up in Yorkshire, I think over dinner, one of the investors asked you, if there are any sacred cows. I think was the phrase in the portfolio, is everything for sale at the right price?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Well, look, I mean, the short answer to that is, if you're managing a portfolio like we are, there are clearly no sacred cows in it. Because if every asset has its place and its time, we have to look at it through that lens all of the time. So, no, there are no sacred cows.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Fairclough:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, beautiful. Thanks very much. And thanks again for the presentation today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks, Jason.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Next question comes from Alain Gabriel from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alain Gabriel:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for taking my question. Hi, Duncan. Hi, everyone. So, you have reset your volume guidance today, you've doubled down on the cost cutting program and pulled back on capex. But the market doesn't seem to think this is enough, judging by how the share prices have reacted today. First question, is there more or deeper restructuring that you can or are prepared to do across the various businesses to speed up the turnaround? One.</p><p>And then two on Woodsmith following up on on Jason's question. that's the single largest consumer of cash today and for the foreseeable future as well. Is finding a strategic partner on the table to help share the capital burden? I think you've addressed this before, but in light of your new guidance, is there a new thinking around it? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Aline, Thanks. So, second question first. John addressed that in his part of the presentation. So, there's no new thinking on this thing, we continue at pace to find a partner, the right partner at the right price for this particular asset. And so, no new news there. In terms of the levers that we've got to pull, we continue to focus on the things that we can control and we will continue to control them in an appropriate way in response to the conditions as we move forward.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alain Gabriel:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Tyler Broda from RBC. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tyler Broda:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thanks very much. I've got two questions. One, I was wondering if you can go a little bit more into Quellaveco in terms of sort of the guidance for next year, which looks, I think, a little bit soft versus expectations. Why did this come about, could you just give us a bit more color there? I guess the second question is a question around, I guess, just the working capital, diamonds, PGMs, the Kumba buildup, how do you expect to see that evolved? Obviously, there'll be lower production, but can you give us a bit of steer on where you see the working capital over the next sort of 12, 24 months? Thanks very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Sure, Tyler. Matt, I'm going to come to you in terms of the fault at Quellaveco and how we're navigating our way around that and the implications for it. But on working capital, I'll also ask Al, just to talk about what we're doing with diamonds. But certainly at Kumba, the response there has been to slow the mine down and move the stockpile until such time as Transnet recovers. Tyler, as I've said before, there's been an enormous amount of work by both business and government and Transnet to get on with the recovery of that particular institution and the logistics infrastructure. And that work is progressing.</p><p>It is unfortunately not going to represent in a massive turnaround or recovery to the original capacity that that line had in the next year or two. Now that's quite a long time for a business to remain stock bound and very difficult for us not to effectively respond to that. And so that's what Mpumi and the team are doing. We have absolutely not lost faith in the fact that this will recover and it will come back. But being very realistic in terms of the progress that's been made over the last year or so, it is unlikely in our view, that this recovery will be next year. And so therefore, we are just planning accordingly.</p><p>There are no material or significant impacts to the mine itself because as soon as we get the transport capacity, we will be able to ramp the operations back up. So, with that in mind, we will be able to take care of the working capital or the excess working capital at Kumba over the next couple of years. In PGMs, really, there's a little bit of slag as a result of the original Polokwane deferral about a year ago that we need to work through, but that's not really a big deal. The biggest impact to working capital as far as PGMs are concerned are the impact of the POC and Toll agreements and the prepayment agreement that we had with one of our customers that is just unwinding into a lower pricing environment at this particular point in time. So, whilst John is completely focused, as are we on working capital management, this will be one of those.</p><p>And then perhaps, Al, before we go to Matt, you could talk about diamond inventories and the cycle management, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Duncan. Certainly. So, through the course of particularly the second half of this year, we've seen a downturn in demand for diamonds driven by predominantly macroeconomic factors. As Duncan said earlier, we know that cycles are by definition cyclical and because of that, we've kept production relatively steady through the second half of this year and that has led to a buildup of inventory, because so many of our costs are fixed, that appears to us to be the wise thing to do and sets us up very well for the inevitable upturn during the course of the next year. We're growing in confidence in that upturn coming sooner rather than later.</p><p>Having said that, if there is continued lower for longer prices and demand on diamonds, we have a series of levers that we can pull during the course of 2024. And we work with our producer countries and our partners in those countries to do so, including, of course, mining lower grade ore and making operational changes on that basis. So there are a series of levers we can pull depending on the circumstances ahead. But as I say, we are in a good position if, as we believe, there is an upturn beginning during 2024. Thanks, Duncan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Al. Matt, do you want to just talk to the fault at Quellaveco, please?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt Daley:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, certainly. Thanks, Duncan. And thanks, Tyler, for the question. So, Quellaveco ore body continues to impress us as we've progressed the mining and learn more about this particular ore body. We've always known about this fault zone and we continue to look at our pit designs to optimize extraction for both productivity and costs. And so, what you are seeing is just a re-phasing of the copper over the business plan period. And in fact, this redesign, while slightly lower copper in 2024, actually delivers higher total copper and hence value over the next five years. So mining progresses pretty much as planned and we'll continue to optimize this pit, well into the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tyler Broda:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Liam Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liam Fitzpatrick:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sorry to go over some ground that's already being covered, but I just wanted to clarify kind of how you're thinking about things. So the first one is just on Woodsmith. So I think back in the trip, you said partnering or syndication was part of the longer term strategy at the right time. Has there been a bit of a shift there? Because I think you suggested that, there may be a process. So where is that now? Is there an active partnering process going on at the moment?</p><p>And then in terms of that -- the previous question on the portfolio, I guess the share price performance today in this year is telling you that the market doesn't think there's enough action at the moment. Could we expect any further kind of details from you and the management team next year in terms of perhaps how you see the portfolio, whether that's in terms of the asset base or division? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Liam. I mean you are actually covering ground that I think we've already addressed. So I'll just say it again for clarification. So the syndication process is something that we will do and it will be done at the right time and for value. I think that's really important, given an asset of this nature. And then as far as any portfolio changes and so on, we will continue to do what we need to do to ensure that we have a high quality portfolio of assets that delivers through the cycle, and we will continue to respond in whatever way is necessary to respond to both short and long term circumstances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liam Fitzpatrick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Could I just ask an operational one as well, please. Just on De Beers. So at this point, there's no production cuts. How long do you wait before we could see something a bit more meaningful on the production side? Just to react to what the weakness we're seeing in the market. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>We're not waiting. So, we are working actively at the moment with our partners in the producer countries in order to identify the levers that we can take step by step during the course of the year. As I said, we need to be careful with this because a large number of our costs are fixed. So we need to avoid doing something that actually, just disrupts mines, which then take a lot to recover from and doesn't actually create the cost savings that you really want to drive out of this. But no, we're not waiting. We're working actively with our partners at the moment and to ensure that if things do stay low, then we're ready to react to that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liam Fitzpatrick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Richard Hatch from Berenberg. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks very much and good morning. I've got a couple of questions. The first one is just on Los Bronces. I mean, it's a pretty big cut in volumes. Can you just help us a little bit out, just in terms of what that second plant run rate is, you know, what kind of price situation do you need to see, that kind of ramp up again? And are you able just to sort of give us a bit more color on that copper chili volume cut? Is it entirely Bronces or is there other bits and bobs elsewhere? That's the first one, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Richard. Look, Bronces, the volume cut is of the one plant. So this is the old Los Bronces plant is around about 60,000 tonnes per day of capacity that comes out. It's fundamentally led by a couple of things. So, first of all, the mine development has been held back. As we know, we're monophasic out there at the moment. It's going to take a couple of years to get Donoso open up. And during that period of time, the capital required for this plant the operating costs on this plant are extraordinarily high. So, the margins on every copper tonne that come out are very close to zero or negative on that basis. So, it doesn't make any sense for us to keep running that plant at current short term pricing.</p><p>So, Ruben and the team are going to use this time to deal with one of the tailings dams that we are in the process of moving and manage the cost. So, we will be able to start this plant back up in the right price environment and certainly pretty quickly in a couple of years time if that transpired. So, that is the major issue at Los Bronces and it's the right response, it's value over volume.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I hear you. Cool. Understood. And I guess that probably means that in the capex numbers, there's a little bit less stripping in there if you're not having to push as hard.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>[Speech Overlap] That is correct.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Cool. And then just on coal. We've talked a bit about coal in the past as well. Met coal prices -- costs continue to sort of remain elevated. I get that there's a Queensland royalty change that's impacted the cost curve full stop. But on that Met coal business down in Queensland is 20 million tonnes now, the right long term run rate to think about where it can be. And this business has previously operated at $60 a tonne. I completely get it's a different environment now. But what's a good long term line in the sand to set a target for on costs for the coal business in Australia? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>So, Richard, look, I mean -- I think the right sort of long term run rate for this operation is in the order of sort of 24 million, 25 million tonnes per annum. And Themba, Dan and the team are now ensuring that their long run cost base is appropriate to that type of productive output. It'll take a couple of years to get from 17 million tonnes, which is where we're going to end around about this year, to the 25 million tonnes but in advance of that we're making sure that we've got the right cost structure to support that sort of output.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And long term costs?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>So, Long term inflation, long term exchange rates, I'll say we will control every element of this that we can.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks for your time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Next question comes from Myles Allsop from UBS. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Myles Allsop:</emphasis></p><p>Great, thank you. Yeah, just a couple of questions. First of all, just looking back, this is the second consecutive year where we've had some fairly material cutbacks to guidance. What can you say, just to give us some confidence that this is the last of the bad news, that when we get to December 2024, we're not going to have another round of cuts to production guidance?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Myles. We've got some very good assets in the portfolio. They have, many of them been impacted by some very unique set of circumstances coming out of the COVID years and then some specific logistics and infrastructural issues generally around the world and that's been the biggest issue. We have adjusted, I think, dynamically to these circumstances. And as things become clearer, we've used this great team of people and our planning processes to come up with something that we believe is a very meaningful and realistic outcome for the next couple of years in this business.</p><p>So I can absolutely assure you that the things that we are in control of, that we need to be on control of, are being well controlled by a team of extraordinary people. And once we come through some of these cyclical impacts, particularly in diamonds and PGMs, we will be very, very well set.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Myles Allsop:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then maybe just on the cost savings. Obviously that's the other new news from today, this billion dollars that's coming through. To what degree is that embedded in the unit cost guidance or as we look into 2025 unit costs, obviously you're not guiding that at this point. Can we hope to see a further step down in unit costs across a number of the divisions?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>John, do you want to take that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Heasley:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no problem. Thanks Myles, nice to talk to you. Yeah, the costing, as you said, the $500 million we talked about previously on the overhead work. So that continues and is well underpinned and well progressed, so that's coming through nicely. The new $500 million that we've announced today, that's more operationally focused, given the action that we've been talking through. So that is coming through in the unit costs and that underpins the 2% step down in unit costs in 2024.</p><p>And I think it's not to underestimate the scale of that, given that's 2% net offsetting, as I said, CPI running at 4% to 5%, plus mining inflation on top of that. So there is significant action there. And obviously, that won't all come in immediately on 1 January, so there will be a carry forward of some of that on an annualized basis into 2025. And as I said in my presentation, we expect to see that those unit costs will hold broadly at the sort of 2024 levels for a couple of years thereafter, which I think gives good confidence that we see a little bit more in the tank to continue to manage to offset that inflation that I just described.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Myles Allsop:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Chris LaFemina from Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the update. So, just a question on the diamond market, first, the weakness that you're seeing, which you're attributing to consumer weakness, feels like a bit like 2008, 2009. But the global economy obviously isn't as bad as it was then. So I'm wondering how much of this is a function of kind of a structural shift into synthetics? And can you comment on whether synthetics demand is down as much as natural diamond demand, or is it just the real diamonds that are getting impacted more by the weaker consumer?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Al, do you want to take that first?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Thanks, Duncan. This is a question which, as you can imagine, preoccupies a lot of our waking thoughts. We see three main causes for the downturn in diamond demand over the course of the last year. The first is obviously macroeconomic. When global growth rates fall as they've fallen, diamonds are often disproportionately hit by that, the converse, of course, when growth rates go up. So the first is, is that macroeconomics.</p><p>The second is China and the lag that we're seeing in the Chinese market responding. And when Chinese consumers are going out at the moment, they're buying investments rather than diamonds in the same quantity.</p><p>The third aspect that we're seeing is that engagements and therefore the purchase of engagement rings in the United States, are down. And that's because two, three years ago, when the people who would be getting engaged today should have been meeting for the first time, we had the COVID lockdowns. So we're seeing that lag there. So those three main effects, GDP, Chinese demand lagging and staying low and thirdly, this after the macro piece as well on GDP.</p><p>Now, you asked about lab-grown diamonds and the encroachment that lab-grown diamonds are making. This is really interesting. So, what we're seeing is three things. So, lab-grown supply continuing to rise out of India and China. We're seeing lab-grown sales in terms of the amount, the numbers of diamonds, going up in the United States, not really outside the United States, this is mainly a U.S. issue. But we are seeing lab-grown diamond prices plummet, so they are down 90% over the last two years. And that's why you're seeing lab-grown diamond manufacturers heading towards bankruptcy at the moment.</p><p>So greater volume and much lower prices. What does that actually mean for us. This is actually as we predicted it's just happening a bit faster and what we're seeing is this bifurcation, this total splitting of the natural versus lab-grown. So, it's painful in the short term, undoubtedly, because it means a lot of lab-grown volume going in, but it's good in the long term in that now that prices for lab-grown are less than 10% at a wholesale level of those prices than natural. There is less and less confusion between the products and we believe that we're moving towards a time where we're going to see very, very differentiated markets for those two products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>So thank you for that. You're not concerned about lab-grown diamonds taking significant market share from natural stones and high end jewelry? And is that even happening or is it more lower end jewelry where synthetics are getting the market share? I guess my concern here is that the cyclical, the U.S. economy is not terrible and you're seeing the rough diamond market there very, very weak. So, just wondering how much of a real recovery we can see even if the U.S. economy stays resilient or do people just buy more of these synthetics?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>So I think there's a couple of things going on. It's a really, really good question. There are a couple of things going on. Firstly, the natural diamond demand in the United States is not that bad at the moment. And we saw relatively good performance during the Thanksgiving and the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period. So, we can't complain about that. What we are seeing I think a push that's happened through the last two to three years where lab-grown diamonds did encroach on areas such as engagement rings. But with the rapid fall now in lab-grown diamond prices, as I said down 90% in the last two years, we are seeing lab-grown diamond moving towards being more of a fashion item, fashion jewellery, rather than the jewellery that marks the most meaningful moments in people's lifetimes, which is, of course, what we focus on in De Beers.</p><p>Now, when you're at that period where, if you like the forest fire is burning most brightly and we're seeing large amounts of supply coming in, I think it's very important that we look actually at the profitability of that business, at the prices of the lab-grown diamonds and that's why we're so confident in the bifurcation of the market going forward. And in our view, natural diamonds remain, what they have been for hundreds of years, symbols of the most important moments in people's lives. And lab-grown diamonds do what crystal, Swarovski crystal, cubic zirconia has been -- and that is, they remain a fantastically fun bit of fashion jewellery.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>And Chris, just to reiterate. In terms of the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio, from a diamonds perspective, these are second to none. And there have been very, very few, none actually, new diamond discoveries in the last 15 years or so and some of the older diamond assets are shutting down and closing down too. So all of that, everything that Al said, particularly in terms of what we're seeing as a natural break in the lab-grown markets to the natural markets and what's ultimately becoming a scarcity of supply of natural diamonds I think stands this business in very good stead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>Got it, thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Ian Rossouw from Barclays. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Rossouw:</emphasis></p><p>Morning, thank you. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, on the PGM business, in the release or the AMPLAT's release you mentioned that it's roughly keeping current production from own operations flat. But you talk about a review underway to identify further opportunities. II mean, is this an opportunity to more meaningfully cut some of these higher cost, deep underground shafts. Maybe, just curious what that could entail and what the business could look like in, let's say, five years' time.</p><p>And then secondly, just on some of the copper growth options you mentioned, Duncan, how should we think about the timing of these with regards to Los Bronces underground and Collahuasi expansions. I guess, you showed on that chart, but how do this investments of these, sort of dovetail with each other or will there be some overlap in the second half of this decade? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, Ian, sure. So, on the PGMs front, Themba and Craig are absolutely having a look through all of the operating performance of all of these assets. Value over volume will be the driving mantra in all of this. But, of course, we are absolutely optimistic on PGMs and certainly the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio are again, very, very good and therefore, we believe should be right placed to be able to present into this demand that we will see coming for all the reasons that I spoke about earlier.</p><p>I mean, if you plot the industry returns over the last 30 years, we are absolutely at the lowest of the lows in that period of time and that can't be right in terms of this industry generally and our assets in particular. So, Themba and Craig will continue with the review of the general performance of this business. We are as I said earlier, absolutely focused on being sure that we are the best at what we can be the best of and what we are in control of. So, let them get done with that review and we'll see what comes out of that.</p><p>As far as the copper growth options are concerned, I did take you through more or less the timing and the sequencing that we expect for these assets or for these projects in the future. So, the first one is rarely is going to be Collahuasi after Woodsmith. So right now we are in -- as I say, the fifth ball mill is up and running. We've got a few opportunities around debottlenecking there within the current permit, but then we will need to get the permits for the fourth line. And our expectation is that we would be able to acquire these permits in around '27. So, the time that we get the permit would be actually after we've got through the peak spend of capex at Woodsmith. So we'd be on into the execution of the project of the fourth line at Collahuasi '28, '29, '30 so, coming into production in the early '30s.</p><p>And we expect then to be able to get a permit. So we've got the first permit for Sakatti and that is the finished permit now going through the European Union process in 2029. So therefore real construction probably 2030, 2031 and that's more or less at the tail end of the Collahuasi construction.</p><p>And then Los Bronces underground is probably out beyond that, so we're busy doing the pre-feasibility study-B for that now. And then we have, by and large, the environmental permits and there's a number of other permits that we would need to go through for that. But my expectation is that the majority of that spend would occur naturally just after Sakatti is completed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Rossouw:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Maybe just to push you on the PGM restructuring, if you say that you'll look at value over volume. Does that mean that sort of 2.1 to 2.3 from own minds? I mean, how much meaningfully can that fall?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>I don't know. I mean, when we're through this review, every ounce needs to have its own margin on it and not only in the short run, but in the long run too. So obviously, we're not going to make deep, hard cutting to the bone, irrational decisions in terms of the short run when we've got a view on what the long term demand for these assets are going to be or these products are going to be. But if we cannot see sustainable value on every ounce, then we will take those ounces out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Rossouw:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>The next question comes from Matt Green from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, everyone. I think you've covered most of the bases, so I'll have a couple on your copper growth. Just to start with, Collahuasi, and I've got a follow-on on Quellaveco. Just on the brownfield growth, you suggested previously an uplift of around 20,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes with the debottlenecking initiatives, and you seems to have landed on about 25,000 tonnes. And then the fourth line expansion seems to have increased from around 100 to 150 from the early 2030s. So, just keen to know what are the scope change has been between the two options, and is bioleaching still part of the thinking?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Matt, hi. Yeah, so I'll ask Ruben just to talk to the ball mill output. I still think that that's somewhere between 20,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes on our share basis. I think it's just fundamentally a function of where we are in the ore body at any one particular point in time. The fourth line is pretty much in the same sort of dimension as we had previously said, both in terms of quantum and timing. So, I don't think there is any change there.</p><p>And as far as bioleaching is concerned, that remains potentially one of the options but you need a high -- relatively high and sustainable price environment to make that work because we will have to do a little bit of capital to put the appropriate leach pads and plants in place to do that. So, that is under consideration, but it isn't a high priority in the short run. Ruben, do you just want to clarify on the ball mill production, please?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruben Fernandes:</emphasis></p><p>Oh, that's right, Duncan. It's around that. So, 15,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes additional to our share. We are ramping up very well this month, so I think we could expect that coming in next year. And of course, there is a little bit of grade as well that we need to compensate. So, I think this ball mill will cover that. But you're right. And then we have this option, as you mentioned, the debottlenecking options, and can be leaching, can be more flotation cells. So, we are in a process to discuss that with our partners. And then the fourth line, that's the big expansion, as you mentioned, is later on, but you are right, so the numbers are right, so no change in scope. Matt, to be honest, it's just another adjustment of the profile, the roadmap for each phase of the growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's handy. Thanks for clarifying. And then just coming back to two parts, I guess just near term, with the plants and operation fully ramped up, how's your fresh water usage been relative to expectations? And are you comfortable in the immediate term that you won't be water constraints given the droughts in the region, and then just to follow-on, on more longer term. Duncan, you've highlighted on the fact you have scoped that mill up to 150,000 tonnes a day. You permitted it to around 130,000 tonnes if I recall. So just in terms of both an infrastructure and permitting, what's required here to push Quellaveco to 150,000 tonnes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, Ruben, I'll ask you to just clarify the water situation. We had some really good precipitation during the course of this year. So, I think stocks are pretty good going on into next year. And then, of course, we've got the new water scheme, which will come in from 2025 onwards. So, I think we're going to be okay from a water perspective. But Reuben can clarify that.</p><p>In terms of the constraints at Quellaveco, we're currently doing 127,500 tonnes a day. That is our permit constraint. That permit was fundamentally constrained by water availability. We were pretty certain that given our design of this operation and the way we would be able to operate it, we would be able to demonstrate a water efficiency higher than what we were able to get permitted. And with that in mind, we should be able to then apply through the normal amendment processes for an increment in that permit to what we believe is the appropriate size for that shape and geometry of ore body, which would tolerate around about 150,000 tons per day.</p><p>So we would need for that to happen, us to be able to have a few years and a few seasons of collected and demonstrated water manage and performance data, and then use that as part of the baseline information that would go into the permitting process. And then that gives us the ability to bring that expansion. The intention would be, in another couple of years, another year or two, to be able to start that process. As I said, before we had in the original design of the project, in anticipation of this, keyed in the potential tie-ins for that volumetric expansion. So, it should be a relatively low capital intensity expansion when we get to it.</p><p>So, Ruben, do you want to just clarify the water?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruben Fernandes:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, sure. So, as you know Chile has been suffering a lot with water restrictions. And as part of the long term solution, we have this integrated water solution project that we call that is progressing very well, 33% completed as we speak. So by end of '25 we should be up and running. It's a long term contract with a partner, so that's going well. And short term, as you know, we need to have trucks, water trucks supplying water to the plant. But as we speak now, because of the good rainy season in Chile this year, we are not running those trucks at the moment.</p><p>But of course at some point next year, depending on the need, we should run a little bit of, to have a little bit of water trucks on the road. But because we're closing one plant, maybe this is something that cannot happen. So we should have probably 34% less cost in water, which is a big deal for Bronces, as you know, we should remove out of the business of $70 million per year in water next year. So I think it's the right decision to shut the plan given the context that bank explained. And then of course the water solution is well balanced now to deal with this situation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, that's helpful. Sorry, my question was actually more geared towards drought potential in Peru with Quellaveco. Just to confirm your water stocks are fine at Quellaveco?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, I think they are. Ruben, do you want to confirm?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruben Fernandes:</emphasis></p><p>No. Yes, absolutely no, it's confirmed. So, no issue in terms of water for Quellaveco. We have availability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Alexander Pearce from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexander Pearce:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning all. Duncan, I was just wondering if you could drill down into the lower near-term guidance in Minas-Rio a little bit more, please, and particularly in 2024, which is a little bit surprising. Maybe given that strong performance, you flagged in '23. And then, longer term, the question is really, is there still a chance that we could see that 25 million tonne to 27 million tonne per annum run rate in your guidance again or is the new long term lower?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Alex, hi. Thanks for that. So, look, two things going on at Minas-Rio, none of them unknown to us. The first is that, as a result of that water leak several years ago, have to run a PIG through the waterline every four or five years. And so what we are doing is just planning for that production drop as a result of the time that it takes us to PIG the line and check the dimensions of the wall thickness of the pipeline in to plan.</p><p>The second thing is that the ore body transitions over a very long time to a much harder rock, the hard itabirite, as they called. And, as we run through that transition, there are just various phases of a mixed proportion between the hard rock and the softer ore that we're in now. The impact of which is to slow processing rates down. There was a lot of thinking at the time that was done at the time that we thought that it might be possible to get to 27 odd million tonnes per annum, that we would be able to deploy some technology that would help us with this throughput and processing rate.</p><p>That's probably a little bit more a way off than we had originally planned for it to be. So the mine is currently operating or currently has the potential to get to 26 million tonnes, which is the original design capacity of Minas-Rio. I'm absolutely certain that Ruben, Matt, Ana and the team will tweak it a little bit above that, but for the foreseeable future and for those reasons, that's the outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexander Pearce:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Galloway:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you for all the questions. Look, of course, if you've got any -- just before I hand back to Duncan, if you've got any further questions, then please give myself and the IR team a call. we'd be happy to try and talk you through those. Richard, I think we owe you a follow-up, but Duncan, if I may just pass back to you to close, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Paul, and thanks, everybody, for your time this morning. Just, a reiteration is that, this is an extremely high quality portfolio with some great people operating these assets. We are definitely close to I hope, and at the bottom of cycle, certainly for PGMs and diamonds. A couple of the very specific issues associated with Transnet and Los Bronces are well in hand, and we're getting on top of all of these things. I can assure you we are absolutely focused on delivery, and we will continue to be agile in our response to current macroeconomic circumstances.</p><p>And with that, again, thank you for your time, and hope you have a good break if there's a break coming your way. Take care.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-aa7295e719ef526ea53ebd706fb4f0d4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTK-K4F3-RSDY-40WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12189\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 8, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002B37</classCode><className>ANGLO AMERICAN PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000A05B</classCode><className>DE BEERS SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS212220 GOLD ORE AND SILVER ORE MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS322211 CORRUGATED &amp;

Hope you're all safe and well wherever you are. Thanks. [Technical Issues] Today, we'll follow our usual flow, but this time with a new face. So, I'd like to introduce John Heasley, who started with us this time last week, taking over from Stephen. And technically, today is day eight for John, although for John, I'm sure it feels a little bit like day 80 already.</p><p>Anyway, I'm going to talk to the steps that we are taking to enhance margins and cash generation across the whole of the business, and that drives significant cost reductions for us and then make our business a lot more resilient. And John is going to then take us through some of the guidance numbers. I'll come back and cover the longer-term outlook and our outstanding growth opportunities that we have across the portfolio and in the right products for the major demand trends that we've spoken about before.</p><p>Now, as always, I'm going to start with safety. Our commitment here to ensuring that our workforce returns home safely every day is unwavering and it will remain our number one priority. We've made significant progress here in improving our injury rates this year, but, in two incidents we still sadly had three fatalities. And we know that there's still a lot more to do.</p><p>Safety and operational performance as you heard me say before go hand-in-hand. As we refocus on getting the basics right, adhering to our operating model, and driving accountability of our leaders to spend more time in the field to deliver that operational stability, I do expect that these levers should support continued improvement of our safety performance.</p><p>Across all of our operations, we considered our workforce to be a single team, and that is regardless of whether they are employees or contractors. Everyone is accountable for working safely in line with our performance standards and that is without exception.</p><p>Now we do indeed have a high-quality portfolio that combines a fantastic suite of assets with our deep bench capabilities and our leading positions in certain products. All of this is underpinned by a robust capital allocation model and a pipeline of organic growth options. The long-term outlook for our products has arguably never ever looked better. A lot has changed in the last 18 months though, and different circumstances require different approaches. We are alive to these near-term challenges and we are responding accordingly. We've experienced a period of high and prolonged inflationary pressure that continues to impact costs across the whole of the industry, and we are taking measures to ensure that the business is set up to be resilient over the longer term, and as we work through some of these temporary operational headwinds too.</p><p>Diamonds and PGMs are a lot closer to the end consumer than the earlier cycle products and therefore as we know, more directly and immediately impacted by changes in discretionary spending patterns. This is true in a slowdown and as history has shown us before, it will equally be true in the case of an upturn. We are working towards positioning our assets squarely in the first half of their respective cost curves and in same time continue to look through the cycles and focus on these longer term demand themes.</p><p>Just turning to the '23 operating performance. So this year we expect to land broadly within our existing guidance range, and our focus has been on operational delivery, and we did indeed achieve a stronger second half as we had planned. In copper, we are delighted that Quellaveco has now ramped up to full capacity. Unit costs here are just a little higher than we expected as we land towards the lower end of our planned production range. But having successfully delivered this project and then been able to ramp it up as a new asset in a new country and transition to the operational phase as smoothly as we were able to do I think is absolutely a testament to the capabilities that we have in this organization.</p><p>At the copper assets in Chile and Nickel, all grades were as expected lower and our world class Quellaveco operation had another very, very good year. Although our sales volume is running a little bit behind our production, mainly because of weather impacts, sea swells et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Performance in the PGM business has been solid, both from the mines and from the operating -- process operating assets. The team here has expertly, I believe, navigated load-curtailment with minimal impact. And from what we can see, Eskom seems to have had a better performance in the second half of this year, although I'm afraid we will have to continue to carefully monitor the outlook and the performance of Eskom into the first half of 2024.</p><p>De Beers operationally has had a very, very solid year. But as I've spoken about before, we face significant pressure in the downstream in the second half. Consumer spending on luxury goods has eased in the current macro environment, and China has been a lot slower to recover post COVID than we had expected it to.</p><p>With the most recent sites of $80 million and $130 million respectively, De Beers has been loss making in the second half of this year. We are now forecasting our expected sales volumes to be around 25 million carats for the year, but we continue to believe that the fundamentals for diamonds are strong, and we are positioning ourselves to supply into that inevitable demand bounce back.</p><p>In Iron Ore, Minas-Rio has been our star performer this year, a stonking performance by the team there, on track for the top end of guidance, and we've seen some performance records that they've achieved along the way too. Kumba similarly has been performing exceptionally well at the operating level, but unfortunately, the logistics just haven't been there. As a consequence of this, in the last few weeks, we've been lowering volumes to manage the on-mine stockpile that has been developing over the last year and a bit, and as a result managing therefore the costs too.</p><p>We will now deliver to the lower end of our production range, but it will be for the purpose of managing about 2 million tons out of the stockpile and to the port. At Steelmaking coal, our focus has continued to be on safe and stable operations. However, consistency and predictability there have proven elusive in quite challenging ground conditions, particularly at Moranbah. We will land somewhere at around about the 16 million tonne mark for this year, and that of course has had an impact on our unit costs. We are now expecting these costs to come in at around $115 per tonne for the year. Of course, with prices north of $300 a ton, we are still generating some very good margins here, despite the excess of Queensland royalties.</p><p>And finally, at Woodsmith, we have made significant progress this year and we are delighted to have hosted you to a visit a few months ago. We will be within touching distance of that 27 kilometers on the tunnel, and we did achieve the world record for the longest tunnel on a single tunnel boring machine. So, well done to Tom and the team there.</p><p>Sinking activities in the deep shafts continue to progress well, 680 meters of depth on the service shaft now and 385 meters on the production shaft. We pre-emptively took some action in the first half of this year to reduce our business support costs by $0.5 billion by the mid of 2024. That work is on track and pretty well advanced. We are improving our organizational effectiveness through a simpler, a leaner, more streamlined organization that has fewer layers and clearer accountabilities. We are also taking measures to increase business resilience across the whole board. Within each of our businesses, we are pulling the necessary levers to enhance our financial performance both near and medium term, and at the same time protecting value over the longer term. That will translate into significant OpEx reductions for us of a further $0.5 billion in 2024.</p><p>And our final lever is in the capital that we deploy. We have now reduced CapEx by $1.8 billion over the guidance period. Let me give you a little bit more color on what we're doing in each of these businesses. So firstly, copper. As you hopefully know, we have a truly world class portfolio in copper including Collahuasi, and it has very, very significant growth potential embedded within it.</p><p>Los Bronces, though, I think is a perfect example of the challenges that the whole of the mining industry is facing. Los Bronces itself is 156 years old, and as a result of that is facing quite a lot of cost pressure from depth and grades. With a reserve life of 34 years and plenty of resources to extend that, it is still an incredible ore body. It still accounts for more than 2% of the world's known copper resources. However, the ore at the current mining area is very hard. It impacts throughput and cost and it'll be at least another two years before we can open up other areas of the mine so that we can blend this ore with the higher grade softer ores and maintain historic production levels. The mine development has also been delayed in the last few years due to COVID related and permitting issues.</p><p>Now, while we work through these challenges in the pit, we've decided to place the older of the two processing plants on care and maintenance in order to reduce our operating costs and our CapEx, which will help drive value for the whole of the business. As a result of our actions, unit costs will be 15% lower, and we will continue to invest, however, in critical projects which will enable a swift reopening of the plant at the right time, in the right pricing environment.</p><p>Los Bronces remains an incredible ore body, and it is important to recognize the merits of having a permitted operation in an established copper jurisdiction. And to that end, we will continue to progress the studies of our Los Bronces underground project. At Quellaveco, we have adjusted the mine plan based on the latest geotechnical assessments of a known fault. Safety always comes first, and the consequence of this re-phasing is that 75,000 tonnes of copper has been displaced into 2027. Now the new plan -- the new mine plan actually anticipates slightly higher overall volumes than we had previously forecast over the next five years reflecting further optimization of the mining sequence. Given the current copper market outlook, of course, we may well also achieve some higher real term prices for these deferred volumes.</p><p>Now, as you know, we are well positioned in high grade iron ore producing premium quality products. However, Transnet's logistics performance is currently limiting our ability to rail our mine volumes at Kumba, and we are now unfortunately stock bound. Had that been delivered to port, we would have made significantly more EBITDA this year. That unsold ore is also a significant blow, of course, to the South African fiscus. Now, while the government absolutely recognizes the severity of this situation, and I am convinced it's continuing to make strides to get it resolved and sorted out, it is our view that this is going to take some time for conditions to improve and a longer term solution to be implemented. And as a result, we are going to focus on ensuring that we have a balanced value chain through the reconfiguration of this business, including a revised mine plan and structural cost reductions to protect our margins.</p><p>Minas-Rio has delivered operationally very well this year as I said. We are now focusing on operational stability and optimization to maximize cash flows there. In 2025, we are dovetailing some additional maintenance work into the pipeline inspection process.</p><p>Now, moving on to Steelmaking coal. As always, and as I said right at the beginning of this presentation, safety has to come first for us. The gas, depth and strata issues represent very big, complex geotechnical challenges for us there. While our mining experience has resulted in improvements in procedures and risk management, we are still some way off where we had hoped to be at this stage of the reopening of these mines.</p><p>Our priority needs to be delivering safe and stable production, and we are now focused on reconfiguring our cost structure in the near and the medium term to match our productive output. Operational improvements, debottlenecking and automation all represent opportunities to raise this capacity of these assets towards 20 million tonnes, and we are working now hard on ensuring that we can implement some of these things.</p><p>We have also made a significant improvement in our Australian operations, in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of which, of course, methane is the largest component. So far, we are capturing around 60% of the methane, and our confidence in addressing the balance has significantly progressed over the last year. We are also now -- have managed to secure a 100% renewable energy for these operations, all starting in January of 2025.</p><p>PGMs have been acutely in focus for us with a sharply lower trajectory in prices over the last -- over the last year, although these did come from unsustainably high levels from the previous year and the year before. The basket price is now firmly into the cost curve, with sector returns at the lowest point seen in this industry in the last 30 years. It remains to be seen how long these prices persist and its effect on a number of producers. We are ensuring that our own operations are resilient and that we secure Mogalakwena's highly attractive value proposition for the longer term.</p><p>The team is working hard to identify and implement further cost reduction initiatives to sustainably deliver an all-in sustaining cost at a touch over $1,000 per PGM ounce. There are also a number of purchase of concentrate agreements that are coming to the end of their contract life and these changes are also now reflected in our revised production numbers.</p><p>We are focused on enhancing returns through lower CapEx and near-term asset optimization work, and as a result, we will not be progressing work on the option for the third concentrate at Mogalakwena, nor will we be progressing work for the time being on the expansion opportunities at both Amandelbult and Mototolo.</p><p>At Mogalakwena, we have an exceptional ore body, and as well, in our operations in Southern Africa we have the largest of the PGM processing capacity. Now that gives us significant optionality and flexibility for the future. As we work on the underground opportunity, we have one of the largest drilling campaigns in Africa underway, and results so far have exceeded our expectations here, giving us confidence in the long-term development of that resource at the right time.</p><p>Our value-over-volume approach will enhance the competitiveness of our world-class PGM assets under a range of price scenarios. Our business is positioned in the first half of the margin curve, which means that we do have significant flexibility within this portfolio. Current prices seem to reflect the aggressive consensus view of the rapidity of decline of the internal combustion engine.</p><p>Recently, we've seen a rolling back and a dilution of many of the measures favoring rapid BEV adoption, hearing a lot more commentary on the difficulty of hitting BEV targets, and more awareness of the need for internal combustion engines to play a role for longer. Now, this plays into our very long held belief that hybrid vehicles will play an absolutely critical transition step to cleaner transport systems. And hybrids, as we know, require similar levels of PGMs to the internal combustion engine. Furthermore, we are also seeing how current market challenges are affecting the supply side. Projects that were previously being discussed are now being shelved, deferred or delayed because they are uneconomic at current prices.</p><p>And longer term, we are seeing hydrogen accelerate just a little bit faster than many of us were forecasting, which supports, I think, the outlook for platinum and iridium in particular. And finally, with significant activity in the market development space, we do remain confident that these young metals with their unique properties will find metallurgical and catalytic uses in clean technology, as well as a host of other industrial applications.</p><p>Moving on to diamonds. At De Beers, we're taking a slightly different approach here as the business has performed extremely well operationally. What has gone against us is the market, particularly in the second half of this year. Demand and prices for diamonds have fallen as global GDP growth has fallen, but all cycles end, and we believe that the current weakness is temporary. Indeed, we are working closely with our partners to ensure that we can supply into that demand increase when it comes.</p><p>Already, there are some signs that the market might be beginning to turn. Nonetheless, we are focused on streamlining De Beers, reducing the annual overheads by $100 million in a sustainable manner. We have also reduced our CapEx for next year with our investment focused on the highest value opportunities that we see in Southern Africa from the existing assets as well as on the exploration front.</p><p>We will focus our efforts on the ramp-up of Venetia Underground in South Africa, and we are planning to move forward with the first phase of Jwaneng Underground at -- in Botswana. The long-term fundamentals are strong, and we have access to the world's best diamond assets. Now these include our renewed mining licenses in Botswana where we are progressing as planned towards a full agreement with the government early next year.</p><p>We are also renewing our efforts in the downstream. The return of the iconic 'A diamond is forever' campaign has proven highly successful, and you can see some of the ads on this slide. We are committed to further strengthening demand for natural diamonds, and the launch of our origin story will differentiate our natural, traceable diamond offering and highlight how the journey of our diamonds makes an extraordinary contribution to the producer countries.</p><p>Woodsmith is the next multi-billion dollar greenfield project in our pipeline. I still believe this is a textbook example of a high quality, Tier 1 asset in a low-risk jurisdiction. It is large scale, it is expandable, long life, and it has structural advantages that will position it in lowest quartile of the cost curve and it has the potential to generate very significant cash flows for many, many decades. You want these sorts of assets in any portfolio. For that reason, we are focused on setting it up right from the outset. It'll be a truly modern and sustainable mine with a minimal impact to the surface. It'll hardly be able to tell that it is there. POLY4 plays perfectly into those global demand themes I spoke about earlier.</p><p>Food security for 10 billion people, and delivering that sustainably remains one of the key challenges for the Ags industry today. POLY4 is the crop nutrition solution that this industry needs. It can increase your crop yields by 3% to 5%, and it will have a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional products, because it is a natural product without any requirement for downstream chemical processing. And that also means it is therefore use -- suitable for organic use.</p><p>The nutrients themselves are of course not new, but the way they present in this product is new. And POLY4 can deliver absolutely significant additional benefits to the farmer, well beyond the pure nutrient value. There is an enormous potential here in POLY4, even if we just capture a small slice of that significant upside.</p><p>And with that, John, I'll hand over to you to take us through the guidance for the next few years, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Heasley:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Duncan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here and I look forward to meeting many of you personally over the coming months. My decision to join Anglo American was predicated on a number of things.</p><p>Firstly, my deep rooted personal belief in the criticality of the mining industry to the world's development and energy transition.</p><p>Secondly, a great culture with a focus on doing the right thing for the long term.</p><p>And thirdly, a fantastic set of assets, global leading positions in diamonds and PGMs, high-quality iron ore, and phenomenal copper assets with great growth potential.</p><p>No, as Duncan said, while it's only day eight of the job, I'm pleased to see that my experience thus far has been hugely confirmatory. It's also been timely, given that I've had the opportunity to participate in detailed budget review meetings with each of our businesses. And I've been especially encouraged by the unwavering desire of my Board and executive colleagues to do all that we can to maximize performance and returns from our existing assets to fund our future growth options. And I'm sure as you can appreciate, as a Scottish finance director, that is music to my ears.</p><p>Moving on to the numbers, Duncan has stepped you through the operational performance for 2023. That translates into expected production, up about 3% on last year, with unit costs up around 5%, reflecting higher CPI as well as the impact of lower grades, harder ores and deeper pits. You will see in the appendices some more detail by business if required.</p><p>On capex, we expect to come in under our full year guidance at around $5.8 billion, following general tightening of spend across the Board. Our effective tax rate at around 39% is slightly higher than the range previously indicated and reflects the impact of profit mix, higher contributions from South America and lower contributions from Southern Africa, particularly De Beers. I would like to remind everyone that a lot of other producers, particularly in Australia, for example, pay more of that economic rent and royalties that set an operating costs rather than the tax line. And on an all-in basis, we aren't too dissimilar from those peers.</p><p>Working capital has continued to build through the second half of the year and this will be a particular focus of mine. Inventories are higher than we would like, especially in De Beers and Kumba, given market demand and transportation issues respectively. That said, the key driver of the circa $1.5 billion anticipated increase in working capital this year is payables, with the lion's share being in PGMs, given the impact of lower prices on the valuation of the bulk payables and the customer prepayment. Finally, and of course, subject to Board discussion and approval in the new year, we would expect the dividend payout to be in line with our well established policy at 40%.</p><p>Looking now at production for the next three years, you've heard from Duncan that we are very focused on maximizing the margins and cash generation from our operations. Against this backdrop, we've taken some difficult, but necessary decisions to reconfigure some of the operations in order to capture more value from recovery. This translates into production being lower next year, most significantly in copper, with the older and smaller Los Bronces plant moving into care and maintenance and the rephasing at Quellaveco due to the known fault.</p><p>Our volume guidance is down 7% over the next two years before rising 4% in 2026. These reconfigurations enable significant cost reductions and will ultimately support higher margins and returns. Those cost reductions from our reconfigurations are evident on this next slide. Early action to improve resilience and margins is expected to deliver a 2% reduction in unit costs next year and broadly maintain those over the following two years. With CPI across our geographies at around 5%, you can see the favorable impact of our actions is significant.</p><p>In copper, PGMs and iron ore, we are delivering significant year-on-year cost reductions and should see a resultant move to improve our position on the cost curves. We are rigorously implementing these measures to ensure they are comprehensively embedded into our operational footprint, allowing us to sustain this performance.</p><p>At De Beers, the transition of Venetia to underground operations adversely impacts the unit costs of our managed operations. While we are proposing to change the ramp-up in light of prevailing market conditions and to optimize capital spend, we expect unit costs to return to current levels from 2026 as volumes pick up.</p><p>The Steelmaking coal business is more levered to fixed costs given the nature of longwall mining, and more generally, we're seeing Queensland slip down the rankings of competitiveness as a mining jurisdiction, due to the additional royalty regimes implemented last year. While we have managed to broadly offset the key inflationary pressures, we're still working very hard to find opportunities to lower that cost base. If we can deliver any upside in our production, that represents our greatest margin lever for this business.</p><p>Finally from me, our cost discipline also extends to capex. We've identified opportunities to reduce capex by $1.8 billion from now to 2026. That's $0.2 billion in 2023, $0.8 billion in 2024 and a further $0.4 billion in 2025. 2026 capex gains is now set at $5.3 billion, which is $0.4 billion than our previous budget. These figures now include Woodsmith as we guided earlier in the year to a spend of around $1 billion per annum.</p><p>Safety and asset integrity spend is untouched in these updated numbers. Those are sacrosanct. The savings reflect the refocus of investment. Two such examples are to pursue only the underground at Mogalakwena and PGMs and the technical review of the UHDMS project at Kumba. We will pull similar levers across the balance of the portfolio as required until we reach the FNTP decision on Woodsmith expected in early 2025, current governance processes will continue with ongoing spend remaining subject to annual Board approval.</p><p>As we have said, we will consider potential partnership opportunities for this business at the right time, with the right partners and of course, for value. In summary, we have updated our numbers with a focus on reducing costs, enhancing margins and driving cash generation. I am confident that these are the right decisions for both the near and long term.</p><p>Thank you, and I will now hand back to Duncan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks John. So, turning now to the longer term outlook, we have a highly differentiated investment proposition underpinned by our high quality portfolio very long mine lives, and a -- which is diversified across many critical minerals and metals that are essential for both ongoing global economic development and the transition to cleaner energy. This is supported by a strong marketing capability that maximizes the value of the products that we deliver to our customers.</p><p>Our diversified portfolio works as a whole. Each of the businesses has a very clear role, delivering a balance between cash generation and the funding and execution of our well sequenced sets of growth options. With the current focus on copper and crop nutrients that together are set up to strongly deliver enhanced value in the future.</p><p>The attractive growth options that we have are naturally well sequenced over the next 10 years from a cash generation and a capital allocation perspective. As you all know, permitting timelines are a natural break on bringing on any new supply. The fifth ball mill at Collahuasi is now up and running with some debottlenecking options there to follow. Then permits are expected for the fourth line at Collahuasi in 2027. Once the studies have been completed, it will then follow peak spend at Woodsmith. That's Collahuasi.</p><p>So, permitting is then expected for Sakatti in 2029, with the underground expansion at Los Bronces potentially delivering an annual production increment of 100,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes per annum. Sakatti is the greenfield option in Finland with a relatively low capital cost. It has a high grade, it is a polymetallic ore body, it contains copper, battery grade nickel, platinum gold and some cobalt. Whilst it is relatively small, it could deliver at least 100,000 tonnes of copper equivalent over a mine life that could extend over a couple of decades or so. And the by-products here would, of course, give us a negative cash cost position.</p><p>Our unique project execution capabilities should allow us to unlock the value of this particular ore body. Los Bronces underground could deliver over 10 million tonnes of copper equivalent over 100 years with copper head grades of around 1.5%. Whilst studies are ongoing, significant work has already progressed on optimizing the capital spend and we could deliver those volumes at, I believe, a very competitive capital intensity.</p><p>At Quellaveco, we are progressing the studies of the expansion options that would help sustain production after we are through the initial high grade period. We initially oversized the elements of the plant in order to cater for this increase in throughput rates, and we are studying further expansion potential here, such as the possible third ball mill. Beyond the existing site, there is also additional regional potential that our discovery team are very interested in, including the adjacent Mamut area which is around 10 km away from the current mine.</p><p>Now, while we are taking firm action to respond to the near term pressure, our commitment to responsible and sustainable mining is unwavering. We will continue to apply our value focused approach to delivering on our sustainability ambitions. We have made good progress with the first wave of Envusa renewable energy projects in Southern Africa this year, and we will secure more than enough renewable energy for our own needs, decoupling ourselves from the double-digit cost escalation in the electricity contracts that we have today, and providing a greater grid stability to support broad economic development in the region.</p><p>Envusa makes absolutely good business sense to us. It is strongly NPV positive whilst also at the same time being the right solution for us. It is great for decarbonization goals and it is great for South Africa. We seek out opportunities in challenges. These capabilities are a key enabler for our growth pathway from the delivery of Quellaveco through to the permitting milestones that we have achieved this year at both Los Bronces and Sakatti, as well as the renewal of our long standing partnership with the government of Botswana.</p><p>Understanding our social license to operate remains at the heart of our approach. We have a clear track record of delivering on our promises. Communities and host governments can see that, and they value that. We have been operating in our current jurisdictions for decades, learning, evolving and continuing to refine our approach. We aim to be the development partner that countries choose to work with.</p><p>So, to conclude, the outlook for metals and minerals has never looked stronger, underpinned by the three mega demand trends that you've heard me speak about before. While much of the conversation today seems to be around and focused on decarbonization, lets not forget that poverty remains the number one and most urgent daily challenge of much of the world's population, uplifting global living standards amid a growing global population requires an unprecedented level of economic development.</p><p>For example, giving everyone in the developing world a living standard equivalent to just half that enjoyed in the developed world today would require us to mine an additional 70 billion tonnes of iron ore and an additional 1 billion tonnes of copper. Those numbers are quite extraordinary. To put that in context, that would represent approximately the same amount of iron ore that has been extracted over the entire course of human history and 1.3 times the amount of copper that has ever been mined. And we must remember that we are discovering new applications for materials that we produce all of the time. Similarly, to feed the global population over the next 30 years will require the use of more man-made fertilizers than have been consumed in total over the last 100 years.</p><p>So, our portfolio, with its diversification of high quality and long life assets, I think it's very well positioned to deliver in these trends. We are taking deliberate, decisive and necessary performance interventions in this challenging and dynamic near term environment to improve our resilience, capture value and ensure that we are set up to deliver for the long term. These measures, together with our technical capabilities and our approach to sustainability, position our assets to deliver significant and enduring value for decades to come.</p><p>And with that, I am very happy to take questions. John and I are joined for this session with you -- with Ruben, Temba, Al and Matt Daley. So, Paul, if you would like to master the ceremony of the question session, that would be great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Galloway:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Duncan. If you would like to ask a question, you can see the details on the screen. I would like to hand over to the operator, Ellie, to take the first question, please.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Fairclough:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Jason Fairclough from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the presentation. Some very interesting points. Look, a bit of a big picture question for you. So, Duncan, you inherited a company running a series of tier-1 assets. Today, it feels like we have pressure in at least four major businesses, right. So, in PGMs, in diamonds, at Kumba, and at some of the copper assets. And then on top of that, you are going to be burning about $1 billion a year at Woodsmith for the foreseeable future. And today, you are taking quite aggressive steps to conserve cash. So, how do you think about this? Is there actually an opportunity here to focus the portfolio, perhaps to shed some of the assets that don't have a position in Anglo American longer term? I guess some people would say that diversification is the enemy of simplicity, but just interested in how you are thinking about the portfolio, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Jason. Look I mean you picked up a couple of interesting points there in terms of elements of the business that are exposed to a cycle. Very unusual that we have the confluence of a number of effects like PGMs, diamonds and the transport issues in South Africa related to Kumba, all happening at the same time in a portfolio of this nature. But this is what's happened. And what you're seeing is us take the appropriate level of response to this thing. Certainly from a whole of portfolio position, what we are doing -- I mean a couple of points that I want to reiterate there.</p><p>First of all, every asset in the portfolio has a role. Some are cash generating assets and some we then invest that cash in a value balanced way in accordance with our capital allocation model, including returns to shareholders, in developing other assets over the business. And I think that's how you have to think about a portfolio. Cycles will be cycle, they will come and go and we expect that with the quality and the type of assets that we've got in the portfolio through the long run, there are extraordinary returns that get developed out of this.</p><p>Now, of course, part of what we have to do in response to the current economic climate and some of the issues that we've got temporarily and uniquely in this particular portfolio, we have to be sure that we are conserving cash and we are allocating that cash even more rigorously. That's what we said that we would do and this is what you're seeing us do. In the context of Woodsmith, this becomes part of the portfolio that will replace this portfolio over time. So what we will get in Woodsmith is one of the world's pre-eminent orebodies with a great level of flexibility in the right commodity set to serve the right customer base, that sits at the bottom of the cost curve, spinning off large volumes of cash for multiple decades. Now, that doesn't just happen, it has to be built up over time and therefore, this allocation is very careful and very thoughtful.</p><p>In the context of your question about is this time to review elements of the portfolio. Well, I think all of the time is the right time to review elements of the portfolio. As I said earlier, every asset in the portfolio has a role to play and it is important that that role is effectively played through the lifecycle of those assets and through the holistic cycles of the macroeconomy that affect the business over time. So we do review every single asset and its role in the portfolio on a regular basis. So not just now, but even at the tops of cycles, it is our job to continue to ensure that we have the right mix and suite of assets within the portfolio. So it is ongoing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Fairclough:</emphasis></p><p>And look, Duncan, when we were up in Yorkshire, I think over dinner, one of the investors asked you, if there are any sacred cows. I think was the phrase in the portfolio, is everything for sale at the right price?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Well, look, I mean, the short answer to that is, if you're managing a portfolio like we are, there are clearly no sacred cows in it. Because if every asset has its place and its time, we have to look at it through that lens all of the time. So, no, there are no sacred cows.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jason Fairclough:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, beautiful. Thanks very much. And thanks again for the presentation today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks, Jason.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Next question comes from Alain Gabriel from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alain Gabriel:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for taking my question. Hi, Duncan. Hi, everyone. So, you have reset your volume guidance today, you've doubled down on the cost cutting program and pulled back on capex. But the market doesn't seem to think this is enough, judging by how the share prices have reacted today. First question, is there more or deeper restructuring that you can or are prepared to do across the various businesses to speed up the turnaround? One.</p><p>And then two on Woodsmith following up on on Jason's question. that's the single largest consumer of cash today and for the foreseeable future as well. Is finding a strategic partner on the table to help share the capital burden? I think you've addressed this before, but in light of your new guidance, is there a new thinking around it? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Aline, Thanks. So, second question first. John addressed that in his part of the presentation. So, there's no new thinking on this thing, we continue at pace to find a partner, the right partner at the right price for this particular asset. And so, no new news there. In terms of the levers that we've got to pull, we continue to focus on the things that we can control and we will continue to control them in an appropriate way in response to the conditions as we move forward.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alain Gabriel:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Tyler Broda from RBC. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tyler Broda:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thanks very much. I've got two questions. One, I was wondering if you can go a little bit more into Quellaveco in terms of sort of the guidance for next year, which looks, I think, a little bit soft versus expectations. Why did this come about, could you just give us a bit more color there? I guess the second question is a question around, I guess, just the working capital, diamonds, PGMs, the Kumba buildup, how do you expect to see that evolved? Obviously, there'll be lower production, but can you give us a bit of steer on where you see the working capital over the next sort of 12, 24 months? Thanks very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Sure, Tyler. Matt, I'm going to come to you in terms of the fault at Quellaveco and how we're navigating our way around that and the implications for it. But on working capital, I'll also ask Al, just to talk about what we're doing with diamonds. But certainly at Kumba, the response there has been to slow the mine down and move the stockpile until such time as Transnet recovers. Tyler, as I've said before, there's been an enormous amount of work by both business and government and Transnet to get on with the recovery of that particular institution and the logistics infrastructure. And that work is progressing.</p><p>It is unfortunately not going to represent in a massive turnaround or recovery to the original capacity that that line had in the next year or two. Now that's quite a long time for a business to remain stock bound and very difficult for us not to effectively respond to that. And so that's what Mpumi and the team are doing. We have absolutely not lost faith in the fact that this will recover and it will come back. But being very realistic in terms of the progress that's been made over the last year or so, it is unlikely in our view, that this recovery will be next year. And so therefore, we are just planning accordingly.</p><p>There are no material or significant impacts to the mine itself because as soon as we get the transport capacity, we will be able to ramp the operations back up. So, with that in mind, we will be able to take care of the working capital or the excess working capital at Kumba over the next couple of years. In PGMs, really, there's a little bit of slag as a result of the original Polokwane deferral about a year ago that we need to work through, but that's not really a big deal. The biggest impact to working capital as far as PGMs are concerned are the impact of the POC and Toll agreements and the prepayment agreement that we had with one of our customers that is just unwinding into a lower pricing environment at this particular point in time. So, whilst John is completely focused, as are we on working capital management, this will be one of those.</p><p>And then perhaps, Al, before we go to Matt, you could talk about diamond inventories and the cycle management, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Duncan. Certainly. So, through the course of particularly the second half of this year, we've seen a downturn in demand for diamonds driven by predominantly macroeconomic factors. As Duncan said earlier, we know that cycles are by definition cyclical and because of that, we've kept production relatively steady through the second half of this year and that has led to a buildup of inventory, because so many of our costs are fixed, that appears to us to be the wise thing to do and sets us up very well for the inevitable upturn during the course of the next year. We're growing in confidence in that upturn coming sooner rather than later.</p><p>Having said that, if there is continued lower for longer prices and demand on diamonds, we have a series of levers that we can pull during the course of 2024. And we work with our producer countries and our partners in those countries to do so, including, of course, mining lower grade ore and making operational changes on that basis. So there are a series of levers we can pull depending on the circumstances ahead. But as I say, we are in a good position if, as we believe, there is an upturn beginning during 2024. Thanks, Duncan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Al. Matt, do you want to just talk to the fault at Quellaveco, please?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt Daley:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, certainly. Thanks, Duncan. And thanks, Tyler, for the question. So, Quellaveco ore body continues to impress us as we've progressed the mining and learn more about this particular ore body. We've always known about this fault zone and we continue to look at our pit designs to optimize extraction for both productivity and costs. And so, what you are seeing is just a re-phasing of the copper over the business plan period. And in fact, this redesign, while slightly lower copper in 2024, actually delivers higher total copper and hence value over the next five years. So mining progresses pretty much as planned and we'll continue to optimize this pit, well into the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tyler Broda:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Liam Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liam Fitzpatrick:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sorry to go over some ground that's already being covered, but I just wanted to clarify kind of how you're thinking about things. So the first one is just on Woodsmith. So I think back in the trip, you said partnering or syndication was part of the longer term strategy at the right time. Has there been a bit of a shift there? Because I think you suggested that, there may be a process. So where is that now? Is there an active partnering process going on at the moment?</p><p>And then in terms of that -- the previous question on the portfolio, I guess the share price performance today in this year is telling you that the market doesn't think there's enough action at the moment. Could we expect any further kind of details from you and the management team next year in terms of perhaps how you see the portfolio, whether that's in terms of the asset base or division? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Liam. I mean you are actually covering ground that I think we've already addressed. So I'll just say it again for clarification. So the syndication process is something that we will do and it will be done at the right time and for value. I think that's really important, given an asset of this nature. And then as far as any portfolio changes and so on, we will continue to do what we need to do to ensure that we have a high quality portfolio of assets that delivers through the cycle, and we will continue to respond in whatever way is necessary to respond to both short and long term circumstances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liam Fitzpatrick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Could I just ask an operational one as well, please. Just on De Beers. So at this point, there's no production cuts. How long do you wait before we could see something a bit more meaningful on the production side? Just to react to what the weakness we're seeing in the market. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>We're not waiting. So, we are working actively at the moment with our partners in the producer countries in order to identify the levers that we can take step by step during the course of the year. As I said, we need to be careful with this because a large number of our costs are fixed. So we need to avoid doing something that actually, just disrupts mines, which then take a lot to recover from and doesn't actually create the cost savings that you really want to drive out of this. But no, we're not waiting. We're working actively with our partners at the moment and to ensure that if things do stay low, then we're ready to react to that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liam Fitzpatrick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Richard Hatch from Berenberg. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks very much and good morning. I've got a couple of questions. The first one is just on Los Bronces. I mean, it's a pretty big cut in volumes. Can you just help us a little bit out, just in terms of what that second plant run rate is, you know, what kind of price situation do you need to see, that kind of ramp up again? And are you able just to sort of give us a bit more color on that copper chili volume cut? Is it entirely Bronces or is there other bits and bobs elsewhere? That's the first one, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Richard. Look, Bronces, the volume cut is of the one plant. So this is the old Los Bronces plant is around about 60,000 tonnes per day of capacity that comes out. It's fundamentally led by a couple of things. So, first of all, the mine development has been held back. As we know, we're monophasic out there at the moment. It's going to take a couple of years to get Donoso open up. And during that period of time, the capital required for this plant the operating costs on this plant are extraordinarily high. So, the margins on every copper tonne that come out are very close to zero or negative on that basis. So, it doesn't make any sense for us to keep running that plant at current short term pricing.</p><p>So, Ruben and the team are going to use this time to deal with one of the tailings dams that we are in the process of moving and manage the cost. So, we will be able to start this plant back up in the right price environment and certainly pretty quickly in a couple of years time if that transpired. So, that is the major issue at Los Bronces and it's the right response, it's value over volume.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I hear you. Cool. Understood. And I guess that probably means that in the capex numbers, there's a little bit less stripping in there if you're not having to push as hard.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>[Speech Overlap] That is correct.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Cool. And then just on coal. We've talked a bit about coal in the past as well. Met coal prices -- costs continue to sort of remain elevated. I get that there's a Queensland royalty change that's impacted the cost curve full stop. But on that Met coal business down in Queensland is 20 million tonnes now, the right long term run rate to think about where it can be. And this business has previously operated at $60 a tonne. I completely get it's a different environment now. But what's a good long term line in the sand to set a target for on costs for the coal business in Australia? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>So, Richard, look, I mean -- I think the right sort of long term run rate for this operation is in the order of sort of 24 million, 25 million tonnes per annum. And Themba, Dan and the team are now ensuring that their long run cost base is appropriate to that type of productive output. It'll take a couple of years to get from 17 million tonnes, which is where we're going to end around about this year, to the 25 million tonnes but in advance of that we're making sure that we've got the right cost structure to support that sort of output.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And long term costs?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>So, Long term inflation, long term exchange rates, I'll say we will control every element of this that we can.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hatch:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks for your time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Next question comes from Myles Allsop from UBS. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Myles Allsop:</emphasis></p><p>Great, thank you. Yeah, just a couple of questions. First of all, just looking back, this is the second consecutive year where we've had some fairly material cutbacks to guidance. What can you say, just to give us some confidence that this is the last of the bad news, that when we get to December 2024, we're not going to have another round of cuts to production guidance?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Myles. We've got some very good assets in the portfolio. They have, many of them been impacted by some very unique set of circumstances coming out of the COVID years and then some specific logistics and infrastructural issues generally around the world and that's been the biggest issue. We have adjusted, I think, dynamically to these circumstances. And as things become clearer, we've used this great team of people and our planning processes to come up with something that we believe is a very meaningful and realistic outcome for the next couple of years in this business.</p><p>So I can absolutely assure you that the things that we are in control of, that we need to be on control of, are being well controlled by a team of extraordinary people. And once we come through some of these cyclical impacts, particularly in diamonds and PGMs, we will be very, very well set.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Myles Allsop:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then maybe just on the cost savings. Obviously that's the other new news from today, this billion dollars that's coming through. To what degree is that embedded in the unit cost guidance or as we look into 2025 unit costs, obviously you're not guiding that at this point. Can we hope to see a further step down in unit costs across a number of the divisions?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>John, do you want to take that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Heasley:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no problem. Thanks Myles, nice to talk to you. Yeah, the costing, as you said, the $500 million we talked about previously on the overhead work. So that continues and is well underpinned and well progressed, so that's coming through nicely. The new $500 million that we've announced today, that's more operationally focused, given the action that we've been talking through. So that is coming through in the unit costs and that underpins the 2% step down in unit costs in 2024.</p><p>And I think it's not to underestimate the scale of that, given that's 2% net offsetting, as I said, CPI running at 4% to 5%, plus mining inflation on top of that. So there is significant action there. And obviously, that won't all come in immediately on 1 January, so there will be a carry forward of some of that on an annualized basis into 2025. And as I said in my presentation, we expect to see that those unit costs will hold broadly at the sort of 2024 levels for a couple of years thereafter, which I think gives good confidence that we see a little bit more in the tank to continue to manage to offset that inflation that I just described.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Myles Allsop:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Chris LaFemina from Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the update. So, just a question on the diamond market, first, the weakness that you're seeing, which you're attributing to consumer weakness, feels like a bit like 2008, 2009. But the global economy obviously isn't as bad as it was then. So I'm wondering how much of this is a function of kind of a structural shift into synthetics? And can you comment on whether synthetics demand is down as much as natural diamond demand, or is it just the real diamonds that are getting impacted more by the weaker consumer?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Al, do you want to take that first?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Thanks, Duncan. This is a question which, as you can imagine, preoccupies a lot of our waking thoughts. We see three main causes for the downturn in diamond demand over the course of the last year. The first is obviously macroeconomic. When global growth rates fall as they've fallen, diamonds are often disproportionately hit by that, the converse, of course, when growth rates go up. So the first is, is that macroeconomics.</p><p>The second is China and the lag that we're seeing in the Chinese market responding. And when Chinese consumers are going out at the moment, they're buying investments rather than diamonds in the same quantity.</p><p>The third aspect that we're seeing is that engagements and therefore the purchase of engagement rings in the United States, are down. And that's because two, three years ago, when the people who would be getting engaged today should have been meeting for the first time, we had the COVID lockdowns. So we're seeing that lag there. So those three main effects, GDP, Chinese demand lagging and staying low and thirdly, this after the macro piece as well on GDP.</p><p>Now, you asked about lab-grown diamonds and the encroachment that lab-grown diamonds are making. This is really interesting. So, what we're seeing is three things. So, lab-grown supply continuing to rise out of India and China. We're seeing lab-grown sales in terms of the amount, the numbers of diamonds, going up in the United States, not really outside the United States, this is mainly a U.S. issue. But we are seeing lab-grown diamond prices plummet, so they are down 90% over the last two years. And that's why you're seeing lab-grown diamond manufacturers heading towards bankruptcy at the moment.</p><p>So greater volume and much lower prices. What does that actually mean for us. This is actually as we predicted it's just happening a bit faster and what we're seeing is this bifurcation, this total splitting of the natural versus lab-grown. So, it's painful in the short term, undoubtedly, because it means a lot of lab-grown volume going in, but it's good in the long term in that now that prices for lab-grown are less than 10% at a wholesale level of those prices than natural. There is less and less confusion between the products and we believe that we're moving towards a time where we're going to see very, very differentiated markets for those two products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>So thank you for that. You're not concerned about lab-grown diamonds taking significant market share from natural stones and high end jewelry? And is that even happening or is it more lower end jewelry where synthetics are getting the market share? I guess my concern here is that the cyclical, the U.S. economy is not terrible and you're seeing the rough diamond market there very, very weak. So, just wondering how much of a real recovery we can see even if the U.S. economy stays resilient or do people just buy more of these synthetics?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Al Cook:</emphasis></p><p>So I think there's a couple of things going on. It's a really, really good question. There are a couple of things going on. Firstly, the natural diamond demand in the United States is not that bad at the moment. And we saw relatively good performance during the Thanksgiving and the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period. So, we can't complain about that. What we are seeing I think a push that's happened through the last two to three years where lab-grown diamonds did encroach on areas such as engagement rings. But with the rapid fall now in lab-grown diamond prices, as I said down 90% in the last two years, we are seeing lab-grown diamond moving towards being more of a fashion item, fashion jewellery, rather than the jewellery that marks the most meaningful moments in people's lifetimes, which is, of course, what we focus on in De Beers.</p><p>Now, when you're at that period where, if you like the forest fire is burning most brightly and we're seeing large amounts of supply coming in, I think it's very important that we look actually at the profitability of that business, at the prices of the lab-grown diamonds and that's why we're so confident in the bifurcation of the market going forward. And in our view, natural diamonds remain, what they have been for hundreds of years, symbols of the most important moments in people's lives. And lab-grown diamonds do what crystal, Swarovski crystal, cubic zirconia has been -- and that is, they remain a fantastically fun bit of fashion jewellery.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>And Chris, just to reiterate. In terms of the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio, from a diamonds perspective, these are second to none. And there have been very, very few, none actually, new diamond discoveries in the last 15 years or so and some of the older diamond assets are shutting down and closing down too. So all of that, everything that Al said, particularly in terms of what we're seeing as a natural break in the lab-grown markets to the natural markets and what's ultimately becoming a scarcity of supply of natural diamonds I think stands this business in very good stead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris LaFemina:</emphasis></p><p>Got it, thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Ian Rossouw from Barclays. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Rossouw:</emphasis></p><p>Morning, thank you. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, on the PGM business, in the release or the AMPLAT's release you mentioned that it's roughly keeping current production from own operations flat. But you talk about a review underway to identify further opportunities. II mean, is this an opportunity to more meaningfully cut some of these higher cost, deep underground shafts. Maybe, just curious what that could entail and what the business could look like in, let's say, five years' time.</p><p>And then secondly, just on some of the copper growth options you mentioned, Duncan, how should we think about the timing of these with regards to Los Bronces underground and Collahuasi expansions. I guess, you showed on that chart, but how do this investments of these, sort of dovetail with each other or will there be some overlap in the second half of this decade? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, Ian, sure. So, on the PGMs front, Themba and Craig are absolutely having a look through all of the operating performance of all of these assets. Value over volume will be the driving mantra in all of this. But, of course, we are absolutely optimistic on PGMs and certainly the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio are again, very, very good and therefore, we believe should be right placed to be able to present into this demand that we will see coming for all the reasons that I spoke about earlier.</p><p>I mean, if you plot the industry returns over the last 30 years, we are absolutely at the lowest of the lows in that period of time and that can't be right in terms of this industry generally and our assets in particular. So, Themba and Craig will continue with the review of the general performance of this business. We are as I said earlier, absolutely focused on being sure that we are the best at what we can be the best of and what we are in control of. So, let them get done with that review and we'll see what comes out of that.</p><p>As far as the copper growth options are concerned, I did take you through more or less the timing and the sequencing that we expect for these assets or for these projects in the future. So, the first one is rarely is going to be Collahuasi after Woodsmith. So right now we are in -- as I say, the fifth ball mill is up and running. We've got a few opportunities around debottlenecking there within the current permit, but then we will need to get the permits for the fourth line. And our expectation is that we would be able to acquire these permits in around '27. So, the time that we get the permit would be actually after we've got through the peak spend of capex at Woodsmith. So we'd be on into the execution of the project of the fourth line at Collahuasi '28, '29, '30 so, coming into production in the early '30s.</p><p>And we expect then to be able to get a permit. So we've got the first permit for Sakatti and that is the finished permit now going through the European Union process in 2029. So therefore real construction probably 2030, 2031 and that's more or less at the tail end of the Collahuasi construction.</p><p>And then Los Bronces underground is probably out beyond that, so we're busy doing the pre-feasibility study-B for that now. And then we have, by and large, the environmental permits and there's a number of other permits that we would need to go through for that. But my expectation is that the majority of that spend would occur naturally just after Sakatti is completed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Rossouw:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Maybe just to push you on the PGM restructuring, if you say that you'll look at value over volume. Does that mean that sort of 2.1 to 2.3 from own minds? I mean, how much meaningfully can that fall?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>I don't know. I mean, when we're through this review, every ounce needs to have its own margin on it and not only in the short run, but in the long run too. So obviously, we're not going to make deep, hard cutting to the bone, irrational decisions in terms of the short run when we've got a view on what the long term demand for these assets are going to be or these products are going to be. But if we cannot see sustainable value on every ounce, then we will take those ounces out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Rossouw:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>The next question comes from Matt Green from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, everyone. I think you've covered most of the bases, so I'll have a couple on your copper growth. Just to start with, Collahuasi, and I've got a follow-on on Quellaveco. Just on the brownfield growth, you suggested previously an uplift of around 20,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes with the debottlenecking initiatives, and you seems to have landed on about 25,000 tonnes. And then the fourth line expansion seems to have increased from around 100 to 150 from the early 2030s. So, just keen to know what are the scope change has been between the two options, and is bioleaching still part of the thinking?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Matt, hi. Yeah, so I'll ask Ruben just to talk to the ball mill output. I still think that that's somewhere between 20,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes on our share basis. I think it's just fundamentally a function of where we are in the ore body at any one particular point in time. The fourth line is pretty much in the same sort of dimension as we had previously said, both in terms of quantum and timing. So, I don't think there is any change there.</p><p>And as far as bioleaching is concerned, that remains potentially one of the options but you need a high -- relatively high and sustainable price environment to make that work because we will have to do a little bit of capital to put the appropriate leach pads and plants in place to do that. So, that is under consideration, but it isn't a high priority in the short run. Ruben, do you just want to clarify on the ball mill production, please?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruben Fernandes:</emphasis></p><p>Oh, that's right, Duncan. It's around that. So, 15,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes additional to our share. We are ramping up very well this month, so I think we could expect that coming in next year. And of course, there is a little bit of grade as well that we need to compensate. So, I think this ball mill will cover that. But you're right. And then we have this option, as you mentioned, the debottlenecking options, and can be leaching, can be more flotation cells. So, we are in a process to discuss that with our partners. And then the fourth line, that's the big expansion, as you mentioned, is later on, but you are right, so the numbers are right, so no change in scope. Matt, to be honest, it's just another adjustment of the profile, the roadmap for each phase of the growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's handy. Thanks for clarifying. And then just coming back to two parts, I guess just near term, with the plants and operation fully ramped up, how's your fresh water usage been relative to expectations? And are you comfortable in the immediate term that you won't be water constraints given the droughts in the region, and then just to follow-on, on more longer term. Duncan, you've highlighted on the fact you have scoped that mill up to 150,000 tonnes a day. You permitted it to around 130,000 tonnes if I recall. So just in terms of both an infrastructure and permitting, what's required here to push Quellaveco to 150,000 tonnes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, Ruben, I'll ask you to just clarify the water situation. We had some really good precipitation during the course of this year. So, I think stocks are pretty good going on into next year. And then, of course, we've got the new water scheme, which will come in from 2025 onwards. So, I think we're going to be okay from a water perspective. But Reuben can clarify that.</p><p>In terms of the constraints at Quellaveco, we're currently doing 127,500 tonnes a day. That is our permit constraint. That permit was fundamentally constrained by water availability. We were pretty certain that given our design of this operation and the way we would be able to operate it, we would be able to demonstrate a water efficiency higher than what we were able to get permitted. And with that in mind, we should be able to then apply through the normal amendment processes for an increment in that permit to what we believe is the appropriate size for that shape and geometry of ore body, which would tolerate around about 150,000 tons per day.</p><p>So we would need for that to happen, us to be able to have a few years and a few seasons of collected and demonstrated water manage and performance data, and then use that as part of the baseline information that would go into the permitting process. And then that gives us the ability to bring that expansion. The intention would be, in another couple of years, another year or two, to be able to start that process. As I said, before we had in the original design of the project, in anticipation of this, keyed in the potential tie-ins for that volumetric expansion. So, it should be a relatively low capital intensity expansion when we get to it.</p><p>So, Ruben, do you want to just clarify the water?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruben Fernandes:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, sure. So, as you know Chile has been suffering a lot with water restrictions. And as part of the long term solution, we have this integrated water solution project that we call that is progressing very well, 33% completed as we speak. So by end of '25 we should be up and running. It's a long term contract with a partner, so that's going well. And short term, as you know, we need to have trucks, water trucks supplying water to the plant. But as we speak now, because of the good rainy season in Chile this year, we are not running those trucks at the moment.</p><p>But of course at some point next year, depending on the need, we should run a little bit of, to have a little bit of water trucks on the road. But because we're closing one plant, maybe this is something that cannot happen. So we should have probably 34% less cost in water, which is a big deal for Bronces, as you know, we should remove out of the business of $70 million per year in water next year. So I think it's the right decision to shut the plan given the context that bank explained. And then of course the water solution is well balanced now to deal with this situation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, that's helpful. Sorry, my question was actually more geared towards drought potential in Peru with Quellaveco. Just to confirm your water stocks are fine at Quellaveco?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, I think they are. Ruben, do you want to confirm?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruben Fernandes:</emphasis></p><p>No. Yes, absolutely no, it's confirmed. So, no issue in terms of water for Quellaveco. We have availability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Green:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Alexander Pearce from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexander Pearce:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning all. Duncan, I was just wondering if you could drill down into the lower near-term guidance in Minas-Rio a little bit more, please, and particularly in 2024, which is a little bit surprising. Maybe given that strong performance, you flagged in '23. And then, longer term, the question is really, is there still a chance that we could see that 25 million tonne to 27 million tonne per annum run rate in your guidance again or is the new long term lower?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Alex, hi. Thanks for that. So, look, two things going on at Minas-Rio, none of them unknown to us. The first is that, as a result of that water leak several years ago, have to run a PIG through the waterline every four or five years. And so what we are doing is just planning for that production drop as a result of the time that it takes us to PIG the line and check the dimensions of the wall thickness of the pipeline in to plan.</p><p>The second thing is that the ore body transitions over a very long time to a much harder rock, the hard itabirite, as they called. And, as we run through that transition, there are just various phases of a mixed proportion between the hard rock and the softer ore that we're in now. The impact of which is to slow processing rates down. There was a lot of thinking at the time that was done at the time that we thought that it might be possible to get to 27 odd million tonnes per annum, that we would be able to deploy some technology that would help us with this throughput and processing rate.</p><p>That's probably a little bit more a way off than we had originally planned for it to be. So the mine is currently operating or currently has the potential to get to 26 million tonnes, which is the original design capacity of Minas-Rio. I'm absolutely certain that Ruben, Matt, Ana and the team will tweak it a little bit above that, but for the foreseeable future and for those reasons, that's the outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexander Pearce:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Galloway:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you for all the questions. Look, of course, if you've got any -- just before I hand back to Duncan, if you've got any further questions, then please give myself and the IR team a call. we'd be happy to try and talk you through those. Richard, I think we owe you a follow-up, but Duncan, if I may just pass back to you to close, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duncan Wanblad:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Paul, and thanks, everybody, for your time this morning. Just, a reiteration is that, this is an extremely high quality portfolio with some great people operating these assets. We are definitely close to I hope, and at the bottom of cycle, certainly for PGMs and diamonds. A couple of the very specific issues associated with Transnet and Los Bronces are well in hand, and we're getting on top of all of these things. I can assure you we are absolutely focused on delivery, and we will continue to be agile in our response to current macroeconomic circumstances.</p><p>And with that, again, thank you for your time, and hope you have a good break if there's a break coming your way. Take care.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-0db779ef2b4358af9874a2df45c22a52</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTK-K4F3-RSDY-40WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12189\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 8, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002B37</classCode><className>ANGLO AMERICAN PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000A05B</classCode><className>DE BEERS SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS212220 GOLD ORE AND SILVER ORE MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS322211 CORRUGATED &amp;

They concluded that prescribed burning can help restore forest habitats to a state less favorable to several species of disease-carrying ticks and could be an effective management tactic for reducing their populations.</p><p>The era of fire suppression, which began roughly in the early 1900s and has continued for more than a century, changed the species composition of Eastern forests, creating habitats and microclimates that favored the survival and spread of ticks, noted lead author Michael Gallagher, research ecologist at the Silas Little Experimental Forest, Northern Research Station, U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, New Lisbon, New Jersey.</p><p>\"Before the arrival of Europeans, Eastern forests were 'fire-dependent,' characterized by fire-tolerant species such as pine, oak and chestnut,\" Gallagher said. \"Frequent low-to-moderate intensity fires would have fostered dry conditions, thinned the understory and diminished layers of leaf litter, which in turn would have created microclimates with lower humidity and higher temperatures.</p><p>\"These lower-moisture, higher-temperature or xeric conditions were likely to limit ticks' activity, interaction with reservoir hosts and overall populations,\" he said.</p><p>Since fire has been suppressed and forests have recovered significantly from periods of deforestation caused by logging and agricultural land-clearing, fire-sensitive mesic forest species those that thrive in and contribute to moister environments have become dominant, a process known as mesophication, he explained.</p><p>\"This mesophication of forests has been widely observed throughout the eastern United States,\" Gallagher said. \"In the absence of fire, these mesic habitats moderate forest temperatures and humidity, promote denser understory growth, and cause greater moisture retention in forest litter. This creates microclimates within the ideal range for tick survival and optimizes conditions for ticks to 'quest,' or seek hosts.\"</p><p>A female blacklegged tick positions itself to \"quest\" for a host. Researchers say a lack of fire during the past century has changed forest composition, creating habitat that optimizes questing conditions for disease-carrying ticks. Credit: Joyce Sakamoto.

Tick-borne pathogens can cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Powassan disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia and other illnesses.</p><p>\"Research suggests that conditions contributing to this rise in cases resulted from climate change, growth of certain wildlife populations, land-use change and, likely, forest change due to the decline of fire frequency,\" said co-author Erika Machtinger, assistant professor of entomology in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences. \"These changes have created conditions known to drive tick abundance, tick-wildlife host interactions and expansion of ticks' geographic range.\"</p><p>In addition to fire's direct effect on tick survival by subjecting them to heat high enough to cause mortality, several indirect effects of fire-driven forest modification can suppress tick abundance and pathogen transmission, she said.</p><p>\"Reductions in canopy and understory density and the creation of gap space from prescribed burning can increase sun exposure and wind speed and reduce evapotranspiration from plants, promoting hotter and drier conditions during the daytime and colder temperatures at night,\" said Machtinger, who directs the college's Veterinary Entomology Laboratory. \"These more frequent moisture and temperature extremes can exceed tick tolerances and affect behavior, development time, molting and overall survival.\"</p><p>She also pointed out that thinner layers of leaf litter due to burning could reduce insulation and lower the temperature of soils where ticks overwinter, causing higher mortality. In addition, studies indicate that fire-driven habitat change is likely to increase the population of certain wildlife predators of ticks, such as red imported fire ants and bobwhite quail.</p><p>\"On the other hand, reduced woody plant density and debris as a result of fire actually may decrease populations of some small mammal hosts of ticks by removing cover and making them more vulnerable to predation,\" Machtinger said. \"This would reduce ticks' interaction with hosts that serve as reservoirs of disease pathogens.\"</p><p>The researchers noted that the current paradigm for tick-borne disease control places nearly all the burden on the individual to prevent tick bites, while broader-scale tick management by professionals has been insufficient to stem increases in tick-borne pathogen transmission.</p><p>\"Although the fire suppression era persists in many parts of the United States, prescribed burns have been used successfully in a growing number of fire-suppressed landscapes in recent decades,\" Gallagher said. \"We believe there's an opportunity to reduce the number of ticks by using prescribed fire to restore the health of forest ecosystems, and we think this approach can be integrated as part of a multipronged strategy for managing ticks and tick-borne diseases.\"</p><p>Other co-authors of the paper are Jesse Kreye, assistant professor of fire and natural resources management, and Nathaniel Schmidt, former master's degree student, Penn State;

Chairman Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), Senate Western Caucus Chairman Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), and other members of the Caucus discussed their policy priorities for the upcoming year. The Congressional Western Caucus is made up of over 60 Members who serve as the voice of rural America in Congress. Many of the Caucus's policy priorities for the upcoming year regard improvements in domestic energy policy, private property rights, water policy, forest revitalization, and farming and agriculture.</p><p>\"Farmers, ranchers, and rural areas depend on clean sources of water to survive. Unfortunately, 90% of western states faced catastrophic drought conditions in the last year. Our recent winter storms have shown that we have enough water, we just don't have the reservoir capability to store it. Looking at long term solutions, such as increased water storage, combats catastrophic drought and ensures that we have enough water come fire season. As us western states are all too familiar, many of our towns were hit hard by yet another devastating fire season. Last summer multiple fires scorched over two million acres in my district, destroying thousands of homes, businesses, and municipal facilities. To help alleviate some of the financial burdens and accelerate rebuilding, I made rebuilding our towns and managing our forests a top priority in 2021, and I plan to continue these efforts into this year,\" said Congressman LaMalfa.</p><p>\"Much of the west is federally-owned land and we need a far more aggressive approach in thinning our unmanaged, overgrown federal forests. California alone has an estimated 35 million tons of waste biomass available annually that sits on our forest floor, left to burn as fuel for wildfires and decompose in our forests. Converting natural waste biomass into biofuel is a win-win-win for energy production, forest fire curtailment, and job growth right here in our back yard. Rural America is the backbone of our country, and I am working to bring new economic and job opportunities to our rural towns. Our small towns and forested communities can't wait. We have been burning up at record rates the last few years. Western Caucus and rural representatives are committed to working to improve wildland management practices, forest regrowth, and helping survivors of wildfires rebuild.\"</p><p>Congressman Doug LaMalfa is a lifelong farmer representing California's First Congressional District, including Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou and Tehama Counties.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://lamalfa.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/lamalfa-sets-priorities-as-executive-vice-chair-of-western-caucus\">https://lamalfa.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/lamalfa-sets-priorities-as-executive-vice-chair-of-western-caucus</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHM203240A6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64PF-PD91-JCCP-00YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"482\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 3, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Pelletier, who coached for one year in 1967-68, must put together a team that has fallen on unfortunate times. But, according to Mike's record of a few years back, he's perfectly capable of doing this. His record for that season was 10 wins and 6 losses, but if you recall, the Owls were in contention for a tournament spot almost until the last.</p><p><br/>NYC nearing end -- Although the Madawaska Neighborhood Youth Corps program had been authorized to employ 32 youngsters, additional funds became available to the State Department of Education for NYC projects and Madawaska obtained an additional 10 job openings. For the past eight weeks these 42 youngsters have been a valuable asset to various non-profit organizations in the community. Some of the jobs completed by these workers are: cleaning up the K of C picnic grounds; helping care for the aged at the St. John Valley Security Home; cleaning 70 classrooms in various school buildings; tutoring youngsters in summer reading programs; typing over 6,000 report cards for use in grades 7-12 and several more jobs.</p><p><br/>25 Years Ago -- August 23, 1995</p><p><br/>Honoring a Madawaska hero -- Onias Martin, a Madawaska native with strong Acadian lineage, is a hero who gave his life to liberate Bonntable, Sarthe, France, a small village located just north of La Mans, France. There is a permanent memorial there in his honor. He was the only American killed during that battle on August 10, 1944, less than 60 miles from the birthplace of Pierre Martin, the first Martin to immigrate to Acadia.</p><p><br/>Forest fire rousts Valley residents -- A forest fire in Quebec had Valley heads of households out and about in the wee hours of the morning, checking for house fires. A spokesman for the state police said that \"A fire broke out in Quebec Province in the area of Three Rivers.\" Madawaska Police chief Ron Pelletier said that \"The police department and the fire department logged in more than 100 phone calls.\" Smoke stretched as far as Bangor.</p><p><br/>10 Years Ago -- August 25, 2010</p><p><br/>King Foundation awards library -- The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation of Bangor awarded a $50,000 grant to the Long Lake Public Library with the understanding that it continue with its \"good work.\" Librarian Sr. Jackie Ayotte made the announcement last week.

By no means am I the handyman who built the fort, but I'd like to think I did my share of the gathering and played my role.\"</p><p>That's exactly what the Bruins are expecting from Looft, a 5-feet-11, 200-pound defenseman, this season \u2014 to play his role \u2014 and the role he plays is a big reason why he's been named one of the team's four captains.</p><p>\"With Nate, we know exactly what we're getting from him,\" Austin head coach Steve Howard said. \"He's a big body, he's going to throw his body around and hit people, and he's not afraid of anybody.\"</p><p>To take it a step further, Looft is a guy that every team needs, the quintessential fourth-line tough that every team needs.</p><p>\"The coaches here have made it pretty clear,\" Looft said. \"They want me to be a good person and a leader, on and off the ice. Being an older guy \u2014 I might have the most junior hockey games played on the team \u2014 they want me to show the young guys the ropes.</p><p>\"On the ice, it's also very clear \u2014 block shots, be physical, stand up for teammates, kill penalties. I'm totally fine with that. There are a lot of hockey teams out there that need those players. If that's what it takes to get to the next level, then that's what it takes. I have no issue with that.\"</p><p>Looft \u2014 whose brother Kyle played for the Bruins in the 2016-17 season and is now a senior captain at Division I Bemidji State University \u2014 is a key piece of the puzzlie this season for a Bruins team that is off to a 4-0 start after going undefeated at the season-opening NAHL Showcase last week in Blaine. True to form, Looft had one point in those four games, and 17 total penalty minutes.</p><p>His mental and physical toughness have developed over years of loving to play the game. A point-per-game player in high school, he has been more than willing to trade some of those points for penalty minutes. He started his junior hockey career with the Tier III New Ulm Steel in 2020-21, when he had 15 points and 64 penalty minutes in 31 games. At La Ronge last season, Looft had 25 points and 124 penalty minutes in 45 games.</p><p>Now he's a junior hockey veteran and a leader for Austin, which plays at St. Cloud today, then plays its first home game of the regular season at 7:05 p.m. Saturday against NAHL Central Division rival St. Cloud.</p><p>\"You have to be willing to work, no matter what level you're at,\" he said. \"Look at me. I started out in the (North American 3 Hockey League), bumped up to the SJ(HL) last year and now I'm here, in Austin.</p><p>\"It's not always just 'oh man, I'm going to get done with high school then go play in the USHL or North American league immediately. It doesn't just happen like that. You have to be willing to work for it.\"</p><p>___ (c)2022 the Post-Bulletin Visit the Post-Bulletin at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.postbulletin.com\">www.postbulletin.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCPBRM-20220923RCFireandIceJuniorhockeyhasbeenoneenjoyable0923RC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Post-Bulletin (R KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66FR-4H71-JBTP-M3YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474087</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Post-Bulletin</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Post-Bulletin (Rochester, Minnesota)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 23, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001589</classCode><className>WINTER SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000881</classCode><className>ICE HOCKEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>N611110GM</classCode><className>SECONDARY SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>N611110GM</classCode><className>SECONDARY SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D1KX</classCode><className>ROCHESTER, MN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Here are excerpts from the conversation (which has been condensed). </p><p><br/> On the likelihood of a Trump indictment: high  <br/><br/>I won't predict which of the investigations will result in charges but given the sheer amount of the former president's wrongdoing \u2014 which seems to have been concentrated in the period in, around and after he lost the election \u2014 it caused him to lose his balance. He had walked a tightrope of, in my view, illegality for his entire career and certainly in the White House, where whether it was civilly on issues like emoluments \u2014 constitutionally prohibited cash and benefits from foreign governments \u2014 or a criminal and civil violation, Trump managed to walk that tightrope and not fall off. But I think he was unbalanced by the 2020 election and particularly by the loss and in my view, he has serious criminal exposure. Perhaps the most serious is in the state of Georgia. <br/>And that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's said that the Jan. 6 committee is seriously considering additional criminal referrals; who knows what they're gonna call for? <br/> On our very own special Kim  <br/><br/>You know, (Kim) Crockett, your secretary of state candidate (editor's note: she was defeated by Secretary of State Steve Simon) Fortunately, it was repudiated at the polls and at the constitutional officer level, you don't have election deniers who will be running your elections, but boy, you've got them in your legislative delegation \u2014 state and federal legislative delegation. So this threat of election denial is not going away. <br/> On election denial and criminality  <br/><br/>Don't just look at Trump; look at the people he inspires. The Cochise County Board of Supervisors \u2014 they won't certify an election over in Arizona. They are committing crimes. Election denial leads to criminality. That's why the Trump investigations are so important. And we're going to continue to see this propensity. So, that is the problem with the election denial. It's a continuing danger to our country, and they're not stopping and so we must celebrate (election deniers') defeat, the successes for democracy, but also remain vigilant. <br/> Team Normal and Team Crazy  <br/><br/>My best friend is a firm Trumper and he keeps telling me that '2,000 Mules' is real. (Editor's note: He's referred to a Dinesh D'Souza documentary filled with debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.) Thank goodness his wife is a normal conservative. You know, there's Team Normal and Team Crazy. I don't know what I would do if both of them went over the edge He's a very educated, affluent individual. He hasn't suffered the kinds of understandable stresses that many who voted for Trump (did) \u2014 remember 10 million Trump voters were Obama voters. He hasn't suffered those kinds of stresses. <br/> What happens if indictments come down  <br/><br/>I believe that there will be grumbling. There'll be anger. Trump will make noise. But just as we saw in the 2018, the 2020 and the 2022 elections, all of those were referenda on how the country reacted to Trump's autocratic threats He is building on a long tradition of autocratic movements and his reaction and the reaction of his followers will be the same as when Berlusconi was prosecuted in Italy (editor's note: for paying for sex with an underage sex worker) There can be no doubt that Trump's autocracy and his criminal election denial was thoroughly rejected across the United States. <br/> Election deniers underperformed regular Republicans  <br/><br/>If you look at the underperformance in places like Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Crockett \u2014 the way Crockett underperformed other Republicans in Minnesota \u2014 you will see that the American people realize that Trump's election denial ideology inevitably leads to criminality. They didn't want to get on that slippery slope with a whole new generation of Trumpists, and they repudiated it. And if you compare, just look at the numbers, how much worse Team Crazy performed than Team Normal in the Republican Party from coast to coast. You will see that there is proof now that the American people won't stand for it. <br/> On potential violence  <br/><br/>Yes, he's going to try to stimulate violence of his followers, but we didn't have widespread violence in the 2022 election. It did erupt in the aftermath of 2020, but we were prepared (in 2022). If Trump is charged, the country is prepared to deal with his incitement. <br/> Why not let him be? <br/><br/>But if he's not charged, what kind of country will we be? The greater danger is if he's not charged. Anybody else would be charged for what he did with the Mar-a-Lago classified documents, for the fake electoral slate and the trying to get fake votes in Georgia, for his role in Jan. 6. Any other American would be charged. It won't be America if one person in virtue of having been a former president can get away with that kind of stuff. That's why I'm so certain he will be charged because it's essential to the American rule of law system. <br/> Are we in the clear? <br/><br/>Trumpism is far from dead. It's taken over This is very much a living phenomenon and we're going to have to deal with it for many years to come. We need to celebrate the defeats of election deniers in many races and in the most important election-controlling races in 2022. But we need to stay vigilant There were hundreds of election deniers who successfully won office and they've taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives. How can that be? Let's remind ourselves that in many places, the forest fire is still burning and it can erupt. And there's an out-and-out high-level conflagration that's about to explode in the United States House of Representatives. The fire is not out. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/11/30/norm-eisen-trump-unbalanced-by-2020-election-fell-off-tightrope/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009805166984443621625876100196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009805</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:670B-SG11-F03R-N24G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567766</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1022\"/><timeReceived>9:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Minnesota Reformer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 30, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

We want to extend their work, use their methods and do a similar study. \u201d<br/>Eisenberg said the study\u2019s focus is to put a dollar value on the effects that residents who live in the area have faced since the fire, as well as the effects to overall economic activity in the area, including cattle production, tourism and infrastructure damages.<br/>During the committee meeting, Committee Chair, Rep. David Cook, R-Globe, said one of the legislative goals was to create a resolution asking for Federal Emergency Management Agency requirements to be more inclusive of Western states\u2019 rural communities affected by forest fires so they can better receive aid in the aftermath of a fire. He said the intended resolution would also be passed on to other Western state legislatures.<br/>The total figure that the University of Arizona determines in its study will likely be higher than what NAU determined with the Schultz Fire. Cook said he hopes this data can be used to influence Congress to be more flexible with providing aid to rural communities affected by forest fires.<br/>FEMA policy has a $10 million requirement that local government agencies must show to receive a public assistance grant, which is only applicable six to 18 months after the initial incident, depending on the cost of restorative work. Cook said the aftermath of a fire and resulting flooding make it difficult to know how expensive such work will be and rural communities are left on their own often in these events.<br/>During the committee meeting, Cook noted the U.S. Forest Service spent $11 million in fire response, and only $603,000 in flood mitigation from 2013-2019 in NAU\u2019s study of the Schultz Fire.<br/>\u201cAfter the fire, which came from their land and affected all of these things, they really have no investment,\u201d Cook said during the meeting.<br/>In comparison, Coconino County taxpayers spent $20 million on post-fire mitigation.<br/>Cook has been one of the Forest Service\u2019s most vocal critics since the Telegraph Fire. Before the committee\u2019s meeting, Cook told the Arizona Capitol Times that the Forest Service has been slow using its $2.3 million to restore range allotment infrastructure affected by the Telegraph Fire.<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s been a year and a half and the Forest Service hasn\u2019t driven one t-post yet,\u201d Cook said.<br/>Cook is a rancher in Globe and the Telegraph Fire burned his property. He lost cattle and has been working to repair fences burned by the fire. He said that another rancher recently found two of his cattle that he hadn\u2019t seen in over a year, which is lost business for him and others who have similar stories.<br/>The Telegraph Fire burned almost 181,000 acres and destroyed 51 structures in Gila and Pinal counties in 2021.<br/>But not everyone on the committee agrees with Cook about what the federal government\u2019s role should be. Sen. Stephanie Stahl Hamilton, D-Tucson, said Arizona needs to take a more inward look at its forest management practices and be more proactive to the effects of climate change.<br/>\u201cWe can try to play catch up as long as we want, but until we become honest about the root causes of a lot of this, all of the things that we do to try to mitigate the huge fires and get our forests healthy, it\u2019s not going to get us as far down the road,\u201d Hamilton said.<br/>Like Cook, Hamilton has also been affected by forest fires in Arizona. In 2011, the Wallow Fire burned through the Montlure Presbyterian Church Camp, to which she was the executive director. She said the campsite is still unsafe and people aren\u2019t allowed to be there for recreational activity.<br/>\u201cThere are a lot of people very tied to that land and where we were. That canyon will never be the same,\u201d Hamilton said.<br/>NAU\u2019s study also found proactive forest restoration could save millions of dollars in the aftermath of a forest fire. Researchers estimated that the Jack Smith/Schultz project, which wasn\u2019t fully implemented prior to the fire, could have saved between $78 million and $93.5 million in post-fire mitigation costs.<br/>The project would have treated about 10,000 acres of forest near Flagstaff with non-activity fuels, forest vegetation improvements and noxious weed treatments, according to the Forest Service.<br/>\u201cWe know that wildfires will continue to occur in Arizona and throughout the west,\u201d Colavito of NAU told committee members during the November meeting. \u201cWe also have strong scientific evidence and agreement among forestry professionals and ecologists that restoration treatments are effective at restoring forests and preventing severe wildfire and post-fire flooding. \u201d<br/>Hamilton said more efforts like the Jack Smith/Schultz project should be considered by the Legislature.<br/>In 2021, the Arizona Healthy Forest Initiative was established, which employed low-risk inmates to clear forests of debris and prevent wildfires. Hamilton said this was a good start, but she has some problems using incarcerated labor and thinks it\u2019ll take many more resources than what state lawmakers are willing to give in order to restore the health of Arizona\u2019s forests.<br/>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a huge state that has a lot of forest in it that over the years, the work has been neglected that needed to be done,\u201d Hamilton said.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p><p>Copyright \u00a9 2022 BridgeTower Media.

KG, Research Division - Analyst</p><p>* Tyler Anson Broda</p><p>RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Director, Global Mining Research</p><p>Presentation</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ANGLO AMERICAN PLC: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this call today. I hope you're all safe and well wherever you are. Thanks. Today, we'll follow our usual flow but this time with a new face. So I'd like to introduce John Heasley, who started with us this time last week, taking over from Stephen. And technically, today's day for John, although for John, I'm sure it feels a little bit like day 80 already.</p><p>Anyway, I'm going to talk the steps that we are taking to enhance margins and cash generation across the whole of the business, and that drives significant cost reductions for us and then make our business a lot more resilient. And John is going to then take us through some of the guidance numbers I'll come back and cover the longer-term outlook and our outstanding growth opportunities that we have across the portfolio and in the right products for the major demand trends that we've spoken about before.</p><p>Now as always, I'm going to start with safety. Our commitment here to ensuring that our workforce returns home safely every day is unwavering, and it will remain our #1 priority. We've made significant progress here in improving our injury rates this year. But in 2 incidents, we still sadly had 3 fatalities and we know that there's still a lot more to do.</p><p>Safety and operational performance, as you've heard me say before, go hand in hand. As we refocus on getting the basics right, adhering to our operating model and driving accountability of our leaders to spend more time in the field to deliver that operational stability, I do expect that these levers should support continued improvement of our safety performance.</p><p>Across all of our operations, we considered our workforce to be a single team and that is regardless of whether they are employees or contractors. Everyone is accountable for working safely, in line with our performance standards, and that is without exception.</p><p>Now we do indeed have a high-quality portfolio that combines a fantastic suite of assets with our deep bench of capabilities and our leading positions in certain products. All of this is underpinned by a robust capital allocation model and a pipeline of organic growth options. The long-term outlook for our products has arguably never ever looked better.</p><p>A lot has changed in the last 18 months, though, and different circumstances require different approaches. We are alive to these near-term challenges, and we are responding accordingly. We've experienced a period of high and prolonged inflationary pressure that continues to impact costs across the whole of the industry, and we are taking measures to ensure that the business is set up to be resilient over the longer term and as we work through some of these temporary operational headwinds, too.</p><p>Diamonds and PGMs are a lot closer to the end consumer than the earlier cycle products. And therefore, as we know more directly, and immediately impacted by changes in discretionary spending patterns. This is true in a slowdown. And as history has shown us before, it will equally be true in the case of an upturn. We are working towards positioning our assets squarely in the first half of their respective cost curves, and at the same time, continue to look through the cycles and focus on these longer-term demand themes.</p><p>Just turning to the '23 operating performance. So this year, we expect to land broadly within our existing guidance range. And our focus has been on operational delivery, and we did indeed achieve a stronger second half as we had planned.</p><p>In copper, we are delighted that Quellaveco has now ramped up to full capacity. Unit costs share are just a little higher than we expected as we land towards the lower end of our planned production range. But having successfully delivered this project and then been able to ramp it up as a new asset in a new country and transition to the operational phase as smoothly as we were able to do, I think, is absolutely a testament to the capabilities that we have in this organization.</p><p>At the copper assets in Chile and Nickel, ore grades were as expected, lower and our world-class Collahuasi operation had another very, very good year. Although our sales volume is running a little bit behind our production, mainly because of weather impact, sea swells, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Performance in the PGM business has been solid, both from the mines and from the operating -- process operating assets. The team here has expertly, I believe, navigated load curtailment with minimal impact. And from what we can see, Eskom seems to have had a better performance in the second half of this year, although I'm afraid we will have to continue to carefully monitor the outlook and the performance of Eskom into the first half of 2024.</p><p>De Beers operationally has had a very, very solid year. But as I've spoken about before, we faced significant pressure in the downstream in the second half. Consumer spending on luxury goods has eased in the current macro environment, and China has been a lot slower to recover post COVID than we had expected it to.</p><p>With the most recent sites of $80 million and $130 million, respectively, De Beers has been loss-making in the second half of this year. We are now forecasting our expected sales volumes to be around 25 million carats for the year, but we continue to believe that the fundamentals for diamonds are strong and we are positioning ourselves to supply into that inevitable demand bounce back.</p><p>In iron ore, Minas-Rio has been our star performer this year, a stonking performance by the team there. On track for the top end of guidance and we've seen some performance records that they've achieved along the way, too. Kumba similarly has been performing exceptionally well at the operating level. But unfortunately, the logistics just haven't been there.</p><p>As a consequence of this, in the last few weeks, we've been lowering volumes to manage the online stockpile that has been developing over the last year and a bit. And as a result, managing therefore, the costs too. We will now deliver to the lower end of our production range, but it will be for the purpose of managing about 2 million tonnes out of the stockpile into the port.</p><p>At Steelmaking Coal, our focus has continued to be on safe and stable operations. However, consistency and predictability there have proven elusive in quite challenging ground conditions, particularly at Moranbah. We will land somewhere at around about the 16 million tonne mark for this year, and that, of course, has had an impact on our unit costs.</p><p>We are now expecting these costs to come in at around $115 per tonne for the year. Of course, the price is north of $300 a tonne. We are still generating some very good margins here despite the excessive Queensland royalties.</p><p>And finally, at Woodsmith, we have made significant progress this year, and we are delighted to have hosted you to a visit a few months ago. We will be within touching distance of that 27 kilometers on the tunnel and we did achieve the world record for the longest tunnel on a single tunnel boring machine. So well done to Tom and the team there.</p><p>Sinking activities in the deep shafts continue to progress well, 680 meters of depth on the service shaft now, and 385 meters on the production shaft. We preemptively took some action in the first half of this year to reduce our business support costs by $0.5 billion by the mid of 2024. That work is on track and pretty well advanced. We are improving our organizational effectiveness through a simpler, a leaner, more streamlined organization that has fewer layers and clearer accountabilities.</p><p>We are also taking measures to increase business resilience across the whole board. Within each of our businesses, we are pulling the necessary levers to enhance our financial performance both near and medium term and at the same time, protecting value over the longer term. That will translate into significant OpEx reductions for us of a further $0.5 billion in 2024.</p><p>And our final lever is in the capital that we deploy. We have now reduced CapEx by $1.8 billion over the guidance period. Let me give you a little bit more color on what we're doing in each of these businesses. So firstly, copper. As you hopefully know, we have a truly world-class portfolio in copper, including Collahuasi, and it has very, very significant growth potential embedded within it.</p><p>Los Bronces, though, I think, is a perfect example of the challenges that the whole of the mining industry is facing. Los Bronces itself is 156 years old, and as a result of that, is facing quite a lot of cost pressure from debt and grades with a reserve life of 34 years and plenty of resources to extend that, it is still an incredible ore body.</p><p>It still accounts for more than 2% of the world's known copper resources. However, the ore at the current mining area is very hard. It impacts throughput and cost, and it will be at least another 2 years before we can open up other areas of the mine, so that we can blend this ore with a higher-grade softer ores and maintain historic production levels.</p><p>The mine development has also been delayed in the last few years due to COVID-related and permitting issues. Now while we work through these challenges in the pit, we've decided to place the older of the 2 processing plants on care and maintenance in order to reduce our operating costs and our CapEx, which will help drive value for a whole of the business.</p><p>As a result of our actions, unit costs will be 15% lower, and we will continue to invest, however, in critical projects, which will enable a swift reopening of the plant at the right time in the right pricing environment. Los Bronces remains an incredible ore body, and it is important to recognize the merits of having a permitted operation in an established copper jurisdiction. And to that end, we will continue to progress the studies of our Los Bronces underground project.</p><p>At Quellaveco, we have adjusted the mine plan based on the latest geotechnical assessments of a known fault. Safety always comes first. And the consequence of this rephasing is that 75,000 tonnes of copper has been displaced into 2027.</p><p>Now the new mine plant actually anticipates slightly higher overall volumes than we had previously forecast over the next 5 years, reflecting further optimization of the mining sequence. Given the current copper market outlook, of course, we may well also achieve some higher real term prices for these deferred volumes.</p><p>Now as you know, we are well positioned in high-grade iron ore, producing premium quality products. However, Transnet's Logistics performance is currently limiting our ability to rail our mine volumes at Kumba, and we are now unfortunately stock bound. Had that been delivered to port, we would have made significantly more EBITDA this year.</p><p>That unsold ore is also a significant blow of course, to the South African fiscus. Now while the government absolutely recognizes the severity of the situation, and I am convinced is continuing to make strides to get it resolved and sorted out, it is our view that this is going to take some time for conditions to improve and a longer-term solution to be implemented.</p><p>And as a result, we are going to focus on ensuring that we have a balanced value chain through the reconfiguration of this business, including a revised mine plan and structural cost reductions to protect our margins.</p><p>Minas-Rio has delivered operationally very well this year, as I said. We are now focusing on operational stability and optimization to maximize cash flows there. In 2025, we are dovetailing some additional maintenance work into the pipeline inspection process.</p><p>Now moving on to steelmaking coal. As always and as I said right at the beginning of this presentation, safety has to come first for us. The Gas, Depth and Strata issues represent very big complex geotechnical challenges for us there. While our mining experience has resulted in improvements in procedures and risk management, we are still some way off where we had hoped to be at this stage of the reopening of these mines.</p><p>Our priority needs to be delivering safe and stable production, and we are now focused on reconfiguring our cost structure in the near and the medium term to match our productive output. Operational improvements, debottlenecking and automation all represent opportunities to raise this capacity of these assets towards 20 million tonnes and we are working now hard on ensuring that we can implement some of these things.</p><p>We have also made a significant improvement in our Australian operations in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, of which, of course, methane is the largest component. So far, we are capturing around 60% of the methane and our confidence in addressing the balance has significantly progressed over the last year.</p><p>We also now have managed to secure 100% renewable energy for these operations, all starting in January of 2025. PGMs have been acutely in focus for us with a sharp below trajectory in prices over the last year. Although these did come from unsustainably high levels from the previous year and the year before.</p><p>The basket price is now firmly into the cost curve with sector returns at the lowest point seen in this industry in the last 30 years. It remains to be seen how long these prices persist and its effect on a number of producers. We are ensuring that our own operations are resilient and that we secure Mogalakwena's highly attractive value proposition for the longer term.</p><p>The team is working hard to identify and implement further cost reduction initiatives to sustainably deliver an all-in sustaining cost at a touch over $1,000 per PGM mounts. There are also a number of purchase of concentrate agreements that are coming to the end of their contract life and these changes are also now reflected in our revised production numbers.</p><p>We are focused on enhancing returns through lower CapEx and near-term asset optimization work. And as a result, we will not be progressing work on the option for the third concentrate at Mogalakwena nor will we be progressing work for the time being on the expansion opportunities at both Amandelbult and Mototolo.</p><p>At Mogalakwena, we have an exceptional ore body and as well in our operations in Southern Africa, we have the largest of the PGM processing capacity. Now that gives us significant optionality and flexibility for the future. As we work on the underground opportunity, we have one of the largest drilling campaigns in Africa underway and results so far have exceeded our expectations here, giving us confidence in the long-term development of that resource at the right time.</p><p>Our value-over-volume approach will enhance the competitiveness of our world-class PGM assets under a range of price scenarios. Our business is positioned in the first half of the margin curve, which means that we do have significant flexibility within this portfolio. Current prices seem to reflect the aggressive consensus view of the rapidity of decline of the internal combustion engine.</p><p>Recently, we've seen a rolling back and the dilution of many of the measures favoring Rapid BEV adoption. Hearing a lot more commentary on the difficulty of hitting BEV targets and more awareness of the need for internal combustion engines to play a role for longer.</p><p>Now this plays into our very long-held belief that hybrid vehicles will play an absolutely critical transition step to clean the transport systems. And hybrids, as we know, require similar levels of PGMs to the internal combustion engine.</p><p>Furthermore, we are also seeing how current market challenges are affecting the supply side. Projects that were previously being discussed are now being shelved, deferred or delayed because they're uneconomic at current prices. And longer term, we are seeing hydrogen accelerate just a little bit faster than many of us were forecasting with support -- which supports, I think, the outlook for platinum and Iridium in particular.</p><p>And finally, with significant activity in the market development space, we do remain confident that these young metals with their unique properties will find metallurgical and catalytic uses in clean technology as well as a host of other industrial applications.</p><p>Moving on to diamonds. At De Beers, we're taking a slightly different growth approach here as the business has performed extremely well operationally. What has gone against us is the market, particularly in the second half of this year. Demand and prices for diamonds have fallen as global GDP growth has fallen, but all cycles end, and we believe that the current weakness is temporary.</p><p>Indeed, we are working closely with our partners to ensure that we can supply into that demand increase when it comes. Already, there are some signs that the market might be beginning to turn.</p><p>Nonetheless, we are focused on streamlining De Beers, reducing the annual overhead by $100 million in a sustainable manner. We have also reduced our CapEx for next year with our investment focus on the highest value opportunities that we see in Southern Africa from the existing assets as well as on the exploration front.</p><p>We will focus our efforts on the ramp-up of Venetia underground in South Africa, and we are planning to move forward with the first phase of Jwaneng underground in Botswana. The long-term fundamentals are strong and we have access to the world's best diamond assets. Now these include our renewed mining licenses in Botswana where we are progressing as planned towards a full agreement with the government early next year.</p><p>We are also renewing our efforts in the Downstream. The return of the iconic A diamond is forever campaign has proven highly successful, and you can see some of the ads on the slide. We are committed to further strengthening demand for natural diamonds and the launch of our origin story will differentiate our natural traceable diamond offering, and highlight how the journey of our diamonds makes an extraordinary contribution to the produced countries.</p><p>Woodsmith is the next multibillion-dollar greenfield project in our pipeline. I still believe this is a textbook example of a high-quality Tier 1 asset in a low risk jurisdiction. It is large scale, it is expandable, long life, and it has structural advantages that will position it in the lowest quartile of the cost curve, and it has the potential to generate very significant cash flows for many, many decades.</p><p>You want these sorts of assets in any portfolio. For that reason, we are focused on setting it up right from the outset. It will be a truly modern and sustainable mine with a minimal impact to the surface. It will hardly be able to tell that it is there. POLY4 plays perfectly into those global demand teams I spoke about earlier.</p><p>Food security for 10 billion people and delivering that sustainably remains one of the key challenges for the ags industry today. POLY4 is the crop nutrition solution that this industry needs. It can increase your crop yields by 3% to 5%, and it will have a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional products because it is a natural product without the new requirement for downstream chemical processing. And that also means it is, therefore, use suitable for organic use.</p><p>The nutrients themselves are, of course, not new, but the way they present in this product is new. And POLY4 can deliver absolutely significant additional benefits to the farmer well beyond the pure nutrient value. There is an enormous potential here in POLY4 even if we just capture a small slice of that significant upside.</p><p>And with that, John, I'll hand over to you to take us through the guidance for the next few years, please?</p><p>JOHN HEASLEY, FINANCE DIRECTOR &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ANGLO AMERICAN PLC: Thank you, Duncan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here, and I look forward to meeting many of you personally over the coming months. My decision to join Anglo American was predicated on a number of things. Firstly, my deep rooted personally belief in the criticality of the mining industry to the world's development and energy transition. Secondly, a great culture with a focus on doing the right thing for the long term. And thirdly, a fantastic set of assets, global leading positions in diamonds and PGMs and high-quality iron ore and phenomenal copper assets with great growth potential.</p><p>Now as Duncan said, while it's only day 8 of the job, I'm pleased to say that my experience thus far has been hugely confirmatory. It's also been timely given that I've had the opportunity to participate in detailed budget review meetings with each of our businesses. And I've been especially encouraged by the unwavering desire of my Board and executive colleagues to do all that we can to maximize performance and returns from our existing assets to fund our future growth options. And I'm sure, as you can appreciate, as a Scottish Finance Director, that is music to my years.</p><p>Moving on to the numbers. Duncan has stepped you through the operational performance for 2023. That translates into expected production up about 3% on last year, with unit costs up around 5%, reflecting higher CPI as well as the impact of lower grades, harder ores and deeper pits. You will see in the appendices some more detail by business if required.</p><p>On CapEx, we expect to come in under our full year guidance at around $5.8 billion, following general tightening of spend across the board. Our effective tax rate at around 39% is slightly higher than the range previously indicated and reflects the impact of profit mix, higher contributions from South America and lower contributions from Southern Africa, particularly De Beers.</p><p>I would like to remind everyone that a lot of other producers, particularly in Australia, for example, pay more of that economic rent and royalties that's set in operating costs rather than the tax line. And on an all-in basis, we aren't too dissimilar from those peers. Working capital has continued to build through the second half of the year, and this will be a particular focus of mine. Inventories are higher than we would like, especially in De Beers and Kumba, given market demand and transportation issues, respectively.</p><p>That said, the key driver of the circa $1.5 billion anticipated increase in working capital this year as payables. With the lion's share being in PGMs, given the impact of lower prices on the valuation of the bulk payables and the customer prepayment. Finally, and of course, subject to Board discussion and approval in the new year, we would expect the dividend payout to be in line with our well-established policy at 40%.</p><p>Looking now at the production for the next 3 years. You've heard from Duncan that we are very focused on maximizing the margins and cash generation from our operations. Against this backdrop, we've taken some difficult but necessary decisions to reconfigure some of the operations in order to capture more value from recovery.</p><p>This translates into production being lower next year, most significantly in copper with the older and smaller Los Bronces plant moving into care and maintenance and the rephasing a clear vehicle due to the known fault. Our volume guidance is down 7% over the next 2 years before rising 4% in 2026.</p><p>These reconfigurations enable significant cost reductions and will ultimately support higher margins and returns. Those cost reductions from our reconfigurations are evident on this next slide. Early action to improve resilience and margins is expected to deliver a 2% reduction in unit costs next year and broadly maintain those over the following 2 years.</p><p>With CPI across our geographies at around 5%, you can see the favorable impact of our actions as significant. In copper, PGMs and iron ore, we are delivering significant year-on-year cost reductions and should see a resultant move to improve our position on the cost curves. We are rigorously implementing these measures to ensure they are comprehensively embedded into our operational footprint, allowing us to sustain this performance.</p><p>And De Beer is the transition of Venetia to underground operations adversely impacts the unit cost of our managed operations. While we are proposing to change the ramp-up in light of prevailing market conditions and to optimize capital spend, we expect unit costs to return to current levels from 2026 as volumes pick up.</p><p>The Steelmaking Coal business is more levered to fixed cost given the nature of longwall mining. And more generally, we're seeing Queensland slip down the rankings of competitiveness as a mining jurisdiction due to the additional royalty regimes implemented last year.</p><p>While we have managed to broadly offset the key inflationary pressures, we are still working very hard to find opportunities to lower that cost base. If we can deliver any upside in our production, that represents our greatest margin lever for this business.</p><p>Finally for me, our cost discipline also extends to CapEx. We've identified opportunities to reduce CapEx by $1.8 billion from now to 2026. That's $0.2 billion in 2023, $0.8 million in 2024 and a further $0.4 billion in 2025. 2026 CapEx gains is now set at $5.3 billion, which is $0.4 billion than our previous budget. These figures now include Woodsmith as we guided earlier in the year to spend around $1 billion per annum.</p><p>Safety and asset integrity spend is untouched in these updated numbers. Those are sacrosanct. The savings reflect the refocus of investment. 2 such examples are to pursue only the underground Mogalakwena and PGMs and the technical review of the UHDMS project at Kumba.</p><p>We will pull similar levers across the balance of the portfolio as required. Until we reach the FNTP decision on Woodsmith expected in early 2025, current governance processes will continue with ongoing spend remains subject to annual Board approval. As we have said, we will consider potential partnership opportunities for this business at the right time with the right partners and, of course, for value.</p><p>In summary, we've updated our numbers with a focus on reducing costs, enhancing margins and driving cash generation. I'm confident that these are the right decisions for both the near and long term. Thank you, and I will now hand back to Duncan.</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Thanks, John. So turning now to the longer-term outlook. We have a highly differentiated investment proposition, underpinned by our high-quality portfolio very long mine lives and -- which is diversified across many critical minerals and metals that are essential for both ongoing global economic development and the transition to cleaner energy.</p><p>This is supported by a strong marketing capability that maximizes the value of the products that we deliver to our customers. Our diversified portfolio works as a whole. Each of the businesses has a very clear role delivering a balance between cash generation and the funding and execution of our well sequenced set of growth options.</p><p>With the current focus on copper and crop nutrients, that together are set up to strongly deliver enhanced value in the future. The attractive growth options that we have are naturally well sequenced over the next 10 years from a cash generation and a capital allocation perspective. As you all know, permitting time lines are a natural break on bringing on any new supply.</p><p>The fifth ball mill at Collahuasi is now up and running with some debottlenecking options there to follow. Then permits are expected for the fourth line at Collahuasi in 2027. Once the studies have been completed, it will then follow peak spend at Woodsmith. That's Collahuasi.</p><p>So permitting is then expected for Sakatti in 2029 with the underground expansion at Los Bronces, potentially delivering an annual production increment of 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes per annum. Sakatti is the greenfield option in Finland with a relatively low capital cost. It has a high grade, it is a polymetallic ore body. It contains copper, battery-grade nickel, platinum gold, and some cobalt. Whilst it is relatively small, it could deliver at least 100,000 tonnes of copper equivalent over a mine life that could extend over a couple of decades or so.</p><p>And the byproducts here would, of course, give us a negative cash cost position. Our unique project execution capabilities should allow us to unlock the value of this particular ore body. Los Bronces underground could deliver over 10 million tonnes of copper equivalent over 100 years with copper head grades of around 1.5%.</p><p>While studies ongoing, significant work has already progressed on optimizing the capital spend and we could deliver those volumes at, I believe, a very competitive capital intensity. At Quellaveco, we are progressing the studies of the expansion options that would help sustain production after we are through the initial high-grade period.</p><p>We initially oversized elements of the plant in order to cater for this increase in throughput rates. And we are studying further expansion potential here, such as the possible third ball mill. Beyond the existing site, there is also additional regional potential that our discovery team are very interested in, including the adjacent moment area, which is around 10 kilometers away from the current mine.</p><p>Now while we are taking firm action to respond to the near-term pressure, our commitment to responsible and sustainable mining is unwavering. We will continue to apply our value-focused approach to delivering on our sustainability ambitions.</p><p>We have made good progress with the first wave of Envusa renewable energy projects in Southern Africa this year, and we will secure more than enough renewable energy for our own needs decoupling ourselves from the double-digit cost escalation in the electricity contracts that we have today and providing a greater grid stability to support broader economic development in the region.</p><p>Envusa makes absolutely good business sense to us. It is strongly NPV positive, whilst also at the right, at the same time being the right solution for us. It is great for our decarbonization goals and it is great for South Africa.</p><p>We seek out opportunities in challenges. These capabilities are a key enabler for our growth pathway from the delivery of Quellaveco through to the permitting milestones that we have achieved this year at both Los Bronces and Sakatti as well as the renewal of our long-standing partnership with the government of Botswana. Understanding our social license to operate remains at the heart of our approach.</p><p>We have a clear track record of delivering on our promises. Communities and host governments can see that and they value that. We have been operating in our current jurisdictions for decades, learning, evolving and continuing to refine our approach. We aim to be the development partner that countries choose to work with.</p><p>So to conclude, the outlook for metals and minerals has never looked stronger underpinned by the 3 mega demand trends that you've heard me speak about before. While much of the conversation today seems to be around and focused on decarbonization, let's forget that Poverty remains the #1 and most urgent daily challenge of much of the world's population.</p><p>Uplifting global living standards amid a growing global population requires an unprecedented level of economic development. For example, giving everyone in the developing world, a living standard equivalent to just half that enjoyed in the developed world today would require us to mine an additional 70 billion tonnes of iron ore and an additional 1 billion tonnes of copper. Those numbers are quite extraordinary.</p><p>To put that in context, that would represent approximately the same amount of iron ore that has been extracted over the entire course of human history and 1.3x the amount of copper that has ever been mined. And we must remember that we are discovering new applications for materials that we produce all of the time.</p><p>Similarly, to feed the global population over the next 30 years, we'll require the use of more man-made fertilizers that have been consumed in total over the last 100 years. So our portfolio with its diversification of high-quality and long-life assets, I think, is very well positioned to deliver into these trends.</p><p>We are taking deliberate, decisive and necessary performance interventions in this challenging and dynamic near-term environment to improve our resilience, capture value and ensure that we are set up to deliver for the long term. These measures, together with our technical capabilities and our approach to sustainability, position our assets to deliver significant and enduring value for decades to come.</p><p>And with that, I am very happy to take questions. John and I are joined for this session with you -- with Ruben, Timber, [El] and Matt Daley. So Paul, if you'd like the master of ceremony, the question session, that would be great.</p><p>PAUL GALLOWAY, GROUP HEAD OF IR, ANGLO AMERICAN PLC: Thanks, Duncan. If you'd like to ask a question, you can see the details on the screen. I'd like to hand over to the operator, [Elly], to take the first question, please.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We have our first question from Jason Fairclough from Bank of America.</p><p>JASON ROBERT FAIRCLOUGH, HEAD OF THE DEVELOPED &amp; EMERGING EMEA METALS AND MINING EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA SECURITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Some very interesting points. Look, a bit of a big picture question for you. So Duncan, you inherited a company running a series of Tier 1 assets. Today, it feels like we have pressure in at least 4 major businesses, right? So in PGMs, in Diamonds, at Kumba and at some of the copper assets. And then on top of that, you're going to be burning about $1 billion a year at Woodsmith for the foreseeable future. And today, you're actually taking quite aggressive steps to conserve cash. So how do you think about this? Is there actually an opportunity here to focus the portfolio, perhaps to shed some of the assets that don't have a position in Anglo American longer term? I guess some people would say that diversification is the enemy of simplicity. But just interested in how you're thinking about the portfolio, please?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Thanks, Jason. Look, I mean, you picked up a couple of interesting points there in terms of elements of the business that are exposed to a cycle, very unusual that we have the sort of confluence of a number of effects like PGMs, diamonds and the transport issues in South Africa related to Kumba, all happening at the same time in a portfolio of this nature. But this is what's happened and what you are seeing is us take the appropriate level of response to this thing. Certainly, from a whole portfolio position, what we're doing -- I mean, a couple of points that I want to reiterate there. First of all, every asset in the portfolio has a role. Some are cash-generating assets and some we then invest that cash in a value balanced way in accordance with our capital allocation model, including returns to shareholders in developing other assets over the business. And I think that's how you have to think about the portfolio.</p><p>Cycles will be cycles. They will come and go. And we expect that with the quality and the type of assets that we've got in the portfolio, through the long run, there are extraordinary returns that get developed out of this. Now of course, part of what we have to do in response to the current economic climate and some of the issues that we've got temporarily and uniquely in this particular portfolio. we have to be sure that we are conserving cash, and we are allocating that cash even more rigorously. That's what we said that we would do, and this is what you're seeing us do. In the context of Woodsmith, this becomes part of the portfolio that will replace this portfolio over time. So what we will get in Woodsmith is 1 of the world's preeminent ore bodies with a great level of flexibility in the right commodity set to serve the right customer base that sits at the bottom of the cost curve, spinning off large volumes of cash for multiple decades. Now that doesn't just happen. So it has to be built up over time, and therefore, this allocation is very careful and very thoughtful.</p><p>In the context of your question about, is this time to review elements of the portfolio? Well, I think all of the time is the right time to review elements of the portfolio. As I said earlier, every asset in the portfolio has a role to play. And it is important that, that role is effectively played through the life cycle of those assets and through the holistic cycles of the macro economy that affect the business over time. So we do review every single asset and its role in the portfolio on a regular basis. So not just now, but even at the tops of cycles, it is our job to continue to ensure that we have the right mix and suite of assets within the portfolio. So it's ongoing.</p><p>JASON ROBERT FAIRCLOUGH: And look, Duncan, when we were up in Yorkshire, I think over dinner, one of the investors asked you if there are any sacred cows, I think, was the phrase in the portfolio. Is everything for sale at the right price?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Yes. Well, look, I mean, the short answer to that is if you're managing a portfolio like we are, there are clearly no sacred cows in it because if every asset has its place and its time, we have to look at it through that lens all of the time. So no, there are no sacred cows.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next questioni comes from Alain Gabriel from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>ALAIN GABRIEL, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So you have reset for volume guidance today, you've doubled down on the cost-cutting program and the pull back on CapEx, but the market doesn't seem to think this is enough, judging by how the share prices have reacted today. First question, is there more or deeper restructuring that you can or are prepared to do across the various businesses to speed up the turnaround?</p><p>One. And then 2 on Woodsmith following up on Jason's question. That's the single largest consumer of cash today and for the foreseeable future as well, is finding a strategic partner on the table to help share the capital burden. I think we've addressed this before, but in light of your new guidance, is there a new thinking around it?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Alain, Thanks. So second question first. John addressed that in his part of the presentation. So there's no new thinking on this thing.</p><p>We continue at pace to find a partner at the right partner at the right price for this particular asset. And so no new news there.</p><p>In terms of the levers that we've got to pull, we continue to focus on the things that we can control and we will continue to control them in an appropriate way in response to the conditions as we move forward.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Tyler Broda from RBC.</p><p>TYLER ANSON BRODA, DIRECTOR, GLOBAL MINING RESEARCH, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. I've got 2 questions. One, I was wondering you can go a little bit more into Quellaveco in terms of sort of the guidance for next year, which looks, I think, a little bit soft versus expectations. Why did this come about? Could you just give us a bit more color there?</p><p>I guess the second question is a question around, I guess, just the working capital, diamonds, PGMs, the Kumba buildup. How do you expect to see that evolve? Obviously, there'll be lower production. But can you give us a bit of steer on where you see the working capital over the next sort of 12, 24 months?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Sure, Tyler. Matt, I'm going to come to you in terms of the fault at Quellaveco and how we're navigating our way around that and the implications for it. But on working capital, I'll also ask Al just to talk about what we're doing with diamonds, but certainly at Kumba, the response there has been to slow the mine down and move the stockpile until such time as Transnet recovers.</p><p>Tyler, as I've said before, there's been an enormous amount of work by both business and government and Transnet to get on with the recovery of that particular institution and the logistics infrastructure, and that work is progressing. It is unfortunately not going to represent a massive turnaround or recovery to the original capacity that, that line had in the next year or 2.</p><p>Now that's quite a long time for a business to remain stock bound and very difficult for us not to effectively respond to that. And so that's what Mpumi and the team are doing. We have absolutely not lost faith in the fact that this will recover and it will come back, but being very realistic in terms of the progress that's been made over the last year or so, it is unlikely in our view that this recovery will be next year. And so therefore, we are just planning accordingly.</p><p>There are no material or significant impact to the mine itself because as soon as we get the transport capacity, we will be able to ramp the operations back up. So with that in mind, we will be able to take care of the working capital or the excess working capital at Kumba over the next couple of years.</p><p>In PGMs, really, already there is -- there's a little bit of slag as a result of the original Polokwane deferral about a year ago that we need to work through, but that's not really a big deal. The biggest impact to working capital as far as PGMs are concerned by the impact of Bakken [toll] agreements and the prepayment agreement that we had with one of our customers is just unwinding into a lower pricing environment at this particular point in time.</p><p>So whilst John is completely focused, as are we on working capital management, this will be one of those. And then perhaps, Al, before we go to Matt, you could talk about diamond inventories and the cycle management, please.</p><p>ALISON ATKINSON, GROUP DIRECTOR OF PROJECTS &amp; DEVELOPMENT, ANGLO AMERICAN PLC: Thank you, Duncan, certainly. So through the course of -- particularly the second half of this year, we've seen a downturn in demand for diamonds driven by predominantly macroeconomic factors. As Duncan said earlier, we know that cycles are, by definition, cyclical. And because of that, we kept production relatively steady through the second half of this year and that has led to a buildup of inventory because so many of our costs are fixed, that appears -- that feels to us to be the way things do and sets us up very well for the inevitable upturn during the course of the next year. We're growing in content in that upturn coming sooner rather than later.</p><p>Having said that, if there is continued lower -- longer prices and demand on that, we have a series of levers that we can pull during the course of 2024, and we work with our producer countries and our partners in those countries to do so, including, of course, mining lower grade ore and making operational changes on that basis.</p><p>So there are a series of levers we can pull, depending on the circumstances ahead. But as I said, we are in a good position if as we believe there is an upturn beginning during 2024. Thanks, Dunny.</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Thank you, Al. Matt, do you want to just talk to the fault at Quellaveco, please?</p><p>MATTHEW DALEY, DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL &amp; OPERATIONS AND GROUP HEAD OF MINING, ANGLO AMERICAN PLC: Yes, certainly. Thanks, Duncan, and thanks, Tyler, for the question. So Quellaveco orebody continues to impress us as we've progressed the mining and learned more about this particular ore body. We've always known about this fault, and we continue to look at our pit designs to optimize extraction for both productivity and costs.</p><p>And so what you will see is just a rephasing of the copper over the business plan period. And in fact, this redesign will slightly lower copper in 2024, actually delivers higher total copper and hence, value over the next 5 years. So mining progresses pretty much as planned, and we'll continue to optimize this pit well into the future.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Liam Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.</p><p>LIAM FITZPATRICK, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sorry to go over some ground that's already been covered, but I just wanted to clarify kind of how you're thinking about things. So the first one is just on Woodsmith. So I think back in the trip, you said partnering or syndication was part of the longer-term strategy at the right time. Has there been a bit of a shift there because I think you suggested that there may be a process, so where is that now? Is there an active partnering process going on at the moment?</p><p>And then in terms of that -- the previous question on the portfolio, I guess the share price performance today and this year is something that the market doesn't think there's enough action at the moment. Could we expect any further kind of details from you and the management team next year in terms of perhaps how you see the portfolio, whether that's in terms of the asset base or division?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Liam, I mean you are actually covering ground that I think we've already addressed. So I'll just say it again for clarification. So the syndication process is something that we will do, and it will be done at the right time and for value. I think that, that's really important given the assets of this nature. And then as far as any portfolio changes and so on, we will continue to do what we need to do to ensure that we have a high-quality portfolio of assets that delivers through the cycle and we will continue to respond in whatever way is necessary to respond to both short- and long-term circumstances.</p><p>LIAM FITZPATRICK: Could I just ask an operational one as well, please? Just on De Beers. So at this point, there's no production cuts. How long do you wait before we could see something a bit more meaningful on the production side, just to react to what we -- the weakness we're seeing in the market?</p><p>ALISON ATKINSON: We're not waiting. So we are working actively at the moment with our partners in the producer countries in order to identify the levers that we can take step-by-step during the course of the year. As I said, we need to be careful with this because a large number of our costs are fixed. So we need to avoid doing something that actually just disrupts mines, which then take a lot to recover from and doesn't actually create the cost savings that you really want to drive out of this. But no, we're not waiting. We're working actively with our partners at the moment, and to ensure that if things do stay low, then we're ready to react now.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Richard Hatch from Berenberg.</p><p>RICHARD JAMES HATCH, ANALYST, JOH. BERENBERG, GOSSLER &amp; CO. KG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I've got a couple of questions. The first one is just on Los Bronces. I mean it's a pretty big cut in volumes. Can you just help us a little bit out just in terms of what that second plant run rate is, what kind of price situation do you need to see that kind of that ramp-up again? And are you able just to sort of give us a bit more color on that Copper Chile volume cut? Is it entirely Bronces? Or is there other bits and bobs elsewhere? That's the first one, please.</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Richard. Look, Bronces, the volume cut is of the one plant of the [civil] Los Bronces plant is around about 60,000 tonnes per day of capacity that comes out. It is fundamentally led by a couple of things. So first of all, the mine development has been held back. As we know, we're monophasic out there at the moment. It's going to take a couple of years to get Donoso open up.</p><p>And during that period of time, the capital required for this plant, the operating cost on this plant are extraordinarily high. So the margins on every copper tonne that come out are very close to 0 or negative on that basis. So it doesn't make any sense for us to keep running that plant at current short-term pricing.</p><p>So Ruben and the team are going to use this time to deal with one of the tailing dams that we are in the process of moving and manage the costs. So we will be able to start this plant back up in the right price environment, and certainly pretty quickly in a couple of years' time, if that transpired. So that is the major issue at Los Bronces and it's the right response, value over volume.</p><p>RICHARD JAMES HATCH: Cool. Understood. And I guess that probably means that in the CapEx numbers, there's a little bit less stripping in there if you're not having to push us hard?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: That is correct.</p><p>RICHARD JAMES HATCH: Cool. And then just on coal. We've talked a bit about coal in the past as well, met coal price costs continue to sort of remain elevated. I get that there's a Queensland royalty change that's impacted the cost curve full stop. But on that met coal business down in Queensland is 20 million tonnes now the right long-term run rate to think about where it can be? And this business has previously operated at $60 a tonne, I guess, completely gets a different environment now. But what's a good long-term line in the sand to set a target for on costs for the coal business in Australia?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: So Richard, look, I mean, I think the right sort of long-term run rate for this operations is in the order of sort of 24 million to 25 million tonnes per annum. And timber -- Dan and the team are now ensuring that their long-run cost base is appropriate to that type of productive output. It will take a couple of years to get from 17 million tonnes, which is where we're going to end around about this year to the 25 million tonnes. But in advance of that, we're making sure that we've got the right cost structure to support that sort of output.</p><p>RICHARD JAMES HATCH: Okay. And long-term costs?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: So long-term inflation? Long-term exchange rates? It's -- we will control every element of this that we can.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from Myles Allsop from UBS.</p><p>MYLES ALLSOP, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,CO-HEAD OF EMEA MINING EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; EQUITY ANALYST, EUROPEAN MINING RESEARCH, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Just a couple of questions. First of all, just looking back, this is the second consecutive year where we've had some fairly material cutbacks to guidance. What can you say just to give us some confidence that this is the last of the bad news that when we get to December 2024, we're not going to have another round of sort of cuts to production guidance?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Myles, we've got -- so we've got some very good assets in the portfolio. They have many of them being impacted by some very unique set of circumstances coming out of the COVID years and then some specific logistics and infrastructural issues generally around the world, and that's been the biggest issue.</p><p>We have adjusted, I think, dynamically to these circumstances and as things become clearer, we've used this great team of people and our planning process is to come up with something that we believe is a very meaningful and realistic outcome for the next couple of years in this business.</p><p>So the -- I can absolutely assure you that the things that we are in control of that we need to be on control of are being well controlled by a team of extraordinary people and that once we come through, some of these cyclical impacts, particularly in diamonds and PGMs, we will be very, very well set.</p><p>MYLES ALLSOP: Okay. And then maybe just on the cost savings. Obviously, that's the other some new news from today, this $1 billion that's coming through. And to what degree is that embedded in the unit cost guidance? Or as we look into 2025 unit cost, obviously, you're not guiding that at this point. Can we hope to see a further step down in unit across a number of the divisions?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: John, do you want to take that?</p><p>JOHN HEASLEY: Yes, no problem. Thanks, Myles. It's nice to talk to you. Yes, I mean the cost thing, as you said, the $500 million we talked about previously on the overhead work. So that continues and is well underpinned and well progressed. So that's coming through nicely. The new $500 million that we've announced today, that's more operationally focused, given the action that we've been talking through. So that is coming through in the unit cost and that underpins the 2% step-down in unit costs in 2024.</p><p>And I think it's not to underestimate the scale of that, given that 2% net offsetting, as I said, CPI running at 4% or 5% plus mining inflation on top of that. So there is significant action there. Obviously, that would all come in immediately on 1 January, so they'll get a carry forward or some of that on an annualized basis into 2025.</p><p>And as I said in my presentation, we expect to see that those unit costs will hold broadly at the sort of 2024 levels for a couple of years late after, which I think gives good confidence that we see a little bit more in the tank to continue to manage to offset that inflation that I just described.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Chris LaFemina from Jefferies.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LAFEMINA, SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks for the update. Just a question on the diamond market first. The weakness that you're seeing, which you're attributing to consumer weakness, it feels like a bit like 2008, 2009, but the global economy, obviously isn't as bad as it was then. So I'm wondering how much of this is a function of kind of the structural shift into synthetics? And could you comment on whether synthetic demand is down as much as natural diamond demand? Or is it just the real diamonds that are getting impacted more by the weaker consumer?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Sure. Al, do you want to take that first?</p><p>ALISON ATKINSON: Sure. Thanks, Duncan. I think this is a question, which as you can imagine, preoccupies a lot of our waking thoughts. We see 3 main causes for the downturn in diamond demand over the course of the last year. The first is obviously, macroeconomic when global growth rates fall as they've fallen, guidance are often disproportionately hit by that, the converse, of course, when growth rates go up, so the first is that macroeconomics.</p><p>The second is China and the lag that we see in the Chinese market responding and when Chinese consumers are going out on the moon, they're buying investments rather than diamonds in the same quantity.</p><p>The third aspect that we're seeing is that engagements and therefore, the purchase engagement brings in the United States are down. And that's because 2, 3 years ago, when the people who wouldn't be getting engaged today should have been meeting for the first time, we had the COVID lockdowns. So we're seeing that lag there. So those 3 main effects.</p><p>GDP, Chinese demand lagging and staying low. And thirdly, this after -- the macro piece as well on GDP.</p><p>Now you asked about lab-grown diamonds and the encroachment that lab-grown diamonds are making. This is really, really interesting. So what we're seeing is 3 things. So lab grown supply continuing to rise out of India and China. We're seeing lab grown sales in terms of the amount, the numbers of diamonds going up in the United States. Not really outside the United States. This is mainly a U.S. issue, but we are seeing lab-grown diamond prices plummet. So they are down 90% over the last 2 years. And that's why you're seeing lab-grown diamond manufacturers going -- heading towards bankruptcy at the moment.</p><p>So greater volume and much lower prices. What does that actually mean for us? This is actually, as we predicted. It's just happening a bit faster. And what we're seeing is this bifurcation, this total splitting of natural versus lab-grown. So it's painful in the short term, undoubtedly because it means a lot of lab growing volume going in, but it's true in the long term in that now the prices for lab-grown are less than 10% at a wholesale level of those prices are natural. There is less and less confusion between the products, and we believe that we're moving towards a time where we're going to see very, very differentiated markets for those 2 products.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LAFEMINA: You're not concerned about lab-grown diamond taking significant market share from natural stones and high-end jewelry, and is that even happening? Or is it more lower end jewelry where synthetics are getting the market share?</p><p>I'm just -- I guess my concern here is that the cyclical -- the U.S. economy is not terrible. And you're seeing the rough diamond market there very, very weak. So just wondering how much of a real recovery we can see even if the U.S. economy stays resilient? Or do people just buy more of the synthetics?</p><p>ALISON ATKINSON: So I think there's a couple of things going on. It's a really, really good question. There are a couple of things going on. Firstly, the natural diamond demand in the United States is not that bad at the moment. And we saw relatively good performance during the Thanksgiving and the Black Friday and the Cyber Monday period. So we can't complain about that.</p><p>What we are seeing is I think a push that's happened through the last 2 to 3 years where lab-grown diamonds did encroach on areas such as engagement rings, but with the rapid fall now in lab-grown diamond prices, as I say, down 90% in the last 2 years, we are seeing lab-grown diamond moving towards being more of a -- action item fashion jewelry rather than the jewelry that marks the most meaningful movements in people's lifetimes, which is, of course, what we focus on in De Beers.</p><p>Now when you are at that period where, if you like, the forest fire is burning most brightly and we're seeing large amounts of supply coming in, I think it's very important that we look actually at the profitability of that business and the prices of the lab-grown diamonds, and that's why we're so confident in the bifurcation of the market going forward.</p><p>And in our view, natural diamonds remain, well, they have been for hundreds of years, symbols of the most important moments in people's lives and lab-grown diamonds do what crystal, Swarovski crystal, cubic zirconia has been and that is -- they remain a fantastically fun bit of fashion jewelry.</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: And Chris, just to reiterate. In terms of the quality of the assets that we have, in the portfolio. The -- from a diamond's perspective, these are second to none, and there have been very, very few -- none actually, new diamond discoveries in the last 15 years or so, and some of the older diamond assets are shutting down and closing down too.</p><p>So all of that, everything that Al said, particularly in terms of what we're seeing as a natural break in the lab-grown markets to the natural markets and what's ultimately becoming a scarcity of supply of natural diamonds, I think stands this business in very good stead.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ian Rossouw from Barclays.</p><p>IZAK JAN ROSSOUW, DIRECTOR, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a couple of questions. Firstly, on the PGM business in the release of the pamphlet release, you mentioned that it's roughly keeping current production from owned operations flat, but you talk about a review underway to identify further opportunities. I mean, is this an opportunity to more meaningful cut some of these higher cost deep underground shop? Maybe just sort of curious what that could entail and what the business could look like in, let's say, 5 years' time?</p><p>And then secondly, just on some of the core growth options you mentioned, Duncan. How should we think about the timing of these with regards to Los Bronces underground, Collahuasi expansions? I guess, you showed on that chart. But how do these investments of these sort of dovetail with each other? Or will there be some overlap in the second half of this decade?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Yes, Ian. Sure. So on the PGMs front, Timber and Craig, are absolutely having a look through all of the operating performance of all of these assets. Value over volume will be the driving mantra in all of this. But of course, we are absolutely optimistic on PGMs. And certainly, the quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio are, again, very, very good. And therefore, we believe should be right place to be able to present into this demand that we will see coming for all the reasons that I spoke about earlier.</p><p>I mean if you plot the industry returns over the last 30 years, we are absolutely at the lowest of the lows in that period of time, and that can't be right in terms of this industry generally and our assets in particular. So Timber and Craig will continue with the review of the general performance of this business. We are, as I said earlier, absolutely focused on being sure that we are the best at what we can be the best of and what we are in control of. So let them get done with that review, and we'll see what comes out of that.</p><p>As far as the copper growth options are concerned, I did take you through more or less the timing and the sequencing that we expect for these assets or for these projects in the future. So the first one rarely is going to be Collahuasi after Woodsmith.</p><p>So right now, we are in, as I said, the fifth ball mill is up and running. We've got a few opportunities around debottlenecking there within the current permits. But then we will need to get the permits for the fourth line. And our expectation is that we would be able to acquire these permits in around '27. So the time that we get the permit would be actually after we've got through the peak spend of CapEx at Woodsmith.</p><p>So we'd be on into the execution of the project of the fourth line at Collahuasi, '28, '29, '30, so coming into production in the early '30s. And we expect them to be able to get a permit. So we've got the first permit for Sakatti and that is the finish permit now going through the European Union process in 2029. So therefore, real construction probably 2030, 2031, and that's more or less at the tail end of the Collahuasi construction.</p><p>And then Los Bronces underground is probably out beyond that. So we're busy doing the pre-feasibility study be for that now. And then we have, by and large, the environmental permits, and it's a number of other permits that we would need to go through for that. But my expectation is that the majority of that spend would occur naturally just after Sakatti is completed.</p><p>IZAK JAN ROSSOUW: Maybe just to push you on the PGM restructuring. If you say that you'll look at value over volume, does that mean that sort of 2.1 to 2.3 from owned mines, I mean how much meaningfully can that fall?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: I don't know. I mean -- so look, as when we're through this review, every ounce needs to have its own margin on it and not only in the short run, but in the long run, too. So obviously, we're not going to make the hard cutting to the bone irrational decisions in terms of the short run when we've got a view on what the long-term demand for these assets are going to be -- these products are going to be. But if we cannot see sustainable value on every ounce, then we will take those ounces out.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from [Matt Ream] from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I think you've covered on to the [basis]. So I'll have a couple on your copper growth. Just to start with Collahuasi. I've got a follow-on on Quellaveco. Just on the brownfield growth, the -- you suggested previously an uplift of around 20,000 to 50,000 tonnes of the debottlenecking initiatives and you seem to have landed on about [25,000]. And then the fourth line expansion seems to increase from around [100 to 150] from the early [20, 30s.] So just keen to know what the scope change has been between those 2 options? And is bioleaching still part of the thinking?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Matt. Yes, so I'll ask Ruben just to talk to the ball mall output. I still think that, that's somewhere between 20,000 and 50,000 tonnes on our share basis. So I think it's just fundamentally a function of where we are in the ore body at any one particular point in time.</p><p>The fourth line is pretty much in the same sort of dimension as we had previously said, both in terms of quantum and timing. So I don't think there's any change there. And as far as bioleaching is concerned, that remains potentially one of the options, but you need a high -- relatively high and sustainable price environment to make that work because we will have to do a little bit of capital to put the appropriate leach pads and plants in place to do that.</p><p>So that is under consideration, but it isn't a high priority in the short run. Ruben, do you just want to clarify on the ball mill production please?</p><p>RUBEN FERNANDES: That's right, Duncan. It's around that. So 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes additional to -- as our share. We're (inaudible) very well this month. So I think we could expect that coming in next year. And of course, there is a little bit of grade as well that we need to compensate. So I think this ball mill, we will cover that. But you're right.</p><p>And then we have this option, as I mentioned, debottlenecking options and can be -- lithium can be more flotation cells. So we are in a process to discuss that with our partners. And then the fourth line, that's the big expansion, as you mentioned, is later on. But you're right. So the numbers are right. So no change in scope. Matt to be honest, it's just an adjustment of the profile, the road map for each phase of the growth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. Just come back on 2 parts. I guess, just near term with the plants and operations fully ramped up. How is your press [royalty] has been relative to your expectations? And are you comfortable in the immediate term that you won't be water constraints given the drought in the region?</p><p>And then just a follow-on, more longer term. Duncan, you've highlighted on the fact you have scoped that mill up to 150,000 tonnes a day. But you permitted to around 130,000, if I recall. So just in terms of both infrastructure and permitting, what's sort of required here to push [capacity] to 150,000 tonnes?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Okay. Ruben, I'll ask you to just clarify the water situation. We had some really good precipitation during the course of this year. So I think stocks are pretty good going on into next year. And then of course, we've got new water scheme, which will come in from 2025 onwards. So I think we're going to be okay from a water perspective, but Ruben can clarify that.</p><p>In terms of the constraints at Quellaveco. We're currently doing 127,500 tonnes a day. That is our permit constraint. That permit was fundamentally constrained by water availability. We were pretty certain that given our outline of this operation and the way we would be able to operate it, we would be able to demonstrate a water efficiency higher than what we were able to get permitted.</p><p>And with that in mind, we should be able to then apply through the normal amendment processes for an increment in that permit to what we believe is the appropriate size for that shape and geometry of ore body, which would tolerate around about 150,000 tonnes per day.</p><p>So we would need for that to happen as to be able to have a few years and a few seasons of collected and demonstrated water management performance data and then use that as part of the baseline information that would go into the permitting process and then that gives us the ability to bring that expansion. The intention would be in another couple of years, another year or 2 to be able to start that process.</p><p>As I said before, we had in the original design of the project in anticipation of this keyed in the potential tie-ins for that volumetric expansion. So it should be a relatively low capital intensity expansion when we get to it.</p><p>So Ruben, do you want to just clarify the water?</p><p>RUBEN FERNANDES: Yes, sure. So as you know, Chile has been (inaudible) out with water restrictions and as one -- as part of the long-term solution, we have this integrated water solution project that we call that is progressing very well. 33% completed as we speak. So by end of '25, we should be up and running. It's a long-term contract with our partner. So that's going well. And short term, as you know, we need to have trucks, water trucks are supplying water to the plant.</p><p>But as we speak now, because of the good rainy season in Chile this year, we are not running those trucks at the moment. But of course, at some point next year, depending on the need, we should run a little bit of -- to have a little bit of water trucks on the road. But because we closed one plant, maybe this is something that cannot happen.</p><p>So we should have probably 34% or less cost in water, which is a big deal for process, as you know. We should remove out of the business of [70 million] per year in water next year.</p><p>So I think it's one decision in order to shut the plant given the contacts that Duncan explained and then, of course, the water solution is well balanced now to deal with the situation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: That's helpful. Sorry, my question was actually more geared towards potential in Peru with Quellaveco, just to confirm your water stocks are fine at Quellaveco.</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Yes. I think they are -- yes, Ruben, do you want to confirm?</p><p>RUBEN FERNANDES: No, yes, absolutely. No, it's so far. So no issue in terms of water for Quellaveco. We have availability.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Alexander Pearce from BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>ALEXANDER ROBERT PEEL PEARCE, VP OF METALS AND MINING RESEARCH, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Duncan, I was just wondering if you could drill down into the lower near-term guidance of Minas-Rio a little bit more, please, particularly in 2024, which is a little bit surprising. Maybe given that strong performance, you flagged in '23. And then longer term, the question is really, is there still a chance that we could see that 25 million to 27 million tonnes per annum run rate in your guidance again, always the new long-term lower?</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Alex, thanks for that. So look, 2 things going on at Minas-Rio. None of them unknown to us. The first is that we -- as a result of that water leak several years ago have to run a pig through the water line every 4 or 5 years. And so what we're doing is just planning for that production drop as a result of the time that it takes us to pig this line, and check the dimensions of the wall thickness of the pipeline into the plan.</p><p>The second thing is that the ore body transitions over a very long time to a much harder rock, the hardy turbo rides as they called. And as we run through that transition, there are just various phases of a mix proportion between the hard rock and the soft ore that we're in now, the impact of which is to slow processing rates down.</p><p>There was a lot of thinking at the time that was done at the time that we thought that it might be possible to get to 27-odd million tonnes per annum that we would be able to deploy some technology that would help us with this throughput and processing rate. That's probably a little bit more a ways off than we had originally planned for it to be.</p><p>So the mine is currently operating or currently has the potential to get to 26 million tonnes, which is the original design capacity of Minas-Rio. I'm absolutely certain that Ruben, Matt, (inaudible) and the team will tweak it a little bit above that. But for the foreseeable future, and for those reasons, that's the outlook.</p><p>PAUL GALLOWAY: For all the questions, look, of course, if you've got any -- just before I hand back to Duncan, if you've got any further questions, then please give myself and the IR team a call. I'll be happy to try and talk you through those. Richard, I think we owe you a follow-up. But Duncan, if I may, just pass back to you to close, please.</p><p>DUNCAN GRAHAM WANBLAD: Thank you, Paul, and thanks, everybody, for your time this morning. Just a reiteration is that this is an extremely high-quality portfolio with some great people operating these assets. So we are definitely close to, I hope, and the bottom of cycle, certainly for PGMs and diamonds. A couple of the very specific issues associated with Transnet and Los Bronces are well in hand, and we're getting on top of all of these things. I can assure you, we are absolutely focused on delivering, and we will continue to be agile in our response to current macroeconomic circumstances.</p><p>And with that, again, thank you for your time, and hope you have a good break if there's a break coming your way.

I was trying to peek around corners, as I often do with new technologies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once it wrapped up, I felt a strange combination of things. It was something like one part falling in love; one part kid in a candy store; and two parts watching metaphorical birds flying overhead, harbingers of a massive forest fire on its way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This post will share some learnings, art winners with highlights, and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were <url normalizedValue=\"https://tim.blog/2022/12/16/ai-art-competition/\"> a handful of rules for submissions </url>, but the bolded portions below are the most important to me:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">You can use any AI tools or combination of tools that you like, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2/\"> DALL\\xC2-E 2 </url> (<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/openai\"> @OpenAI </url>), <url normalizedValue=\"https://midjourney.com/home/\"> Midjourney </url> (<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/midjourney\"> @midjourney </url>), <url normalizedValue=\"https://stablediffusionweb.com/\"> Stable Diffusion </url> (<url normalizedValue=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/stablediffusion\"> @StableDiffusion </url>), <url normalizedValue=\"https://lexica.art/\"> Lexica </url> (<url normalizedValue=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/lexicaart\"> @LexicaArt </url>,) <url normalizedValue=\"https://creator.nightcafe.studio/\"> NightCafe Studio </url> (<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/nightcafestudio\"> @NightcafeStudio </url>), etc. You are also allowed to do manual touch-ups and fine-tuning.   </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IMPORTANT</emphasis>  :   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You *must* use <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.loom.com/\"> Loom </url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/loom\"> @loom </url>) or other tech to capture your full process.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> '</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Selections will be based on quality, creativity, presentation of process, and more.   </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Process is important. People should at least be able to attempt to replicate what you did. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The entire point of the competition was to create this blog post, a simple collection of how-to tutorials that can get anyone up-skilled in a short period of time. </emphasis>  Even if you hate everything about AI, here's why I think it's worth spending time on this'</p><p>The AI genie is out of the bottle. The more true experts I speak with, the clearer this is.</p><p>No matter how one feels about AI'and I have plenty of misgivings'the genie cannot be put back in the bottle. This is true for hundreds of sectors and millions of people, including artists. I've watched family members work their asses off as artists, I wanted to be a comic book penciler for 10+ years, and I've paid traditional artists hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years. It's a world that is near and dear to my heart.</p><p>But' there is no going back to the way things used to be. In fact, there is no compelling way to stall things for long. So the question for me isn't 'How can we stop AI art?,' as I don't think it's possible, but rather something like:</p><p>'What can artists do to get ahead of the curve?' or 'How might proactive artists position themselves to benefit from this?' or 'How can artists limit the damage of AI and carve out, or preserve, good niches for themselves?'</p><p>There are dozens of other similar questions we could ask, but I think the initial answer is the same for all of them:   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Learn to use AI tools.</emphasis></p><p>To kickstart your art career, and even if you plan on using more traditional methods'   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">learn to use AI tools</emphasis>  .</p><p>To turbocharge your own art by streamlining mundane tasks'   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">learn to use AI tools</emphasis>  .</p><p>To learn the current weaknesses and blindspots of AI tools so you can plan around them'   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">learn to use AI tools</emphasis>  .</p><p>Most high-calibre artists have nothing to fear, many would-be artists have a lot to look forward to, and all artists have something to learn. If you would spend 10 hours at a weekend course that promised to improve the odds of a good living for the next decade, I think you should commit to spending 10 hours seriously using and scrutinizing the better AI tools. Even if you hate everything this represents, even if it's an opponent you want to defeat, this is akin to watching tape of an opponent before a boxing match. Whether you want to surf the tsunami, dive through it, or get the hell out of the way, you need to understand the wave. To do that, you need to study it, and the sooner the better. The best defense is sometimes an early offense.</p><p>I hope you find this post helpful, and please leave comments with other recommendations. I'm sure I'll get a few gems and a boatload of screeds, but such is the spice of the Internet. </p><p>This blog post is a rough draft and merely a starting point. And if you think the pace of AI development has been fast in the last six months, the next 12 months are going to make your head spin. I think the key is always returning your eyes to the road ahead of you instead of the rear-view mirror.</p><p>Just a few notes on structure before we dive in:</p><p>We included both 'Winners' and 'Honorable Mentions,' but all are included because they offered unique value or a unique approach. </p><p>I heavily weighed the incorporation of character traits. As I mention again below, it's easy to make *something* pretty with AI, but to make a very *specific thing* with parameters and characteristics is much harder. For that reason, I tended to reward rougher art with better trait matching vs. polished art that used fewer traits.</p><p>Some tweets are no longer live, and we've indicated that with a comment. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Special Honorable Mention</emphasis></p><p>I am putting the <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JPEGHODL/status/1605397562634256384\"> below Twitter thread </url> by   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JPEGHODL/status/1605397562634256384\"> @JPEGHODL </url></emphasis>   first, as the thread itself represents an excellent <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.midjourney.com/\"> Midjourney </url> 101 tutorial for people who haven't used Discord much.

The burn ban went into effect May 24 due to hazardous forest fire conditions in the area.</p><p>\"Recent rainfall across central and eastern North Carolina has decreased fire danger,\" said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. \"With more rain expected across the area through the weekend, we should see even more improvement. Still, residents should burn responsibly. Check for restrictions before burning, and make sure you have a valid permit. Check the weather, and never leave a debris fire unattended.\"</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, burn permits are available in all counties. You can obtain a burn permit from any open authorized permitting agent or online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ncforestservice.gov/burnpermit\">www.ncforestservice.gov/burnpermit</url>. All burn permits previously granted in the 26 counties affected by this burn ban were canceled when the ban became effective. A valid permit must be obtained.</p><p>Residents with questions regarding their specific county can contact their N.C. Forest Service county ranger or their county fire marshal's office.

In her new book, \"Through the Fire: Traveling the Broken Road to Hope and Healing,\" Dickens shares her journey, traveling through the pain and trauma of some of life's most difficult trials: persevering through sexual and verbal abuse, bullying, chronic illness and pain, a marriage torn apart, a terminal diagnosis, and natural disasters.</p><p>As Dickens began drafting her book, isolated in her cabin in the Arizona Forest, a forest fire broke out and began ravaging the area surrounding her. She alternated between writing and reading fire updates. After a terrifying night with the wind howling and shaking the windows and the smell of smoke filling the house, she was evacuated with the fire just a half-mile away. She knew then the title of her book: \"Through the Fire: Traveling the Broken Road to Hope and Healing.\"</p><p>Dickens wrote this book for those seeking to become whole again, longing for restoration and clarity, ready to break free and find healing. She hopes, by sharing her story, that readers will take comfort in knowing they are not alone in their struggles, that they can overcome them and that God is always by their side.</p><p>\"My goal for this book is to reach as many people as possible, bringing hope and healing to the broken, and restoration in marriage,\" Dickens said. \"My prayer is that they see Jesus' story, interwoven through my own. In addition, late in the book is a chapter my husband has written. I believe this will be powerful for men and women alike.\"</p><p>Through Dickens' book, readers will find a variety of life experiences and trials, each that taught the author something new about the heart and character of God. She hopes that her book will help lead others to the Lord and show them how great God's love truly is.</p><p>\"Through the Fire: Traveling the Broken Road to Hope and Healing\"<br/>By Lucy Dickens<br/>ISBN: ISBN (softcover); ISBN (hardcover); ISBN (electronic)<br/>Available atWestBow Press,AmazonandBarnes &amp; Noble</p><p>About the author<br/>Lucy Dickens is an active, award-winning oil painter, a \"storyteller of fine art\".

(AP) \u2014 Up to 2.4 million trees would be cut down as part of a project to prevent major wildfires in a federally protected New Jersey forest heralded as a unique environmental treasure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Jersey environmental officials say the plan to kill trees in a section of Bass River State Forest is designed to better protect against catastrophic wildfires, adding it will mostly affect small, scrawny trees \u2014 not the towering giants for which the Pinelands National Refuge is known and loved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the plan, adopted Oct. 14 by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission and set to begin in April, has split environmentalists. Some say it is a reasonable and necessary response to the dangers of wildfires, while others say it is an unconscionable waste of trees that would no longer be able to store carbon as <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">climate change</url> imperils the globe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Foes are also upset about the possible use of herbicides to prevent invasive species regeneration, noting that the Pinelands sits atop an aquifer that contains some of the purest drinking water in the nation.</p><p>And some of them fear the plan could be a back door to logging the protected woodlands under the guise of fire protection, despite the state's denials.</p><p>\u201cIn order to save the forest, they have to cut down the forest,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, the retired former director of the New JerseySierra Club, calling the plan \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cOrwellian.\u201d</p><p>Pinelands Commissioner Mark Lohbauer voted against the plan, calling it ill-advised on many levels. He says it could harm rare snakes, and adds that he has researched forestry tactics from western states and believes that tree-thinning is ineffective in preventing large wildfires.</p><p>\u201cWe are in an era of climate change; it's incumbent on us to do our utmost to preserve these trees that are sequestering carbon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don't have an absolutely essential reason for cutting down trees, we shouldn't do it.\u201d</p><p>The plan involves about 1,300 acres (526 hectares), a miniscule percentage of the 1.1-million-acre (445,150-hectare) Pinelands preserve, which enjoys federal and state protection, and has been named a unique biosphere by the United Nations.</p><p>Most of the trees to be killed are 2 inches (5 centimeters) or less in diameter, the state said. Dense undergrowth of these smaller trees can act as \u201cladder fuel,\u201d carrying fire from the forest floor up to the treetops, where flames can spread rapidly and wind can intensify to whip up blazes, the state Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement.</p><p>A Pinelands commissioner calculated that 2.4 million trees would be removed by using data from the state\u2019s application, multiplying the percentage of tree density reduction by the amount of land affected.</p><p>The department would not say whether it believes that number is accurate, nor would it offer a number of its own. But it did say \u201cthe total number of trees thinned could be significant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is like liquid gasoline in the Pinelands,\u201d said Todd Wyckoff, chief of the New Jersey Forest Service, as he touched a scrawny pine tree of the type that will most often be cut during the project. \u201cI see a forest at risk from fire. I look at this as restoring the forest to more of what it should be.\u201d</p><p>Tree thinning is an accepted form of forest management in many areas of the country, done in the name of preventing fires from becoming larger than they otherwise might be, and is supported by government foresters as well as timber industry officials. But some conservation groups say thinning does not work.</p><p>New Jersey says the cutting will center on the smallest snow-bent pitch pine trees, \u201cand an intact canopy will be maintained across the site.\u201d</p><p>The state's application, however, envisions that canopy cover will be reduced from 68% to 43% on over 1,000 acres (405 hectares), with even larger decreases planned for smaller sections.</p><p>And scrawny trees aren't the only ones that will be cut: Many thick, tall trees on either side of some roads will be cut down to create more of a fire break, where firefighters can defend against a spreading blaze.</p><p>The affected area has about 2,000 trees per acre \u2014 four times the normal density in the Pinelands, according to the state.</p><p>Most of the cut trees will be ground into wood chips that will remain on the forest floor, eventually returning to the soil, the department said, adding, \u201cIt is not anticipated that any material of commercial value will be produced because of this project.\u201d</p><p>Some environmentalists fear that might not be true, that felled trees could be harvested and sold as cord wood, wood pellets or even used in making glue.</p><p>\u201cI'm opposed to the removal of any of that material,\u201d Lohbauer said. \u201cThat material belongs in the forest where it will support habitat and eventually be recycled\u201d into the soil. \u201cEven if they use it for wood pellets, which are popular for burning in wood stoves, that releases the carbon.\u201d</p><p>John Cecil, an assistant commissioner with the department, said his agency is not looking to make a profit from any wood products that might be removed from the site.</p><p>But he said that if some felled trees \u201ccould be put to good use and generate revenue for the taxpayers, why wouldn\u2019t we do that? If there\u2019s a way to do this that preserves the essential goals of this plan and brings some revenue back in, that\u2019s not the end of the world. Maybe you could get a couple fence posts out of these trees.\u201d</p><p>Created by an act of Congress in 1978, the Pinelands district occupies 22% of New Jersey\u2019s land area, is home to 135 rare plant and animal species, and is the largest body of open space on the mid-Atlantic seaboard between Richmond, Virginia, and Boston. It also includes an aquifer that is the source of 17 trillion gallons (64 trillion liters) of drinking water.</p><p>\u201cIt is unacceptable to be cutting down trees in a climate emergency, and cutting 2.4 million small trees will severely reduce the future ability to store carbon,\u201d said Bill Wolfe, a former department official who runs an environmental blog.</p><p>Carleton Montgomery, executive director of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, supports the plan.</p><p>The group said opponents are using the number of trees to be cut \u201cto (elicit) shock and horror,\u201d saying that by focusing on the number rather than size of trees to be cut, they \u201care quite literally missing the forest for the trees. The resulting forest will be a healthy native Pine Barrens habitat.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>This story corrects the name of agency in paragraph 13 to New Jersey Forest Service, not Forest Fire
