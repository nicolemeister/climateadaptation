Welcome to Sylvamo's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]</p><p>I would now like to turn the call over to Hans Bjorkman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hans Bjorkman:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our speakers this morning are Jean-Michel Ribieras [Technical Issues]</p><p>Slides 2 and 3 contain important information, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. Reconciliations of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available in the appendix. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2022 earnings press release as well as today's presentation.</p><p>On Slide 4, we want to provide a brief update on our Russian business. As communicated in our first quarter earnings call, we made the decision to exit Russia and began conducting a process to sell our Russian business. In the second quarter, we have transitioned the Russian operations into discontinued operations. It is important to note now that our Russian operations are reported in discontinued ops, all earnings and figures for current and prior periods, as well as our outlook in this presentation exclude our Russian business, unless otherwise noted. The process to sell the business continues, and we will provide an update on any material developments when appropriate. Please keep in mind that the situation in Russia is complex and continues to change frequently. In the meantime, we will continue to comply with all regulations and sanctions.</p><p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Jean-Michel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Hans. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call.</p><p>I'll begin my comments on Slide 5. I'm very pleased to share our second quarter highlights. We continue to have good results with another quarter of excellent commercial and operational execution. Quarter-over-quarter, we had a 290 basis point improvement in our margins, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA to $189 million, a 29% improvement. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 51% quarter-over-quarter to $2.02 per share. We generated $39 million in free cash flow, and we repaid $48 million in debt. We initiated a dividend with the first payment in July, and our Board also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $150 million. Our strong performance is a result of our low-cost asset base, talented people and our continued efforts to help our customers succeed.</p><p>Let's move to Slide 6. We continue to execute and deliver on our three-prong strategy of commercial excellence, operational excellence and financial discipline, which resulted in a 20.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. Demand for uncoated freesheet continued to strengthen in Latin America and North America as schools and offices reopened. Our volumes remain strong, we remain at full capacity in all regions, and we outperformed industry demand across our regions by 260 basis points with our customer focus.</p><p>In fact, year-to-date in Europe, our brand sales as a percentage of overall mix is up almost 10% against last year. And in Brazil, our cut size sales are now back to pre-pandemic levels. We operated well in the current supply chain environment where the availability of many raw materials remain stretched. We continue to realize the benefit of prior price increases, result in price/mix outpacing cost inflation. I'm proud of how our teams navigated the current landscape and the work to take care of each other as well as our customers. Executing this strategy generated significant free cash flow that we have used to pay down debt and pay a dividend.</p><p>Slide 7 highlights our key performance metrics and our strong results for the quarter. Net sales were $912 million, which was up 11% quarter-over-quarter. As mentioned earlier, we generated an adjusted EBITDA of $189 million, which was an improvement of 29% over the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 20.7%, especially since the second quarter was a heavier maintenance outage quarter. We have not seen margins this high since before the pandemic. We generated $39 million in free cash flow, up 22% quarter-over-quarter and delivered adjusted operating earnings per share of $2.02, which is up 51%.</p><p>Slide 8 summarizes our performance for the first half of the year. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $335 million, achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.3%. We generated $71 million in free cash flow after several substantial one-time spin-related payments. And we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by paying down $81 million of debt. This strong performance demonstrates our ability to continue to deliver on our investment thesis. Our teams performed well creating value for all of our stakeholders.</p><p>I'll now turn it over to John to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail. John?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John V. Sims:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Jean-Michel. Good morning, everyone.</p><p>Let's turn to Slide 9. As Jean-Michel mentioned, we generated $189 million in adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 20.7%. Again, this was a 290 basis point improvement over the first quarter as our gains in pricing, commercial excellence and operational excellence are outpacing cost inflation. We improved price and mix by $73 million as price realizations exceeded our forecast, and we have benefited from several mix optimization initiatives. Volumes increased by $2 million, with stronger seasonal demand in Latin America as back-to-school book publishing was strong. Our order backlog remained strong in all regions. Operations and costs also improved by $2 million. Overall, our operations ran well. We successfully conducted planned maintenance outages at our Eastover and Ticonderoga mill and spent $17 million more on outages than in the first quarter. Input and transportation costs increased by $16 million with the rising cost -- with rising cost of chemicals, energy, fiber and distribution.</p><p>Let's take a look at our regional results on Slide 10. Each region continues to perform very well, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our talented teams, our low-cost mills, iconic brands, as well as favorable industry conditions. We continue to win with customers and increase our positions in key segments. For example, in Brazil, we are expanding our presence in high-margin food retail channel. And in North America, we are growing on-demand book publishing. We remain focused on earning the right to be our customers' supplier of choice.</p><p>Our volumes remain strong in all regions, and we continue to outperform industry shipments. Our commercial performance reflects our compelling customer value proposition as well as continued price increase realizations. Operations were good in all regions, while executing two large annual outages in North America. Supply chain costs remain under pressure. However, we're seeing truck availability starting to improve in North America.</p><p>One of the competitive advantages of Sylvamo is our global footprint. And I want to remind you that our European team has been selling products from Brazil into Europe for over a decade. Now that our Russian business is in discontinued operations, the Brazilian volume represents a much higher percentage of our total European sales and impacts our reported EBITDA margins in Europe. So if we exclude the Brazilian volume sold by our European team where they only receive a sales commission, Europe's second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin would have been closer to 20%. The appendix contains additional details on our regional performance.</p><p>So let's turn to Slide 11. Six months into the year, global uncoated freesheet industry conditions continue to be favorable as demand continues to rebound from the effects of COVID and operating rates remain tight, particularly in the regions where we operate. It should be noted that industry inventory levels are below historical levels across all regions due to tight supply conditions. Year-to-date through June, North America industry demand growth is 2%, while Latin American industry demand growth is positive 16%. Western Europe industry demand declined 2.7% in the first half of the year, but the prior shutdown of high-cost capacity still results in favorable supply and demand balance there. It is believed that this tight supply is negatively impacting European demand. Selling prices remain favorable, and we expect to continue to realize prior increases throughout the third quarter. Our price and mix improvements continued to more than offset input and transportation costs.</p><p>So let's move to Slide 12 and look at our third quarter outlook. In the third quarter, we expect to deliver an adjusted EBITDA of $205 million to $215 million. Price and mix is projected to improve by $40 million to $45 million as we continue to realize price increases already communicated to our customers in all regions. We expect volume to improve by $5 million to $10 million with seasonally stronger volume in North America. Operations and costs are projected to increase by $5 million to $10 million. We expect input and transportation costs to increase by $35 million to $40 million, largely due to higher chemical, energy, fiber and transportation costs. Maintenance outage expenses are projected to decrease by $14 million as we conduct less planned maintenance outages this quarter. Slide 22 contains further details on additional financial metrics for the third quarter outlook.</p><p>Now let's turn to Slide 13. I want to remind you how we are planning to allocate cash to create value. This slide claims up how we plan to allocate our capital. We intend to use our cash to strengthen our balance sheet and invest in high-return projects and return cash to shareowners.</p><p>Let's start by diving into how we plan to strengthen our balance sheet on Slide 14. Last quarter, I shared with you that we are now targeting gross debt of $1 billion. We believe this will achieve the following: it reduces our risk and our cost of capital; reduces our interest expense; puts us in a position to invest in businesses throughout the cycle; and increases our flexibility for other value-creation opportunities through the business cycle. As you can see on the slide, we have repaid $225 million in debt since our spin, and we have steadily driven down our gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio every quarter. In addition to the $48 million repaid in the second quarter, we also repaid another $20 million in the month of July. This now puts our gross debt level below $1.3 billion. We were able to accomplish all of this within our first 10 months of being a stand-alone public company.</p><p>Here on Slide 15, we will take a closer look at how we plan to invest in high-return projects to improve our business, lower our costs and make our assets even more competitive. We are developing a portfolio of high-return cost reduction and strategic volume and mix-related capital projects. Over $100 million of capital projects with high returns have been identified so far.</p><p>13 cost reduction projects have been approved at this point with a total capital cost of $33 million. These projects will be executed over the balance of 2022 and 2023. This slide shows six of these projects to illustrate some of what we are working on. We expect to achieve in excess of $12 million in annual savings from these investments with most of the projects starting to return savings in the second half of 2023. All these projects are focused on reducing energy, fiber and chemical costs, as well as indirect cost savings. These projects have an investment range of $200,000 up to $2.5 million and have internal rate of returns ranging from 20% to 80%.</p><p>Let's turn to Slide 16 to discuss returning cash to shareowners. On our last call, we mentioned that we were conducting Board-level discussions around returning cash to share owners. In May, our Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1125 per share that was paid in July. Our Board also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $150 million.</p><p>Let's turn to Slide 17. So as we look at the balance of the year and beyond, you can see that our debt maturity profile that we do not have any significant maturities due until 2027. It is also important to note that we have $128 million of spin-related payments in 2022 that will not repeat. These include $77 million of day one Riverdale and Georgetown inventory payment, $29 million of one-time spin-off expenses, and $22 million of transition service agreement costs. We'll also benefit from our high-return project pipeline as that ramps up as we now have the option to opportunistically buy back shares to help create further value. Also note that in Brazil, a settlement program became available for disputes over the amortization of goodwill, and it expired in July. International Paper, which directs our goodwill tax dispute there, determined not to settle the dispute to the program.</p><p>I'll now turn the call back over to Jean-Michel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, John.</p><p>I'll conclude our remarks on Slide 18. We are well positioned to continue to create value in 2022 and beyond. We remain committed to generating strong earnings and cash flow and confident in our ability to achieve pre-pandemic earnings level in 2022.</p><p>In fact, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance from a range of $725 million to $775 million to $740 million to $780 million. We are also increasing our full-year free cash flow guidance from a range of $160 million to $180 million to $170 million to $190 million. Our reasoning is as follows: we see favorable industry conditions and expect that to remain in the second half; our customer value proposition has continued to strengthen; we continue to have excellent commercial and operational execution; our price/mix continues to outpace inflation. In the second half, we expect improving adjusted EBITDA margins and strong sustainable free cash flow.</p><p>Our strategy has not changed. Also, we are now targeting a good debt level of $1 billion. We are accelerating our high-return project, and we continue to work hard to strengthen our company and improve the business. Our ability to navigate dynamic industry conditions and achieve success is because of our talented and engaged teams. We appreciate their dedication to working safely while delivering on our promises to our employees, customers and shareowners. We are committing to delivering value for all our stakeholders by continuing to deliver on our investment thesis. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our vision of being the employer, supplier and investment of choice.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hans Bjorkman:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Jean-Michel, and thank you, John. Okay, Tony, we're now ready to take questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Quinn:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks guys, and good morning. Just a question on price increases. I've seen a number of competitors in North America introduce September price increases in the marketplace. Just wondering if you follow suit? And what's the status in Latin America?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>I think we don't comment on pricing, but there's been some press or media or specialists, which have informed our price trends. So I think it's public news [Phonetic] for North America.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Quinn:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Then just maybe -- just a bonus question here. Just on guidance, I think I made this wrong last quarter, but essentially, you've moved up guidance about $10 million on the midpoint, right? But I was assuming that Q1 has reported 187 [Phonetic] within your guidance as opposed to the 143 [Phonetic] that's ex Russia, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. This is all ex Russia. And you're correct. We've upgraded especially at the midpoint by about $10 million a bit more.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Quinn:</emphasis></p><p>All right. That's all I have. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Paul.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Hans Bjorkman for closing comments. Oh, one moment, we do have a last moment question that just come in. And that's from Cole Hathorn with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cole Hathorn:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just like to follow up on the wood cost trends that you're seeing by region, particularly interested in hearing what you're seeing in the European markets for wood costs? Some of your competitors are calling out wood cost inflation.</p><p>And then following up on that, like to hear a little bit more about the office paper demand trends that you're seeing in Europe relative to North America. Are you seeing any divergence from your customer base in the strength of those office paper order books? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John V. Sims:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Cole, it's John Sims. On the wood cost, we're seeing wood costs increase across all our regions, but mostly that's driven by transportation costs due to diesel. Although diesel is going down, it's lagged because mostly it's indexed there. In particular to Europe, our sources of wood is from the Saillat in France, and we actually have a wood harvesting operation there. We're not seeing the pressure that you see in other places, particularly like you see in Poland and other places. That's being impacted either because of the Russian ban wood to the Nordics and some other things that are going there. So we're not seeing that type -- that increase other than the transportation cost in Europe and Saillat.</p><p>In terms of your question around uncoated freesheet demand in Europe, it is. As we mentioned, the demand for -- in Western Europe, uncoated freesheet is down, it's down 2.5%. And as we also mentioned on the call, we believe that the conditions are -- despite conditions are so tight there that you have a lot of stock out in shelves, and we reported that some availability of paper is not there. We think that, that is impacting demand and how much we don't really have a view on that. But we do think that, that is impacting it. The most significant demand decline there we're seeing is in Eastern Europe, and that's mostly driven because of the Ukrainian situation. I believe that's been reported almost down 10%. But that really doesn't impact us from Saillat, which -- our shipments there is predominantly the Western Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cole Hathorn:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And if you permit one follow-up, given your region of producing in France, I imagine you don't have any water level or drought issues. Are you seeing any water level issues impacting some of -- potentially some of your competitors' production for the market. Any color you can give on that would be helpful?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. We don't know about competition on drought. There is, as you know, in France, some drought also, it might not be as bad as some other countries of Europe. There is a lot of people making attention and government has given instruction on water. So we're not too affected right now, but we're paying attention to that.</p><p>The one thing which we are paying more attention which is not impacting us directly yet, but could is the fire -- the wood fire, the forest fire. As you know, the especially one big one in the southwest of France. There's been a lot this summer and that has created some disruptions. So far, we've been able to manage it, but yes, it created some disruption on the wood side.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cole Hathorn:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Jonathon Luft with Eagle Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I have is, maybe just talking about Europe and the energy situation, can you just walk us through your exposure there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John V. Sims:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, Jonathan, this is John. We're well positioned, if you will, with our side on mill because we're integrating mill and produce most of our energy needs. We do have some demand for gas there, but it really represents almost 10% of our energy needs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathon Luft:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. And now that Russia is part of the discontinued operation, can you maybe talk to us a little bit about what the business would have looked like without Russia, if we went back to 2019, 2020 pre-pandemic and how the business -- the guidance this year and how it relates to ex Russia?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John V. Sims:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, Jonathan, I mean, I think -- and we mentioned it is that our earnings even without Russia is approaching or actually better than almost in pre-pandemic levels. Even back in 2019, where we had -- we actually had another machine. We had Riverdale 15 machine that was producing. We're with -- today, we're projecting to produce more earnings and have higher EBITDA margins than we did back then. So if you think about what Russia contributed in terms of EBITDA margin during that time frame, pre-pandemic, was north of $120 million to $125 million.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathon Luft:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a last question for me is, if you could talk about the competitive environment, given that margins are pretty attractive now, pricing up. Are you seeing people try and turn on machines or sell some incremental capacity into the market? What are you seeing there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Michel Ribieras:</emphasis></p><p>We're not seeing any major changes. And I think if you are in a non-integrated position in Europe with the energy, wood and chemical price and the pulp price, I know your position remains difficult, I will say probably. And there is no change in capacities in the other main regions. So we're not seeing anything significantly right now. Operating rates remains very high in every regions we operate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathon Luft:</emphasis></p><p>All right. Well, thank you so much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John V. Sims:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Hans Bjorkman for closing comments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hans Bjorkman:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Tony, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We do appreciate your interest in Sylvamo, and we look forward to continuing the conversations in the coming days, weeks and months ahead. Have a great day. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-28541c4b9686545faa10de4189ee6d40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB1-CR53-RTH9-W3FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 AlphaStreet Inc.

Klamath Falls is in southern Oregon just 20 miles North of the California border.  Klamath County has large private and public forests, many large cattle ranches, and beautiful marshes and lakes, which attract thousands of migratory birds throughout the year.</p><p><br/>When I started writing this blog, I was looking at the mountains that surround the magnificent Crater Lake. Now eight days later, I have not seen the mountains surrounding Crater Lake and have quit taking my morning walk. There are fires all around Klamath Falls.  Fires that have been reoccurring for the last few summers. Most disturbing is that a very high percentage of these fires should have been prevented.<br/>Two years ago, then California Governor Jerry Brown said the fires were a \u201cnew normal\u201d because of global warming. This claim was refuted by University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass, who told the Daily Caller, \u201cGlobal warming may contribute slightly, but the key factors are mismanaged forests, years of fire suppression, increased population, people living where they should not, invasive flammable species, and the fact that California has always had fire.\u201d<br/>This post will focus on the history of forest fires, mismanagement, and suppression and how that impacted the people and industries living near the forests\u2019 fires.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">California has Always had Fires</emphasis><br/>As Professor Mass stated, California has throughout history had naturally caused fires. Scientists estimate that before Europeans arrived, 4.4 million acres of California burned annually, which is 16 times larger than the amount that burned in 2019.<br/>California has two separate fire problems.  There are the coastal scrub brush fires that include the notorious Santa Ana fires spread by devastating winds.  The Sierra Nevada fires are the high-altitude pine forests that are now burning in California and Oregon mountains.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mismanaging the Forest</emphasis><br/>The mismanagement occurred from decisions made during President Clinton\u2019s administration.  A combination of listing the Northern Spotted Owl on the endangered specifies list and strong pressure for saving old growth timber by numerous environmental organizations reduced the timber harvest substantially. Worse, it also greatly reduced active management of the forest \u2013 thinning, prescribed burns and clearing underbrush. As a comparison, the amount of timber harvested from Forest Service land from 1960 until 1990 was an average of 10 million feet each year.  Between 1991 and 2000 the harvest was purposely reduced.  From 2000 to 2013 the decline was a precipitous - 80 percent.<br/>Two years ago, in The Daily Caller interview, Bob Zybach, an experienced forester with a Ph.D. in environmental science, described the Forest Service practices up to 1990, \u201cMostly fuels were removed through logging, active management \u2014 which they stopped \u2014 and grazing. You take away logging, grazing and maintenance, and you get firebombs.\u201d<br/>While bad fires still happen on state and private lands, most of the massive blazes happen on or around lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies, Zybach said. Poor management has turned western forests into \u201cslow-motion time bombs.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Years of Fire Suppression</emphasis><br/>For over a century in the West, the general procedure was to stop a forest fire as quickly as possible. \u201cWe have put out fires for 100 years. Now we are paying the price,\u201d said Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science at UC Berkeley. \u201cIt will take a while to make these forests healthy again. But it\u2019s absolutely possible.\u201d Stephen noted that the Sierra mountains typically had about 40 trees per acre in the early 1800s. Now they have 400 or more, creating heavy brush and thick forests, which explode when ignited.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Incompetent Federal Government</emphasis><br/>The federal government has created dangerous and deadly fires. A century of wrong policies and mismanagement has caused enormous economic damage to hundreds of small lumber producing towns. It has also harmed America by denying the beneficial use of the timber.<br/>Now, former Governor Jerry Brown and many environmentalists are attempting to connect the fires to climate change, which will greatly exacerbate the government made fire disaster which plagues much of the American West.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solution: Sell Most of the Government Lands</emphasis><br/>Unfortunately, after a century of incompetent policy and mismanagement, mostly caused by the contradictory demands of environmentalists, it is difficult to believe the federal government will properly pass beneficial legislation that will substantially increase logging, properly thin forests and wisely activate prescribed burns. Therefore, I proffer to sell much of the forest lands for two reasons. First, those of us living in the timber communities of the rural West know which lands are owned by private citizens and which are owned by the Forest Service. Private owners manage and protect their assets by harvesting, thinning and prescribed burns. Second, the federal government with enormous and dangerous debt augmented by the pandemic and lockdowns needs the revenue.<br/>Selling government-owned forests is a win-win. I will gladly assist any organization that wants to promote selling government forests.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-114266</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X0-T1T1-JBJN-M2MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Welcome to Sylvamo's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>I would now like to turn the call over to Hans Bjorkman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.</p><p>HANS BJORKMAN, VP OF IR, SYLVAMO CORPORATION: Thanks, Toni. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our speakers this morning are Jean-Michel Ribieras</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>Slides 2 and 3 contain important information, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. Reconciliations of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available in the appendix.</p><p>Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2022 earnings press release as well as today's presentation. On Slide 4, we want to provide a brief update on our Russian business. As communicated in our first quarter earnings call, we made the decision to exit Russia and began conducting a process to sell our Russian business. In the second quarter, we have transitioned the Russian operations into discontinued operations. It is important to note, now that our Russian operations are reported in discontinued ops, all earnings and figures for current and prior periods as well as our outlook in this presentation exclude our Russian business, unless otherwise noted.</p><p>The process to sell the business continues, and we will provide an update on any material developments when appropriate. Please keep in mind that the situation in Russia is complex and continues to change frequently. In the meantime, we will continue to comply with all regulations and sanctions. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jean-Michel.</p><p>JEAN-MICHEL RIBI\u00e9RAS, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, SYLVAMO CORPORATION: Thanks, Hans. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin my comments on Slide 5. I'm very pleased to share our second quarter highlights. We continue to have good results with another quarter of excellent commercial and operational execution. Quarter-over-quarter, we had a 290 basis point improvement in our margins, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA to $189 million, a 29% improvement.</p><p>Our adjusted earnings per share grew 51% quarter-over-quarter to $2.02 per share. We generated $39 million in free cash flow, and we repaid $48 million in debt. We initiated a dividend with the first payment in July and our Board also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $150 million. Our strong performance is a result of our low-cost asset base, talented people and our continued efforts to help our customers succeed.</p><p>Let's move to Slide 6. We continue to execute and deliver on our three-pronged strategy of commercial excellence, operational excellence and financial discipline, which resulted in a 20.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. Demand for uncoated freesheet continued to strengthen in Latin America and North America as schools and offices reopened. Our volumes remain strong. We remain at full capacity in all regions, and we outperformed industry demand across our regions by 260 basis points with our customer focus.</p><p>In fact, year-to-date in Europe, our branding sales as a percentage of overall mix is up almost 10% against last year. And in Brazil, our cut size sales are now back to pre-pandemic levels. We operated well in the current supply chain environment where the availability of many raw materials remain stretched. We continue to realize the benefit of prior price increases, result in price/mix outpacing cost inflation. I'm proud of how our teams navigated the current landscape and have worked to take care of each other as well as our customers. Executing this strategy generated significant free cash flow that we have used to pay down debt and pay a dividend.</p><p>Slide 7 highlights our key performance metrics and our strong results for the quarter. Net sales were $912 million, which was up 11% quarter-over-quarter. As mentioned earlier, we generated an adjusted EBITDA of $189 million, which was an improvement of 29% over the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 20.7%, especially since the second quarter was a heavier maintenance outage quarter. We have not seen margins this high since before the pandemic. We generated $39 million in free cash flow, up 22% quarter-over-quarter and delivered adjusted operating earnings per share of $2.02, which is up 51%.</p><p>Slide 8 summarizes our performance for the first half of the year. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $335 million, achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.3%. We generated $71 million in free cash flow after several substantial onetime spin-related payments. And we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by paying down $81 million of debt. This strong performance demonstrates our ability to continue to deliver on our investment thesis. Our teams performed well creating value for all of our stakeholders. I'll now turn it over to John to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail. John?</p><p>JOHN VAN SIMS, SENIOR VP &amp; CFO, SYLVAMO CORPORATION: Thanks, Jean-Michel. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. As Jean-Michel mentioned, we generated $189 million in adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 20.7%. Again, this was a 290 basis point improvement over the first quarter as our gains in pricing, commercial excellence and operational excellence are outpacing cost inflation. We improved price and mix by $73 million as price realizations exceeded our forecast, and we have benefited from several mix optimization initiatives. Volumes increased by $2 million, with stronger seasonal demand in Latin America as back-to-school book publishing was strong.</p><p>Our order backlog remained strong in all regions. Operations and costs also improved by $2 million. Overall, our operations ran well. We successfully conducted planned maintenance outages at our Eastover and Ticonderoga mill and spent $17 million more on outages than in the first quarter. Input and transportation costs increased by $16 million with the rising cost -- with rising cost of chemicals, energy, fiber and distribution.</p><p>Let's take a look at our regional results on Slide 10. Each region continues to perform very well, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our talented teams, our low-cost mills, iconic brands as well as favorable industry conditions. We continue to win with customers and increase our position in key segments. For example, in Brazil, we are expanding our presence in high-margin food retail channel. And in North America, we are growing on-demand book publishing. We remain focused on earning the right to be our customers' supplier of choice.</p><p>Our volumes remain strong in all regions, and we continue to outperform industry shipments. Our commercial performance reflects our compelling customer value proposition as well as continued price increase realizations. Operations were good in all regions while executing 2 large annual outages in North America. Supply chain costs remain under pressure. However, we're seeing truck availability starting to improve in North America.</p><p>One of the competitive advantages of Sylvamo is our global footprint. And I want to remind you that our European team has been selling products from Brazil into Europe for over a decade. Now that our Russian business is in discontinued operations, the Brazilian volume represents a much higher percentage of our total European sales and impacts our reported EBITDA margins in Europe.</p><p>So if we exclude the Brazilian volume sold by our European team where they only received a sales commission, Europe's second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin would have been closer to 20%. The appendix contains additional details on our regional performance. So let's turn to Slide 11. 6 months into the year, global uncoated freesheet industry conditions continue to be favorable as demand continues to rebound from the effects of COVID and operating rates remain tight, particularly in the regions where we operate.</p><p>It should be noted that industry inventory levels are below historical levels across our regions due to tight supply conditions. Year-to-date through June, North America industry demand growth is 2%, while Latin American industry demand growth is positive 16%. Western Europe industry demand declined 2.7% in the first half of the year, but the prior shutdown of high-cost capacity still results in favorable supply and demand balance there.</p><p>It is believed that this tight supply is negatively impacting European demand. Selling prices remain favorable, and we expect to continue to realize prior increases throughout the third quarter. Our price and mix improvements continue to more than offset input and transportation costs.</p><p>So let's move to Slide 12 and look at our third quarter outlook. In the third quarter, we expect to deliver an adjusted EBITDA of $205 million to $215 million. Price and mix is projected to improve by $40 million to $45 million as we continue to realize price increases already communicated to our customers in all regions.</p><p>We expect volume to improve by $5 million to $10 million with seasonally stronger volume in North America. Operations and costs are projected to increase by $5 million to $10 million. We expect input and transportation costs to increase by $35 million to $40 million, largely due to higher chemical, energy, fiber and transportation costs. Maintenance outage expenses are projected to decrease by $14 million as we conduct less planned maintenance outages this quarter.</p><p>Slide 22 contains further details on additional financial metrics for the third quarter outlook. Now let's turn to Slide 13. I want to remind you how we are planning to allocate cash to create value. This slide frames up how we plan to allocate our capital. We intend to use our cash to strengthen our balance sheet and invest in high-return projects and return cash to shareholders.</p><p>Let's start by diving into how we plan to strengthen our balance sheet on Slide 14. Last quarter, I shared with you that we are now targeting gross debt of $1 billion. We believe this will achieve the following: reduces our risk and our cost of capital, reduces our interest expense, puts us in a position to invest in businesses throughout the cycle and increases our flexibility for other value-creation opportunities through the business cycle.</p><p>As you can see on the slide, we have repaid $225 million in debt since our spin, and we have steadily driven down our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio every quarter. In addition to the $48 million repaid in the second quarter, we also repaid another $20 million in the month of July. This now puts our gross debt level below $1.3 billion. We were able to accomplish all of this within our first 10 months of being a stand-alone public company.</p><p>Here on Slide 15, we will take a closer look at how we plan to invest in high-return projects to improve our business, lower our costs and make our assets even more competitive. We are developing a portfolio of high-return cost reduction and strategic volume and mix-related capital projects. Over $100 million of capital projects with high returns have been identified so far. 13 cost reduction projects have been approved at this point with a total capital cost of $33 million.</p><p>These projects will be executed over the balance of 2022 and 2023. This slide shows 6 of these projects to illustrate some of what we are working on. We expect to achieve in excess of $12 million in annual savings from these investments with most of the projects starting to return savings in the second half of 2023. All these projects are focused on reducing energy, fiber and chemical costs as well as indirect cost savings.</p><p>These projects have an investment range of $200,000 up to $2.5 million and have internal rate of returns ranging from 20% to 80%. Let's turn to Slide 16 to discuss returning cash to shareowners. On our last call, we mentioned that we were conducting Board-level discussions around returning cash to shareowners. In May, our Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1125 per share that was paid in July. Our Board also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $150 million.</p><p>Let's turn to Slide 17. So as we look at the balance of the year and beyond, you can see in our debt maturity profile that we do not have any significant maturities due until 2027. It is also important to note that we have $128 million of spend related payments in 2022 that will not repeat. These include $77 million of day 1 Riverdale and Georgetown inventory payment, $29 million of onetime spin-off expenses and $22 million of transition service agreement costs.</p><p>We'll also benefit from our high-return project pipeline as that ramps up, as we now have the option to opportunistically buy back shares to help create further value. Also note that in Brazil, a settlement program became available for disputes over the amortization of goodwill, and it expired in July. International Paper, which directs our goodwill tax dispute there, determined not to settle the dispute through the program.</p><p>I'll now turn the call back over to Jean-Michel.</p><p>JEAN-MICHEL RIBI\u00e9RAS: Thanks, John. I'll conclude our remarks on Slide 18. We are well positioned to continue to create value in 2022 and beyond. We remain committed to generating strong earnings and cash flow and confident in our ability to achieve pre-pandemic earnings levels in 2022.</p><p>In fact, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance from a range of $725 million to $775 million to $740 million to $780 million. We are also increasing our full year free cash flow guidance from a range of $160 million to $180 million to $170 million to $180 million (sic) [$190 million]. Our reasoning is as follows: We see favorable industry conditions and expect that to remain in the second half; our customer value proposition has continued to strengthen; we continue to have excellent commercial and operational execution; our price/mix continues to outpace inflation.</p><p>In the second half, we expect improving adjusted EBITDA margins and strong sustainable free cash flow. Our strategy has not changed. Also, we are now targeting a gross debt level of $1 billion. We are accelerating our high-return project, and we continue to work hard to strengthen our company and improve the business. Our ability to navigate dynamic industry conditions and achieve success is because of our talented and engaged teams.</p><p>We appreciate their dedication to working safely while delivering on our promises to our employees, customers and shareowners. We are committing to delivering value for all our stakeholders by continuing to deliver on our investment thesis. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our vision of being the employer, supplier and investment of choice.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hans.</p><p>HANS BJORKMAN: Thanks, Jean-Michel, and thank you, John. Okay, Toni, we're now ready to take questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>PAUL C. QUINN, DIRECTOR OF PAPER AND FOREST PRODUCTS &amp; PAPER AND FOREST PRODUCTS ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a question on price increases. I've seen a number of competitors in North America introduce September price increases in the marketplace. Just wondering if you followed suit? And what's the status in Latin America?</p><p>JEAN-MICHEL RIBI\u00e9RAS: I think we don't comment on pricing, but there's been some press or media or specialists, which have informed our price trends. So I think it's public knowledge for North America.</p><p>PAUL C. QUINN: Okay. Then just maybe just a bonus question here. Just on guidance, I think I made this wrong last quarter, but essentially, you've moved up guidance by $10 million on the midpoint, right? But I was assuming that Q1 has reported 187, which was in your guidance as opposed to 143. That's ex Russia, right?</p><p>JEAN-MICHEL RIBI\u00e9RAS: Yes. This is all ex Russia. And you're correct. We've upgraded especially at the midpoint by about $10 million a bit more.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) I'll now turn the call back over to Hans Bjorkman for closing comments. One moment, we do have a last moment question that just come in. And that's from Cole Hathorn with Jefferies.</p><p>COLE HATHORN, VP, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just like to follow up on the wood cost trends that you're seeing by region, particularly interested in hearing what you're seeing in the European markets for wood costs. Some of your competitors are calling out wood cost inflation. And then following up on that, like to hear a little bit more about the office paper demand trends that you're seeing in Europe relative to North America. Are you seeing any divergence from your customer base in the strength of those office paper order books?</p><p>JOHN VAN SIMS: Yes. Cole, it's John Sims. On the wood cost, we're seeing wood costs increase across all our regions, but mostly that's driven by transportation costs due to diesel. Although diesel is going down, it's lagged because mostly it's indexed there. In particular to Europe, our sources of wood is from the Saillat mills in France, and we actually have a wood harvesting operation there.</p><p>We're not seeing the pressure that you see in other places, particularly like you see in Poland and other places. That's being impacted either because of the Russian banned wood to the Nordics and some other things that are going there. So we're not seeing that type -- that increase other than the transportation cost in Europe, in Saillat.</p><p>In terms of your question around uncoated freesheet demand in Europe, it is. As we mentioned, the demand for -- in Western Europe, uncoated freesheet is down. It's down 2.5%. And as we also mentioned on the call, we believe that the conditions are -- despite conditions are so tight there that you have a lot of stock out in shelves, and we reported that some of the availability of paper is not there. We think that, that is impacting demand. How much? We don't really have a view on that.</p><p>But we do think that, that is impacting it. The most significant demand decline, though, we're seeing is in Eastern Europe, and that's mostly driven because of the Ukrainian situation. I believe that's been reported almost down 10%. But that really doesn't impact us from Saillat, which our shipments there is predominantly Western Europe.</p><p>COLE HATHORN: If you permit one follow-up, given your regional of producing in France, I imagine you don't have any water level or drought issues. Are you seeing any water level issues impacting some of -- potentially some of your competitors' production for the market? Any color you can give on that would be helpful.</p><p>JEAN-MICHEL RIBI\u00e9RAS: Yes. We don't know about competition on drought. There is, as you know, in France, some drought also. It might not be as bad as some other countries of Europe. There is a lot of people making attention and government has given instruction on water. So we're not too affected right now, but we're paying attention to that. The one thing which we are paying more attention, which is not impacting us directly yet but could is the fire -- the wood fire, the forest fire, as you know, the especially one big one in the southwest of France. There's been a lot this summer and that has created some disruptions. So far, we've been able to manage it, but yes, it created some disruption on the wood side.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And we do have a question from the line of Jonathon Luft with Eagle Capital Partners.</p><p>JONATHON LUFT;EAGLE CAPITAL PARTNERS;ANALYST: The first question I have is maybe just talking about Europe and the energy situation. Can you just walk us through your exposure there?</p><p>JOHN VAN SIMS: Yes, Jonathon, this is John. We're well positioned, if you will, with our Saillat mill because we're an integrated mill and produce most of our energy needs. We do have some demand for gas there, but it really represents almost 10% of our energy needs.</p><p>JONATHON LUFT;EAGLE CAPITAL PARTNERS;ANALYST: Perfect. And now that Russia is part of the discontinued operation, can you maybe talk to us a little bit about what the business would have looked like without Russia if we went back to 2019, 2020 pre-pandemic and how the business -- the guidance this year and how it relates to ex Russia?</p><p>JOHN VAN SIMS: Yes, Jonathon, I mean, I think -- and we mentioned it is that our earnings even without Russia is approaching or actually better than almost in pre-pandemic levels. Even back in 2019, where we had -- we actually had another machine. We had Riverdale 15 machine that was producing. We're with -- today, we're projecting to produce more earnings and have higher EBITDA margins than we did back then. So if you think about what Russia contributed in terms of EBITDA margin during that time frame pre-pandemic was north of $120 million to $125 million.</p><p>JONATHON LUFT;EAGLE CAPITAL PARTNERS;ANALYST: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a last question for me is if you could talk about the competitive environment, given that margins are pretty attractive now. Pricing is up. Are you seeing people try and turn on machines or sell some incremental capacity into the market? What are you seeing there?</p><p>JEAN-MICHEL RIBI\u00e9RAS: We're not seeing any major changes. And I think if you are in a nonintegrated position in Europe with the energy, wood and chemical price and the pulp price right now, your position remains difficult, I will say, probably. And there is no change in capacities in the other main regions. So we're not seeing anything significant right now. Operating rates remains very high in every region we operate.</p><p>OPERATOR: I'll now turn the call back over to Hans Bjorkman for closing comments.</p><p>HANS BJORKMAN: Thank you, Toni, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We do appreciate your interest in Sylvamo, and we look forward to continuing the conversations in the coming days, weeks and months ahead. Have a great day. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in Sylvamo's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.

Klamath Falls is in southern Oregon just 20 miles North of the California border. Klamath County has large private and public forests, many large cattle ranches, and beautiful marshes and lakes, which attract thousands of migratory birds throughout the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When I started writing this blog, I was looking at the mountains that surround the magnificent Crater Lake. Now eight days later, I have not seen the mountains surrounding Crater Lake and have quit taking my morning walk. There are fires all around Klamath Falls. Fires that have been reoccurring for the last few summers. Most disturbing is that a very high percentage of these fires should have been prevented.</p><p>Two years ago, then California Governor Jerry Brown said the fires were a \"new normal\" because of global warming. This claim was refuted by University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass, who told the Daily Caller, \"Global warming may contribute slightly, but the key factors are mismanaged forests, years of fire suppression, increased population, people living where they should not, invasive flammable species, and the fact that California has always had fire.\"</p><p>This post will focus on the history of forest fires, mismanagement, and suppression and how that impacted the people and industries living near the forests' fires.</p><p>California has Always had Fires</p><p>As Professor Mass stated, California has throughout history had naturally caused fires. Scientists estimate that before Europeans arrived, 4.4 million acres of California burned annually, which is 16 times larger than the amount that burned in 2019.</p><p>California has two separate fire problems. There are the coastal scrub brush fires that include the notorious Santa Ana fires spread by devastating winds. The Sierra Nevada fires are the high-altitude pine forests that are now burning in California and Oregon mountains.</p><p>Mismanaging the Forest</p><p>The mismanagement occurred from decisions made during President Clinton's administration. A combination of listing the Northern Spotted Owl on the endangered specifies list and strong pressure for saving old growth timber by numerous environmental organizations reduced the timber harvest substantially. Worse, it also greatly reduced active management of the forest thinning, prescribed burns and clearing underbrush. As a comparison, the amount of timber harvested from Forest Service land from 1960 until 1990 was an average of 10 million feet each year. Between 1991 and 2000 the harvest was purposely reduced. From 2000 to 2013 the decline was a precipitous - 80 percent.</p><p>Two years ago, in The Daily Caller interview, Bob Zybach, an experienced forester with a Ph.D. in environmental science, described the Forest Service practices up to 1990, \"Mostly fuels were removed through logging, active management which they stopped and grazing. You take away logging, grazing and maintenance, and you get firebombs.\"</p><p>While bad fires still happen on state and private lands, most of the massive blazes happen on or around lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies, Zybach said. Poor management has turned western forests into \"slow-motion time bombs.\"</p><p>Years of Fire Suppression</p><p>For over a century in the West, the general procedure was to stop a forest fire as quickly as possible. \"We have put out fires for 100 years. Now we are paying the price,\" said Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science at UC Berkeley. \"It will take a while to make these forests healthy again. But it's absolutely possible.\" Stephen noted that the Sierra mountains typically had about 40 trees per acre in the early 1800s. Now they have 400 or more, creating heavy brush and thick forests, which explode when ignited.</p><p>Incompetent Federal Government</p><p>The federal government has created dangerous and deadly fires. A century of wrong policies and mismanagement has caused enormous economic damage to hundreds of small lumber producing towns. It has also harmed America by denying the beneficial use of the timber.</p><p>Now, former Governor Jerry Brown and many environmentalists are attempting to connect the fires to climate change, which will greatly exacerbate the government made fire disaster which plagues much of the American West.</p><p>Solution: Sell Most of the Government Lands</p><p>Unfortunately, after a century of incompetent policy and mismanagement, mostly caused by the contradictory demands of environmentalists, it is difficult to believe the federal government will properly pass beneficial legislation that will substantially increase logging, properly thin forests and wisely activate prescribed burns. Therefore, I proffer to sell much of the forest lands for two reasons. First, those of us living in the timber communities of the rural West know which lands are owned by private citizens and which are owned by the Forest Service. Private owners manage and protect their assets by harvesting, thinning and prescribed burns. Second, the federal government with enormous and dangerous debt augmented by the pandemic and lockdowns needs the revenue.</p><p>Selling government-owned forests is a win-win. I will gladly assist any organization that wants to promote selling government forests.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123968291</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X2-8H61-DYTH-G19K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We sent a team up there to help support the operations center, working really closely with the COMLs up there.\"<br/><br/>Supporting first responders fighting blazes in the western part of the U.S. has become expected\u2014particularly in recent years\u2014but Davis described this year\u2019s wildfire landscape as \u201cunprecedented,\" based on some of the new locations needing communications support.<br/><br/>\u201cThis is the first time my East team went to a large forest fire in that part of the country,\" Davis said. \u201cPlaces like Canada and Minnesota just generally don\u2019t have large forest fires that often like the West does. But as things are getting warmer and the climate is changing, we\u2019re seeing that fires are popping up everywhere\u2014I had my team out in North Carolina at a fire about a month ago.<br/><br/>\u201cSo, it\u2019s not just secluded now in the West. We\u2019re seeing it more in other parts of the country, where [wildfires historically] weren\u2019t that big of a threat\u2014they were manageable.\"<br/><br/>Firefighters often work to control and extinguish wildfires in locations where terrestrial wireless coverage is not available, so many of the VRT solutions utilize geosynchronous (GEO) satellite communications with \u201cpublic-safety-grade priority\" to provide backhaul, according to Davis.<br/><br/>\u201cWe can get an average of 30 mbps downlink and 10 mbps uplink,\" he said. \u201cObviously, there will be bursts with more [data throughput] being available.<br/><br/>\u201cThe biggest thing is dealing with latency when you use satellite backhaul\u2014anywhere between 600 and 800 milliseconds\u2014but first responders can do a lot with 30 mbps.\"<br/><br/>Davis said that Verizon is closely monitoring developments in the low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite arena and will consider leveraging that technology in the future. This assessment process include testing of LEO-based offerings from companies like <url normalizedValue=\"https://urgentcomm.com/2021/07/13/lynk-begins-operation-of-next-gen-leo-satellite-plans-to-offer-service-in-2022/\">Lynk</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://urgentcomm.com/2021/04/09/life-saving-technology-ast-spacemobile-ceo-outlines-capabilities-of-direct-to-smartphone-leo-satellite-service/\">AST SpaceMobile</url> , which have announced satellite LTE services that will connect directly to a smartphone, as opposed to requiring the user to deploy a satellite dish or a specialized device, he said.<br/><br/>\u201cI can tell you that we\u2019ve been testing those solutions, and they do work,\" Davis said. \u201cBut I can tell you that, from our perspective, the satellite-dish solutions are still the most reliable.\"<br/><br/>In addition to traditional deployable communications solutions\u2014from those on vehicles to offerings housed in Pelican cases that can be carried by hand to a location\u2014VRTs are using satellite pico cells on trailers (SPOTs) to deliver broadband in a focused area to help support first-responder communications.<br/><br/>\u201cEssentially, we can provide not only a 4G LTE bubble but also a Wi-Fi bubble for\u2014and it depends on the environment\u2014about 6,000 to 7,000 square feet. So, it\u2019s really good for base camps,\" Davis said.<br/><br/>\u201cSince it is enclosed, we also have the capability to have it be like a mini operational command-center\u2014you can fit two or three good-sized adults in there. So, you can turn it into not only an asset that deploys coverage and capacity, but it can also work as kind of a makeshift operations center for a very, very small group.\"<br/><br/>Verizon cannot use the high-power user equipment (HPUE) that is only permitted on the 700 MHz Band 14 spectrum licensed for FirstNet, but VRTs do have some solutions that can be deployed when extra range is needed, Davis said.<br/><br/>\u201cWe do have tools to deploy out in the field when we are in those fringe areas to increase the power and the pull from the macro network,\" he said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically antennas that we can deploy that pull in the signal in these fringe area. So, instead [of experiencing throughputs based on] being 7-10 miles from the network, now it\u2019s like you\u2019re a mile from it. So it significantly increases the upload and download bandwidth capabilities.\"<br/><br/>Verizon also has provided several hundred devices that have been loaned to first responders already this year.<br/><br/>\u201cWe provide a lot of loaner devices, and all of these services are free of charge,\" Davis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t charge first responders\u2014public-safety agencies or federal agencies \u2026 these are loan devices for as long as the first responders need them to achieve the mission in a crisis response.<br/><br/>\u201cWe provide phones. These phones have the capability\u2014if the first responders need it\u2014to have mission-critical PTT capabilities. We also have priority-and-preemption QoS on all of our devices. We also provide Jetpacks [MiFi units] and tablets. We provider off-network laptops for some of these Red Cross shelters, Cradlepoint routers, and panoramic antennas \u2026 to significantly augment the network and provide a better experience.\"<br/><br/>And free VRT communications support is not just limited to agencies that subscribe to Verizon, according to Davis.<br/><br/>\u201cMy team supports all first responders\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a Verizon, AT&amp;T or T-Mobile customer, we\u2019re going to come help you out, if you need it,\" Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to deploy Wi-Fi and, and anybody can jump into a Wi-Fi [network]. They can make Wi-Fi calls, if they\u2019re on another carrier, so they can make phone calls through that. It\u2019s very carrier-agnostic, as well\u2014we have capabilities to provide multiple cellular and Wi-Fi signals.<br/><br/>\u201cIt could be anybody; they could be AT&amp;T FirstNet [subscribers] \u2026 When there\u2019s a time of need or a crisis and there\u2019s a first responder that needs mission-critical communications, we\u2019re going to help them out.\"<br/><br/>Verizon also has its own drone team with certified pilot that can be used to gather video in an incident location, so responders can better understand some of the challenges they may face prior to entering a situation, Davis said. Along with the recent improvements in satellite communications, the rapid evolution of drone and robotics capabilities have had some of the greatest impacts on the support VRTs can provide to response efforts, he said.<br/><br/>\u201cProbably in the last five years, satellite backhaul has been a lot more practical,\" Davis said. \u201cFrom a drone perspective, over the last three or four years, that technology has definitely gotten a lot better.<br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019re able to use thermal sensing on drones now for search-and-rescue missions, where it has the thermal capability to see whether there\u2019s a person or a wild animal out there. Some of that capability just wasn\u2019t around 10 years ago, like it is today.\"<br/><br/>While the VRT focus today is on wildfire response effort, Davis said Verizon officials recognize that communications support also will be needed as public safety agencies try to mitigate the damage caused by hurricanes and tropical storms that typically hit the U.S. during the next few months.<br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing double duty\u2014fighting fires in the West and fighting storms in the South and in the East\u2014this is our gametime,\" Davis said.<br/><br/>\u201cThis is what we live for, and we just feel so honored that we\u2019re able to go out there and help these brave men and women who are out there putting their lives at risk to keep our communities safe. It really is an honor for us to go out there and help these first responders.\"<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MOBRT-608229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MOBRT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637R-SGV1-JBKS-P0XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261825</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Informa Business Media, Inc.

John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, issued the following floor statement, which was published in the Congressional Record on July 27, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Madam President, I come to the floor today to strongly oppose the nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to focus my remarks now on the misleading and false statements that Tracy Stone-Manning has made to the Senate and how they just don't align with the facts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On her committee questionnaire, which is a sworn affidavit that every nominee fills out, the committee clearly asks: Have you ever been investigated?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tracy Stone-Manning said she had not.</p><p>On the same document, she also stated that she testified for a grand jury about an alleged tree spiking. Well, these statements are not true, and Ms. Stone-Manning knows it.</p><p>Tree spiking involves hammering a metal spike, like this one, into the trunk of a tree. Ecoterrorists use spikes like this. This is something they do to prevent loggers from harvesting trees. If a saw blade hits that spike, it destroys the saw, and metal shrapnel flies in every direction. The results can be catastrophic.</p><p>The trees in the Clearwater National Forest were spiked in 1989.</p><p>Individuals were found guilty of this crime, and a local sawmill was damaged as a result of the spikes. Some of the trees standing today are still spiked and can still do damage to loggers and firefighters. These are serious dangers and damages that can occur to people still today.</p><p>If there is a forest fire in the Clearwater National Forest, a smoke jumper may need to cut down trees to slow the spread of the fire. If that person hits a spike with a chain saw, it could kill or maim the firefighter. Worse still, Tracy Stone-Manning knew who the ecoterrorists were, and she could have turned them in at the start.</p><p>In 1989, she edited, typed, and sent this vile, threatening letter to the men and women of the U.S. Forest Service. She did it on behalf of the tree spikers. The letter included lines like:</p><p>You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could get hurt.</p><p>She went on:</p><p>I would be more than willing to pay you a dollar for the sale, but you would have to find me first, and that could be your WORST nightmare.</p><p>Tracy Stone-Manning has said since the incident that she mailed this disturbing, threatening letter to warn people of the danger of the spiked trees. But she didn't go to the authorities. No, she did not.</p><p>She did not go to the police. No, not at all. She took extraordinary steps to ensure that she and the tree spikers would never get caught.</p><p>If she had gone to the police, the Forest Service would have been much better able to identify the spiked trees. Instead, she covered up for the criminals for years. All the while, these trees remain spiked and remain incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Ms. Stone-Manning told our committee that she was never investigated.</p><p>Well, that was a lie. Following the tree spiking in 1989, she was subpoenaed by investigators to provide hair samples, fingerprints, writing samples, and other physical evidence.</p><p>These are criminal investigators. Press articles at the time confirm this fact, as do the court documents obtained by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This is further verified by the letter that our committee received by the lead criminal investigator for the U.S. Forest Service, Mr. Michael Merkley. We received this letter after she had testified in front of the Senate committee a few months ago.</p><p>He wrote:</p><p>. . . the grand jury issued subpoenas for hair samples, handwriting exemplars, and fingerprints. These subpoenas were served on persons suspected of having knowledge of the incident, including Ms. Tracy Stone-Manning.</p><p>But don't take his word for it. Let's listen to the words of Tracy Stone-Manning herself. In a 1990 article about law enforcement's investigation at the University of Montana, she complained about how the investigation made her feel.</p><p>She said:</p><p>It was degrading. It changed my awareness of the power of the government.</p><p>Through this entire period, she did not tell the truth to the investigators. Remember, she knew who spiked the trees. She sent a threatening letter to them. She never went to the police, and she never identified the ecoterrorists. She also didn't cooperate.</p><p>The lead investigator says in his letter that the committee has received since the time she testified to the committee a few months ago--he said:</p><p>Through this initial investigation in 1989, Ms. Stone-Manning was extremely difficult to work with; in fact she was the nastiest of suspects. . . . she was vulgar, antagonistic, and extremely anti-government.</p><p>He goes on to say she refused to comply with the investigation until she learned she would be arrested if she did not.</p><p>But the investigation of Tracy Stone-Manning did not end in 1989 with the subpoenas. In December of 1992, after years of her covering up for the ecoterrorists, she was identified as the one who sent the threatening letter. A woman connected with the group came forward and gave her name to investigators.</p><p>Mr. Merkley writes, again, in this letter we received since Stone-Manning has testified in her committee hearing in the Senate--he writes: [A]s a result of Ms. Lilburn's testimony, the grand jury sent Tracy Stone-Manning a target letter, which meant she was going to be indicted on criminal charges for her active participation in planning these crimes.</p><p>Her lawyer then negotiated an immunity deal. She would testify against the individuals who spiked the trees. And she knew she could have been charged.</p><p>In an interview published in a 1983 article in \"The Missoulian,\" Stone-Manning said that she could have been charged with conspiracy if not for the immunity deal.</p><p>Remember, she told the Senate she had never been investigated. She was subpoenaed for physical evidence. She was investigated. She didn't cooperate with investigators. She complained to the press about being investigated, and she covered up for the ecoterrorists for years until she was caught. But that wasn't her only lie. On our committee's questionnaire for the record, I asked her:</p><p>Did you have personal knowledge of, participate in, or in any way directly or indirectly support activities associated with the spiking of trees in any forest during your lifetime?</p><p>In any forest during your lifetime?</p><p>She responded:</p><p>No.</p><p>Everyone knows that is a lie. She sent their letter. She knew who they were. She supported their activities. The lead investigator's letter makes clear she knew the plan to spike the trees in the Idaho forest in advance.</p><p>He wasn't the only one--this lead criminal investigator wasn't the only one to say she knew so in advance. One of the convicted tree spikers, one of the people who went to jail in this episode, he told E&amp;E News--again, since the hearing and since the letter has come out, just in the last couple weeks, the convicted tree spiker says: \"She knew about it far in advance, a couple of months before we headed out.\"</p><p>He continued: \"She had agreed to mail the letter well in advance.\"</p><p>To be clear, after Tracy Stone-Manning had her confirmation hearing here in the Senate earlier this year, two people with direct knowledge came forward. One was the cop--the criminal investigator who investigated the crime. The other was the criminal who was convicted.</p><p>Both the cop and the criminal say she lied.</p><p>Ms. Stone-Manning helped plan the tree spiking. She knew about it in advance. She sent a threatening letter to the Forest Service. She was investigated. She collaborated with ecoterrorists. She lied to the Senate.</p><p>Lying to the U.S. Senate has consequences. In this case, her actions and her lies should cost her this nomination.</p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

That sounds a little bit like clickbait, but it's true- at least, according to the Doomsday Clock.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Doomsday clock was created in 1945 after the development of nuclear weapons. It's a theoretical clock whose hands move closer or further away from \"midnight,\" which represents Doomsday, or the so-called end of the world. The clock is managed by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The hands of the Doomsday clock move based on careful research and analysis conducted by the, \"Bulletin's Science and Security Board in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 13 Nobel laureates,\" according to the Bulletin's 2020 Doomsday Report by John Mecklin. This clock has been the measure of the status of the world for nearly 75 years, and never has it been this close to midnight.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Previously, the closest the clock had been to midnight was two minutes. It was two minutes to midnight in 1953, during the cold war. The clock was moved to two minutes to midnight once again in 2017 due to issues facing humanity due to climate change, and also the buildup of nuclear weapons programs and the devolution of international treaties. Never has the clock been so close- 1.67 minutes to midnight.</p><p>History lesson over. Now that we all have the background information, I can delve into the issue. How does it feel? How does it feel to be barely 20 years old and know that the world is closer to destroying itself than it has been in the past 75 years? I don't know. It makes the world feel so small and delicate- as though all the issues (climate change, politics, etc.) that made them move the hands of the clock are small enough to fit in my palm. My world feels delicate, and it makes me feel delicate too.</p><p>But I mean, it's not as if when the imaginary hands get to midnight, everything will just blink out of existence. Right? Probably. The problem with the apocalypse is that even though I feel like I can see it coming, I don't know how it's going to kill me. The whole concept of a Doomsday almost feels like a ploy from a cheap B-horror movie.</p><p>I've had too many conversations lately about the Doomsday Clock. I've had so many conversations about life and death, and different historical examples of how people have reacted to the belief that everyone was going to die (the plague, the world wars, famine). What am I supposed to say about the fact that we might die?\u00a0</p><p>It would be different, I think, if I couldn't see everything that was going on. Almost easier to ignore the whole issue, if say I had never seen a forest fire, or an animal that had starved to death, or the aftermath of a bombing. But I have seen those things, either through my own eyes, or someone's camera lens, and there is no denying, no matter how hard some people try, there is no denying the fact that the planet is dying and that we're all killing it.\u00a0</p><p>I've spent a lot of time writing about hope, because I really believe in that quotation from Inherit the Wind, that, \"it is the duty of a newspaper to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\" I've worked at trying to be positive and trying to think of ways to bring hope and light. But it's 100 seconds to midnight, and it's getting dark outside.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4504794</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5W-5HM1-DY7P-T29B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Brunswickan: University of New Brunswick</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Criminal Law &amp; Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzc1Q0RCQzU5OUE3NDlFMjhFNUQ0Q0ZERTdGRDU3NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTQ1RDlFQ0RGMjE3NDE2Q0I1NDFDNDgzNzBBNjQ0MTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G8D</classCode><className>NUCLEAR SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001226</classCode><className>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp; ARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOJW</classCode><className>WEAPONS RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000A4QF</classCode><className>COLD WAR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000695</classCode><className>FAMINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST0009RCL</classCode><className>NOBEL PRIZES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001758</classCode><className>TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009VNP</classCode><className>HORROR FILMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001226</classCode><className>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOJW</classCode><className>WEAPONS RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000695</classCode><className>FAMINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009VNP</classCode><className>HORROR FILMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS170</classCode><className>NEW BRUNSWICK, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Students were invited to submit their ideas to improve the world by providing solutions for problems within the areas of education, health, humanitarian challenges, sustainability and climate change. The challenge is organized by the Nittany AI Alliance, a service of Penn State Outreach.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New to the challenge this year is a collaboration with Penn State University Libraries. Cynthia Vitale, department head of research informatics and publishing in Penn State University Libraries, said faculty librarians and staff will be working with the student teams to find relevant data and other resources to help build and optimize the AI models and work to eliminate potential bias.</p><p>\"We are excited by this collaboration as it brings library expertise for finding and evaluating resources into the program,\" Vitale said. \"Finding and evaluating data can be a tricky point in developing these models as it is important to consider any biases and ethical considerations inherent in the data source prior to using it.\"</p><p>Teams selected represent eight different academic colleges, including the Smeal College of Business, College of the Liberal Arts, College of Engineering, College of Information Sciences and Technology, College of Health and Human Development, College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, the Eberly College of Science, and the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications, as well as six Penn State campuses, including Hershey, Harrisburg, Berks, Great Valley, Altoona and University Park. Their ideas include:</p><p>* ADHD Proposal: use of AI for earlier diagnosis in children.</p><p>* Aidly: use of AI to assist nonprofits in volunteer outreach.</p><p>* Ailee: AI-powered lecture engagement enhancer.</p><p>* Applications of computer vision toward search and rescue.</p><p>* ARFind: a real-time augmented reality smart navigation system for visually impaired individuals.</p><p>* AI to assist radiologists in diagnoses with convolutional neural networks.</p><p>* Bloom: connecting farmers to wholesalers in developing countries.</p><p>* Clinical trial design success prediction model and design suggestion tool.</p><p>* Comments for Consideration: the use of AI to combat cyberbullying.</p><p>* DACTR: Depression Advisory Correctional Therapy Rehabilitation.</p><p>* Energy Solutions.</p><p>* Fast Insights: video-to-text summarizer.</p><p>* Forest Fire Prevention AI.</p><p>* Insight: predicting demand from historical data using deep learning time series model.</p><p>* Insurance Compatibility Assistant.</p><p>* MedArmor: Genetic and AI-based diagnosis and medical cost estimation.</p><p>* NittanyLink, rethinking group work.</p><p>* Nyansapo, increase literacy rates in African countries.</p><p>* TechCycle, a recycling program for Penn State.</p><p>* Vessel: machine learning model of the vascular network to detect tumors and accelerate advances in artificial tissue growth.</p><p>\"We received an impressive number of proposals describing incredibly innovative visions of how AI can improve our world, truly showcasing the innovative spirit and ambition of Penn State students,\" said Brad Zdenek, innovation strategist for the Nittany AI Alliance. \"We are proud to play a role in helping launch these 20 transformational ideas and excited to work with the teams throughout 2020 as they move their proposals into reality.\"</p><p>All 20 teams will have an opportunity to present a prototype on April 1 at the Flex Theatre in the HUB-Robeson Center as part of Penn State Startup Week. After the demonstrations, 10 teams will be selected to receive additional funding to turn their prototype into a minimal viable product.</p><p>For more information about the Nittany AI Challenge and other AI workshops and events, visit the Nittany AI Alliance online (<url normalizedValue=\"https://nittanyai.psu.edu/?utm_source=penn%20state%20news&amp;utm_medium=news%20story&amp;utm_campaign=nittany%20ai%20challenge&amp;utm_content=news\">https://nittanyai.psu.edu/?utm_source=penn%20state%20news&amp;utm_medium=news%20story&amp;utm_campaign=nittany%20ai%20challenge&amp;utm_content=news</url>).

They point towards prevention measures that can be taken through governance, planning and forest management, and outline how EU Member States can access EU funding for wildfire resilience and work together at EU level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forests are necessary for biodiversity, climate and water regulation, the provision of food, medicines and materials, carbon sequestration and storage, soil stabilisation and the purification of air and water. We have to protect, restore and manage forests sustainably, as they are crucial for our lives and livelihoods.</p><p>In recent years, the impact of wildfires on people and nature has increased. The new guidance looks at interconnected factors behind this increase, and provides an overview of existing principles and experiences on managing landscapes, forests and woodlands that can save lives.</p><p>The European Green Deal announced a new EU Forest Strategy for 2021 to ensure effective afforestation, and forest preservation and restoration in Europe. This will help to reduce the incidence and extent of wildfires. The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030 also aims to contribute to the EU and its Member States being adequately equipped to prevent and respond to major wildfires, which seriously damage forest biodiversity. The new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change puts emphasis on the need to strengthen the resilience of forests and includes several actions to support this objective. Climate change is already damaging Europe's forests directly and indirectly through fires, droughts and unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks. Such impacts are likely to increase in the future.</p><p>Wildfire risks can be successfully addressed through better management and land-use planning. Mitigating wildfire risks requires looking at land management to ensure that the structure, composition and use of forests, woodland and other vegetation landscapes are more resistant and resilient against wildfires. Citizens also need to be informed and educated about wildfires. The Commission provides funding for such education actions and facilitates cooperation and the coordination of joint responses.</p><p>In addition, the Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed country profiles under the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS) to support wildfire management and disaster risk reduction globally and in particular in Latin America and the Caribbean. This work is part of the EU's comprehensive approach to support conservation and sustainable development of Amazon forests. There are at present more than 50 EU programmes on this regional priority, and the new budget for global Europe will also cover a specific Amazon strategy, coordinated with EU Member States.</p><p>Reactions by Members of the College</p><p>Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal Frans Timmermans said: \"Trees are our allies in the fight against the climate and biodiversity crisis. A tree helps purify the air, cools cities, and takes up CO2. Humans already put enormous pressure on the world's forests, and wildfires are an additional threat. With the risk of wildfires exacerbated by rising temperatures and increasing droughts, stronger forest protection, better prevention and faster responses are crucial.\"</p><p>Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevicius, said: \"Forest ecosystems are home to 80% of the world's known terrestrial plants and animals, and their destruction puts us all at risk. Wildfires are an increasingly growing threat to forests and humans and in this new context, prevention and cooperation are our most important tools. I am convinced that these guidelines can create a more effective response with great benefits for people, and the nature we depend on.\"</p><p>Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel, said: \"Wildfires can have catastrophic consequences on the environment and on people. The country profiles designed by the Joint Research Centre will contribute to the risk assessment and mitigation of this danger, proving how science can help improve and protect lives and our planet.\"</p><p>Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic said: \"The fires in the Amazon region and globally were unprecedented in their destruction over the last years. The Global Wildfire Information System is therefore crucial to provide information on fire danger and burnt areas globally. Monitoring tools such as the Global Wildfire Information System help the Commission to have all information at hand to coordinate the EU response, and protect lives, livelihoods and the environment\".</p><p>Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen said: \"We stand ready to work together with our partners towards more effective wildfire prevention. This work requires sharing of knowledge on sustainable forest management techniques, adapted to local needs, as well as restoration of forests. The World's forests are indispensable for biodiversity, climate and for us humans; we need to respect and protect ecosystems that give us so much, also in terms of jobs and livelihoods. With the Green Deal, we aim to ensure the preservation of healthy forests for future generations.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background</p><p>In recent years, wildfires have had an enormous impact on Europe's natural capital, economy, and its people, from South to North and East to West. The causes behind these recent trends are complex, and they include climate change, land-management changes, social patterns such as rural abandonment and urban expansion, changing cultural traditions and leisure behaviours, as well as sub-optimal fire management policies.</p><p>New scenarios of global climate change also show a potential increase in the occurrence of so-called catastrophic fires, i.e. wildfires that are too severe to be put out. In response to these alarming trends, greater attention should be given to land-based fire prevention practices as part of integrated fire management.</p><p>The JRC's country profiles provide information on the geographic distribution of wildfires, burnt areas and emissions, and assess wildfire regimes and impacts at country and sub-country level worldwide. They enable a global assessment of wildfire risk and mitigation of the effects of wildfires on land degradation, deforestation, or biomass burning emissions. The Global Wildfire Information System builds on the European Forest Fire Information System of Copernicus, and is being further developed together with Group on Earth Observations and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in close collaboration with the United Nations.

Unfortunately, people are spreading this rumor and it is causing problems,' they wrote.What's more, the FBI has even released a statement explaining the rumors regarding antifa arsonists are untrue.'FBI Portland and local law enforcement agencies have been receiving reports that extremists are responsible for setting wildfires in Oregon. With our state and local partners, the FBI has investigated several such reports and found them to be untrue,' tweeted the FBI[8].Unfortunately, it seems Joe Rogan never got the memo. Joe Rogan caught parroting fake newsJoe Rogan lies to his millions of listeners that left-wing activists are starting forest fires in Oregon. This dangerous claim has been completely debunked. pic.twitter.com/qbNK9GQB9h[9] \u2014 Alex Paterson (@AlexPattyy) September 17, 2020[10];Despite numerous reports that claims of antifa arson are nothing more than rumors, Joe Rogan seems to have bought into the fake news. Unfortunately, this dovetails into Rogan's recent willingness to buy into conspiracy theories and curmudgeonly viewpoints against 'political correctness.''They've arrested people for lighting forest fires up there. They've arrested left-wing people for lighting these forest fires, air-quote 'activists.' This is also something that's not being widely reported, you know, that people have actually been arrested for lighting fires up there,' claimed Rogan during a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience.Unfortunately , it seems as if Rogan didn't have Jamie on hand to fact-check this one. Spotify employees struggle with transphobic contentJoe Rogan | Michael Schwartz/WireImage Meanwhile, Joe Rogan's Spotify deal hasn't been going over as smoothly as the comedian might have hoped. Various episodes including interviews with alt-right talking heads have been scrubbed from the catalogue.However, Spotify employees are currently struggling within the company to have additional episodes removed, specifically ones featuring transphobia. Spotify has decided to keep the episodes up.'Others have concerns specifically over a recent episode. And Joe Rogan and the episode in question have been reviewed extensively. The fact that we aren't changing our position doesn't mean we aren't listening. It just means we made a different judgment call,' said Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.

Like Germany, California's renewables are becoming an increasing share in intermittent electricity generation, but at a HIGH COST. Power prices in Germany are among the highest in Europe.</p><p>California's high cost of electricity is already fifty percent higher than the national average for residents, and double the national averages for commercial, and are projected to go even higher. The inability to replace the closure of continuously uninterruptable electricity from nuclear and natural gas power plants with intermittent electricity from renewables of industrial wind and solar is causing the state to import more and more of its electricity.</p><p>California is proud of being the only state in America that imports more electricity than any other state, now at 32 percent. With the state having no plans to replace the capacity of the recent three natural gas power plants that were shuttered in 2018 and the upcoming five power plant closures (four natural gas and one nuclear) with in-state intermittent electricity from wind and solar, California will need to increase its imports of high-priced electricity from the Northwest and Southwest to fill the void, and let residents and businesses pay the premium.</p><p>Germany tried to step up as a leader on climate change, by phasing out nuclear and natural gas power plants, and pioneered a system of subsidies for industrial wind and solar that sparked a global boom in manufacturing those technologies. Germany is failing to meet its climate goals of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions even after spending over $580 billion by 2025 to overhaul its energy systems. Germany's emissions miss should be a \"wake-up call\" for governments everywhere, but Governor Newsom has yet to wake up.</p><p>Not only has the shuttering of four gas plants been deferred to a later time, but the zero-emission generating plant at PGandE's Nuclear 2,160 megawatt plant at Diablo Canyon to be shuttered in 2024 remains on schedule. The Diablo plant supplies zero emission electricity to 3 million households.</p><p>The four gas plants, that are part of the fossil fuel arsenal, that were given a shuttering deferral for the time being, to allow them to continue providing continuous and uninterruptable generated electricity are:</p><p>The 310 mw Natural Gas Power Plant at Redondo Beach, that was scheduled to be shuttered in 2023.</p><p>The 823 mw Natural Gas Power Plant at Scattergood in Playa Del Rey, that was scheduled to be shuttered in 2024.</p><p>The 575 mw Natural Gas Power Plant at Haynes in Long Beach, that was scheduled to be shuttered in 2029.</p><p>The 472 mw Natural Gas Power Plant at Wilmington, that was scheduled to be shuttered in 2029.</p><p>Until the 2020 summer, California utilities and grid operators were able to purchase extra electricity from the Southwest and Northwest, but when the heat wave stretches from Texas to Oregon there is little available to make up for California's power shortage.</p><p>By continuously shuttering in-state power plants, the state will need to import more high-priced electricity from the Southwest and Northwest to fill the void as the states continues to support the disparate cost effects onto the poorer, less educated residents of all races and ethnicities, resulting from importing electricity at premium rates.</p><p>As California fires rage, nobody is taking responsibility for the unlimited \"fuel\" for the fires. Rather than addressing ways to reduce the amount of \"fuel\" awaiting the next spark, homeless campfire, gender reveal, or lightning strike, California's Governor Newsom's solution is for more litigation and a reorganization of a utility company to prevent devastating wildfires.</p><p>It's a shared responsibility of all parties as to why we've accumulated so much fuel for a fire and continue to allow its growth. Year after year, Democrats have supported environmentalists who have litigated and lobbied to stop efforts to clear the forests through timber harvesting, underbrush removal, and controlled burns.</p><p>California has forbid forest management, and builders continue to build wood tinder box homes adjacent to the stockpile of \"fuel\" for any fires in the forest, and homeowners do very little to fireproof their homes sitting amongst all that \"fuel\" for the fire.</p><p>In addition to promoting the growth of fuel for the next forest fire, the dysfunctional energy plan to \"leak\" emissions to other states for California's electricity needs, to help achieve in-state emission reductions, is also based on the hopes that other states will be able to generate enough to replace the shuttered California power plants and will have the extra capacity to add to the grid!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123958574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W0-GB91-JCBF-S2JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 18, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Although today she acknowledges that a solution will require a collective effort, she's found that education may be one of the best ways to tackle the issue.</p><p>Alongside a team of researchers from NASA and Google, Goldberg has created an educational program called Cloud to Classroom that uses satellite imagery to make the science of global climate and environmental change simpler and more accessible.</p><p>\"Climate change is really hard for many students to understand through just statistics and news articles,\" Goldberg said. \"But when we give them satellite images showing trends like ice melt and forest fire, it becomes a lot easier for them to visualize local to global climate impacts.\"</p><p>For the past year, Goldberg has been busy launching and promoting Cloud to Classroom at conferences and trainings for teachers and students, with the hope that they will implement the program in their curriculums. The project is the result of a years-long effort by Goldberg to better understand climate change using satellite technology an effort that started when she was just 14 years old and working at NASA.</p><p>Today, Goldberg is a Stanford frosh with plans to double major in computer science and Earth systems. Although studying remotely from her home in Maryland wasn't ideal, she's made the most of the opportunity and is confident that her Stanford training will make her a better scientist. She will be on campus this quarter.</p><p>\"It's been quite the quarter, but I loved all my classes,\" she said. \"I've learned so much in those 10 weeks, and I'm excited to see what else Stanford has to offer.</p><p>Cloud to Classroom</p><p>Cloud to Classroom is a series of apps that feature satellite images taken by such space agencies as NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). These agencies have thousands of satellites orbiting Earth, each with its own purpose, including measuring climate activity or Earth's physical dynamics.</p><p>To see environmental change over time, these satellites monitor the pulses of light emitted from different landscapes and objects on Earth's surface a process called remote sensing. With this data, researchers can then calculate ratios in wave-lengths of the reflected light.</p><p>\"Using the energy emitted from these landscapes, we're able to track how vegetation is changing over time, because healthy vegetation and unhealthy vegetation reflect radiation differently,\" Goldberg said. \"By measuring those changes in energy emissions, we're also able to track trends like urbanization and deforestation.\"</p><p>Researchers are able to access these satellite data for free using Google Earth Engine, a data platform for remote sensing analysis.</p><p>Goldberg and her fellow researchers introduced Cloud to Classroom last year at a conference in Lisbon, Portugal, for science educators. They've since traveled to cities worldwide to host trainings for teachers and students. Those trainings are now taking place online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They expect soon to go live with an official website where students and teachers can access the apps for free.</p><p>\"The long-term goal is to reach as many students as possible,\" Goldberg said. \"We're looking to expand our work to several Latin American nations in the coming years.\"</p><p>Working at NASA</p><p>Goldberg's work on Cloud to Classroom began several years ago when she was growing up in Columbia, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. While presenting her work at a local science fair when she was in 8th grade, Goldberg caught the attention of one of the judges who worked at NASA and encouraged her to join the organization as an intern. She was just 14.</p><p>In high school, she would spend the first half of the day at school, before heading off to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where she joined a team studying mangrove loss using satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine. Mangroves, which are one of Earth's most valuable ecosystems because of their carbon-capture potential, have been in dramatic decline in recent decades.</p><p>\"We're working to create a system to monitor not only where mangroves are being lost, but also the primary drivers of that loss,\" Goldberg said. Their findings were recently published in the scientific journal Global Change Biology. Goldberg is still working with NASA.</p><p>Feeling lucky to see Earth from a new perspective using satellite images to study mangroves, Goldberg wanted to share the experience with other students. So she approached members of the Google Earth Engine team in Mountain View with the idea of creating Cloud to Classroom.</p><p>\"I just reached out to them and said, 'What if we put these satellite technologies in the hands of not only scientists and researchers, but also the next generation?'\"\" she said.</p><p>For her work on Cloud to Classroom, Goldberg was awarded a National Geographic Young Explorer's Grant, which she's put toward further developing the program. She's hopeful that as it is integrated into more science curriculums, the chances of beating climate change will improve.</p><p>\"The more students understand the science and impacts of climate change, the more quickly we can spread public awareness and jointly work toward climate solutions in the future,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124178472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61PF-CG01-DYTH-G4SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 31, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Year after year, Democrats have supported environmentalists who have litigated and lobbied to stop efforts to clear the forests through timber harvesting, underbrush removal, and controlled burns.</p><p>California has forbid forest management, and builders continue to build wood tinder box homes adjacent to the stockpile of \"fuel\" for any fires in the forest, and homeowners do very little to fireproof their homes sitting amongst all that \"fuel\" for the fire.</p><p>In addition to promoting the growth of fuel for the next forest fire, the dysfunctional energy plan to \"leak\" emissions to other states for California's electricity needs, to help achieve in-state emission reductions, is also based on the hopes that other states will be able to generate enough to replace the shuttered California power plants and will have the extra capacity to add to the grid!</p><p>The article Newsom Vows To Fast Track Toward Germany's Failed Climate Goals - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-184714212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VH-08N1-F11P-X0V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 16, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

Forest Service Photo/John Merager</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As wildfires, or \"bushfires\", burn throughout Australia, the USDA Forest Service and U.S. Department of the Interior continue to deploy wildfire personnel to assist with fire suppression efforts. The two departments have sent more than 200 firefighters since November of 2019.</p><p>The Fire year began in Australia in late July, with 2019 marking the country's hottest and driest year on record. Over the last 20 years, drought and severe temperatures have significantly increased on the continent, resulting in larger megafires, more acres burned, extreme fire behavior and longer periods of burning.</p><p>In late November, the National Resource Sharing Centre (NRCS), part of the Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council requested U.S. support to help with critical wildfire and aviation shortfalls in New South Wales and Victoria.</p><p>\"It was humbling to observe the Australians' resilience, the response in Australia, and level of support from our agency,\" said Forest Service Director of Fire and Aviation Management Shawna Legarza. \"We will continue to learn from each other in this complex fire environment.\"</p><p>The Forest Service anticipates the U.S. will provide additional support for as long as our Australian partners need us to assist in containing the ongoing and new wildfires. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) has received requests from the NRCS for several Type 1 Incident Management Teams, which are self-contained teams recognized for their robust training and experience managing large, complex wildland fire incidents. NIFC has also responded to the request for hot shot crews and a variety of specialized firefighting personnel. These personnel are from multiple land management agencies including the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park's Service, the National Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the U.S. Forest Service.</p><p>The Forest Service has had an ongoing relationship with Australia and New Zealand since the 1950s through joint efforts and coordination between the North American Forest Commission, Fire Management Working Group (US, Canada and Mexico) and the Forest Fire Management Group (Australia and New Zealand). Bilateral Study Tours between the two countries began in 1951, but the first mobilization between the US and Australia/New Zealand occurred in 2000 when 96 fire management personnel from Australia and New Zealand were deployed to the US. The first mobilization of fire management personnel to Australia was in January 2003.</p><p>NIFC is the nation's focal point for overseeing all coordination activities for wildland fire and other incidents throughout the U.S. The center is comprised of eight different agencies and organizations: The Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Association of State Foresters, and U.S. Fire Administration.</p><p>The Forest Service holds a well-established leadership role in forest management. By working to promote sustainable forest management globally, it helps address important issues such as, illegal logging, habitat protection for migratory species and of course fire management on National Forest System land, as well as on land under the jurisdiction of other Federal, tribal, state and local agencies when needed.</p><p>During this devastating time, we reflect on the key Forest Service value of interdependence; how we depend on each other to mitigate wildfire risk and provide safety to the communities we serve, and shared stewardship; because fire knows no boundaries.

However, the United States under President Donald Trump has announced plans to withdraw from that pact.</p><p>The study analyzed historical weather data from thermometers and rain gauges to conclude that \"the risk of extreme wildfire conditions during autumn has more than doubled across California over the past four decades,\" according to an April 2 news release about the findings. Additionally, the researchers used many climate model simulations from worldwide government research centers that indicated human-caused global warming has made the observed extreme wildfire preconditions more likely.</p><p>California's recent wildfires \"have garnered widespread attention, with an especially high level of interest from policymakers and emergency responders seeking to understand the multiple contributors to the increase in wildfire disasters,\" according to the study, titled \"Climate change is increasing the risk of extreme autumn wildfire conditions across California.\"</p><p>The study notes that \"Quantitative assessments of changing wildfire risk factors have thus become critical as California moves beyond the initial stages of short-term disaster recovery and begins to develop risk mitigation, land management, and resource allocation strategies.\"</p><p>\"The consequences are not restricted to California,\" the news release says, noting that California's recent autumn wildfires coincided with the onset of wildfires in Australia, creating a strain on limited global resources that the U.S. and other countries have shared by sending people and equipment between the northern and southern hemispheres.</p><p>One of the study's findings is that \"hotspots\" for extreme wildfires exist in areas with vegetation that differs from California's. The finding \"strongly suggests that -- at least from an extreme fire weather perspective -- the direct influence of climate change on wildfire risk is not limited to California's forested regions, and instead extends across a diverse range of microclimates and ecoregions as long as fuel abundance is not limiting,\" the study notes.</p><p>\"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could further strain emergency resources, including impeding efforts to prepare for the upcoming summer and autumn seasons that are likely to be intensified by low spring snowpack and a dry winter in northern California,\" the release says.</p><p>Echoing that concern, Arizona's Department of Forestry and Fire Management, which is preparing for the impending fire season, has said that the spread of coronavirus is forcing the state's firefighters to take extra protective steps, including daily temperature checks and social distancing in fire camps, an article on the news site Patch reported.</p><p>Ahead of the coming wildfire season, the Environmental Defense Fund also expressed concerns that increasing wildfire activities that produce particulate matter could increase the incidence and severity of disease caused by the COVID-19 virus.</p><p>The senior author of the new study, Stanford professor Noah Diffenbaugh, who has served as a U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group lead author, said, \"Many factors influence wildfire risk, but this study shows that long-term warming, coupled with decreasing autumn precipitation, is already increasing the odds of the kinds of extreme fire weather conditions that have proved so destructive in both northern and southern California in recent years.\"</p><p>The study notes that a broad portfolio of options to deal with the wildfire threats already exists, \"including the use of prescribed burning to reduce fuel loads and improve ecosystem health, upgrades to emergency communications and response systems, community-level development of protective fire breaks and defensible space, and the adoption of new zoning rules and building codes to promote fire-resilient construction.\"</p><p>The study comes as GreenpeaceRussia, citing satellite images, told Reuters that a huge forest fire in Ukraine that has been raging for more than a week was within 0.6 miles from the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant and poses a radiation risk, according to an April 13 Reuters article. Although under control, the Ukraine threat underscored the additional interconnected risks climate and wildfires can pose.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALEPA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALEPA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT3-MN81-DY0P-G1T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Cal/EPA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 1, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Energy &amp;

It's so bad that it even broke the vacuum NASA designed to clean the Moon dust off Apollo spacesuits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With NASA's return to the Moon and its orbit, it will need to manage the dust, which is dangerous for people too. The first step is knowing how much is around at any given time. Efforts to do just that are already paying off on Earth, in the fight against air pollution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apollo missions struggled to deal with damage done by lunar dust. It clogged the camera equipment and scratched helmet visors so badly that astronauts had difficulty seeing. During the Apollo 17 mission, astronaut Harrison Schmitt described his reaction to breathing in the dust as \"lunar hay fever,\" experiencing sneezing, watery eyes, and a sore throat. The symptoms went away, but concern for human health is a driving force behind NASA's extensive research into all forms of lunar soil, called regolith.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sensitive tissues such as the lungs and corneas can be damaged by lunar dust trapped inside a habitat. While air filtration can remove a great deal of the tiny particles, an air-quality sensor is necessary to ensure the controls are effective.</p><p>This was one focus of NASA's Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program. Through NextSTEP, the agency issued a series of documents detailing specific needs for a future lunar habitation and inviting private industry to help overcome obstacles to future lunar missions. One of these needs was for air revitalization and monitoring, including a way to measure lunar dust in surface and orbiting habitats.</p><p>Lunar Outpost Inc. was founded in Denver in 2017 with the goal of developing technologies for lunar exploration and then adapting them for use on Earth. Based on the specifications laid out in NextSTEP documents, the company developed an air-quality sensor it called the Space Canary.</p><p>Lunar Outpost offered the sensor to Lockheed Martin Space, which was one of several companies to successfully bid on a NextSTEP public-private partnership to build lunar orbit habitat prototypes for testing. Lockheed agreed, bringing Lunar Outpost on as a contributor to tweak the Space Canary to NASA's needs.</p><p>After the device was integrated into the environmental control system, it provided distinct advantages over traditional equipment. Rebranded Canary-S (Solar), it's now filling a need for low-cost, wireless air-quality and meteorlogical monitoring on this planet.</p><p>It Starts with Dust</p><p>Here on Earth, particulate matter is a form of air pollution generated by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and burning fossil fuels, among other processes. The particles, a mix of liquid and solid, are tiny, much smaller than a grain of sand. This kind of pollution causes myriad health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and contributes to numerous environmental issues, including climate change.</p><p>Off-world, particulate matter could pose similar health risks. And the mechanical systems designed to protect astronauts, such as air filtration, can be damaged by the abrasive nature of the dust.</p><p>\"We are still learning about techniques to mitigate dust intrusion into the crew habitable areas and how to remove it,\" said Tracy Gill, project engineer for the Mission and Commercial Support Office at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. \"Having a measurement system like Lunar Outpost demonstrated would help us understand the environment the crew is experiencing and help us to keep within the recommended exposure limits.\"</p><p>The Canary and the Mine School</p><p>The Canary-S is a self-contained unit powered by solar energy and a battery that transmits data using cellular technology. It can measure a variety of pollutants, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds, among others. The device is constantly taking measurements and sends a message up to a secure cloud every minute, where it's routed either to Lunar Outpost's web-based dashboard or a customer's database for viewing and analysis.</p><p>The sensors and software are flexible, making customization simple.</p><p>\"Nowadays, everybody's so used to plug-and-play,\" said Chris Cloutier, habitation design and integration lead at Kennedy, so having that flexibility is \"a key capability.\"</p><p>Proving the sensors' accuracy on Earth, however, can be difficult. The devices exceeded NASA requirements for the habitat prototype, but outdoor readings are trickier because they're influenced by wind and humidity.</p><p>The Canary-S had some support with that in the form of a recent study by the Payne Institute for Public Policy of the Colorado School of Mines. The independent verification of the technology validated the accuracy of the sensor readings for both daily and long-term measurements.</p><p>Supporting Firefighters, Emissions Controls</p><p>The Canary-S is deployed in 15 states and across numerous industries. One customer is the U.S. Forest Service, which is using the Canary-S to monitor forest-fire emissions in real-time.</p><p>\"Firefighters have been exhibiting symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning for decades. They thought it was just part of the job,\" explained Julian Cyrus, COO of Lunar Outpost. But the sensors revealed where and when carbon monoxide levels \"were sky high,\" making it possible to issue warnings to take the necessary precautions.</p><p>The same devices can measure the particulate matter in urban areas. Evidence of poor air quality can trigger alerts warning people, especially those with respiratory conditions, to take necessary precautions. The city of Denver chose the Canary sensor to collect air-quality data at local schools to educate and inform teachers, parents, and students about their local air quality. The data quantified the benefits of a no-idle campaign near schools and provided general emissions pollution in key sites around the city.</p><p>In the oil and gas industry, the sensors can help provide evidence for how effective environmental controls are, explained Charles Losche, senior manager of growth and policy for Project Canary. The company deploys Canary-S sensors to provide continuous, real-time monitoring of fugitive gas emissions.</p><p>That data can help justify the cost of those controls, said Losche, who noted that without the readings, the oil and gas producers \"had no way to prove their efforts are reducing their impact on the environment.\"</p><p>Additionally, sensor readings make it possible to determine if a spike in hydrocarbons such as volatile organic compounds or methane is coming from the facility or a truck driving past. If it's a mechanical malfunction in the facility, a repair crew is dispatched.</p><p>Cyrus, who previously worked on the Orion spacecraft as an employee at Lockheed, recognized NASA as a driving force behind the company's work to develop dual-purpose technology for use on the Moon and Earth. In addition to studying a wealth of lunar data when designing the sensor, the NextSTEP program made the opportunity to work with NASA a reality.</p><p>\"Supporting the private-public partnership is going to create a sustainable presence on the Moon,\" Cyrus said. \"Establishing that approach is one of the most important things that NASA has done over the last few years.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202105262313415186</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62SF-0W51-DYJG-N1SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1215\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 27, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC000275Z</classCode><className>LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Labor Day weekend brought record-breaking temperatures across the state that exacerbated what already are drought conditions in a large swath of the state.</p><p>On Thursday,\u00a0a Northern California wildfire was threatening thousands of homes\u00a0after winds whipped it into a monster that incinerated houses in a small mountain community and killed at least three people.</p><p>University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot, dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are \"the highest seen in at least four decades\" across major parts of the West.</p><p>The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy, which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume, \"creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm,\" Flannigan said.</p><p>The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus, which may or may not produce lightning, and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze.</p><p>An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented \"firenado,\" killing a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding.</p><p>Yet just this month a fire north of Lake Tahoe spun off at least two and as many as four firenadoes, while the Plumas National Forest fire appears to have produced \"a handful\" overnight Tuesday, said Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p><p>The Creek Fire produced at least two firenadoes that appeared to touch down Saturday, he said, one straddling an access road to a popular campground at Mammoth Pool Reservoir where 214 people became trapped.</p><p>\"It's really kind of a testament to the remarkable extremes that we're seeing right now,\" Lareau said. \"It really is kind of this vicious cycle that it gets into, and that's when the fire really takes off and becomes these unstoppable infernos.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-9826651</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TG-KX01-F039-F017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The characters become familiar enough to hook your attention while remaining mysterious enough to keep it - perhaps this explains the growing trend of adapting children's shows for mature audiences. It is this idea that serves as the bedrock of the highly-controversial show \"Riverdale\" and the much-loved series \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,\" both of which are often talked about albeit for largely different reasons: one is infamous for its gross sensationalism while the other is famous for its addictive weirdness, wit, and dark, fantastical world-building. Accordingly, it was evident from its trailer that \"Fate: The Winx Saga,\" a mature Netflix adaptation of a children's cartoon featuring elementally and racially diverse fairies, had the potential for the same greatness and obsession, whether that be through adopting some of the ridiculous shock value that keeps \"Riverdale\" relevant, or mirroring \"CAOS\" with a delicious diegesis of its own. Disappointingly, it does neither very well. And while the show does have its share of enjoyable scenes, the overall quality of the series fluctuates so much - even within episodes - to the point where its shortcomings become too obvious to excuse.</p><p/><p>For one, the show has an overall feeling of \"unfinishedness\" that could have been alleviated by the show's creators spending more time to achieve a binge-worthy final product. There's a mix of some great and not-so-great scenes within the series that interrupt the viewer's ability to feel truly invested in an episode. For example, the opening scenes of the first episode features music that abruptly fades out within seconds for a somewhat clunky flirtation between Bloom (Abigail Cowen), the new fire-fairy at magical boarding school Alfea, and Sky (Danny Griffin), a specialist (a non-magical knight of sorts) and Bloom's obvious love interest. In addition to the music's jarring editing, the dialogue feels blandly narrative - a classic example of telling instead of showing as Bloom's unsolicited spilling of her guts to a stranger feels more like it was for the audience's benefit rather than to establish rapport with Sky. It is these first few scenes of the show that sets the tone for the series. Although the scene quality and dialogue seem to improve at certain points, it tends to be temporary, further highlighting the unrealized potential of the more disappointing aspects of the show.</p><p>For the most part, the show's special effects create an addictive portrayal of magic. The show does well with its horror-esque elements as seen by its depiction of the \"Burned Ones,\" invincible, humanoid zombies that portray the season's villains. The scenes involving these creatures create chilling moments of suspense that feel more like the quality viewers anticipated upon release of the show's trailer. Moreover, the special effects showing Terra (Eliot Salt) the earth fairy animating vines to strangle bullies or coaxing flowers to blossom, Aisha (Precious Mustapha) water-bending torrential currents, and Bloom setting herself and a forest on fire, evoke the same feelings of awe and wonder that the magic of both \"CAOS\" and \"Harry Potter\" did for its fans.</p><p>Unfortunately, even the quality of these special effects are inconsistent - Bloom's \"transformation scene\" against a glittery, midnight blue, green screen effect in the season finale feels out of place compared to the other more commonplace depictions of magic in the series. Furthermore, the show misses an opportunity to capitalize on the fun of learning magic in a school devoted to teaching it by failing to properly integrate Bloom's improvement as a fairy into the plot. To explain, she professes to have trouble accessing her magic in the beginning of the series, envious of Aisha's masterful control, which seems to set up a promising character arc for viewers. However, the show fails to take advantage of this set-up, opting instead for a storyline in which Bloom spontaneously displays an uncharacteristic control and mastery of her powers while Aisha is unable to control a single drop of water. This is one of the most confusing aspects of the show as Aisha was previously shown to impressively extinguish Bloom's uncontrolled forest fire with a flood. As this isn't the only plot point that feels hastily brushed over, the show often feels poorly paced.</p><p>It should also be noted that \"Fate: The Winx Saga\" has been highly criticized for white-washing its cast - the original cartoon was ahead of its time for featuring white fairies alongside fairies of color, including a Latina fairy, East Asian fairy, and Black fairy. However, nearly all the characters on \"Fate: The Winx Saga\" are white or white-passing. If considered as a stand-alone show, this might be a bit more excusable, but the show exists within a greater context, having derived itself from a popular cartoon, which makes this facet all the more difficult to overlook.</p><p>Overall, as a series of magic, friendship, and romance, \"Fate: The Winx Saga\" is appealing for its novel reinvention of once-familiar characters, and is weakened by its pacing and stilted character development. It's difficult to get a sense of how this show will evolve or improve as it feels so incomplete, but perhaps the possible renewal for a second season, an increased budget, and more time will improve upon the first season and give viewers more of what they were looking for. After all, the elements of what could be a fascinating story do exist, albeit in tiny seeds of potential. Perhaps they just need some time to bloom.</p><p>Grade: C+Created by: Brian YoungStarring: Abigail Cowen, Precious Mustapha, Elisha Applebaum, Eliot Salt, Hannah van der Westhuysen, Danny Griffin, Freddie Thorp, Jacob Dudman, Theo Graham, Sadie SoverallRelease date: January 22, 2021Rated: TV-MA</p><p>Image courtesy of Netflix.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4890472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61YC-XXJ1-JBSN-32KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Guardian: University of California - San Diego</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 7, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp; DISC RENTAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7841 VIDEO TAPE RENTAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>La Jolla</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009V9V</classCode><className>ANIMATED TELEVISION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000291</classCode><className>CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009V9V</classCode><className>ANIMATED TELEVISION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000385</classCode><className>CONTENT RATINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001704</classCode><className>TELEVISION PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX544</classCode><className>SAN DIEGO, CA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Labor Day weekend brought record-breaking temperatures across the state that exacerbated what already are drought conditions in a large swath of the state.</p><p>On Thursday, a Northern California wildfire was threatening thousands of homes after winds whipped it into a monster that incinerated houses in a small mountain community and killed at least three people.</p><p>University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot, dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are \"the highest seen in at least four decades\" across major parts of the West.</p><p>The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy, which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume, \"creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm,\" Flannigan said.</p><p>The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus, which may or may not produce lightning, and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze.</p><p>An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented \"firenado,\" killing a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding.</p><p>Yet just this month a fire north of Lake Tahoe spun off at least two and as many as four firenadoes, while the Plumas National Forest fire appears to have produced \"a handful\" overnight Tuesday, said Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p><p>The Creek Fire produced at least two firenadoes that appeared to touch down Saturday, he said, one straddling an access road to a popular campground at Mammoth Pool Reservoir where 214 people became trapped.</p><p>\"It's really kind of a testament to the remarkable extremes that we're seeing right now,\" Lareau said. \"It really is kind of this vicious cycle that it gets into, and that's when the fire really takes off and becomes these unstoppable infernos.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLPD-1003524506</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLPD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X8-NS01-DY37-32D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

During the recent extreme fire season in Australia, which began in 2019 and burned into 2020, millions of tons of smoke particles were released into the atmosphere. Most of those particles followed a typical pattern, settling to the ground after a day or week; yet the ones created in fires burning in one corner of the country managed to blanket the entire Southern hemisphere for months. A pair of Israeli scientists managed to track puzzling January and February 2020 spikes in a measure of particle-laden haze to those fires, and then, in a paper recently published in Science, they uncovered the \"perfect storm\" of circumstances that swept the particles emitted from those fires into the upper atmosphere and spread them over the entire Southern Hemisphere.</p><p>Particles reaching the stratosphere - the upper layer of the atmosphere - most often get there through volcanic eruptions. The ash emitted in the more extreme eruptions dims the sun and cools the planet, as well as producing spectacular sunsets. Prof. Ilan Koren of the Weizmann Institute of Science's Earth and Planetary Science Department, who conducted the study together with his former student, Dr. Eitan Hirsch, now the Head of the Environmental Sciences Division at the Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Tziona, had noticed an extreme increase in a satellite-based measure of particle loading in the atmosphere called AOD - or aerosol optical depth. In January 2020, those measurements, plotted in standard deviations, showed a deviation three times the normal - some of the highest readings ever obtained, higher even than those from Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. But the timing did not coincide with any volcanic activity. They wondered if fires might be to blame, even though it is rare for the smoke from fires to escape the lower layer of atmosphere known as the troposphere in significant amounts. The troposphere extends from the ground to a height of several kilometers, and if smoke particles manage to rise that high, they hit an inversion layer called the tropopause that acts as a sort of ceiling between the troposphere and the stratosphere.</p><p>Working backwards and using data from several satellites, including, in addition to AOD, LIDAR readings that revealed how the particles were distributed vertically in \"slices\" of atmosphere, the two were able to prove that the source of the spikes was bushfires - specifically those burning in Southeastern Australia. Further analysis of satellite data revealed the broad band of haze in the stratosphere spreading to cover the Southern hemisphere, peaking from January to March and persisting through July; reaching all the way around and back to Australia's west coast.</p><p>How did these smoke particles penetrate through the tropopause ceiling and why did they come from these fires and not the others? One clue, says Hirsch, lay in another, distant forest fire that had occurred several years ago in Canada. Then, too, high AOD levels had been recorded. Both of these fires occurred in high latitudes, away from the equator.</p><p>The height of the troposphere shrinks at these latitudes: Over the tropics its upper ceiling can reach up to 18 km above the surface, while somewhere above the 45th parallel - North and South, it takes a sudden step down to around 8-10 km in height. So the first element enabling the particles' trans-layer flight was simply having less atmosphere to cross.</p><p>Pyrocumulus clouds - clouds fueled by the fires' energy - were considered as a means of transporting smoke to the stratosphere. However, when inspecting the satellite data, Hirsch and Koren noticed that pyrocumulus clouds formed only over a small fraction of the fires' duration, and they were mostly seen over fires burning on the central part of the coast. In other words, these clouds could not explain the large amounts found to be transported to the stratosphere, and an additional mechanism for lifting smoke downwind from the sources was missing.</p><p>This brings up the second element: the weather patterns in the strip known as the mid-latitude cyclone belt that runs through the southern end of Australia, one of the stormiest regions on the planet. The smoke was first advected (moved horizontally) by the prevailing winds in the lower atmosphere to the Pacific Ocean, and then some of it converged into the deep convective clouds there and was lifted in the clouds' core into the stratosphere. An interesting feedback mechanism known as \"cloud invigoration by aerosols\" can further deepen the clouds. In a previous study, the authors had shown that in conditions such as the pristine environment over the Southern Ocean, the convective clouds are \"aerosol limited.\" The elevated smoke levels could thus act as cloud condensation nuclei, allowing the clouds to develop deeper and thus increasing the number of clouds that able to penetrate the tropopause and inject the smoke in the stratosphere.</p><p>Up in the stratosphere, the particles found themselves in a different world than the one they had just left. If below they were at the mercy of mixing and churning air currents, up on top the air moves in a steady, linear fashion. That is, there was one strong current, and it was moving them eastwards over the ocean to South America and back over the Indian Ocean toward Australia, and slowly settling around the entire hemisphere. \"People in Chile were breathing particles from the Australian fires,\" says Hirsch. By sailing on an endless air current, these particles remained airborne for much longer than lower atmosphere smoke particles.</p><p>\"For people on the ground, the air may have just seemed a bit hazier or the sunsets a bit redder. But such a high AOD - much, much higher than normal - means sunlight was getting blocked, just as it does after volcanic eruptions,\" says Koren. \"So the ultimate effect of that smoke on the atmosphere was cooling, though we still do not know how much influence that cooling and dimming may have had on the marine environment or weather patterns.</p><p>\"There are always fires burning in California, in Australia and in the tropics,\" he adds. \"We might not be able to stop all of the burning, but we do need an understanding that the precise locations of those fires may grant them very different effects on our atmosphere.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Science <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6535/1269\">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6535/1269</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7425256 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7425256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:627S-46Y1-DYG2-R36J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><timeReceived>7:41 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 19, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Detroit public schools will probably require them unless everyone in a room is vaccinated. In Pittsburgh, masks will likely be required regardless of vaccination status. And in some states, schools cannot mandate face coverings under any circumstances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19 cases soaring nationwide, school districts across the U.S. are yet again confronting the realities of a polarized country and the lingering pandemic as they navigate mask requirements, vaccine rules and social distancing requirements for the fast-approaching new school year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The spread of the delta variant and the deep political divisions over the outbreak have complicated decisions in districts from coast to coast. Some conservative states, lawmakers have banned districts from requiring masks despite outcry from medical professionals. Schools are weighing a variety of plans to manage junior high and middle school classrooms filled with both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.</p><p>\"I'm so frustrated that it's become a political issue because it shouldn't be. It's science,\" said Mary Tuttle, who operates an Indianapolis in-home day care center and has watched the debate in her state over vaccines and masks.</p><p>The Indianapolis district has not yet announced its mask policy, but she hopes they will be required. She worries that the delta variant could lead to a return to in-home learning, which caused her 10-year-old daughter to become depressed and anxious last year.</p><p>\"Emotionally, she really needed to be in school,\" Tuttle said, adding that her daughter will be vaccinated as soon as the shot is approved for her age group. Another daughter will turn 12 six days after starting 6th grade and will be vaccinated as soon as possible.</p><p>The vaccine has not been approved for children under 12. If it shown to be safe and effective for younger ages, vaccine manufacturers may seek emergency authorization sometime this fall or winter.</p><p>Adding to the concerns is a rise in cases overall - sharply in some states, including Arkansas, which won't let schools require masks. Public health researchers on Tuesday called Arkansas' rapidly climbing infections and hospitalizations a \"raging forest fire,\" and the state's top health official warned of significant future outbreaks in schools.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, and it has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>Weekly tallies by the American Academy of Pediatrics based on state reports show that COVID-19 cases in kids increased nationally in July after a couple of months of declines. The most recent data shows a 1% increase from July 1 to July 15, representing 43,000 additional cases.</p><p>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the fact that some states refuse to allow mask requirements \"is just plain wrong.\" She said the organization has embraced recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including masking for those who are not vaccinated and other mitigation steps such as 3-feet physical distancing, ventilation and testing.</p><p>But school officials say masking decisions have been complicated by conflicting advice from public health officials.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday recommended universal masking in schools, even for those who are vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC earlier this month recommended mask-wearing indoors only for students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.</p><p>\"It's frustrating. Parents hear that these are recommendations, and it becomes a delicate dance\" because of differing opinions, said Steve Matthews, superintendent of Novi Community Schools, outside Detroit.</p><p>He probably will recommend that the school board make masking optional, although he worries about potential outbreaks because people are gathering for sporting events, family reunions and other activities.</p><p>\"It would be very helpful if there was agreement among the medical community what the approach should be,\" Matthews said. When everyone wore masks last year, \"it created a sense of community, a sense that we're all in this together. Now it ends up dividing people.\"</p><p>That's part of the reason the academy recommended universal masking in schools, said Dr. Sonja O'Leary, chair of the academy's Council on School Health.</p><p>\"People just wanted it to be clearer, masks or no masks,'' said O'Leary. She said data show COVID-19 infections have not been rampant in U.S. schools, but \"we know masks do curb transmission.\" What's more, keeping track of who has had shots and who has not may be tough for schools.</p><p>School districts that can set their own policies are taking different approaches.</p><p>In Detroit public schools, everyone will likely be required to wear a mask unless an entire room is vaccinated. Officials are developing an identification system, perhaps by wearing lanyards, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, administrators are proposing that all public school students and staff be required to wear masks indoors to protect younger students and because of \"concerns around unknowns from the variant,\" spokeswoman Ebony R. Pugh said. Universal masking also protects the privacy of older students who have not been vaccinated, she said.</p><p>In Kansas, most schoolchildren and teachers will not be required to wear masks. The state's largest district, Wichita, made masks optional starting July 6 and surveyed parents before announcing its reopening plan, said Wichita Public Schools spokeswoman Susan Arensman.</p><p>\"A lot of them, their big talking points were about the emotional well-being of students and staff,\" Arensman said. \"They still wanted kids to be safe, but they also wanted kids to be back to normal.\"</p><p>In Templeton, California, Jenny Grinager said she does not like masks and got an exemption for her 8-year-old son because he has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. She said her son struggles to communicate with people who wear masks because he's unable to see their facial expressions.

The characters become familiar enough to hook your attention while remaining mysterious enough to keep it - perhaps this explains the growing trend of adapting children's shows for mature audiences. It is this idea that serves as the bedrock of the highly-controversial show \"Riverdale\" and the much-loved series \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,\" both of which are often talked about albeit for largely different reasons: one is infamous for its gross sensationalism while the other is famous for its addictive weirdness, wit, and dark, fantastical world-building. Accordingly, it was evident from its trailer that \"Fate: The Winx Saga,\" a mature Netflix adaptation of a children's cartoon featuring elementally and racially diverse fairies, had the potential for the same greatness and obsession, whether that be through adopting some of the ridiculous shock value that keeps \"Riverdale\" relevant, or mirroring \"CAOS\" with a delicious diegesis of its own. Disappointingly, it does neither very well. And while the show does have its share of enjoyable scenes, the overall quality of the series fluctuates so much - even within episodes - to the point where its shortcomings become too obvious to excuse.</p><p/><p>For one, the show has an overall feeling of \"unfinishedness\" that could have been alleviated by the show's creators spending more time to achieve a binge-worthy final product. There's a mix of some great and not-so-great scenes within the series that interrupt the viewer's ability to feel truly invested in an episode. For example, the opening scenes of the first episode features music that abruptly fades out within seconds for a somewhat clunky flirtation between Bloom (Abigail Cowen), the new fire-fairy at magical boarding school Alfea, and Sky (Danny Griffin), a specialist (a non-magical knight of sorts) and Bloom's obvious love interest. In addition to the music's jarring editing, the dialogue feels blandly narrative - a classic example of telling instead of showing as Bloom's unsolicited spilling of her guts to a stranger feels more like it was for the audience's benefit rather than to establish rapport with Sky. It is these first few scenes of the show that sets the tone for the series. Although the scene quality and dialogue seem to improve at certain points, it tends to be temporary, further highlighting the unrealized potential of the more disappointing aspects of the show.</p><p>For the most part, the show's special effects create an addictive portrayal of magic. The show does well with its horror-esque elements as seen by its depiction of the \"Burned Ones,\" invincible, humanoid zombies that portray the season's villains. The scenes involving these creatures create chilling moments of suspense that feel more like the quality viewers anticipated upon release of the show's trailer. Moreover, the special effects showing Terra (Eliot Salt) the earth fairy animating vines to strangle bullies or coaxing flowers to blossom, Aisha (Precious Mustapha) water-bending torrential currents, and Bloom setting herself and a forest on fire, evoke the same feelings of awe and wonder that the magic of both \"CAOS\" and \"Harry Potter\" did for its fans.</p><p>Unfortunately, even the quality of these special effects are inconsistent - Bloom's \"transformation scene\" against a glittery, midnight blue, green screen effect in the season finale feels out of place compared to the other more commonplace depictions of magic in the series. Furthermore, the show misses an opportunity to capitalize on the fun of learning magic in a school devoted to teaching it by failing to properly integrate Bloom's improvement as a fairy into the plot. To explain, she professes to have trouble accessing her magic in the beginning of the series, envious of Aisha's masterful control, which seems to set up a promising character arc for viewers. However, the show fails to take advantage of this set-up, opting instead for a storyline in which Bloom spontaneously displays an uncharacteristic control and mastery of her powers while Aisha is unable to control a single drop of water. This is one of the most confusing aspects of the show as Aisha was previously shown to impressively extinguish Bloom's uncontrolled forest fire with a flood. As this isn't the only plot point that feels hastily brushed over, the show often feels poorly paced.</p><p>It should also be noted that \"Fate: The Winx Saga\" has been highly criticized for white-washing its cast - the original cartoon was ahead of its time for featuring white fairies alongside fairies of color, including a Latina fairy, East Asian fairy, and Black fairy. However, nearly all the characters on \"Fate: The Winx Saga\" are white or white-passing. If considered as a stand-alone show, this might be a bit more excusable, but the show exists within a greater context, having derived itself from a popular cartoon, which makes this facet all the more difficult to overlook.</p><p>Overall, as a series of magic, friendship, and romance, \"Fate: The Winx Saga\" is appealing for its novel reinvention of once-familiar characters, and is weakened by its pacing and stilted character development. It's difficult to get a sense of how this show will evolve or improve as it feels so incomplete, but perhaps the possible renewal for a second season, an increased budget, and more time will improve upon the first season and give viewers more of what they were looking for. After all, the elements of what could be a fascinating story do exist, albeit in tiny seeds of potential. Perhaps they just need some time to bloom.</p><p>Grade: C+Created by: Brian YoungStarring: Abigail Cowen, Precious Mustapha, Elisha Applebaum, Eliot Salt, Hannah van der Westhuysen, Danny Griffin, Freddie Thorp, Jacob Dudman, Theo Graham, Sadie SoverallRelease date: January 22, 2021Rated: TV-MA</p><p>Image courtesy of Netflix.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4890450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61YC-XXJ1-JBSN-32KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Pan American: University of Texas - Pan American</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 7, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp; DISC RENTAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7841 VIDEO TAPE RENTAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Pan American</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>TX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009V9V</classCode><className>ANIMATED TELEVISION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000291</classCode><className>CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009V9V</classCode><className>ANIMATED TELEVISION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000385</classCode><className>CONTENT RATINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001704</classCode><className>TELEVISION PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS159</classCode><className>TEXAS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's been known about for hundreds of years. But only recently have scientists begun to unravel its mysteries.</p><p>It has an unwieldly name: epicardial adipose tissue, or EAT. But researchers are learning how this pocket of fat beneath the outer lining of the heart plays a dynamic role in heart health. Like a cardiac version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, EAT sometimes serves as a protector against heart problems but can also wreak havoc.</p><p>Eventually, it might turn out to play a role in predicting your risk of heart disease.</p><p>Since at least the early 1800s, doctors have known that fat surrounding the heart seemed related to cardiovascular disease. But over the past decade, researchers began to realize that EAT, which can cover 80 percent of the heart muscle and make up 20 percent of the heart's mass, is special.</p><p>EAT stores energy. Sitting right on the heart muscle, it's an important fuel source for the heart, said Samar R. El Khoudary, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh.</p><p>But it's more than that.</p><p>\"This fat is not just a storage place,\" she said. \"It's active.\"</p><p>When it's functioning normally, EAT generates anti-inflammatory agents that protect the heart, she said. Because it's attached to the heart muscle and near important arteries, those helpful agents can affect the entire cardiovascular system. EAT also reduces friction between the coronary arteries and the sac-like tissue surrounding the heart when it beats.</p><p>But when people gain excess weight, EAT also expands. And \"once it expands, here's where we have the problem,\" El Khoudary said.</p><p>Dr. Victor A. Ferrari, professor of medicine at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and chairman of the Penn Cardiovascular Imaging Council, said EAT can be pushed into a \"deranged\" mode. It begins to pump out pro-inflammatory cells that spread like a forest fire, encouraging other fat pockets throughout the body to send out similar agents.</p><p>That appears to hurt the heart in three ways, he said.</p><p>First, some research shows EAT may be associated with a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Evidence also suggests malevolent EAT promotes stiffness in the heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure. And several studies suggest EAT plays a direct role in the formation of artery-clogging plaque, although Ferrari said that not everyone is convinced.</p><p>What triggers the transformation of EAT from quiet protector to cardiac monster?</p><p>\"I think that's the million-dollar question,\" Ferrari said. \"It may even be worth more than a million.\"</p><p>If researchers could find the answer, he said, EAT could become a target for treatment with drugs or other therapies.</p><p>El Khoudary said EAT is of interest for another reason: It has potential as a tool for helping determine who is most at risk for heart disease.</p><p>Some studies have found it can predict coronary artery disease about as well as the widely accepted test known as the coronary calcium score. Sometimes, it's even better, she said.</p><p>EAT can be inconvenient to measure, though, El Khoudary said. The \"gold standard\" for measuring it is to use an MRI or CT scan (which is also used for the coronary calcium score). Those have drawbacks. The tests can be expensive, and evaluating them takes time.</p><p>But, she said, there has been progress in measuring EAT using an echocardiogram, which would be easier. And a recent study in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging found artificial intelligence could measure EAT from CT scans in about 30 seconds.</p><p>For all its intriguing qualities, much remains to be learned about EAT.

Their neighbors to the north, here in Washington State are also facing severe fire dangers--and not just on the traditionally dry east side of the Cascade Mountains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">See this opinion piece I had published in the Seattle Times back in 2017 Western Washington not immune from wildfire risk</p><p>One last note on the publication. It was planned to run in 2016, and then it started raining. I told the editor to pull the piece because it would fall on deaf ears. \"Fire danger, what fire danger--It's raining.\"  So, he ran it in 2017.</p><p>The full text is below:</p><p>To the Seattle Times</p><p>Western Washington has High Wildland-Urban Fire Danger [My original title]</p><p>By  Eric Holdeman, Director Center for Regional Disaster Resilience</p><p>Wildland fires in the United States are becoming commonplace. There have been significant fires all throughout the West in the last month with individual homes and even neighborhoods being lost to fire. In California, their wildland fire season is now year-round. Typically, the wildland fire season here in Washington State begins in June and really heats up in the months of July, August and September. It is true that the majority of wildland fires here in Washington State occur east of the Cascades.</p><p>If you asked people to list the natural hazards and risks that we here in Western Washington should pay attention to, that list would likely include earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, river and urban flooding, mud slides, avalanches and the like. It is unlikely that many people other than firefighters and emergency managers would even mention the danger of a forest fire in Western Washington.</p><p>What most people don't realize is that the wildland fire risk is not confined to Eastern Washington. Ask any professional firefighter and they will tell you that each year we here in Western Washington during the months of July through September and into October are sitting on a ticking time bomb that will only be defused when our normally wet autumn weather returns in the late fall. Until then, we will have an extremely high risk of a wildland fire extending into urban areas in all parts of Western Washington.</p><p>We have enjoyed an early onset of summer with dry weather that began in June. This does not bode well for the rest of this summer and the fire conditions we can expect to have until the rains return in October.</p><p>Much of our highest population density areas exist in an \"urban forest\" environment.  This is not just the foothills of the Cascades, but extends into the city limits of urban and suburban cities. We have entire communities nestled in wooded areas with green belts running throughout and parklike forested greenspaces. Typically, none of the Fire Wise practices used in Eastern Washington to reduce the impact of a wildland fire spreading have been applied by homeowners here on the West Side.</p><p>Short term there are a few measures you can take to protect your own home.  Clear any debris from your roof that are now tinder dry.  This includes cleaning out your gutters of any dry leaves and needles.  Cut away any tree limbs that directly overhang your roof. Limb up your trees so that a fire spreading on the ground cannot leap to the tree canopy and then spread from tree to tree.  Move any woodpiles a good distance away from your home. Don't provide a supply of flammable materials by having the woodpile stacked right next to your house. Keep vegetation cleared away from your home, especially those types of bushes and trees that have a high sap content and can flame up like a torch when on fire.  There are many other steps you can take and a good website for advice on protecting your home is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.firewise.org\">www.firewise.org</url></p><p>Lastly, one of the best opportunities long-term to protect your home is choosing the most fire resistant roofing materials possible.  Some home owner associations still have covenants that require wood shake roofs as one of the roofing options. I know, because where I live there is a requirement in place for either tile or wood shake roofs.  I had to replace my wood shake roof with another shake roof because I could not convince my neighbors to adjust their value system to include protecting their homes from wildland fires--a danger I could not convince them exists.</p><p>Remember that a firestorm will eventually happen here on the West Side. It will be a predictable surprise to some and a danger to all.</p><p>___ (c)2020 Emergency Management Visit Emergency Management at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.emergencymgmt.com\">www.emergencymgmt.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-202009071EMWesternWashingtonFireDangerisVeryHigh0907202009071EM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Emergency Manage KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T7-5731-DYNS-33TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474037</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Emergency Management</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Emergency Management</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 7, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Monday and Tuesday rain showers and strong thunderstorms will range from Arizona through the Great Basin.</p><p>\"Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will again develop over the higher terrain around noon before drifting into the valleys later in the afternoon through the evening,\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) in Las Vegas.</p><p>The main threats associated with the strongest storms will be heavy downpours causing flash flooding and strong wind gusts of up to 50 miles per hour that could produce blowing dust.</p><p>As the week progresses, the monsoonal moisture will be centralized over the Four Corners, spreading slightly northward into parts of Wyoming at the end of the week.</p><p>Thursday and Friday see rain totals ramping up, with up to an inch and a half of rainfall per day in some areas. Heavy rain becomes more widespread into Thursday and Friday, when Utah, western Colorado, and western New Mexico will experience slightly higher rain totals than at the beginning of the week.</p><p>\"The Southwest Monsoon should remain quite active for the foreseeable future and bring much-needed rainfall to this section of the country. However, the potential for flash flooding will also continue for isolated locations throughout the Southwest and central Great Basin, especially over burn scars,\" the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/#page=frt\"> WPC said. </url></p><p>The brunt of the rainfall is forecast to impact Arizona, an area in dire need of substantial relief from<url normalizedValue=\"https://new.azwater.gov/drought\"> decades of drought</url>. Up to 5 inches of rain could fall in parts of the state over the week, with locally higher totals where stronger storms pass over.</p><p>\"More scattered to possibly widespread storms are expected for the second half of the week as a more organized weather system may affect the region. Storms will be capable of producing both locally heavy rain, strong winds, and blowing dust,\" the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/getprod.php?new&amp;prod=XXXAFDPSR&amp;wfo=psr\">NWS in Phoenix said.</url></p><p>Flash flood watches have been issued across four states in the Southwest, including California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona, in effect through Monday afternoon and evening due to the potential for flash flooding in areas that see localized heavy rainfall.</p><p>Last week, flash flooding became a major issue in Arizona and Utah, leading to scenes of cars sweeping down neighborhood roads on feet of rushing water and train derailments resulting in injury.</p><p>Burn scars from wildfires in the region are the greatest areas of concern for flash flooding -- after a fire incinerates a swath of land, the ground left behind is hydrophobic, acting more like concrete than a sponge. Rainwater then easily flows off the burnt soil, sometimes drastically, causing flash flooding events.</p><p>The rain brought by monsoon season is a sigh of relief, but lightning from the stronger thunderstorms could cause more harm than good, producing more fires and leaving behind more burn scars.</p><p>More lightning could mean more wildfires </p><p>Statistics from the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/US-Fire-Problem/Fire-causes/oslightning.ashx?la=en#:~:text=National%20Interagency%20Fire%20Center%20statistics,per%2Dhuman%2D%20caused%20fire.\"> National Interagency Fire Center</url> show that on average from 2008-2012, 12% of wildfires were ignited by a lightning strike while most were human-caused, but fires started by lightning burned nine times more acres on average than human-caused fires.</p><p>Four large fires are currently burning in Arizona, and the dry vegetation from the drought could cause concern with any lightning produced from monsoon thunderstorms. Luckily, most of the storms will contain plenty of rainfall and moisture, the biggest threat being flash flooding.</p><p>\"Scattered to widespread wet thunderstorms are expected to continue across the Southwest, southern Great Basin, and southern Colorado,\" the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn\">National interagency Fire Center said. </url></p><p>This monsoon season has been more active than the seasons in 2019 and 2020, but the NWS in Phoenix points out that there have been a below-average number of lightning strikes compared to the average since 1990 -- a good thing for the extremely active fire season.</p><p>A different story could play out this week in the Great Basin and Northwest, where dry thunderstorms are expected to cause wildfire concerns Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>\"Though high-based, these storms are expected to produce predominantly wet strikes. Nonetheless, fuels are critically/record dry across much of the Northwest. Efficient lightning-induced ignitions are possible with drier strikes on the periphery of storm cores, warranting the maintenance of broad isolated dry thunderstorm highlight,\" said<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy1.html\"> the Storm Prediction Center. </url></p><p>Northern California and southern Oregon will see elevated fire weather conditions on Monday due to the potential for dry thunderstorms in an area that is already devastated by the country's largest wildfire.</p><p>The Bootleg Fire, located near the border of California and Oregon, has seared more than 300,000 acres of forest. Fire officials have said that it might take a significant weather event to put it out.</p><p>\"We are experiencing extremely dry conditions with record to near-record temperatures. Conditions on the ground due in part to the historic drought have accelerated the fire season. The combination of the weather and fuel conditions have led to the rapid growth of the fire,\" Fire spokesperson Katy O'Hara told CNN.</p><p>\"The scope and scale of the Bootleg Fire will require a season-ending weather event such as a significant storm that is either widespread wetting rain or snow, which in southern Oregon typically occurs in the late fall,\" O'Hara said.</p><p>This week, conditions are not looking favorable to help with firefighting efforts, and lightning initiations from dry thunderstorms could make matters worse.</p><p>\"Isolated dry thunderstorms may also form in northern Idaho and western Montana with very hot, dry, and unstable conditions across the inland Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies and Plains into northern Minnesota, and northern Great Basin,\" said the NIFC.</p><p>The SPC has highlighted critical fire danger in eastern Montana as winds pick up during a record heat event. Montana currently has 14 large wildfires burning, the most in the country just above Idaho with 13.</p><p>\"During the afternoon, 20 mph sustained southeasterly surface winds will likely overlap with 15-20% relative humidity for at least a few hours. While the winds are somewhat marginal for Critical highlights, a Critical area has been maintained for portions of eastern Montana into far northeast Wyoming given the presence of Critically/record dry fuels,\" the SPC said.</p><p>Over 3 million people are included in red flag warnings across the Northwest and Northern Great Plains on Monday as fire danger runs high. Nearly the entire states of Idaho and Montana are in red flag warnings, and excessive heat warnings encompass all of eastern Montana where temperatures are climbing into the triple digits once again to start the week.</p><p>Overall, the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn\"> 2021 US wildfire season</url> has crushed the record-breaking 2020 season, with over 2.5 million acres (about the area of Connecticut) burned compared to 1.8 million acres this time last year.         </p><p>             By Hannah Gard and Monica Garrett, CNN</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

One screens for active infection by detecting the virus itself, and the other determines the presence of COVID-specific antibodies, which indicates if someone has ever been infected. Although these tests are ostensibly useful, Professor of Medicine Michael Dee Gunn cautioned about their dubious reliability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If both of those tests work as they are supposed to, you can get a pretty good idea of where someone stands at any time in the course of infection,\" Gunn said. \"Currently, we are early in this so we don't know exactly how to interpret all of these tests. The test for the virus, which is the genetic test, we've seen a lot of cases where those stay positive for a long time and we're still trying to figure out exactly what that means.\"</p><p>With so many new companies racing to develop testing, the creation of a common form of validation is the most pressing issue. Standardizing aspects of testing across companies could be crucial to understand who actually has protective immunity.</p><p>\"What you want to be able to do is to have a number of different testing platforms and be able to have it well-curated-so you can run the samples on all the platforms and look at your results and start to understand, 'Are they all picking up the same measurement?'\" said Thomas Denny, chief operating officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.</p><p>Current hurdles to adequate testing stem from shortages in the supply chain, which extend beyond just the physical kits and necessary reagents.</p><p>Shortages in the materials necessary to collect test samples and a diminished workforce to provide more resources factor heavily into this shortage, said Christopher Woods, co-director of the Hubert-Yeargan Center for Global Health and chief of the infectious diseases division at the VA Medical Center in Durham.</p><p>The ultimate goal of sufficient testing is to facilitate a return to economic productivity, but the degree of oversight required depends on the particular location. North Carolina ranks 20th in terms of coronavirus infections, with Durham County at about 400 cases as of April 21, so the parameters in Durham to reopen would be more lax than New York City's.</p><p>\"It's the same thing that happens in a forest fire,\" Gunn said. \"Once you get the fire under control, then it's an issue of managing the hotspots. What we need to do very efficiently is to be able to identify people that are at risk or having been infected.\"</p><p>Federal, state and local governments must cooperate to address the testing issue, Woods added. He explained that this comprehensive effort should stem from strong, but not overbearing, leadership from the president's team and federal organizations.</p><p>\"I think we require substantial national leadership from our national public health entities, but ultimately at the state level, that's where the data will be available to make the best decisions to invest current resources and direct new resources,\" Woods said.</p><p>Although many people seek to end social distancing in a timely manner and introduce less restrictive measures, there are risks if the transition occurs too soon. The prospect of loosening quarantine measures could arrive soon, but Gunn reminded that the process must be gradual and methodical.</p><p>Get The Chronicle straight to your inbox</p><p>Signup for our editorially curated, weekly newsletter.

So you can start small and then you watch and be ready to contact tracing and testing in that area, and you build on it. I'm concerned we are going to find ourselves in worse shape if we go too fast,\" Gunn said.</p><p>Gunn acknowledged those who are motivated by the loss of their job and income but reminded viewers that coronavirus safety is \"something we can deal with on a national level, as opposed to forgetting all the efforts we've been through the last six to eight weeks.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4591267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR5-P4H1-JBSN-32V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Duke Chronicle: Duke University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Durham</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

We enthusiastically join our partners at the Colorado Springs Airport and the USDA Forest Service in the regional response to increasing forest fire activity,\" said Mayor John Suthers. \"We want to do everything we can to protect our beautiful state and our residents. As wildland firefighting continues to be a priority for western states, we continue to embrace our leadership role and we look forward to completion of this vital asset. This base is something we've been working on for quite some time, and I want to commend our airport staff for their work in helping the project become a reality.\"</p><p>On Jan. 24, the Forest Service signed a lease agreement with the Colorado Springs Airport. The agreement paves the way to begin construction on the project. By working together, both agencies will share the costs for construction and maintenance for the initiative, currently budgeted at approximately $20 million.</p><p>\"This project is a perfect example of how we can work within all levels of government to promote shared stewardship,\" said USDA Acting Regional Forester Jennifer Eberlien. \"I am excited to see it unfold and to see what it will mean for supporting communities during peak fire year activity.\"</p><p>The one-and-a-half-acre base will initially house six reload pits for any type of contracted airtanker, including Very Large Airtankers that can hold more than 5,000 gallons of retardant-making it the largest base in the region, with the ability to serve a 600-mile radius. The base will support even the largest airtankers and will allow multiple airtankers to reload at once. This will allow an increased amount of retardant to be sent to a wildfire faster and with greater efficiency. It will also help the firefighters on the ground and protect communities from the approaching threat of wildfire. By being able to service aircraft of all sizes and capabilities, the base will also reduce the total number of flights needed to fight a wildfire, reducing the risk to additional flight crews and other regions.</p><p>The 600-mile radius includes Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Kansas and Nebraska. The base will also provide support to southern Montana, southeastern Idaho, eastern Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, western Iowa and western Missouri.</p><p>The eight-acre ramp will be located near the airport's main 13,500-foot runway and adjacent to the U.S. Army-operated ramp. During the winter months, when the Forest Service is not using the ramp, the airport will use it as a de-icing area for commercial aircraft.</p><p>The groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for spring 2020. Construction on the new base and ramp is set to begin in summer 2020, with completion and a ribbon cutting ceremony in 2021.</p><p>Congress awarded the Forest Service funding for the project as part of the 2018 Omnibus Bill that repurposed previous allocations to the agency's Aviation Safety and Modernization Strategy. The Department of Agriculture prioritized the Colorado Springs Airtanker Base as the one of the highest investments for Aviation Safety Modernization Projects, representing nearly one fourth of the $37.2 million budget. The City of Colorado Springs is providing additional funding through a partnership agreement.

We need a downtown thoroughfare for Glenn/New Seward/Minnesota connectivity. It is unbelievable there is no way to bypass downtown for commercial trucks and countless vehicles passing through Anchorage. There are no thoroughfares traversing the Hillside or roads through the mid-Hillside to Northeast Anchorage without many stops on roads that aren't suitable for big trucks or heavy traffic that needs to get through Anchorage. The port project needs to be completed somehow, and the downtown road infrastructure must be overhauled. Traffic flow patterns need to be improved generally, with investments in modern technology. Having to constantly stop at stop lights that aren't coordinated is a drain on our time and our gas tanks. Airport rail extension for shipments?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2021/03/13/anchorage-mayor-candidate-qa-forrest-dunbar/\">Forrest Dunbar</url></p><p>I will champion transportation projects that improve connectivity, increase pedestrian and bike options, reduce traffic, have community buy-in, and make Anchorage a more livable city. There are several community-based plans that already exist with long lists of projects that would meet those criteria. With the new federal administration prioritizing infrastructure spending, we will have a unique opportunity to turn our plans into projects: for example, a pedestrian and bike overpass on Lake Otis below Tudor will improve safety and trail connectivity; more life-safety access roads will ensure residents aren't trapped on the wrong side of a forest fire. Building out our world-class trail system to connect more neighborhoods will improve property values and economic activity across Anchorage.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2021/03/13/anchorage-mayor-candidate-qa-bill-evans/\">Bill Evans</url></p><p>I would push hard for the completion of the highway-to-highway project. If you consider the \"port\" as a transportation project, it will be absolutely essential that we complete that project during the next few years. If Anchorage's economy grows, as I believe it will, we also have to be mindful of ensuring our transportation corridors and infrastructure keep pace with the growth. Too many cities get bound up by rapidly growing industries and insufficient transportation corridors.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2021/03/13/anchorage-mayor-candidate-qa-bill-falsey/\">Bill Falsey</url></p><p>Despite improvements to the PeopleMover bus system and our trail network, Anchorage remains predominately a car city. For motorized traffic, our roads work pretty well. For non-motorized traffic, the city still has work to do - but it is moving in the right direction. Recent initiatives such as \"vision zero,\" which outlines a strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries while increasing safe, healthy and equitable transportation for everyone, and the move to \"complete streets,\" like the rebuilt section of Spenard Road, that equally prioritize pedestrian and bicycle safety, show the way.

Often, they lose everything they hold dear their home, family photos, clothes, furniture everything. When the worst happens, American Red Cross volunteers are there to help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Red Cross has supported disaster victims since its beginning. Over the past 140 years, we've continued to adapt to people's emerging needs and deliver emergency relief to those who need it most.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1881 MICHIGAN FOREST FIRE Months after Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross, the organization launched its first disaster response donating money, clothes and furniture to victims of the devastating forest fires in Michigan. The fire claimed almost 300 lives and left thousands homeless. Red Cross chapters collected food and supplies, which were shipped to Michigan to help assist the 14,000 people in need.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the fire in Michigan, the Red Cross proved it could respond to large disasters, and President Chester Arthur and the U.S. Senate officially recognized the American Red Cross by signing the Treaty of Geneva on March 16, 1882.</p><p>1889 JOHNSTOWN FLOOD In 1889, a dam collapsed near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, sending millions of gallons of water toward the town of 30,000 people. More than 2,000 people died, hundreds were missing and tens of thousands were left homeless. To help, Clara Barton and a team of doctors, nurses and relief workers set up hospital tents, feeding stations and our first sheltering operation with \"Red Cross hotels\" to house the people whose homes were destroyed. Clara Barton and her team of 50 volunteers remained in Johnstown for months, helping the survivors get back on their feet.</p><p>1893 HURRICANE SEA ISLANDS, SC Before hurricanes were named, the Red Cross launched its first major hurricane response when a powerful storm struck the Sea Islands in South Carolina in August 1893, claiming the lives of thousands of residents. As bad as the damage was, starvation was a chief concern. Red Cross volunteers, led by President Clara Barton, helped feed thousands of people until the next year's spring crops were harvested. She set up a warehouse to stock clothing and food to support those in need. For nearly a year, the Red Cross stood with survivors who lost everything, helping them rebuild their homes and livelihoods by providing seeds for new crops and creating local sewing groups for people to create and sell clothes.</p><p>1927 MISSISSIPPI RIVER FLOOD The Red Cross was called into action along the Mississippi River during the Great Flood of 1927, which covered about 16 million acres in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. The Red Cross helped with transportation, sheltering, feeding and clothing, as well as furnishing nursing and medical care.</p><p>More than 325,000 people stayed in Red Cross tent camps across affected states, and the Red Cross fed another 300,000 people staying in public buildings or on the second floor of damaged homes. People joined the relief effort in different ways, including a large group of cowboys from Texas who help save people's livestock working day and night to perform floodwater rescues with their lassoes. Eventually, when the water receded, the Red Cross helped local families return home using fleets of boats, caravans of vehicles and the railroad.</p><p>1969 HURRICANE CAMILLE On August 17, 1969, Hurricane Camille made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama as a deadly Category 5 storm, causing extensive damage and unprecedented flash flooding. At the time, it was the most damaging storm on record in the U.S. During the height of the response, the Red Cross fed and sheltered nearly 260,000 disaster victims and relief workers. In coordination with federal and state authorities, the Red Cross assisted families with their long-term recovery and returning to their daily lives.</p><p>1994 NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE On January 17, 1994 a powerful earthquake struck southern California, knocking down walls, collapsing parking structures, crushing cars and buckling freeways. The city of Los Angeles suffered heavy damage and thousands were in need. The Red Cross mobilized thousands of disaster volunteers, many of whom had loaded their families into cars and drove them to safety, only to turn back around and drive to their local chapter to report for duty. In the first 36 hours, the Red Cross opened numerous shelters and service delivery sites throughout the San Fernando Valley. Over the course of the response, the Red Cross served 1.7 million meals, provided shelter for nearly 22,000 people and provided mental health support to more than 40,000 affected Californians.</p><p>2005 HURRICANE KATRINA The largest single disaster relief effort ever undertaken by the American Red Cross was the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In fact, parts of our response were nearly 20 times greater than any previous disaster relief effort. The storm killed nearly 2,000 people and left millions homeless. In the largest sheltering operation in its history, the Red Cross opened nearly 1,400 evacuation shelters in 27 states and the District of Columbia and provided more than 3.8 million overnight shelter stays. Five days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the Red Cross was serving nearly 1 million meals in a single day distributing a total of more than 68 million meals during the response. More than 244,000 disaster workers, 95 percent of them volunteers, responded to help the hurricane survivors.</p><p>2012 SUPERSTORM SANDY On October 29, 2012, Superstorm Sandy came ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey, having already pummeled much of the East Coast. The massive storm hit hard across New Jersey and New York, paralyzing the nation's largest city with unprecedented flooding, taking lives and displacing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Storm damage left 8.5 million people without power across 11 states and sparked a massive fire in Queens, New York, which leveled more than 100 homes.</p><p>Survivors looked to the Red Cross for help, which came in the form of shelter, food and care. Red Cross workers served over 17.5 million meals and snacks, and they drove more than 300 emergency response vehicles to navigate blocked roads, closed bridges and tunnels, and gas shortages as they worked to bring relief throughout the region, providing food, blankets, health care, emotional support and sorely needed relief supplies like cleanup and comfort kits.</p><p>ADAPTING TO TODAY'S CHALLENGES Since then, severe weather has continued to batter communities some, again and again. In 2017, back-to-back hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, became some of the worst in U.S. history. And record-breaking wildfires continue to rage each year.</p><p>As disasters become more frequent and intense, and with disaster seasons lasting longer, the Red Cross is continuing to adapt just as we have for the past 140 years. In light of climate change, we're committed to grow our response capacity and deliver our services more sustainably so the American Red Cross can continue to help future generations in need.</p><p>About the American Red Cross:</p><p>The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families. The Red Cross is a not-for-profit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to perform its mission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124473709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R7-8F91-JCBF-S1B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1261\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 20, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Pursuant to the last amendment signed by Puma and El Nino, Puma had until June 30th, 2020, to proceed with the final $1 million cash consideration. The 30-day extension granted will be used to review different potential methods to deal with the acquisition of the Murray Brook Project and its future development that would be beneficial for both companies. Further announcements will be forthcoming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Marcel Robillard, president and CEO said: \"I'm please to have kept, over the years, a good relationship between Puma and El Nino which might contribute to a positive outcome for the acquisition of the minority interest of the Murray Brook Deposit, and that both shareholders benefit from it for many years to come.\"</p><p>TRIPLE FAULT GOLD AREA</p><p>Puma is currently focusing its field work on its flagship TRIPLE FAULT GOLD PROJECT in New Brunswick. The initial phase of the program incorporates large detailed prospecting, mapping, trenching, and stripping focused over the entire Williams Brook property of the Triple Fault Gold Project. The Williams Brook property includes selected drill results of 11.2 g/t over 2.8m, 1.0 g/t over 23 m, gold occurrences grading up to 50.8 g/t Au in bedrock, numerous gold soil anomalies and extremely anomalous till samples with up to 508 gold grains that occur over an area approximately 12 by 3 kilometres. Puma has received all the necessary authorizations from the New Brunswick government in light of the pandemic, and field work is authorized to begin, but was delayed because of the Forest Fire warnings and security.</p><p>The Triple Fault Gold Project includes four (4) properties named Williams Brook, Jonpol Gold, Rocky Brook, and Portage Lake and controls more than 25,000ha of favorable gold exploration. There are many gold occurrences up to 50.8 g/t Au, 40 g/t Au, 28 g/t Au, 17 g/t Au with previous holes intersected 11.2 g/t over 2.8m, 8.02 g/t Au over 1.0m, 1.0 g/t over 23.0m, 3.46 g/t Au over 2.0m. There has been very limited drilling and exploration in the area with excellent access by the paved Route 180 close to the mining camp infrastructure. The Dunnage Zone hosts major gold deposits and gold occurrences in siluro-devonian host rocks with the emergence of many companies in Eastern Canada for gold exploration and development.</p><p>QUALIFIED PERSONS </p><p>Marcel Robillard, PGeo, qualified person as defined by Canadian National Instrument 43-101 standards, has reviewed and approved the geological information reported in this news release.

Meal distributions were prepared for up to 300 families, with various dry goods, dairy products and meats being distributed. Volunteers were able to give away most of the donations before the event was even scheduled to end at 1 p.m.</p><p>Reagran Lara, nutrition education manager with Second Harvest's location in Pasco, was at the head of the Mobile Market in Quincy on Monday. Lara said the need for assistance from families is \"immense\" right now and hopes to be able to come back to the area a few more times this year.</p><p>Lara said there's a large number of families in this part of Central Washington that have been severely affected by COVID-19. She said they're working at Second Harvest to do what they can to offer support.</p><p>\"Anything we can do, we're ready to go,\" Lara said. \"As long as we're invited, we'll come. The big thing is to have a location and have somebody let us be here, that's the biggest hurdle that we've found.\" Food donations come through partners from Feeding America, sponsors of more than 200 food banks around the nation, including Second Harvest Inland Northwest. While they don't have a set date to return just yet, Lara said they'll be back in the area as soon as possible.</p><p>Mary Jo Ybarra-Vega, Outreach and Behavioral Health Coordinator for Quincy Community Health Center, said they had intended on hosting this event earlier in the year, but were forced to cancel when the county shifted back to Phase 1.</p><p>Ybarra-Vega said she feels \"blessed\" to be able to help offer something like this for the community at this time. She said she's also hoping they're able to bring the Mobile Market back again in a few weeks.</p><p>\"We have tons of people that will drive up from Soap Lake, Ephrata, Mattawa, Royal City, they'll drive up here for a box of food,\" Ybarra-Vega said. \"That's how tough things are for some people. I think it's just really needed more than anything right now. There's a lot of people that haven't been working, and I think they're very grateful.\"</p><p>With school returning shortly, she said there's a lot of stress on people's minds right now. Ybarra-Vega said she's heard a lot of parents discuss finding out how expensive it can be with children at home all the time already this summer.</p><p>\"There's a lot of food being consumed in the house, where maybe two meals would have been happening at school,\" Ybarra-Vega said. \"That's a burden that people don't think about, especially if you're not a family especially in need. I've had people tell me 'I didn't know what I was going to eat today, this is the last thing of macaroni left.'\"</p><p>For people facing these struggles to be able to show up and see steaks and milk being distributed, she said it hopefully eases that burden a bit. Quincy Community Health Center employees also distributed fresh masks to people coming by as well.</p><p>Normally, she said an army of volunteers would be working to help distribute food at the Mobile Market. This year, there was no need with Second Harvest Inland Northwest bringing a \"literal army\" with volunteers from the Army and Air Force National Guard out of Pasco.</p><p>Sergeant Emmanuel Torres, from Pasco, said they've been working with Second Harvest since about May after the food bank saw a surge in donations it was unable to handle on its own. Torres said they've been helping with at least three mobile distributions a week.</p><p>Getting called up to action in his own community is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Torres said.</p><p>\"We don't get activated to help, or be directly in contact with the community, unless it's like a forest fire, or flash flooding,\" Torres said. \"This is a rare, unique opportunity for us to be out here,  so we're grasping on to it and we're out here persevering.\"</p><p>___ (c)2020 the Columbia Basin Herald, Wash.

Several groups led by Native American activists are planning protests for Trump's July 3 visit, part of the president's \"comeback\" campaign for a nation reeling from sickness, unemployment and, recently, social unrest. The event is slated to include fighter jets thundering over the 79-year-old stone monument in South Dakota's Black Hills and the first fireworks display at the site since 2009. But it comes amid a national reckoning over racism and a reconsideration of the symbolism of monuments around the globe. Many Native American activists say the Rushmore memorial is as reprehensible as the many Confederate monuments being toppled around the nation. </p><p>\"Mount Rushmore is a symbol of white supremacy, of structural racism that's still alive and well in society today,\" said Nick Tilsen, a member of the Oglala Lakota Nation and the president of a local activist organization called NDN Collective. \"It's an injustice to actively steal Indigenous people's land then carve the white faces of the conquerors who committed genocide.\" While some activists, like Tilsen, want to see the monument removed altogether and the Black Hills returned to the Lakota, others have called for a share in the economic benefits from the region and the tourists it attracts. Meanwhile, some wildfire experts have also raised concerns the July Fourth pyrotechnics could spark fires, especially because the region has seen dry weather this year. A fire that started in Custer State Park yesterday has burned an estimated 150 acres about 6 miles south of Mount Rushmore. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's spokesman Ian Fury said the South Dakota Wildland Fire Division is leading a multistate, multiagency effort to fight the forest fire, the Rapid City Journal reported. Noem (R) has said event planners are hoping for rain this week but are monitoring fire conditions and will decide whether it is safe to set off fireworks. Trump has long shown a fascination with Mount Rushmore. Noem said in 2018 that he had once told her straight-faced it was his dream to have his face carved into the monument. He later joked at a campaign rally about getting enshrined alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. And while it was Noem who pushed for a return of the fireworks on the eve of Independence Day, Trump joined the effort and committed to visiting South Dakota for the celebration. The four faces, carved into the mountain with dynamite and drills, are known as the \"shrine to democracy.\" The presidents were chosen by sculptor Gutzon Borglum for their leadership during four phases of American development: Washington led the birth of the nation; Jefferson sparked its westward expansion; Lincoln preserved the union and emancipated slaves; Roosevelt championed industrial innovation. And yet, for many Native American people, including the Lakota, Cheyenne, Omaha, Arapaho, Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache, the monument is a desecration to the Black Hills, which they consider sacred. Lakota people know the area as Paha Sapa -- \"the heart of everything that is.\" As monuments to Confederate and colonial leaders have been removed across U.S. cities, conservatives have expressed concern that Mount Rushmore could be next. Commentator Ben Shapiro this week suggested that the \"woke historical revisionist priesthood\" wanted to blow up the monument. Noem responded by tweeting, \"Not on my watch.\" Tim Giago, a journalist who is a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe, said he doesn't see four great American leaders when he looks at the monument, but instead four white men who either made racist remarks or initiated actions that removed Native Americans from their land. Washington and Jefferson both held slaves. Lincoln, though he led the abolition of slavery, also approved the hanging of 38 Dakota men in Minnesota after a violent conflict with white settlers there. Roosevelt is reported to have said, \"I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe 9 out of every 10 are.\" The monument has long been a \"Rorschach test,\" said John Taliaferro, author of \"Great White Fathers,\" a history of the monument. \"All sorts of people can go there and see it in different ways.\" The White House had no immediate comment on criticism of the president's planned visit. -- Stephen Groves, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-PV21-DY7N-F00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 25, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The organization is utilizing their unique resources and contacts to provide much needed relief to those living on tribal lands in Utah and surrounding areas. COVID-19 was comparatively slow to come to the Navajo Nation. The first case was recorded over two months after the virus first appeared in the United States. But after it arrived the disease traveled with the speed and destruction of a forest fire. On May 27th it was announced that the Navajo Nation had surpassed New York to become the area with the highest per-capita infection rate in the U.S. The rapidity of the spread and the high rate of death were due mainly to a lack of infrastructure in this remote part of the country. There are also high rates of pre-existing conditions among citizens and lack of access to healthcare. About 40% of homes lack the running water necessary to follow the basic guidelines set forth by the CDC, and many homes are multigenerational. Both are factors that are believed to contribute to spread. To combat the rising total of cases, this great tribal nation initiated mandatory weekend and weekday curfews. They were initially active for 8 weeks and have been reinstated periodically as the case count waxes and wanes. When weekend curfews are in effect, residents are required to stay at home starting Friday evening through Monday morning. The weekday curfew has been strictly reinforced between 8pm and 5am. Many Native Americans living within the Navajo Nation are hours away from the closest grocery store. There have been anecdotal reports that cleaning supplies are nearly impossible to find at grocery stores on the reservation. This means that people have to travel even farther to find what they need in order to keep their families safe. These curfews and long distance to stores have made it extremely difficult for citizens to get supplies. It is especially difficult for elders who are dependent on family to get essentials. And for the households in quarantine - which number in the hundreds on any given day - getting what they need is made that much harder. The reports from the Navajo Nation are dire. In a community where 1 in 3 children live in poverty, many children depend on school attendance in order to receive regular meals. As schools were shut down for months, the food insecurity of low income families on the reservation only deepened. Many low income children were only getting 1 meal a day until schools opened up again. Many breadwinners have lost their jobs after being exposed to the virus and going into quarantine, or as a result of the recession. Elders who live on roads only accessible by four wheel drive are close to starving because they aren't able to get supplies. The main focus at American Indian Services is providing educational scholarships and programs to Native American students. However, they often create special projects to meet the needs of their constituents. Due to the extreme challenges the Navajo Nation is facing, American Indian Services opened up a project to provide food and supplies. Since the pandemic began, AIS has delivered 160,000 pounds of nonperishable goods to tribal citizens. These goods were divided into 1,200 family boxes and each box had enough provisions to provide for a family of 5 for four weeks. Once the boxes were ready, they were loaded into volunteer's trucks and taken to cities throughout the Navajo and Hopi Nations. These cities included Kayenta-New Mexico, Chinle-Arizona, Fort Defiance-Arizona, Tuba City-Arizona, and Monument Valley-Utah. The goal of the organization was for the boxes to be delivered to the families most in need of them.

I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the \"NewsHour\" tonight: economic resilience. Employers add more jobs to the nation`s overall economy, even as the tech industry is hit with massive layoffs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then: fighting power. In a new memoir, journalist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa explores how online misinformation has contributed to democracy`s decline.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA RESSA, CEO, Rappler: That is what gets the greatest distribution online. It`s lies laced with anger and hate, fear, us against them. If you do this all the time, what kind of societies do we create?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUDY WOODRUFF: And it`s Friday. Jonathan Capehart and David Brooks give their take on President Biden pushing Democrats to shake up their presidential primary calendar for 2024.</p><p>All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. hiring remained strong in November, in spite of slow economic growth and high inflation. The Labor Department reported that the economy added 263,000 jobs last month. That is down slightly from October`s gain of 284,000. The unemployment rate also held steady at 3.7 percent. And average hourly pay rose 5.1 percent over a year ago.</p><p>Democrats voted for a major shakeup to their presidential primary calendar. The Democratic National Committee rules panel picked South Carolina to be the first state to vote, followed by New Hampshire and Nevada a week later. President Biden had recommended the move to prioritize the party`s diverse base, stripping Iowa of its traditional first place status. The full DNC is expected to give final approval early next year.</p><p>President Biden signed a bill today averting a rail strike that could have plunged the U.S. into a recession. It gives rail workers a pay raise, but does not include paid sick leave. The president, a staunch union ally, acknowledged the bill is not perfect, but insisted it was necessary to avoid an economic catastrophe.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, President of the United States: Look, I know this bill doesn`t have paid sick leave that these rail workers and, frankly, every worker in America deserves. But that fight isn`t over.</p><p>I want to thank Congress, Democrats and Republicans, for acting so quickly. I know this was a tough vote for members of both parties. It was tough for me, but it was the right thing to do at the moment.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The president said the strike could have caused some 750,000 job losses and triggered major supply chain disruptions during the holidays.</p><p>\"Infowars\" host Alex Jones filed for personal bankruptcy today in Texas. Jones had been ordered to pay families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims nearly $1.5 billion for falsely calling the massacre a hoax.</p><p>A Connecticut attorney representing the victims` relatives called the filing a -- quote -- \"cowardly move.\"</p><p>The European Union has reached a deal to cap the price of Russian oil exports at $60 a barrel. Hours later, Australia and a group of seven nations which includes the U.S. Australia and a Group of Seven nations, which includes the U.S., also agreed on the same cap. The move aims to limit Moscow`s profits off of oil sales to curb its war on Ukraine, while also keeping Russian oil on the market.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Kremlin rejected Western demands today to completely pull out of Ukraine as part of any future peace talks. It came a day after President Biden said that he would be ready to speak with Moscow only if President Putin is serious about ending his war by withdrawing forces.</p><p>Also, a top adviser to Ukraine`s President Zelenskyy made a rare acknowledgement, that they have lost up to 13,000 soldiers in the conflict since February. That`s well below Western estimates.</p><p>In Ethiopia, civilians are still being killed by Eritrean troops in the Tigray region weeks after the two warring parties had signed a piece agreement. The Tigray Emergency Center reported that at least 111 civilians died in Tigray and 103 others were injured, according to data compiled over seven days in late November. Dozens of other people were kidnapped and hundreds of homes were destroyed.</p><p>Back in this country, red hot lava from the Mauna Loa volcanic eruption is inching toward a main highway on Hawaii`s Big Island. A lava road blockage would create serious problems for residents, who regularly use the island`s main east-west road. Locals are bracing for a tough commute.</p><p>SKY MAKAI, Hilo Resident: When I think about how it`s how it`s going to affect me, it`s really devastating. I know that I will still be able to work, but it`s going to be way harder. I don`t know many people that have a four-hour commute and eight hours in a day.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that it could be at least a week before the lava reaches the highway. Hawaii`s National Guard is already looking to set up potential bypass routes.</p><p>Twitter has suspended Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, after he tweeted a picture of a swastika merged with the Star of David. It is the second time this year that his account has been suspended over antisemitic comments. Twitter CEO Elon Musk had that Ye`s swastika post violated the platform`s rule against inciting violence.</p><p>The last of Arizona`s counties to certify its midterm election results did so late Thursday, but only after a court order. Republican officials in rural Cochise County had refused to finalize results after falsely citing issues with vote counting machines. They finally approved the vote count after a judge ruled that the county broke state law in defying Monday`s deadline.</p><p>And stocks were mixed on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 35 points to close at 34430. The Nasdaq fell 21 points, and the S&amp;P 500 slipped five.</p><p>Still to come on the \"NewsHour\": how Muslim American candidates made history in the midterms; David Brooks and Jonathan Capehart dissect the latest political news; and much more.</p><p>The latest jobs report is further confirmation of a strong labor market in the U.S., one that may be slowing down, but has proven more resilient than many have expected. Many sectors are continuing to add jobs.</p><p>But that is not true in the tech sector, where a number of companies have announced layoffs.</p><p>Our economics correspondent, Paul Solman, looks at what that means for those workers, and why the struggles in tech may not be as problematic for the wider economy as one would think.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Seven weeks into her dream job as the software company at the software company known as Meta, formally known as Facebook, Julia Gonik was suddenly laid off.</p><p>JULIA GONIK, Former Meta Employee: It`s like the ground just fell out from underneath me, and all of my opportunities and the future that I saw for myself just completely disappeared.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Now, the ink barely dry on her MIT diploma, the computer science major is looking for a new job.</p><p>JULIA GONIK: The market is just not great right now. So that makes interviewing and looking for a new job more stressful, since you just don`t know if there are jobs out there or if you can get a job that you would actually like to do and want to do.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Especially jobs that pay like big tech.</p><p>JULIA GONIK: Software engineers at these big companies definitely make very good money right outside of college, definitely six figures, starting salary.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Plus a signing bonus.</p><p>Three weeks ago, Gonik was one of 11,000 laid off at Meta without warning, 13 percent of the company, one of more than 140,000 tech workers who have already lost their jobs this year, making headlines worldwide.</p><p>Especially worried, those on a work-sponsored visa which allows them to remain in the U.S.</p><p>SOWMYA IYER, Former Lyft Employee: It is extremely stressful being in that ambiguous state, being in -- like, feeling really vulnerable and really, like, helpless.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: For four years, Sowmya Iyer was a product designer at the ridesharing app Lyft. She has 60 days to find a job or go back to India.</p><p>SOWMYA IYER: On the day of layoffs, you`re instantly logged out of all your applications, all your systems, all your apps, all your documents.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Four years of work that you were simply instantaneously logged out of?</p><p>SOWMYA IYER: Yes.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Nobody to call to say, hey, can you just give me a couple of days to download some stuff?</p><p>SOWMYA IYER: The moment you`re laid off, you have until the end of the day.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: So what did you do?</p><p>SOWMYA IYER: I had a lot of exit formalities to complete, so that took most of my day.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And all that time, you`re thinking, how do I retrieve...</p><p>SOWMYA IYER: Work.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: ... the work you have done for your portfolio?</p><p>SOWMYA IYER: Right. It was driving me crazy. I had to compromise on a lot of great companies because everyone instantly wants to see work.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And she could not access any of hers. So, massive disruption in tech, massive layoffs, a harbinger of deep recession?</p><p>VIVEK WADHWA, Tech Entrepreneur: You know, Silicon Valley has burned down many times. And every time it burns down, it reinvents itself. But, this time, it isn`t a forest fire. It`s just a hedge trimming.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Longtime valley entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa.</p><p>VIVEK WADHWA: This is nothing like the dot-com burst. The dot-com burst had global consequences and it was huge. It set the economy back for years to come. This is just a minor correction.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Economist Betsey Stevenson agrees.</p><p>BETSEY STEVENSON, Former Council of Economic Advisers Member: What I`m seeing is a sector that hired more than most other sectors did during the pandemic. They`re pulling back a little bit with layoffs.</p><p>And we`re still dealing with monthly jobs reports that are showing us job growth that`s bigger than almost any single month we had prior to the pandemic. So, I don`t think there`s any reason to worry that there are some people losing their jobs, because you know there are hundreds of thousands of others gaining jobs.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: Of course, that does not make it any easier for those workers laid off. But Stevenson actually has a positive big-picture reframing.</p><p>BETSEY STEVENSON: When the pandemic began, technology was our savior. We turned to technology to be able to work from home, to be able to shop from home, to be able to talk to our doctors from home.</p><p>But I do think that it`s run its course in terms of that growth. And the fact that is resulting in the tech sector having layoffs, to me, symbolizes that we`ve reached the end of this pandemic era.</p><p>ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON, Stanford University: I actually think that the recent wave is a bit overdue and may be good for the rest of the economy.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: And there is actually an upside to the layoffs, claims techno-optimist Erik Brynjolfsson, who runs the Digital Economy Lab at Stanford.</p><p>ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: There`s a ton of really great tech talent that`s been tied up in activities that may not be creating that much value. Especially, I`m thinking of crypto.</p><p>Meanwhile, the real need is to have tech folks go and transform the rest of America, manufacturing, retailing, finance, health care most of all. And we need to unleash some of the talent in that part of the economy.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: I put this to the talent itself.</p><p>JULIA GONIK: I think that is possible. I have been looking at some job opportunities in the health care sector, for example. So it`s definitely somewhere that I may end up.</p><p>SOWMYA IYER: I was always more passionate to be in health care or something that has to do with, like, food and health services or something that has to do with education and learning, et cetera. So, now I feel that it`s a good time to recalibrate and rethink about the future.</p><p>PAUL SOLMAN: In sum, a rough ride, for sure, for laid off tech talent, especially from abroad, but, for the economy, and eventually even the talent, maybe, just maybe, a harbinger of health.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" this is Paul Solman, reporting, although still sometimes remotely, at what we all pray is the dawn of the post-pandemic era.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: More than a year after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, journalist Maria Ressa still faces a series of criminal charges in her native country, the Philippines.</p><p>She is the founder and CEO of Rappler.com and has spent much time reporting on former President Rodrigo Duterte`s regime and the war on drugs. In a new memoir, she shares a personal account of her unrelenting work uncovering the truth and holding power to account.</p><p>I spoke with her a short time ago about her book, \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator: The Fight for Our Future.\"</p><p>Maria Ressa, thank you very much for joining us. And this book is about how to stand up to a dictator, but it`s also very much your personal story. You were born and spent 10 years in the Philippines. Then you moved to the United States for another 10 years.</p><p>How did that dual country coming up, coming of age shape you?</p><p>MARIA RESSA, CEO, Rappler: I think in a lot of ways.</p><p>It created a great kind of setup for being a journalist. When I wasn`t here in the U.S., when we landed, I could really barely speak English. So my teachers remembered the year when I was strangely quiet, and they kept teaching me music, which was fantastic.</p><p>And then, when I was graduating college, somehow, it felt like I wasn`t completely American, right? So I thought, let me figure out what being Filipino meant. So, I applied for a Fulbright going the other way. I went back to the Philippines. And it was supposed to be a year, and I just never left the Philippines, never left Southeast Asia.</p><p>And then, when I came back to America, I realized, oh, my gosh, every time I`m with Americans, I feel more Filipino. When I`m with Filipinos, I feel more American. So, you`re kind of part of both, but you`re part of neither, which then set up being a reporter for me.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But where -- and where did the courage that you had to summon for what your entire adult life as a journalist in the Philippines working for CNN, where I first met you, where did where did that courage come from?</p><p>MARIA RESSA: So, I think one of the things I tried to do early on, when I first was an immigrant kid, the only brown kid in my classroom when I walked in, there lessons I learned from that time period that still reverberating today, through the time I was with CNN.</p><p>They were about standing up to a bully, because you can replace how to stand up to a dictator with how to stand up to a bully. It`s the exact same thing, how to embrace your fear. Like, I realized that it`s our own fears that get in our way. And how to embrace your fear? Well, like, this one, I remember was, I didn`t know early on what a pajama party was.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: It`s a great story.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: So, my classmates invited me to it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: And I asked my mom, I was like, mom, do -- is that a party? You wear pajamas? And she was like, yes.</p><p>So, we show up. And we`re rounding -- we`re pulling up in front of the House. And it was 4:00 in the afternoon. And all the kids were playing kickball, and they were not wearing pajamas.</p><p>So...</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Such a great story.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Then I got out of the car. And then my classmate came and helped me, right?</p><p>So, you kind of just -- I learned to confront my fear. I learned to move forward and trust someone will be there. And then I hope, when it`s my turn to help someone else, that I will be there.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And you have cemented your reputation. You worked in -- as we said, in journalism in the Philippines for CNN, and then you created, what, a little over a decade ago, this forward-leaning news Web site called Rappler, earning the ire of the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, while he was in power. Now he`s now out of power.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But he considered you a threat.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Yes, I don`t really know why.</p><p>I think that meant he just considered accountability journalism a threat. He had attacked three different news groups, the largest newspaper, the largest broadcaster, and then we were the most -- and we were the largest online news site.</p><p>And we were the third attack, but we didn`t buckle because we had no other corporate interests. It was very easy to push up. This is a man who just wanted to make everyone afraid of him. And I think I was -- I was too old.</p><p>By that time, I had -- I was in my 50s. Being a breaking news war zone correspondent is the best training for that, because you sit there and, regardless of what`s happening around, you distill to three bullet points and you say it like it is.</p><p>And that`s kind of the way I dealt with this administration. We kept doing our jobs.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And along the way, you won the Nobel Peace Prize just in the last year or so.</p><p>And now there`s a new president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Bongbong.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Yes. Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you are -- are you still -- I mean, you`re -- there are still warrants out yes for you.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Yes.</p><p>In order to be here, I have to ask court approvals. Now one has gone all the way to the Supreme Court, the court of last resort. Sometimes, I get approval. Sometimes, I don`t. That is also, I think, calculated.</p><p>And you really don`t know how much you value your freedom until you begin to lose it. Now we just were -- it`s -- I don`t want to read the tea leaves. I want to just keep doing my job. And I think, in general, forget what`s happening in the Philippines. To me, what was more damaging, because this is what I demanded an end for in 2016, the impunity not just of Duterte, but also of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: That`s -- that was something we had no control over in the Philippines. But it enabled the rise of Duterte. It enabled the rise of Marcos.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And that`s what I want to ask you about, because now you are virtually on a crusade...</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: ... to tell the world about what social media is doing to democracy.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: It`s what I have lived through.</p><p>And it is both a blessing and a curse to be the target of attacks, of information operations. You`re the only one who feels it. Your attack meant -- these exponential attacks are meant to pound you to silence.</p><p>But the flip side of it is, if you`re a reporter, you sit there and you look at the data. And that started something different for us. It was investigative journalism. And it was -- just like what following the terrorists after 9/11, this one is a different type.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: It`s insidious manipulation. And the data proves it.</p><p>That`s what -- I lean on the facts.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: It`s evidence-based. It is bad for us.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Your message to Americans watching this is what? Because we`re having our own debate in this country about social media.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But you`re saying that it`s a warning sign, what happened in your country.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: Look at what`s happened to us because it`s coming for you.</p><p>This is what I said in 2016. When January 6 happened, it was Silicon Valley since coming home to roost. The fact that there is no legislation to prevent this insidious manipulation -- I mean, think about it like this, right? If you have kids, would you tell them to keep lying? You reward the lies.</p><p>That is what gets the greatest distribution online. It`s lies laced with anger and hate, fear, us against them. If you do this all the time, what kinds of societies do we create?</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So many important warnings -- stories and warnings, in this book by Maria Ressa, \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator: The Fight for Our Future.\"</p><p>It`s so good to see you again. Thank you, Maria.</p><p>MARIA RESSA: So wonderful to see you, Judy. Thanks for having me.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: More Muslim Americans ran for political office during this year`s midterms than ever before, 153 in total. That`s according to a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations and Jetpack Resource Center. And more of them won their races than in any past election.</p><p>Geoff Bennett has more.</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT: Judy, this year`s elections proved to be historic, with 89 Muslim American candidates winning local, state, federal and judicial seats across 25 states, according to that report.</p><p>Our next guest, Ruwa Romman, is among them. She`s the first known Muslim woman elected to the Georgia House of Representatives and the first PalestinianAmerican elected to any office in the state of Georgia.</p><p>Welcome to the \"NewsHour.\" It`s good to have you with us.</p><p>RUWA ROMMAN (D), Georgia State Representative-Elect: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT: Before you became a politician, you were a longtime volunteer in Democratic Party politics in the state of Georgia.</p><p>It`s one thing to be civically engaged. It`s another thing to decide to run for office yourself. What motivated your decision to launch a campaign?</p><p>RUWA ROMMAN: I did not decide to run for office is the best way to explain that.</p><p>I had done a lot of work with civic organizations focused on empowering and mobilizing historically marginalized communities, like my Muslim community. And one of those, Georgia Muslim Voter Project, had a training with some local partners to teach people how to run for office. My friend had asked me to attend to support the program and give them feedback on what they should be adding, since I have been doing that sort of work for a long time in Georgia.</p><p>A reporter was there. She writes a great article about the importance of civic engagement for minorities in the state. But she started out with, Ruwa Romman is contemplating a run for office, which I was not. But it was a fair assumption since I was at this training. And my community was so excited, they asked me to run. And, 15 days later, we launched my campaign.</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT: You are an immigrant. You`re the granddaughter of Palestinian refugees. You`re a Muslim woman who wears a hijab.</p><p>What has the road to political office been like for you?</p><p>RUWA ROMMAN: It`s been long, and it`s been unexpected sometimes. But it`s also been one built by those who`ve come before me.</p><p>The woman who ran in my seat four years ago is also a Muslim woman. Her name is Aisha Yaqoob. She founded the Georgia Muslim Voter Project. She`s currently the executive director of Asian American Advocacy Fund.</p><p>And my win is as a result of that investment, that almost-decade-long investment by the Muslim community, by other minority groups in Georgia that said, hey, we`re tired of these decisions being made about us, but without our voices. It`s time we were at those tables.</p><p>And so, for years now, these organizations have worked to build the infrastructure needed for campaigns like mine.</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT: Is that what you think accounts for the historic number of Muslim Americans who are not just running for elected office, but, in this last election, won?</p><p>RUWA ROMMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>We have been able to show over years now that, as the community continues to invest time, of course, money, of course, but also their vote, their civic participation, their work and coalitions with other organizations, that we can make history happen. And that`s exactly what happened in Georgia.</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT: You ran on a platform focused on increasing public school funding, tackling Medicaid, expanding voting rights.</p><p>How does your background, how does your experience inform your approach to policymaking?</p><p>RUWA ROMMAN: I have been doing this work in Georgia for almost 10 years. I have learned how the General Assembly works here.</p><p>I have the knowledge and the experience to be able to come to the table and say, look, there`s a better way of doing this. There`s a way of doing this that will benefit Georgians across the board, not just the select few. And I`m really excited to be able to bring that expertise to the table in a way that says, we don`t have to turn everything into who`s going to make the best headline today.</p><p>It`s who can pass the best piece of legislation to help the most Georgians. And that`s why we ran the campaign the way that we did this year, which is focusing on putting public service back into politics, focusing on the issues, and making sure that we`re able to reach voters and talk to voters at every avenue that we could.</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT: In an election year, most of the attention is focused on lawmakers, it`s focused on politicians at the national level.</p><p>You have said that state lawmakers shouldn`t be overlooked. Tell me more about that.</p><p>RUWA ROMMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>I always remind people that every piece of legislation that either you love on a national level or absolutely hate on a national level started in a state legislature somewhere around the country. At the end of the day, these laws start right here, in our case, whether it`s the heartbeat bill or other pieces of legislation as it pertains to immigration, as it pertains to taxes, even as it pertains to health care.</p><p>We saw this with Obamacare. These things always start at the state level. And us, as state representatives, are the ones that you can reach out to say, look, here`s how this personally impacts me. And your voice is now part of a much smaller group of people. So it`s even more powerful.</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT: Ruwa Romman, just elected to the Georgia StateHouse of Representatives, thanks so much for your time and for your insight.</p><p>RUWA ROMMAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The president halts a railroad strike, lawmakers shield gay marriage, and Democrats shake up the road to the White House.</p><p>To consider this week`s news, the analysis of Brooks and Capehart. That`s New York Times columnist David Brooks, and Jonathan Capehart, associate editor for The Washington Post.</p><p>Hello to both of you.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: Hello.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I`m so glad you had a good Thanksgiving meat. You just reassured me that that -- that that was the case.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Let`s start, Jonathan, with the newest news.</p><p>And that is what the Democratic Party is doing. They took a vote today. They are moving up South Carolina. This is the primary calendar in 2024. It`s a ways away. It`s more than -- a little more than a year away, but with big consequences. What does it say to you, South Carolina and Michigan earlier, Iowa...</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: Well, right.</p><p>It`s more than just moving South Carolina up. It`s a total reorganization of the calendar and cramming a lot in, in the month of February. So, with South Carolina going first, clearly, what the what the party wants to do is make sure that the first state that votes in a presidential primary election is one that demographically looks more like the country than, say, Iowa, and with, if memory serves, about a quarter of the electorate in South Carolina is African American.</p><p>And so that makes a lot of sense. And I think there are a lot of people within the Democratic Party, especially after the debacle of the Iowa caucuses in 2020, were really pushing for a state more representative of the country having a say early, if not first, about who the nominee of the party should be.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David, this is something pushed by President Biden. What do you make of it?</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: Well, if anybody had any doubts that Biden is running for reelection, I think they were ended today. Like, he like took over the whole primary process.</p><p>The state to go first is the state he`s probably most likely to win of all the 50 states. It propelled him last time, which it propelled him last time. And he just said, no, you`re -- we`re going to do it my way. And whatever you guys have been talking about, that`s nice. We`re going to do it my way.</p><p>And he has prevailed. And so I think, for the reasons Jonathan said, it`s not only ruthless politics, but it`s also probably the right thing to do.</p><p>The one lament -- because we want states that are a little more diverse up front. The one thing I do lament, aside from the heck that I like going to Iowa and New Hampshire -- it`s very comfortable and beautiful. The people are very earnest. But I lament the possibility that it will end small-scale retail politics.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: Because in Iowa and New Hampshire, you -- a candidate like Pete Buttigieg can come there and just live in Des Moines, and, really, 10, 15 people at a time, can build a following.</p><p>Now there`s going to be big states. They`re going to be all at once. You`re going to have to -- it`ll help the candidates who have a lot of money and a lot of name recognition. And so an outsider, a Pete Buttigieg, frankly, a Barack Obama, will, I think, probably find it a little harder to come from relatively nowhere and then ride a tide.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I remember Jimmy Carter, who I covered a long time, sleeping in people`s guest bedrooms all over the state of Iowa.</p><p>But what I`m really going to miss, Jonathan, Iowa State Fair, the butter sculptures, that big competition.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: I once saw the Last Supper sculpted in butter life-size.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: It was the highlight of all my life.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I`m trying to get an image of that in my head.</p><p>So, a lot was going on this week, Congress back in session, and they moved pretty quickly to address this rail strike, imposing a settlement on rail workers, bipartisan. What do you make of what they did? Is it good for the country? Is it good for the rail workers?</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: It is good for the country, in that, if rail -- if there had been a rail strike, that would have hit 30 percent of the economy. It would have ground things to a standstill, right at the time when American consumers, when Americans are most sensitive. And that is when they`re doing all of their holiday shopping.</p><p>I mean, remember the supply chain conversations we were having a year ago this time, people losing their minds that they couldn`t get their gifts. This had to be done. I think this president, of all presidents, is the one who was able to cobble together the deal in the first place that then got rejected.</p><p>It`s a federal law that makes it possible for the president and Congress to impose this deal on rail workers. But the issues that the rail workers were about to strike over are not insignificant. Paid sick leave is something that is -- that`s something that they need to discuss. That`s something that is not an unreasonable ask, especially when rail companies are sitting on billions upon billions of dollars in profits last year.</p><p>But the workers had no leverage, unlike, say, fast-food workers or other workers around the country, who for whom a strike is that leverage point to get what they want and what they need.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And they didn`t get the paid sick leave.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: Yes.</p><p>And it is -- the administration said there could have been 675,000 job losses, costing billions of dollars a day. Nonetheless, I`m a little -- not that I`m singing solidarity for every -- every morning, but, basically, the government took away the workers` right to strike or their ability to strike.</p><p>And that imbalances the negotiation going -- if the railroad companies think, oh, well, the government will step in and take away the ability to strike, then that alters how they`re going to negotiate. And so it alters the balance.</p><p>So, I worry a little about the -- sort of the moral hazard of government stepping in. And, somehow, it reminds me, in sort of an inverse case, I thought the bailout of the banks in 2008 was the right thing to do. Nonetheless, it is clear that the moral hazard, the way the government behaved had long-term moral and cultural effects on this country, because people thought, the system is rigged.</p><p>And if workers decide, if we lose the ability to strike, then the system is a little rigged against us, and that could lead to some level of cynicism and distrust.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: But that`s why you need to -- this law needs to be changed.</p><p>It`s not like the president and Congress said, well, we will just make you take it just by fiat. The law says that that`s what they -- they have the power to do that. So, to do what you`re saying, David, they need to change the law to give those rail workers the opportunity to strike.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were saying weighing it against what it would mean for the economy if the -- if this went on, if it wasn`t resolved.</p><p>Another thing that the two parties were able to come together on, Jonathan, was on protecting same-sex and interracial marriage in America. What does this amount to? What`s the significance?</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: Well, I`m smiling from ear to ear. As someone -- an out, gay married man in an interracial marriage, I`m double -- doubly covered.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: Look, in the grand scheme of things, this is a terrific thing, to have -- to ensure that, if Obergefell is rendered unconstitutional, my marriage will still be recognized by the federal government.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Supreme Court decision.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: The Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage.</p><p>If Obergefell goes away, though, this is where -- the problem I have with the law, my marriage is protected, but if my husband and I move back to North Dakota, where he`s from, same-sex marriage is banned, by Constitution -- in the Constitution and in -- by state law.</p><p>If Obergefell goes away, same as when Dobbs overturn Roe v. Wade -- instantly, 35 states ban same-sex marriage. So, if we meet friends, a same- sex couple that wants to get married in North Dakota, they would have to leave the state, go to New York, go to California, go somewhere where marriage is -- same-sex marriage is legal, and then come home.</p><p>And the state would be forced, because of this law, to recognize their marriage. That is a burden, an unfair burden, on couples who all they want to do is solemnize their relationships, and also protect their families, because, more often than not, these same-sex couples want to get married either to start a family or to protect the family that they have.</p><p>And if Congress really wants to do something to protect LGBTQ Americans, and certainly same-sex -- same-sex married couples, they would pass the Equality Act. It`s out of the House. It`s been sitting in the Senate. All they need to do is pass it in the lame-duck, and things would be great.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So how much of a step forward is this?</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: I think it`s a very significant step forward, first, in the matter of justice that.</p><p>I think there are now over a billion same-sex married -- same-sex -- a billion.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: Billion.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: A million.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: More than...</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: A million. A million.</p><p>So, what, we`re going to take away those people`s marriages? Like, is that pro-family? So I don`t think -- I don`t think -- that would be just a tremendous wrong to do that. And, as Joe Biden says, love is love, and people should get married.</p><p>I think the thing I`m also very hopeful about is that this represents a path out of some of the culture wars. So, the history of this is that, in 2008, the LDS Church campaigned against gay marriage in a California proposition. The blowback was so strong, they said, wait, we got to rethink this issue.</p><p>So they went to the LGBT community in Utah and said, let`s have a compromise. Gay marriage will be on the books, but our religious freedom will be protected, so the government will not take away our tax status.</p><p>And so they made this compromise. And this is sort of what happened here. So, the National Association for Evangelicals supports this. The CCCU, the -- all the Christian colleges support this, because they were terrified that they would get their tax status taken away because of their religious beliefs.</p><p>And so this was a group of people coming together across the culture war, saying, what you want is to protect your marriages. What we need is to not have our tax status taken away. We want religious freedom.</p><p>And so they both got what they want. They did a deal. And that`s the way politics should work.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: We are...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I see your face, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: No, no, I was...</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I see the look on your face.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: Well, only because, I mean, I -- the religious exemptions offend me personally, because there are some people who are going to use their personal beliefs and hide behind religion to discriminate against people like me and families like mine.</p><p>And there`s no -- there would be no legal recourse for me and my husband or other, these billion, million same-sex married couples in the United States to hold someone accountable for not giving us the services we should constitutionally be able to avail ourselves of. That`s all.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: I`m sympathetic to that.</p><p>But, as I understand this law, if a -- if you went to a baker and said, we want you to bake our wedding cake, he still has to bake the wedding cake, because I understand that it`s mostly what they were worried about is their view of Scripture is that God doesn`t support gay marriage or same-sex marriages. And they don`t -- if -- they don`t want to be forced to perform gay marriages or face losing their tax status.</p><p>And I do not agree with them, but there are a lot of people in this country who believe in Scripture and believe this is what Scripture says. And I think it`s a willing sacrifice to give people their religious freedom so we can live together.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: And, to be clear, it`s both those things.</p><p>It`s not putting their tax-exempt status to risk, but also not putting themselves at risk for denying service, i.e., foster care or other services, in all sorts of institutions.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Only a few seconds left, but I did want to say it`s a little over a week since former President Trump had dinner with Nick Fuentes, the known neo-Nazi, and every other -- I think now you can -- you can say that it isn`t positive.</p><p>We asked members of Congress for their reaction, and many of them are still not commenting on it. Interesting.</p><p>DAVID BROOKS: There`s a glass half full or half empty. A lot did not comment. But, more than usual, Republicans condemned Trump, more than average.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: It`s reprehensible.</p><p>If a Republican is in leadership, they should have been out there within hours of finding out about this dinner. This is what`s leading to the corrosion of political discourse. And, in our society, we have people who are openly, openly antisemitic, and no consequences. That`s outrageous.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Tough to think about.</p><p>Jonathan Capehart, David Brooks, thank you both.</p><p>JONATHAN CAPEHART: Thanks, Judy.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be back shortly with a rapper and actor who is encouraging fans to find their purpose in life.</p><p>But, first, take a moment to hear from your local PBS station. It`s a chance to offer your support, which helps to keep programs like ours on the air.</p><p>For those stations staying with us, the Great Salt Lake in Utah is shrinking because of population growth and an ongoing megadrought worsened by climate change.</p><p>Stephanie Sy explored the lake earlier this year to learn more. Here`s a reprise of her report.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Reaching the waters of the Great Salt Lake from almost any direction these days is a hike.</p><p>And Brian Footen is carrying a heavy load. Founder of the EarthViews Conservation Society, he`s equipped a kayak with cameras and sensors, mobile tools to map the receding shoreline.</p><p>BRIAN FOOTEN, Co-Founder, EarthViews Conservation Society: This is going to log water quality data every 10 seconds, things like temperature, dissolved oxygen.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Satellite images capture the extent of the lake`s shrinkage since 1985, but Footen says there is nothing like bringing the public right to its dwindling surface through his interactive Web site.</p><p>BRIAN FOOTEN: It doesn`t take charts and graphs and big scientific reports to tell the story, right? All you have to do is go out there and look.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: And so we did, paddling through shallow waters with an astonishing vacancy of life.</p><p>This northern arm of the lake is already forever changed by human decisions. The red tint is a result of extremely high salinity. It was choked off from the rest of the lake years ago to build a railroad causeway.</p><p>BRIAN FOOTEN: The Great Salt Lake is drying up. Climate change is responsible. You know, developers are responsible. And it just goes -- it goes over top of people`s heads, right?</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Yes.</p><p>BRIAN FOOTEN: So, what were doing is using this imagery as a way to kind of go, wow, look at this. This is really happening.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Footen also sends the data he collects to biologist Bonnie Baxter.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER, Westminster College: The water is way out there now.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: We meet her on the southern end of the Great Salt Lake. It is eerily quiet and smells of brine.</p><p>I feel like were in the middle of just a dead zone here.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: Yes.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: It feels like another planet.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: So, it`s like a dead coral reef. It`s like a cemetery. And these are the tombstones.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Yes. It feels like that.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: Yes.</p><p>If we see larvae in the water, or pupal casings, there are sharpies to write on.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Baxter brings researchers from Westminster College to gather specimens weekly.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: These mounds should be covered with maps of microorganisms that do photosynthesis and bring the suns energy into the lake system.</p><p>But you can see that they`re dry and they`re not green and they`re out of the water. Even the ones in the water are not healthy, because they`re too salty. The ones out of the water are too dry.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: The mounds are called microbialites.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: This is the foundation of the Great Salt Lake ecosystem. And we`re seeing it crash and die right before our eyes.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: The lake is at its lowest level in history. As a result, it`s becoming too salty even for species adapted to high salinity.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: We`re not seeing any fly pupae today. That`s terrifying.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Brine flies feed the millions of birds that flock here, as do brine shrimp, which are also harvested. It is just one part of the $1.3 billion economic output of the Great Salt Lake.</p><p>To understand why the lake is drying up, you have to zoom out to the surrounding areas of the lake`s namesake, Salt Lake City.</p><p>ERIN MENDENHALL (D), Mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah: The state of Utah as a whole is the fastest growing state in the nation.</p><p>Yellow is the new green.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Erin Mendenhall is the mayor, a Democrat.</p><p>ERIN MENDENHALL: Salt Lake City, as the capital, is seeing more growth in terms of units each year than almost anywhere else in the state.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: There are more city residents than ever, but they`re actually using less water.</p><p>ERIN MENDENHALL: We are absolutely committed to saving this lake with whatever we can. Last year, that was 2.6 billion gallons of water Salt Lakers conserved. This year, it`s already up to 2.9 billion gallons.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: The city`s achieved that not by mandating water restrictions, but by raising water rates about 15 percent a year, and implementing a tiered rate structure.</p><p>ERIN MENDENHALL: So, the more you consume, those water rates go up even faster. And these water rates reflect the urgency that we feel as Salt Lakers.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: But beyond the capital, developments are spring up along the Wasatch Front, single-family homes with lawns full of Kentucky bluegrass that demands daily watering.</p><p>JENNIFER LAIR, Salt Lake City Resident: It`s ephedra, so something that is a native species.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: In Salt Lake City, Jennifer and John Lair are part of a grassroots movement to swap bluegrass lawns for native plants that need less water.</p><p>JENNIFER LAIR: Especially with the kind of exponential growth that the Wasatch Front has seen and expects to see for the next 25, 30 years, there just isn`t going to be enough water.</p><p>JOHN LAIR, Salt Lake City Resident: It makes us wonder if we need to be thinking about living somewhere else. I mean, it`s an idea we toss around. How seriously? It kind of depends on the day. Of course, the question then becomes, where do you go from there? Where is not going to be impacted by climate change?</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: While conservation efforts by residents of Salt Lake City will definitely help, it may not be enough. Two-thirds of the water in the Great Salt Lake watershed goes to agriculture, including the water from the Bear River.</p><p>It irrigates the farms and ranches whose yields Utah families have relied on since Mormon pioneers settled the region in the 1800s, fulfilling, they believed, a biblical prophecy to make the desert blossom.</p><p>JOEL FERRY, Director, Utah Department of Natural Resources: I don`t know what normal looks like anymore. It`s been a long time since we have had good winters and good moisture.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Joel Ferry has a unique perspective. A fifth-generation Utah cattle rancher, he`s also a former Republican state representative and now the director of the state`s Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>JOEL FERRY: Water in the state of Utah is a prior appropriation. So whoever used it first has the first right to use it today. And a lot of those rights belong to farmers.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Is it time for that to change?</p><p>JOEL FERRY: Well, no, I mean, we have -- we have laws and we have structure. So what is time for us to do is to implement more conservation measures.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Bipartisan support for conserving water for the Great Salt Lake led to a dozen laws enacted this year by the Republican-dominated state government. The reforms, among many provisions, do away with use-or- lose water policies.</p><p>JOEL FERRY: We passed legislation that me, as a farmer, I can say, you know what, I`m going to take my water, I`m going to put it in the river, and I will receive a beneficial use, which totally changes the mind-set of that use it or lose it.</p><p>I might say, wheat is not worth very much. I don`t want it. I`m going to get some compensation if I leave it in the river.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: One of the biggest worries is that the Great Salt Lake will go the way others have gone before it, not just drying up and ceasing to be a source of water, but becoming a source of poison.</p><p>Biologist Bonnie Baxter says more than 40 percent of the lake bed is no longer covered by water and could turn to dust.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: We are likely to see an increase in dust storms as we expose more shorelines. We`re likely to see more dust.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: And that is toxic dust...</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: Yes.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: ... because there is arsenic and heavy metal in this lake bed.</p><p>BONNIE BAXTER: Exactly. Right.</p><p>So, the -- breathing these small particles has a huge impact on human health, but then you talk about the heavy metals and what that does to a system over time, and that`s a little scary.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: Other dried-out Salt Lakes provide a cautionary tale. In the early 20th century, water from the Sierra Nevada Mountains was diverted from Owens Lake to growing Los Angeles. By the 1920s, the lake was dry. And, for decades after, toxic dust plumes sickened area residents.</p><p>It is only one reason why, for hours a day, Brian Footen paddles along the lake`s shoreline, documenting its disappearance.</p><p>BRIAN FOOTEN: I think one of the big stories that`s being missed in the talk about the climate and the drought and the agriculture and the development in Salt Lake is that this is a unique ecosystem on the planet. There`s nothing else like it.</p><p>STEPHANIE SY: And that, in itself, he says, is a reason for saving it.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I am Stephanie Sy at the Great Salt Lake in Utah.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Here is a question that a Houston-born, first-generation Nigerian-American artist asked himself and then others as he has built his following through his music and his acting: What`s your purpose?</p><p>Jeffrey Brown went to Houston to learn more about the man who was just nominated for a Grammy in the best new artist category.

But his heart remains in Houston. And that`s where we met him at the White Oak Music Hall rehearsing for an upcoming date in London. As it`s been from the start, this is a family affair, his wife, Martica, beside him on stage, their three young children, age 3, 2, and 1, always nearby, dancing while daddy sings, musicians, dancers, 14, all local, all friends.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: It`s the only way I know to operate, because I didn`t have any foreknowledge of how else to operate in the industry. So I just utilized the resources and people that were in my actual life.</p><p>It`s people that I have built trust with. And I just prefer it that way. It`s sweeter like that to me.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: The original all-consuming purpose for Nwigwe?</p><p>ANNOUNCER: It`s intercepted!</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Football.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Nwigwe scores for the Texans!</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: He was a star linebacker in high school and at the University of North Texas, and had the NFL in his sights, until a foot injury his senior year ended that dream.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: I swear I been broke way too long.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Instead, he developed a plan that`s guided him since. His new purpose would be helping others find theirs. Seeing many young people adrift, some into drugs and violence, he started a nonprofit to work in local schools, using what he called edutainment, entertainment education.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: I just use a lot of the natural skill sets that I had, the charisma, not being scared to speak in public and do skits and all that type of stuff, to really try to motivate students and kids to just get on the path to figure out what their purpose is, not, you come here, and we`re going to tell you what your purpose is, but just on some, like, really, like, you should start trying to figure that out early.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Nwigwe is a first-generation child of Nigerian immigrants. His full first name is Tobechukwu, which means \"Praise God.\"</p><p>And he credits part of his drive and motivation to that heritage, as in his description of his parents` approach to school report cards.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: Let me tell you have a B stands for bonehead. C is for can`t you get an A? D is for dummy. F is for fools. And fools can no longer stay in this house. But A is for appreciation.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: That`s what you`re showing when you go out and get A`s, because now you`re showing that you appreciate my sacrifice. You appreciate all the things that I have done to make your life special.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Another driving force, his Christian faith, heard in one of his biggest hits to date, \"Try Jesus.\" In fact, he first gained attention and built his audience with what he called Get Twisted Sundays, a weekly music video posted on social media with the force of a sermon, often centered on the power of Black family and love.</p><p>Starting from scratch, he`s involved in everything from designing the clothes to the choreography to the marketing.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: What I landed on was, I`m just going to market myself as myself, and I`m going to put out...</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: Wait a minute. You`re going to market yourself as yourself.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: Yes.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, that sounds pretty normal.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: Yes.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: But maybe it`s not in the music business?</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: Yes, it`s really not. You would be surprised. I have encountered in this industry a lot of people doing stuff that ain`t really them.</p><p>And I`m like, oh, I thought you was like this because you portray this type of character. And it`s like: Nah, I`m really not.</p><p>No knock to anybody who does it like that. Me personally, it`s just my art and my real life are, like, synonymous.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: The music served the message, and both took off.</p><p>A short and simple track about the police killing of Breonna Taylor went viral. He performed a tribute to Houston on NPR`s nationally renowned \"Tiny Desk\" series.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: That`s all we`re trying to do, is to get you to understand, like, I know there`s a way that music is done. There`s ways that life is done. But you don`t have to necessarily subscribe to a way that you don`t fully agree with or a way that the world does it that makes you feel like, yo, this is the only way.</p><p>You can branch out, do your own thing, stand on your own principles, stand on your own beliefs, and do what you believe in.</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: For now, there`s more acting to come. Tobe Nwigwe will make his big screen debut in the next \"Transformers\" film due next spring.</p><p>TOBE NWIGWE: All right, Houston, you ready?</p><p>JEFFREY BROWN: And there`s lots more music.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Jeffrey Brown in Houston.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: In other words, we`re going to be hearing a lot more about him.</p><p>And on the \"NewsHour\" online: how a famous children`s book author is trying to inspire a new generation of authors by building a library for school kids in Malawi. That story is at PBS.org/NewsHour.</p><p>Be sure to join Yamiche Alcindor and her panel on \"Washington Week\" later tonight right here on PBS. And tune into \"PBS News Weekend.\" That`s tomorrow.</p><p>And that`s the \"NewsHour\" for tonight. I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p>For all of us at the \"PBS NewsHour,\" thank you, please stay safe, and we`ll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSHR-2022120201cb112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSHR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:670T-XC21-F053-D2DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 MacNeil/Lehrer Productions All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>PBS NewsHour (formerly The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 2, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002LOB</classCode><className>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Art</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Utah</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Minorities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Employment and Unemployment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Maria Ressa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Family Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTA1NEVGNjU1QUFBNDAyMUIyMDM3MjQ5M0M4NTI1MjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDBDQzM0MkIyRjFDNEU2Rjk0QUQzNDY1ODczRUE0REQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Same Sex Marriages</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhFNUU2MUZFRjJCNEFDQjg3ODk1N0NCRjgzQTA4MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzlENkE4OENDOTNFNDg1RUEyNzBBMzcyQkE4MjM0Q0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Interracial Marriages</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEQyMjUwQjQ2QTc3NDdCODk5NjgyMzRENTVGRTIxQjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzFERDgwRDcyNzg3NDM0QUI5OTU1RjMxNENBQ0E1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001377</classCode><className>PRIMARY ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000150</classCode><className>AWARDS &amp;

Chris Smith (NJ-04).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Defense will provide funding to six projects in New Jersey (see list below) that promote land conservation near military sites, including $380,000 for a firebreak project to be built near the Roosevelt City section of Whiting. The firebreak will simultaneously protect the military mission of JB-MDL.</p><p>\"This modest but important federal funding will go a long way toward protecting areas near our military bases that are susceptible to forest fires,\" Smith said. \"According to the NJ Forest Fire Service, more than 7,000 acres a year are consumed by an average of 1,500 wildfires in New Jersey, the most densely populated State in the union. The firebreak project will be in Manchester Township, home to nearly 44,000 people and many senior retirement communities,\" he said.</p><p>PHOTO: Much of the 65-square mile Joint Base-MDL consists of forests. (U.S. Army Photo by Staff Sgt. Shawn Morris, at JB-MDL, 2013)</p><p>Manchester Township Mayor Ken Palmer said that he liked the idea of added fire protection for the Whiting section of the township.</p><p>\"We welcome any effort to provide firebreaks in the most wooded portion of our town,\" Palmer said. \"Certainly, any safety measure to assist in this area is appreciated and extremely useful.\"</p><p>Smith noted that the \"$380,000 slated toward building a five-mile long firebreak near JB-MDL will protect people and property to the west of Whiting.\"</p><p>\"This area in Whiting is part of the New Jersey Pine Barrens is vulnerable to forest fires in the dry seasons or droughts,\" Smith said. \"This project protects America's only Army-Navy-Air Force joint base--the second largest employer in New Jersey--and the missions it performs. More importantly, it also protects the residents of Whiting. There are many homes and businesses concentrated in Whiting which will be better protected through this project.\"</p><p>The DoD awarded the funds from its Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program that promotes projects with local partners to collaborate in the preservation of compatible land uses near military installations, ranges and other strategic sites. REPI is designed to protect DoD assets and capabilities to maintain military readiness throughout the United States.</p><p>Smith said Naval Weapons Station Earle, headquartered in the Fourth District he represents, has been a leader in seeking the REMI grant. Dennis Blazak, Community Plans and Liaison Officer at Earle, has pursued this competitive funding for several years.</p><p>A total of $1,935,564.98 will be distributed to protect six military sites across 1.6 million acres in the Garden State that are threatened by development and encroachment which could impact the military mission:</p><p>* $500,000 for storm surge protection for Naval Weapons Station Earle in Middletown, Monmouth County;</p><p>* $500,000 for living shoreline protection in the form of a \"T\"-shaped oyster castle groin in Barnegat Bay, in Ocean County near Island Beach State Park.</p><p>* $380,000 for wildfire mitigation near Joint Base MDL in Ocean/Burlington counties (Whiting project);</p><p>* $300,000 to protect 44,000 acres of forest area in the Greenwood State from wildfire near the NJ National Guard Warren Grove Gunnery Range in Ocean/Burlington counties;</p><p>* $150,000 for Rancocas Creek Watershed stormwater management to protect the area near Lockheed Martin plant that produces AEGIS technology for the U.S. Navy in Burlington County, and;</p><p>* over $100,000 for storm surge protection near Earle, in Keansburg, Monmouth County.</p><p>PHOTO: Naval Weapons Station Earle sailors assist the NY/NJ Baykeepers install oyster castles in the waters off Earle's pier to establish a living shoreline at the entrance of Ware Creek (undated U.S. Navy file photo taken by Bill Addison)</p><p>The projects are being done in conjunction with the lead partner, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, as well as local authorities, and they will be augmented with state and local resources.</p><p>The competitive funding announced was part of a $17 million effort across the country to fund projects at a dozen locations. There is no required state or local match for the federal funding.</p><p>\"These projects which the DoD has identified will help make the bases safer should we face any upcoming rounds of base realignment and closure (BRAC),\" Smith said, who successfully led the fight to reverse the planned closure of Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station in 1995, as well as helped in other fights to save Fort Dix and McGuire AFB in the 1990s, later merged into the Joint Base in 2009. \"Earle is a critical base for the Navy and its logistical shipping, and protecting its mission is crucial to national security, and to the jobs of the men and women who work there.\"</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409012\">https://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409012</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHMA20084H3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6140-SMP1-DYVR-P1W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 20, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'm Christina Macfarlane in for Max Foster here in London. Just ahead --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Great likelihood is that we will have a recession.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This 40 year high in inflation is having a real impact on the economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Consumers are shifting their spending to more essential categories like food and fuel.</p><p>REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL): Our investigation though it is not a criminal investigation certainly has brought some things to light that DOJ is watching.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: DOJ is now inside the White House for the first time. That's a big change.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is a hard grind, that's what Ukrainian commanders are predicting to try to push the Russian troops back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: It's Wednesday, July 27, 9:00 a.m. here in London, 4:00 a.m. in Washington. Where in the coming hours, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to hike its benchmark interest rate in the latest attempt to cool the economy and tame inflation. Second-quarter data on the country's GDP will be released tomorrow with analysts waiting to see if the numbers show that the economy has slowed again. Add in soaring prices, rising expenses and an ill performing stock market and it's creating the perfect recipe for recession fears. Despite all this, the White House remains confident the U.S. can steer clear of this one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Growth is slowing globally and I'm not saying that we will definitely avoid a recession.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think that we'll see a recession.</p><p>BRIAN DEESE, DIRECTOR, U.S. NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Citigroup, little of the data that I see tells me that the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Morgan Stanley, with strong job growth and continued robust final domestic demand and consumption, this economy really does not look particularly recessionary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: But most Americans aren't buying it though. A Morning Consult/Politico poll from earlier this month shows 65 percent of register voters already feel that they're in a recession and that sentiment is changing spending habits. McDonald's says despite small and frequent price increases to combat inflation, customers are still waiting to pay for the convenience. Chipotle has adopted the same practice. The reports says higher income customers have increased their visits while lower income customers are ordering as often. Luxury and big-ticket purchases are also on the decline as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy slipped for the third month in a row. CNN's Rahel Solomon has more now from New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The state of the economy this week with major corporate earnings and economic data. Tuesday, we learned consumer confidence fell for a third straight month with only 17 percent of people surveyed rating business conditions as good. Almost a quarter describe business conditions as bad. Consumer confidence gives us a look at several things, including how the public feels about the economy and perhaps more key, how they plan to spend.</p><p>Plans to make major purchases also signaled a slowdown. Investors feeling a slowdown as well after Microsoft and Google parent company Alphabet both reported weaker than expected earnings on Tuesday.</p><p>Walmart, meantime, reported it's already seeing a slowdown in where people are spending. The U.S. retailer warning that investor profits are likely to fall 11 percent to 13 percent for the fiscal year. Retailer says that while it's expecting to see more customers, inflation is forcing people to spend more on essentials like food and fuel and less on apparel. Walmart makes larger profits on categories like apparel as opposed to food.</p><p>[04:05:00]</p><p>Wednesday meantime we hear from the U.S. Federal Reserve where it's largely expected it will raise its benchmark interest rate by another three quarters of a percent. That then ripples through the economy and raises borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to car loans and credit cards. The Fed is hoping by raising borrowing costs we consumers spend less and bring a bit more balance in the supply of goods and the demand for those goods and services and this should lower inflation in the future. Speaking of inflation, we get another key inflation report on Friday.</p><p>In New York, Rahel Solomon, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: But it's not just the U.S. feeling the pain. The International Monetary Fund has downgraded its global growth forecast for the second time this year. The IMF chief economist says the outlook is gloomy and more uncertain. It now predicts the world economy will grow to reach just 3.2 percent by the end of 2022, that's nearly half of last year's outlook. The range of issues are cited for the change in the forecast include slowing trends in the world's top economies, high inflation, COVID-19 lockdowns and the war in Ukraine are just some of the issues impacting the global economy.</p><p>Well, Europe is also facing the prospect of a winter with much less natural gas to heat homes and businesses. Russian-owned Gazprom is cutting supply To the Nord Stream One pipeline to 20 percent of capacity. Moscow says more repairs are needed on the turbines in the pipeline. But European leaders say it's retaliation for sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. To deal with the problem the European Union is rationing its gas. Member countries have agreed to lower demand by 15 percent starting next week. But the cuts are voluntary and several EU members are exempt.</p><p>Let's see how European markets are reacting right now. As you can see all of them trending in the green there. And here is a quick look at the U.S. futures as well. Similar picture as you can see the Dow, Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 all in the green.</p><p>Twitter shareholders will be voting on whether to approve Elon Musk's proposed $44 billion merger agreement. The vote will take place during a virtual meeting scheduled for September 13th in spite of the company's ongoing legal fight with Musk. Twitter's board has unanimously recommended shareholders vote in favored of the deal. If they approve the vote could give Twitter additional leverage for its legal fight against Musk.</p><p>Now, an investigation into the efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election is getting deeper into the Trump White House and closer to the former president himself. The \"Washington Post\" reports the Justice Department is now looking directly at Donald Trump's actions as they continue to question his close allies. And U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland suggests prosecuting Trump is now a very real possibility. Ryan Nobles has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Attorney General Merrick Garland making it clear that his office will not hesitate to prosecute the former President Donald Trump if it finds evidence that Trump criminally stood in the way of the certification of the 2020 election. Garland in an interview with NBC said that there is no one who is above the law and that his office will pursue the matter without fear or favor. Take a listen. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: We pursue justice without fear or favor. We intend to hold everyone, anyone, who was criminally responsible for the events surrounding January 6 for any attempt to interfere with the lawful transfer of power from one administration to another accountable. That's what we do. We don't pay any attention to other issues with respect to that.</p><p>LESTER HOLT, HOST, NBC NIGHTLY NEWS: So, if Donald Trump were to become a candidate for president again, that would not change your schedule or how you move forward or don't move forward?</p><p>GARLAND: I'll say again that we will hold accountable anyone who was criminally responsible for attempting to interfere with the transfer, legitimate lawful transfer of power from one administration to the next.</p><p>NOBLES: Now, in the past Garland has been very specific about making sure that the Department of Justice is focused on the actual rioters that breached the building on January 6. In fact, that took up the lion's share of their investigation in its early stages.</p><p>But just recently, they have been expanding beyond just the rioters themselves, looking into election interference, looking into things like fake electors and other things and of course just this week we learned that they have brought before the grand jury two key Pence aides, Marc Short, Mike Pence's former chief of staff, and Greg Jacob his chief counsel. There's also reporting from the \"Washington Post\" and others that show that the investigation has expanded and has been questions directly asked about Donald Trump himself.</p><p>[04:10:02]</p><p>So, this is Garland saying that they will go where the evidence takes them. The other question of course is whether or not the January 6 Committee forces their hand by sending a criminal referral. Members of the committee this week said that they are very satisfied to see the Department of Justice moving forward, but the committee of course is not giving up. They still have hearings planned for September and a final report for later this year.</p><p>Ryan Nobles, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Well meantime, a former Trump defense secretary told the house committee that Trump never ordered him to have 10,000 troops ready to be deployed to the Capitol on January 6. Trump had previously said that he requested National Guard troops to be ready because he felt, quote, the crowd was going to be very large. Here's more from Chris Miller's testimony.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To be crystal clear, there was no direct order from President Trump to put 10,000 troops to be on the ready for January 6, correct? CHRIS MILLER, FORMER ACTING DEFENCE SECRETARY: No. Yeah, that's correct, there was no direct -- there was no order from the president.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Now as powerful as the January 6 hearings might be, a new CNN poll finds that they are not moving the needle very much in terms of how Americans view the Capitol riot. However, public consensus is growing that Donald Trump acted illegally or at least unethically in trying to hold on to office after the 2020 election. With 79 percent of those surveyed saying that that was the case. While 61 percent of Americans think that Trump's statements leading up to the attack encouraged violence.</p><p>Now the CEOs of at least two gun makers are due on Capitol Hill today to testify about the mass shootings in the U.S. The chair of the House oversight committee says it's long past time for the gun industry to be held accountable. She plans to show a video featuring survivors and victims' families from the recent mass shootings from Uvalde, Texas, Highland Park, Illinois and Buffalo, New York.</p><p>Now in just over three hours from now, U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner will take to the stand for the first time in her criminal trial. She's been detained in Russia since February on drug smuggling charges and had already pleaded guilty. Her defense team is asking for leniency. Well, this is a crucial week for Griner. Our Clare Sebastian is here with details on the case. It clear, what do we expect to hear from Griner the first time we'll hear from her today?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, really important day as you say, she is expected to testify in her own defense. I think the sense now we're getting from the case given that she's pled guilty -- which according to a source close to the case was her decision alone. And taking into account the fact that very tiny percentage of criminal cases in Russia end in acquittal, she decided to plead guilty and potentially to try to mitigate her case to try to improve the sense that she deserves leniency. This is a charge don't forget bringing drugs across border into Russia that carries a maximum ten year sentence. So, take a listen to what her lawyers had to say Tuesday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDER BOYKOV, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR BRITTNEY GRINER: We are still saying that she involuntarily brought them here because she was in a rush as she said packing and this medication, she just forgot to take it out of her luggage.</p><p>MARIA BLAGOVOLINA, DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR BRITTNEY GRINER: We have a lot of mitigating factors, so we do hope that the court will take it under consideration. And the court in Russia in fact has very broad discretion with regard to the sentence. So, we'll see what will happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, they're arguing that the cannabis oil that was in her luggage unintentionally, they're taking the intent out of the plea there. But they're saying that this was -- they brought in an oncologist actually to say that this was designed for medical purposes. That she was taking this sort of as an athlete for medical purposes which is allowed in the U.S. And she just didn't realize that she had packed it in her luggage and it wasn't allowed in Russia. Now course, leniency is one thing, her supporters they want her out of Russia. There is a very clear political side to this case as well.</p><p>MACFARLANE: But the reality is her fate is going to be unclear really until there is a verdict.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes. I mean, I think the sense is certainly we've heard from the Russian side and even from a U.S. official previously speaking to CNN that until she gets through this criminal trial and certainly admits responsibility, was a critical part of this. That they can't move on to any discussions of what to do with her in terms of bringing her back to the U.S. There's been speculation about a potential prisoner swap as we saw happening with another American detainee in Russia, Trevor Reed, who was released in April. We know that potentially New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson might be heading to Russia in the coming weeks. He was instrumental in Trevor Reed's case. So, it looks like there is potential movement on that but the trial has to and first.</p><p>MACFARLANE: And we'll watch very closely to see what Brittney Griner has to say today. Clare, thank you.</p><p>All right, the quick victory Russia expected in Ukraine has turned in to a grinding war of attrition, one that requires reinforcements by Russia appears to be deploying more troops.</p><p>Plus, from deadly flooding to devastating wildfires, the vast impact of the growing climate crisis is hitting home for millions of people.</p><p>[04:15:02]</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Catastrophic rain events over the past 24 hours across portions of Missouri, rainfall amounts exceeding a foot in a few spots. Additional heavy rainfall is in store. We'll touch on this coming up in a few minutes.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Extreme weather made worse by the climate crisis continues to ravage parts of the U.S. In Colorado, the Pueblo Fire Department rescued two people who were trapped by rushing water under a bridge. And in St. Louis, Missouri record-breaking rainfall has caused widespread flooding. Hundreds of people were rescued after they were left stranded on rooftops or in their cars. At least person was found dead in a flooded vehicle. CNN's Omar Jimenez has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look, you can't see nobody cars.</p><p>OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Roads turned into rivers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is the only road out of this area and it is impassable.</p><p>JIMENEZ (voice-over): An interstate shut down.</p><p>[04:20:00]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Interstate 70.</p><p>JIMENEZ (voice-over): And firefighters forced to make dozens of rescues, all as a record amount of rain fell in the St. Louis area in just a matter of hours.</p><p>CHIEF DENNIS JENKERSON, ST. LOUIS FIRE DEPARTMENT: We had approximately eight and a half feet of water that developed in a low lying area. And we were told by a civilian that there was a possibility of somebody in a car. As the water was receding. And we have pulled a civilian out of a vehicle that has passed.</p><p>JIMENEZ (voice-over): Others went scrambling for shelter.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I heard thunder early this morning. You know, I didn't think much of it went back to sleep and a couple hours later, just heard some water coming into the apartment. I woke up and there was a couple feet in and just keep coming up -- filling up.</p><p>JIMENEZ (voice-over): From midnight to 7:00 a.m., St. Louis got more than eight inches of rain. The previous record for one day was less than seven which happened all the way back in 1915. The surrounding St. Louis area saw anywhere from 6 to 10 inches overnight, according to the National Weather Service. Area officials urged everyone to avoid travel as they say they were getting 911 calls of multiple people stuck.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You don't know how deep it is. It's simply not safe. It's not worth the risk.</p><p>JIMENEZ (voice-over): Torrential rain left parts of the area almost unrecognizable, trapping cars on streets, flooding train tracks and homes.</p><p>Climate scientists say such turbulent weather is becoming more familiar as rising temperatures mean the atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more rain and more extreme conditions, from deadly heat to destructive fires, dangerous floods. It's a dynamic officials are increasingly trying to be prepared for across the country.</p><p>ALI ZAIDI, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY NATIONAL CLIMATE ADVISOR: Whether it's the extreme heat affecting tens of millions of Americans or the hurricanes, or the droughts, this is the new normal. This is a climate emergency.</p><p>JIMENEZ (voice-over): In St. Louis, the floodwaters are receding. But scientists say the chances of this happening again are only going up. Omar Jimenez, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Well, in California crews are making progress as they battle a wildfire raging near Yosemite National Park. The Oak Fire has burned through more than 18,000 acres around 7,500 hectares. Fire officials hope rising humidity and cooling temperatures will help them get the blaze under control.</p><p>And in Texas, at least nine homes were destroyed after a grass fire exploded into an inferno near Dallas. Another 17 homes were damaged. Families are getting a look -- their first look at the destruction, and the sense of loss was palpable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL JARAMILLO, LOST HOME IN BATCH SPRINGS, TEXAS FIRE: I really do remember when we first came here, when we first took a look at the house, this was our house and like this is the only thing I've got now. And I just got to start all over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Officials say the flames are now completely out, but north Texas is still facing an elevated fire risk. CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri has those details plus the latest on Missouri's deadly flooding.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Yes, good morning, Christina. You know, you look at the rainfall amounts and it almost appears that it fell out of a tropical storm, a land falling hurricane, but this wasn't the case here as over a foot of rainfall observed across portions of Missouri, historic amounts even in St. Louis. And anytime you look at areas with this much rainfall, we know it's quite a rare event. In fact, statistically it has a 500 year recurrence interval, which means that there is a 1 in 500 chance for this to happen in any given year or less than 1 percent probability. So very rare setup that led to this flooding across this region. And the rainfall amount pretty expansive here as the storm continued to soak this landscape for many hours in a row.</p><p>The disturbance responsible it's shifting a little farther toward the east. There's a slight risk for severe weather east of this region as well, but the rainfall threat going to remain rather high. Now it is east of St. Louis, although there is a marginal risk for St. Louis. But notice around Charleston, around portions of Louisville, Charleston, West Virginia into Nashville, Tennessee, all of these areas from Wednesday and Thursday could see rounds of heavy rainfall in store for them.</p><p>Now on the western United States, the story has been all about the heat. Parts of California, parts of Washington state seeing record temperatures in the past 24 hours as excessive heat stays put here for the next couple of days. What we're watching here when it comes to heat here of course really impacting the fire weather situation around the western United States as well and heat alerts will continue. Some areas as warm as 109 degrees across Oregon and Washington with Seattle really running away here with the incredible amount of heat in store.</p><p>Should be around 79 this time of year. Notice, they'll be well into the 90s for at least the next several days around the Northwest.</p><p>Now, west of Yosemite National Park, the Oak Fire, 18,000 acres consumed, about 26 percent containment, we could use some he rainfall. We've got plenty of it around parts of the Southwest, but not quite to us here across portions of California. So that is what we're watching here.</p><p>[04:25:00]</p><p>Arizona into New Mexico, we'll get some beneficial rainfall help with the drought situation there. Looks like maybe a slight possibility we'll tap into some moisture into portions of California but not nearly enough to douse the fires across this region. In Portland, we'll aim for 97 degrees, in St. Louis around 87, but in New York high temperatures should be in the middle 80s -- Christina.</p><p>MACFARLANE: All right, well in Germany, hundreds of firefighters are struggling to contain a forest fire raging in the northeast. Conditions are especially dry after the recent heatwave making it easier for the fire to spread. On top of that, officials say crews have to be extra cautious because ammo from an old military base is buried there. To the south firefighters are battling another powerful blaze near the German/Czech border.</p><p>Well, too much rain is the problem in southern Pakistan. Several regions have been inundated during the monsoon season, at least 89 people have been killed and authorities say July rainfall in the Balochistan is nearly 450 percent above average. Hundreds of people are stranded after two bridges washed out. And Pakistan's military is helping with rescue efforts and emergency response teams are providing basic food and medical care.</p><p>Now, Russia appears to be ramping up its presence in southern Ukraine. As Ukrainian forces try to retake lost land. We'll have a live report from Odesa.</p><p>And we also look ahead to Mike Pence and his former boss Donald Trump who were in Washington laying out their plans for the future in dueling speeches. .</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I always say I ran the first time and I won. And then I ran a second time and I did much better. We got millions and millions more votes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM.

After all, one of his most famous albums was recorded in a prison! However, fans might not know that Cash was arrested more than half a dozen times   and maybe not for the reasons they expect. </p><p>Johnny Cash rose from a humble backgroundJohnny Cash recorded Folsom Prison Blues live on this day in 1968! pic.twitter.com/WUEgP8kANM[4]   DoYouRemember? (@DoYouRemember) January 13, 2021[5]RELATED:Why Johnny Cash Went to Folsom State Prison to Record His 1st Live Album[6]Born in 1932 in Arkansas, Cash's childhood was marked by his family's status as sharecroppers and his mother's devout devotion to the Pentecostal church. According toBiography.com [7], Cash started writing songs when he was just 12 years old, and his mother managed to get together enough money to help nurture her son's passion with singing lessons. ;The teacher, however, urged Cash to stop lessons after just three sessions, insisting that his natural voice   with its raw, emotional quality   was the best tool he had.After graduating high school in 1950, Cash found his way to Michigan and worked briefly in an auto body plant before enlisting in the Air Force. After he was discharged, he married his first wife[8], Vivian, and began to work as a mechanic. He and some co-workers formed a band, and Cash   strumming the guitar   quickly became its frontman. In 1954, Cash and two of his band members showed up at Sun Records and managed to coax their way into an audition. Eventually, that work gave way to Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two and some hits that laid the foundation for Cash's fame. Johnny Cash became a musical legendJohnny Cash - Hurt (Official Music Video)[9]RELATED:Lost Johnny Cash Album to Be Released Over a Decade After His Death[10]Eventually, Cash went on to have an extremely successful musical career. By the 1960s, he had relocated to California and was traveling almost every night of the year with his group then known as the Tennessee Three. His wife, frustrated with being left alone to raise their children, filed for divorce in 1966. Whether in the midst of his own personal spiral or the spark of one, the divorce saw Cash's personal life taking a serious nosedive. He went on a drug binge and started a forest fire. Johnny Cash | Daily Herald/Mirrorpix/via Getty Images These missteps wreaked havoc on Cash's own personal physical and mental health, but they also helped add to his public persona. Cash had a reputation as a bad boy who answered to no one, and his actions   however destructive   helped solidify it. It wasn't until he married June Carter and refocused on his faith that Cash was able to pull himself out of the spiral and renew his career. Beginning in 1969, that resurgence was started in earnest. Winning two Grammy awards for his albumJohnny Cash at Folsom Prison certainly didn't hurt. When it was all said and done, Cash left behind a sprawling legacy of music over decades. Multiple arrests are in Johnny Cash's history46 years ago today, Johnny Cash was arrested for picking flowers in Starkville, MS.

AsBiography.com [15] reports, Cash was arrested seven times over the course of his life. ;Between 1959 and 1968   prior to his resurgence with June Carter by his side   Cash was arrested for public drunkenness, reckless driving, and drug possession. One of the more interesting arrests on his record includes getting booked for picking flowers. On a drunken binge in a small town, he was caught in the middle of the night picking flowers out of someone's yard.While Cash definitely has a reputation as a bad boy and more than his fair share of nights in the jailhouse, he never spent any significant time behind bars. Cash never faced a prison sentence and managed to keep rolling forward through his brief legal dust-ups.

It turns out the press is correct about the \"manmade\" part but not in the way they ever intended. Over the years, Australian environmental authorities have made illegal the practice of periodic controlled burning of underbrush to prevent larger fires. Together with arson, the results are devastating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate Change?</p><p>People who get their information through the major media corporations often identify climate change as the culprit behind any natural disaster or notable weather phenomenon. However, the body of work by scientists does not support such a conclusion. The United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has consistently reported that there isno scientific evidence of increased extreme weather. Globally, drought has gone slightly down in recent decades, and damage due to fire has declined.</p><p>Furthermore, Australia is not currently unusually hot or dry. Most of the fires have occurred near the east coast, where temperatures arebelow average. As the image shows, during December, the temperature was actually lower than the normal rate for the region.</p><p>Green Incompetence</p><p>Environmentalists have strongly influenced the policies of Australia. One of their accomplishments has been to prevent periodic controlled burning of dry plant matter on the forest floor, under the auspice that doing so would release CO2into the atmosphere.</p><p>In 2015, former Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) bushfire scientist David Packham said that forest fuel levels had worsened over the last 30 years due to \"misguided green ideology.\" He warned that unless at least 10% of dry ground matter on public land is burned annually, \"a massive bushfire disaster will occur. The forest and alpine environment will decay and be damaged possibly beyond repair, and homes and people [will be] incinerated.\"</p><p>He added that forest fuel levels in Australia had risen to their most dangerous levels in thousands of years.</p><p>Thus, the current situation in Australia has the same cause as the recent forest fire disaster in California:green incompetence. These supposed natural catastrophes can be easily avoided with proper planning and preventative measures. Finland, which has a sane and sound forest management policy, has avoided such tragedies even while its neighboring countries were in flames.</p><p>Arson</p><p>The second manmade component is people who light the fires, either due to carelessness or deliberate arson; 183 people have been arrested in the state of New South Wales, the current disaster hotspot, for igniting fires. Government statistics show that humans start more than 80% of fires, and arson is suspected in up to half of the cases.</p><p>Who sets fires? Mostly delinquent teenagers, but we know that after the2017 California wildfires, ISIS described arson as a novel form of terrorism. Another group that could profit from the scenario is radical environmentalists who may wish to blow the horn for the climate change cause.</p><p>Despite media misinformation, cooler heads are aware of green ideology as a major contributing cause to the wildfires. Whether this realization will translate into a sensible forest management policy, involving annual burns to reduce forest fuel, remains to be seen.</p><p>*About the author: International Correspondent at LibertyNation.com.

I'm Bianca Nobilo, in London. Welcome to THE GLOBAL BRIEF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two candidates vying to become Britain's next prime minister face each other one-on-one for the first time in a heated television debate. And it was quite heated. On the agenda, the economy immigration and China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is determined to resume grain exports from its Black Sea ports despite a Russian missile strike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, Pope Francis pilgrimage of penance to Canada as the pontiff apologizes for the church's role in the abuse of Canadian indigenous people.</p><p>Now, we've just heard big promises and fierce fighting from the two candidates for British prime minister, former Treasury Secretary Rishi Sunak and current Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, just faced off in their first one on one debate. They're hoping to conservative members to elect one of them to replace Boris Johnson as leader of the party, and leader of the nation.</p><p>And so far, lawmakers say that Truss has the edge over former chancellor Rishi Sunak. And the debate has been contentious, like their campaigns. Sunak attacking Truss' economic plans, saying it'll raise inflation and cause mortgages to skyrocket, and Truss accusing Sunak of trying to get too close economically to China.</p><p>Let's talk about it with John Rentoul, chief political commentator of \"The Independent\".</p><p>John, always great to talk to you. I'd love to know your first impressions from that debate, honestly, going into it -- I watch a lot of these things, too much probably -- I thought Rishi Sunak would give the stronger performance because he's a very slick operator, Liz Truss could be quiet gaffe-prone and robotic.</p><p>My surprise takeaway from that was that Sunak seemed quite aggressive. He may have thought he seemed passionate. And then Liz Truss seemed a lot more approachable and likable.</p><p>JOHN RENTOUL, CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, THE INDEPENDENT: Yes, I think that's right. I think Rishi Sunak knows that he had to make an impact in this debate there for he was extremely aggressive, he was talking over Liz Truss and I suspect lots of people in the audience won't like that. He did appear to be domineering, and quite sharp as well. I mean, she was sharp, but much more hesitant in her speaking style.</p><p>NOBILO: And what do you think this spells for the rest of the campaign because People I've been speaking to, MPs, even people who work on Liz Truss's campaign have been saying that they thought she may have been more likely to underperform in the campaign and in the debates. It might be trickier for her. I'm not so sure about that now.</p><p>RENTOUL: No, she performed well enough. But actually, when Rishi Sunak did allow her to speak, he actually let her speak for a long sections, certainly in the second half. I felt she was a much weaker performer than he was, I think she didn't have very much to say, she tends to rely on sound bites and slogans.</p><p>Whereas he, Rishi, talked extremely fast, and what's everyone to know that he knows all the details, these are crossover facts. I think he comes across and I'm much more impressive potential prime minister. But I'm not sure that's what conservative party members will think, because he's telling them some pretty unpalatable truths.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, and I agree with the stock phrases coming from Liz Truss. I think if we hear spades in the ground one more time us commentators, our ears might bleed.</p><p>Based on that performance, what we've seen of them in the campaign so far, which of the two do you think has the prospect of bringing the conservative party more electoral success in the medium term?</p><p>RENTOUL: Wow, that's a difficult question. I thought that Rishi Sunak was a better opponent for Keir Starmer and the Labour Party, because I thought he was pitching his tenth very much on the ground of politics. Whereas Liz Truss, with her tax cutting agenda, give Labour to many hostages to fortune, because they were able to present as the cut spending.</p><p>But I'm not sure that's how it's going to work out. I think the conservative party likes the idea of tax cuts whether or not they're economically sensible. I think the voters quite like the idea of tax cuts too.</p><p>NOBILO: And other than the economic argument, which is obviously a point the main point of contrast at the moment, they're certainly focusing on, what else is at stake here in terms of the differences between the two candidates, the direction they might take the conservative party and country, either one of them wins?</p><p>[17:05:14]</p><p>RENTOUL: Well, Liz Truss is trying to make China a big issue. I think the BBC rather surprisingly helped her allocate quite a bit of time in the debate to this topic of China. I'm not sure there's a big disagreement with them about that.</p><p>I mean, Rishi Sunak said some sensible things about, you know, wanting to defend to be -- wanting to defend on our national security -- but also wanted to engage with China. I don't think anybody would disagree with that. I think that's Liz Truss trying to use a credentials as far as foreign secretary.</p><p>I think the essential argument between them is the economic one. And Rishi Sunak tried very, very hard to ride home the point that Liz Truss, her main advisor, said that her policies would result in interest rates going up 7 percent. I'm not sure he did actually say that as a direct cause, because that is Rishi Sunak's argument.</p><p>NOBILO: And as you pointed out, Rishi Sunak, is considered by many, by media, by large majority of MPs to be on paper and in terms of performance, the more impressive candidate, the person that is clear intentions to detail, which he demonstrates whenever he can.</p><p>What do you think he would need to do in order to ingratiate himself and win over the base?</p><p>RENTOUL: Well, that's the question! I'm not sure that he's capable of doing that. In the opinion polls of Conservative Party members and the YouGov poll has been pretty accurate in the past, put Liz Truss so far ahead, but it's difficult to see how Richie Sunak can overcome that.</p><p>He's obviously decided to go for the quite aggressive strategy, of just saying, I'm better qualified for this. I know the arguments better, I'm here to tell people that they can't just have tax cuts, unfunded tax gets paid for borrowing. It'll be interesting to see how that works. We just wait to see what the next couple of Tory Party member says.</p><p>NOBILO: We shall wait, with bated breath.</p><p>John Rentoul, it's always great to talk to you. I wish we had more time, but we'll check in with you again as the campaign progress.</p><p>Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss of play tribute to David Tremble, who's died at the age of 77. Tremble was the first minister of Northern Ireland who played a crucial role in the Good Friday agreement, a peace deal that ended the troubles between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p><p>And the first shipments of Ukrainian grain could begin leaving Black Sea ports this week, under a U.N. brokered deal to ease the global food crisis. The U.N. says that both Ukrainian and Russia have reaffirmed the commitment to the deal, after Russian strikes on the key port of Odessa during the weekend threatened to jeopardize it. Ukraine says that grain export should resume within days, even as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns the Odessa strikes prove that Russia cannot be trusted. Russia's foreign minister insists that his country has not violated the agreement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEI LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: If we talk all the upside the took place in Odessa, there's nothing in the obligation that Russia has taken on, including within the framework of the agreement signed on July 22nd Istanbul which would prohibit us from continuing the special military operation, destroying military infrastructure, and other military targets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Let's bring in CNN's Ivan Watson. He's live in Odessa tonight.</p><p>Ivan, Turkey's presidential spokesperson, Turkey being one of the players in this deal, said that it may lay the foundation for trust that could lead to a presumption of seem fire prisoner exchange, and eventually a peace agreement, but after Russian missile struck where you are, the port of Odessa, one day after the agreement was signed, does anyone Ukraine share that view?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No. I think most Ukrainians think they're in for a long and bloody war. It's already five months of this. That said, the Ukrainian president has said that he wants grain to be exported, that he doesn't want Ukraine to be standing in the way of this, and in the same breath, saying that Russia should unblock the Black Sea to allow this to happen.</p><p>But from the point of view of the Turkish government, of the UN, you know, if you want to set a foundation for negotiation, you do need to build areas of trust. And it may be surprising that, in this kind of very cruel and deadly conflict, there have been other areas where these two warring parties have come to agreements.</p><p>[17:10:03]</p><p>They have done a number -- conducted a number of prisoner exchanges. There were negotiations that led to the surrender of Ukrainian troops in the besieged port of Mariupol, at that Azovstal steel factory.</p><p>So, I think that's part of what you're hearing from Turkish government officials, they're hoping that this could lead to something more, that proof will be in the pudding. You need to see whether or not ships can leave, whether or not the Russians will repeat attacks on the ports, where the grain exports are supposed to be carried out from, whether or not the Ukrainians will agree with what the Russian foreign minister has insisted, would be an escort of cargo ships by Russian warships.</p><p>And if Russian warships got within range of Ukrainian short ship missiles, would they see a big fat juicy target that they could go after, the way they sank the Moskva, flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, some months ago.</p><p>So, there's questions here and as we've heard from the U.S. government, they've pointed out that if this falls apart, there's still the plan B, that the Ukrainians have been working on, it's not as efficient, it can't carry as much grain, but the Ukrainians are exporting rain right now over land, in trucks, in trains, and by the River Danube.</p><p>But again it can't carry as much grain, and that won't make the impact needed to lower global food prices. This war has put tens and millions of people on the brink of starvation due to the skyrocketing prices of wheat. That's what happens when you attack one of the biggest bread baskets.</p><p>NOBILO: Ivan Watson in Odessa, thank you so much.</p><p>Now let's take a look at key climate stories, making headlines, extreme heat is proving to be doubly and destructive across the northern hemisphere. In Europe, forest fire officials say there's a very extreme danger of wildfires in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. That's the highest level of risk. Dozens of homes have already been destroyed in Lesbos, Greece, as firefighters battle a fast-moving wildfire there.</p><p>In the meantime, 60 million people in the U.S. remain under heat alert. In California, the fast-moving Oak Fire exploded in size during the weekend near the Yosemite National Park. It's currently only 10 percent contained. California's fire chief battalion chief calls the wildfire's behavior unprecedented.</p><p>Plus, take a look at this video from China, a bridge in Fujian province split in half while summit blocks expanded due to the heat. More than 70 cities are undoing a red alert, the country's highest heat warning, and meteorologists say this doesn't appear that relief will come anytime soon.</p><p>And still to come, a pilgrimage of penance. Pope Francis apologizes for the evil inflicted on indigenous people in Canada by the Catholic Church. We'll take you live to Edmonton.</p><p>Plus, Odessa opera and ballet theater has reopened in the midst of war. We take you inside to show you how it's using beauty and grace to offer a reprieve to Ukraine's beleaguered people.</p><p>[17:16:28]</p><p>NOBILO: Pope Francis is expressing sorrow and shame John what he calls a trip penance to Canada, he's apologizing for the Catholic Church's role in the residential school system, in which thousands of indigenous children, forced to attend those institutions suffered abuse and oppression. One government report calls it cultural genocide.</p><p>The pope spoke of his pain while meeting with indigenous groups near Edmonton.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POPE FRANCIS, CATHOLIC CHURCH: I have come to our native land to tell you in person, of my sorrow, to implore God's forgiveness, healing, and reconciliation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: CNN's Paula Newton joins us now for the Edmonton.</p><p>Paula, how have indigenous communities responded to this trip of penance, and where does this leave the future of the Catholic Church in Canada?</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. There are interesting questions, we begin with that apology and how it was received. I mean, Bianca, so much pain in these communities and of course mixed feelings at -- as he was making that apology there was a lot of emotion in the audience, a lot of motion across the country.</p><p>What we're going to show you now is the legacy of what's still remains in terms of the hurtful, really torturous things that the Catholic Church did in this country. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON (voice-over): It has taken the high-tech tools of this century for Canadian soil to give up the torturous secrets of the last. Drones hovering, swooping, mapping, ground penetrating radar peering into every layer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We see if there's any disturbances in that soil structure.</p><p>NEWTON: Disturbances. These are soil anomalies that could lead to the unmarked graves of indigenous children. Those who were once students at Fort Alexander Residential School in the Sagkeeng First Nation in the province of Manitoba.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you have 190 anomalies, it's got to be something.</p><p>NEWTON: The Catholic institution is no longer standing, but its survivors want you to know what it stood for -- abuse of all kinds that a government report found amounted to cultural genocide.</p><p>RITA GUIMOND, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL SURVIVOR: That's where the priests stayed.</p><p>NEWTON: Rita Guimond was just 6 when she arrived. The abuse started soon after.</p><p>GUIMOND: And he'd have us sit on his lap. And meanwhile, he had his hands under our skirts.</p><p>NEWTON: Patrick Bruyere was 7. He endured eight years.</p><p>PATRICK BRUYERE, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL SURVIVOR: He got me drunk. I didn't know what the hell happened when I got up the next morning.</p><p>NEWTON: Sarah Mazerolle was 6, forced to stay until she was 14.</p><p>SARAH MAZEROLLE, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL SURVIVOR: Bam. Every morning, she did that to me.</p><p>NEWTON: Henry Boubard is 80 now, just 7 when the nightmare started.</p><p>HENRY BOUBARD, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL SURVIVOR: After what the priest did to me, sexually, you know, it changed everything.</p><p>MAZEROLLE: You had to survive if you were going to live. You had to find ways to get over everything that was being done to you.</p><p>BRUYERE: It was all prayer. It was all behave yourself. It was all don't speak your language because if you do you get punished and a lot of humiliation.</p><p>BOUBARD: They told me to pray, to pray, to pray. But prayer, what is prayer?</p><p>[17:20:04]</p><p>You know, it means nothing to me. If you don't pray, you'll go to hell. I thought all these years I was living in hell in the residential school. This is hell to me.</p><p>NEWTON: Hundreds of victims like these from one school. And there were dozens of these institutions across Canada, most run by the Catholic Church. More than 150,000 indigenous children were forced to leave their families and were subjected to forced labor, neglect, and sexual and physical abuse. And thousands just went missing.</p><p>In the past years, several indigenous communities have discovered hundreds of unmarked graves and more searches are under way.</p><p>The survivors of Fort Alexander were too young to know where children went and why. There remain unmarked crosses in the cemetery made from the old school pipes. Who lays there?</p><p>So here, too, during the very week Pope Francis is on Canadian soil to apologize, they scour the land.</p><p>Which with high tech tools in the digital communities throughout Canada hope they can get the spiritual homecoming, that their lost children deserve something that no papal apology can give them.</p><p>The pope arrives with a singular purpose he says, that of pants. But for decades, there was impunity. Very few staff members were ever prosecuted, and that influx further trauma, some survivors say. And then there's the fact that this in-person apology took years.</p><p>JOE DANIELS, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL SURVIVOR: This thing needed to be dragged out of this person. Someone had to go to Rome, to go in practically begged this guy to come here and apologize. Why couldn't he have done it on his own from here?</p><p>NEWTON: As extraordinary as the pope's pilgrimage to Canada maybe, it stands diminished by the scope of the abuse that it's already known, the horrors still to be discovered.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON (on camera): You know, Bianca, I have to point out here, and, look, CNN has covered abuses by members of the Catholic Church for throughout the entire world, this is different and why it was systemic. It was cultural destruction.</p><p>Even the pope himself in the apology said it had catastrophic consequences for indigenous peoples here. And in the words of the indigenous people who reacted to this apology, don't ask us to get over it, this is the beginning of the healing, certainly not the end -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Paula Newton in Canada, thank you so much.</p><p>And we had a very misleading script in the show a little earlier referring to the troubles, which was a conflict between the unionist and Republican communities, we apologize for.</p><p>That now you're taught to protect your king in chess, but who knew yet protect your fingers as well. One young chess player in Russia found out the hard way, when a chess playing robot broke his finger. You can see in this video how you -- and squeeze. Apparently, the boy made the chest make too quickly, the incident happened during a match in the Russian chess opened last week. The president at the Moscow chess federation, Sergey Lazarev, called it, of course, bad.</p><p>Luckily, the boy didn't seem traumatized. Lazarev said the child play the next day, and finish the tournament with his finger in a cast.</p><p>And back in Ukraine, the Odesa opera and ballet theater is open once again. It had to close for months because of the war. But now, the dancers are back on stage in becoming a symbol of resistance. Once again, here's Ivan Watson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATSON (voice-over): There is great beauty in Ukraine amid the pain and suffering. In the southern pulled city of Odesa, dancers and rehearsal try to tune out Russia's deadly war.</p><p>This is more than just a beautiful expression of art and culture, against the terrible backdrop of this war. These dancers offer a symbol of defiance, a sign that Ukrainians are not giving up. The Odesa opera and ballet theater stands like a Jewel, albeit one protected by sandbags. The Russian rockets and missiles periodically power through Odessa, residents here clinging to prewar normality. And that includes the city's 135-year- old opera.</p><p>Viacheslav Chernukho is the opera's director.</p><p>It's beautiful. Do you still need opera and ballet and is a terrible war?</p><p>VIACHESLAV CHERNUKHO-VOLICH, ODESA NATIONAL ACADEMIC OPERA &amp; BALLET THEATER: Yes. All people need this, and it's very important for society, opera house is a symbol of a good life. It's -- for you hear music (ph).</p><p>[17:25:01]</p><p>WATSON: The good life, tonight's ballet performance. But amid preparations, there's an interruption.</p><p>An air raid siren warns of a possible attack. I muster downstairs.</p><p>This is shelter.</p><p>Musicians and dancers wait in the basement. The threat delays the start of a show. Two of tonight's solo ballerinas try to stay limber.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no. This is not normal.</p><p>WATSON: Why are you sitting here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because, war yes in our country.</p><p>WATSON: Are you afraid?</p><p>Yes, of course, we're se says Catarina Kalchinka (ph). Though we're getting accustom to these threats and that in itself is horrible.</p><p>After a long delay, the opera gets the clear. Audience members emerge from their own shelter and take their seats.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: In case of an air raid alert, all people must proceed to the shelter. Glory to Ukraine.</p><p>WATSON: The music of Chopin fills the halls. And for the briefest of moments, the war seems very far away.</p><p>The reality though is some of these performers sent their children away for safety to other countries. A number of the artist and crew are defending their country, serving in the Ukrainian armed forces, while those on stage struggle to keep the city's cultural spirit alive.</p><p>Soloist Catarina Kalchinka (ph) crosses herself before entering stage right.</p><p>But after just a few steps, the curtain suddenly close as.</p><p>Bad news, the third air siren of the night has just gone off. The curtain just came down, and the show has been brought to a stop.</p><p>I want the whole world to start screaming, she tells us, to stop this horse that innocent people stop dying. I asked for help the ballerinas, and for people to stop not to remain silent.</p><p>Ivan Watson, CNN, Odesa, Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: Thanks for watching. That was THE GLOBAL BRIEF.</p><p>And \"WORLD SPORT\" is up for you next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2022072501cbk42</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66BH-9GK1-F053-8017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 25, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It came to them.</p><p>\"The elusive bear tried turning himself in early this morning, then thought differently as police approached. Last seen walking north on N Five Points Rd,\" police said in a tweet on Sunday.</p><p>Dustin Stoner, education supervisor for the state Game Commission's Southeastern Pennsylvania office, said wardens in Chester and Bucks Counties investigated both sets of sightings, and concluded it's likely two different bears are roaming in each county. If one or both of the bears can be isolated in a safe location, the Game Commission will tranquilize them and move them to a better habitat.</p><p>\"This is kind of typical,\" Stoner said of the spring sightings.</p><p>He said young male bears go in search of new home ranges after being pushed out by other male bears, or by loss of habitat through development. Some will cross the Delaware River from New Jersey.</p><p>And, with security and phone cameras so prevalent, more sightings than ever find their way onto social media.</p><p>\"As a whole, the bear population has increased over the last two decades,\" Stoner said. \"But it is not exploding.\"</p><p>Black bears, which can weigh from 200 to 600 pounds, are omnivorous, and most active at dusk and dawn in search of berries, corn, acorns, beechnuts, and even grass. Sometimes they'll find table scraps in garbage cans.</p><p>In New Jersey, black bear sightings were up 33% from Jan. 1 through May compared with the same period last year. However, sightings have been down in recent years, with most in the rocky, hilly northwestern part of the state, where it's easier for bears to find dens and lots of nuts.</p><p>But black bears have been spotted in all 21 New Jersey counties over the years. Overall black bear growth has increased since the 1980s, with the carnivores pushing their range south and east from the northwest.</p><p>On Saturday, a bear wandered into Elk Township, Gloucester County, so police asked residents to be cautious. The once mostly rural township is now dotted with suburban housing. Possibly the same bear moved on and was sighted this week in nearby communities, including Mantua Township and Clayton.</p><p>Residents theorized on Face-book groups this week that the bear might have been flushed out during a large fire at the Winslow Wildlife Management Area on the border of Camden and Gloucester Counties, though state officials could not confirm that. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service said that the fire burned 2,107 acres on May 20, and that the cause was still being investigated.</p><p>\"The New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife is aware of bear sightings in Gloucester County and has been in contact with local police departments to provide advice,\" Larry Hajna, a spokesperson for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said in astatement. \"Though not certain at this time, the sightings may involve one bear and not multiple animals.\"</p><p>Hajna said black bears are wary of humans and \"should be disturbed as little as possible in order to give them an opportunity to find suitable habitat.\"</p><p>He suggests residents remove any potential food sources, as bears have an extremely keen sense of smell that can lure them to take up in certain neighborhoods.</p><p>Hajna offered some tips to keep bears away:</p><p>Wash garbage containers frequently with adisinfectant solution to remove odors. Put out garbage on collection day, not the night before.</p><p>Avoid feeding birds when bears are active. If you choose to feed birds, do so during daylight hours only and bring feeders indoors at night. Suspend bird feeders from afree-hanging wire, making sure they are at least 10 feet off the ground. Clean up spilled seeds and shells daily.</p><p>Remove all uneaten food and food bowls used by pets fed outdoors.</p><p>Clean outdoor grills and utensils to remove food and grease residue. Store grills securely.</p><p>+<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>^215-854-2329</p><p>\"FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-PHDN20200617Ar02301</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6053-YPT1-DYJT-2024-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000123</classCode><className>POPULATION GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001645</classCode><className>SUBURBS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp; HABITATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX602</classCode><className>PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS154</classCode><className>PENNSYLVANIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

My name is Elaine, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vermilion Energy Q3 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Dion Hatcher, you may begin your conference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thank you, Elaine. Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>I'm Dion Hatcher, President of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars Glemser, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerwin, Vice President, International HSE; Bryce Kremnica, Vice President, North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p><p>We will be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss the Q3 2022 results. Presentation can be found on our website under Invest with Us in Events and Presentations. Please refer to our advisory and forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes the forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today and outlines the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>As shown on slide 2, we generated $508 million of fund flow in Q3, which is a 12% increase over the prior quarter and is another quarterly record for Vermilion. For perspective, this quarterly fund flow is more than we generated for the full year of 2020. Free cash flow of $324 million was down slightly from the previous quarter due to higher capital expenditures associated with our Australia drilling program, which we successfully completed during the quarter.</p><p>Majority of Q3 free cash flow was allocated to debt reduction. Our net debt decreased by 11% to $1.4 billion, representing a debt to trailing 12-month fund flow ratio of 0.8 times. As we outlined last quarter, with our formal return of capital framework, it is our intention to return more free cash flow to our shareholders as debt decreases.</p><p>In Q3, we paid a cash dividend of CAD0.08 per share and repurchased 2.3 million shares under our NCIB for $72 million. Combine this amounts to $85 million returned to our shareholders, representing 26% of Q3 free cash flow.</p><p>Pro-forma Q3 fund flow and free cash flow incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $611 million and $426 million respectively. Q3 production averaged 84,237 BOEs per day, which was in line with the prior quarter as we previously guided to, reflecting planned turnaround activity in Canada and the forest far related downtime in France, which offset the new production added from the Leucrotta acquisition, which closed at the end of May.</p><p>As I mentioned on the previous slide, our net debt to trailing fund flow ratio decreased 0.8 times. As can be seen on slide 3, this is our lowest leverage in over 10 years. We have made significant progress on debt reduction in the last two years. We intend on maintaining this discipline going forward. We operated with a leverage ratio near one times or below for 10 straight years from 2003 to 2013. We will target lower leverage going forward. While commodity prices have helped drive this ratio lower, we'll manage our debt targets based on mid-cycle pricing assumptions, which at one times fund flow implies an absolute debt target of $1 billion or less. Contributing to our strong Q3 financial results was a robust European gas prices, which nearly doubled in Q3 compared to the prior quarter.</p><p>As shown on slide 4, TTF reached an all time high of CAD120 per MMBtu in late August following various supply disruptions and growing concerns regarding Europe's ability to meet winter energy demand.</p><p>Energy security and inflation have become focal points for many countries and citizens around the world, especially in Europe. Energy security situation in Europe, which is really the result of policy decisions over multiple years have been amplified by the ongoing and devastating conflict in Ukraine.</p><p>Prior to 2022, Europe relied on Russia for approximately 40% of its gas supply, but Russia imports have significantly decreased in recent months as key infrastructure was taken offline.</p><p>Damage to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea in late September has removed approximately 6 Bcf of supply capacity, which brings the total supply loss of 10 Bcf per day year-over-year. At this time, it is uncertain if or when this capacity will come back.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Europe managed to source enough gas over the summer months to essentially fill storage ahead of the winter heating season. Even with partial Russian gas supply, prices averaged approximately 60 per MMBtu for the injection season period. We will discuss some of the underlying fundamentals driving European gas and outline why we are bullish on this commodity. It is important to understand how Europe was able to fill stores this past year and how the situation may be different next year.</p><p>Chart on slide 5 illustrates the year-over-year change in LNG imports versus China and the rest of the world. As you can see, over 50% of Europe's increase in LNG imports this year was due to reduced LNG demand in other countries. The Global LNG supply did not materially increase, it was rerouted to Europe.</p><p>European LNG imports were up significantly as Europe started to wean itself off from Russian gas. This is a very large undertaking as Russian gas represent approximately 18 Bcf per day of Europe's gas supply. Europe achieved higher LNG imports by outbidding the rest of world for LNG. However, this was also during a period where China had lower demand due to stringent COVID lockdown policies. In addition, Nord Stream 1 was an operation at supplying Europe for over half of the injection period.</p><p>Storage essentially full, Europe is expected to have enough gas to meet demand this winter, assuming average weather conditions. However, refilling storage capacity next year may prove to be more difficult with Nord Stream 1 presumably offline and Chinese demand potentially returning to pre-COVID levels. Europe has become structurally more dependent on LNG imports to meet current natural gas needs. To put it in perspective, the volume of Russian gas that was supplied to Europe before the war represents approximately a third of the world's current LNG supply.</p><p>Another way to think about it is you would need to more than double the US LNG export capacity to replace the Russian volumes supply to Europe. The increased LNG demand will require direct competition with Asia, where LNG demand is also expected to increase over the coming decades. There's very limited new LNG supply coming online over the next few years. New projects require significant capital underpinned by long-term contracts, which many European countries have been reluctant to commit to.</p><p>In the recent weeks, the QatarEnergy Minister [Indecipherable] Qatar as the largest supplier of LNG in the world stated that negotiations with the European countries on new LNG supply are challenging due to Europe's unwillingness to commit to long-term contracts, which are typically 15 years, 20 years.</p><p>Investments of this scale are expected to structurally change long-term pricing of European gas to higher than what it was before the war. Given this global LNG backdrop and the underlying supply and demand fundamentals developing in Europe, we expect LNG and European gas prices to remain elevated. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, European gas was a meaningful contributor to remain strong Q3 financial results and we expect to be a key driver for future results. The chart on the left of Slide 6 shows historical and forward price for TTF, JKM and AECO. The blue bar is Vermilion's average corporate realized price premium to AECO.</p><p>On a pro-forma basis, including the core of acquisition volumes, European gas represents about a quarter of Vermilion's production base and contributes over 40% of our fund flow. Vermilion has approximately 3.8 million net acres of undeveloped land in the prospective basins across Europe. And we believe there is an opportunity to increase gas production with government support and the appropriate regulatory frameworks in place.</p><p>High European gas prices and the prospect for higher energy costs in the years ahead has become a front and center concern of all stakeholders in Europe, including politicians. For the past several months, there have been various government policy ideas debated on how to contain energy prices in Europe, ranging from voluntary demand reduction to price caps to infill taxes.</p><p>Vermilion has been actively engaged with government officials in the countries where we operate to identify opportunities where we can contribute to domestic gas needs. As natural gas is an important energy source, that should be produced locally where possible to ensure security of supply. This is consistent that Europe having recognized natural gas as a transition fuel.</p><p>Late in the third quarter, the European Union announced several proposals in an attempt to address high energy costs. One of the proposals, which was subsequently approved, the temporary windfall tax measure aimed at EU companies with activities in the hydrocarbon sector. This windfall tax is calculated as a percentage of earnings above a baseline of 120% of the average of taxable earnings with a subject company between 2018 and 2021.</p><p>We have provided an estimate for 2022 windfall tax impact of $250 million to $350 million within our Q3 release. There continues to be many unknown variables related to the final implementation of the tax. However, our current estimate of the potential two-year exposure for 2022 and 2023, if the tax was implemented as framed by the EU, would be approximately $650 million to $750 million, again, over two years based on the current strip pricing. This estimate is inclusive of the incremental core working interest.</p><p>As shown on Slide 7, we have updated our 2022 pro forma financial outlook to incorporate this windfall tax and now forecast pro forma fund flow of $2.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion or over $9 per share, which implies a free cash flow yield of in excess of 30%.</p><p>Getting back to our Q3 results, we provided a brief summary of our operational highlights on Slides 8 through 11. Production from our international operations averaged 27,095 BOEs per day in Q3 and increased 1% from the prior quarter. Production increased in Australia and Germany, which has more than offset far related downtime in France and natural decline in other jurisdictions.</p><p>Most notable activity in our international operations in Q3 was a successful completion of an offshore drilling program in Australia. As highlighted last quarter, this program was scheduled to start earlier in the second quarter, but was delayed approximately one month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on the third-party contracted rig.</p><p>Drilling program was a success and the wells were brought on production in September. In Europe, we focused on restoring production in France that was impacted by the forest fire and expect most of the products to be restored by the end of the year. During the quarter, three wells were drilled in Hungary, but none of these wells encountered commercial hydrocarbons. Capital spend on this program was minimum, while the findings will further enhance our knowledge and understanding of the geology in this region.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, we continued with support work for our Q4 drilling campaign, which will include one well in the Netherlands, one well in Germany and two wells in Croatia. The Netherlands and German program continues into early 2023 for a total of six wells combined.</p><p>As mentioned, we had a very successful drilling campaign in Australia. We drilled the B17 and B18 wells for a total of 6,500 meters horizontal well length drilled between the two wells. The 360-degree well path with planned sidetracks in the B-17 well resulted in accessing new reserves. The wells have produced over 300,000 barrels cumulative to date. Our Wandoo crude currently sells at an approximately $14 premium to Brent, resulting in a Q3 Australian operating netback of approximately $96 per BOE. At current pricing, these two wells have generated approximately $30 million of operating cash flows, recovering 40% of the invested capital in the first two months on production. As in previous years, we will limit the production of these wells to manage our marketing contracts. We are currently evaluating the results to identify potential new targets and plan for our next drilling campaign, which we expect to occur in 2024 or 2025.</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 57,142 BOEs per day in Q3, a decrease of 2% from the prior quarter, primarily due to third-party downtime in Canada, a delayed start up of our Turner wells in the U.S. In Canada, we ramped up our Southeast Saskatchewan drilling program. We brought on production 14 wells and completed the six wells of our first Montney pad and Mica, which were drilled in Q2.</p><p>In the United States, we completed the brought on production the remaining five wells of the six-well Turner program. Three of the wells were drilled with the extended reach two-mile laterals and we executed lower intensity fracs across the wells, which resulted in approximately $2.7 million of total cost savings.</p><p>While the initial production from these wells is lower than our previous higher intensity completions, we are monitoring performance to determine the impact on longer-term decline profiles, well recovery and overall capital efficiencies. One of our farm-in partners drilled and completed two commitment wells testing the Parkman formation. The performance of those wells has exceeded our internal type curves, which we will continue to monitor while accessing the potential of this play on our lands. At River Basin assets, similar to other North American assets, has multiple stack targets including the Parkman, the Niobrara and the [Indecipherable], which represents significant upside beyond the turn.</p><p>As a reminder, we closed the Leucrotta acquisition at the end of May and took over operations during the six-well drilling program that was initiated by Leucrotta on the Alberta Lands. We successfully completed the wells executing over 1,000 fracs. Well testing was limited due to player restrictions, however, we are nearing completion of the initial build out of the facility and are excited to bring the wells on production shortly. We will be kicking off another three-well pad in Alberta in Q4.</p><p>Late in the third quarter, we received approval to restart one mile well in BC, which is now producing over 1,000 barrels a day over the last month, which is in line with our expectations. We have prepared detailed development plans for both our Alberta and BC lands. Although our preference is focused on the BC development, we will continue to maintain flexibility in terms of infrastructure development across the asset, including a drill-to-fill option on the Alberta lands, utilizing the existing infrastructure, which will result in approximately 7,000 to 8,000 BOEs a day of production in 2023.</p><p>This option manages our near term capital by deferring additional Alberta infrastructure and instead building out the BC infrastructure, where the majority of our drilling inventory is located. As part of our corporate allocation, we are optimistic that we can also increase capital to European gas drilling in 2023. Our 2022 capital budget and production guidance remains unchanged. However, we expect annual production to be at the lower end of the range due to the fire-related downtime in France and delayed downstream timing of the Australia and U.S. wells.</p><p>Closing of the Corrib acquisition is nearing the final stages and we now anticipate acquisition to close in Q1 2023 due to administrative delays. As previously noted, all free cash flow generated by the acquired interest in Corrib from Jan 1, 2022 until close we accrue to Vermillion will be netted off the final purchase price.</p><p>We plan to announce our 2023 budget in early January as we require additional time to assess the impact of windfall tax. We'll work with our regulators in Europe to facilitate additional drilling and continued timing -- confirmed timing on the Corrib acquisition close. We will remain disciplined in 2023 as we continue to focus on debt reduction.</p><p>At this time, we anticipate a capital budget similar to 2022 investment levels with potentially a greater portion allocated to European gas. We have the ability and desire to drill more wells in Europe and if ongoing discussions with regulators are productive, we would look to allocate additional capital to the region in 2023.</p><p>In particular, we have several large gas prospects in Germany, targets that are approximately 10 times larger than our recent Netherlands drills. We have -- we're having a very encouraging dialogue with local and state officials in Germany about the prospect of Selan drilling into late 2023.</p><p>That concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Greg Pardy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert Mann:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, team. It's Robert Mann on here for Greg Pardy. My first question is just surrounding the Corrib deal. Could you provide some guidance around what the net cost or benefit would be if it closed in the first quarter of 2023? And what the probability of the deal is -- if the deal does not close for some reason? And if so, how would the unwind work there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Well, thanks, Robert. I'll pass it to Lars just to discuss the financial question and then Darcy to address the timing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Robert. As Dion mentioned, we have factored in the windfall tax impact of the 36.5% interest on Corrib into our analysis here. As opposed to giving a hard number, what I would guide to is a payout at some point in the second half of 2023 now that we would have to factor in the windfall tax obligation, which we will incorporate into the final purchase price effective Jan 1, 2022. So a payout at some point in the second half of 2023.</p><p>The thing that I would highlight then is that includes the hedges that we put in place as part of the original transaction. As you get into 2024, you would then have all of that European gas benefiting cash flows on an unhedged basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. Darcy, do you want to follow up on the second part of the question?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. As it relates to the timing of the close, we certainly do expect that this deal will close. Originally, we did expect it to close in 2022. That is still a possibility, but we think it's likely to slip now into Q1 of 2023. All the parties continue to work together to complete this transactions. We're all working through the administrative delays related to finalizing documents with the government and our partners. I think, it's worth noting that all cash flows are accruing to our benefit as of January 1, 2022, effective date. So the timing of the close really doesn't impact the financial contributions of the acquisition and kind of put things in perspective, when we last did a deal in Ireland to acquire an additional 1.5% stake in quarter, it took approximately 18 months to close. And so we're used to this kind of longer closure period taking place in Europe. So we do expect to fully close in the first quarter 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert Mann:</emphasis></p><p>That's great. Thank you. And just switching gears here a little bit, if I can. How should we be thinking about cash taxes in 2022 and 2023, not including the windfall tax as a percentage of pre-tax cash flow? Does the 10% to 11% range in 2022 still seem reasonable?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Robert. I'll pass it back to Lars for that one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Hey, Robert, for 2022, I think forecasting a cash tax rate of 9% to 11% for the full year would be a reasonable range. Keep in mind that does not include any contribution from the acquired Corrib interest. And then for 2023, pre any kind of windfall tax inclusion, 14% to 16% cash tax would be a reasonable estimate. That does include the contribution of the 36.5% acquired working interest from Equinor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert Mann:</emphasis></p><p>That's great. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll turn it back to the operator now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Robert.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question will come from Menno Hulshof from TD Securities. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the suspension of the NCIB for Q4. Does that mean, you're simply not electing to buy back that stock this quarter or was there a filing submitted to formally suspend it? I'm just not clear on the mechanics of that? And then the second piece of that is, why suspend it at all? It feels like, if the upper end of the windfall tax range is $350 million per annum, that there would still be enough to go around for at least some buyback activity. So any thoughts on that front would be helpful as well?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Menno. I'll pass it over to Lars to address those questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Menno. On the first part of your question, no formal submission has been made in regards to the NCIB. And so what we really wanted to accomplish with this press release was being transparent with shareholders in terms of taking a pause here in the fourth quarter to reassess the impact of a windfall tax that is likely going to be retroactive in nature, as well as potentially exposure to a two-year period as well.</p><p>So we wanted to take some time to prioritize that. When we do our analysis around the appropriate way to return capital over the longer term, every scenario that we run includes a strong balance sheet in terms of being able to support that return of capital over the longer term. If we end up taking a quarter to ensure that we don't put that strong balance sheet at risk, we think that, that is a pause that is worthwhile over the longer term.</p><p>In terms of the second part of the question, yeah, I think that really factors into taking a pause here in the fourth quarter just to make sure that we do prioritize the balance sheet. And we'll reevaluate the merits of capital allocation as we go into 2023 here incorporating this new information that we have, as well as --as we work through the budget and those other variables.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks for that. And then on windfall taxes, did you now have a better sense of how each of the individual countries are going to manage the EU proposal, and what is your best guess on when we have announcements from each company in which you operate? And is there any risk that these announcements get pushed into 2023?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Menno, and maybe I'll take this opportunity just to zoom out and talk a little bit more about the windfall tax, and pass it over to Lars to talk about some of the mechanics. It's been interesting time with the policy in Europe. It's during this energy crisis. It's discussions from price caps to windfall taxes and oil and gas companies. I think it's important to note that the current situation is not solely the result of the war, and really the policies that only resulted in declining supply and increasing demand have created a pretty tight market.</p><p>You think about Vermilion over the last 25 years, going back to 1997, we put meaningful capital at risk to provide secure energy in Europe. And over that time, we've worked hard or operations to too best-in-class. So for our shareholders, we took some risk and we've deployed capital into that market. And with the guarantees of return and also during some pretty difficult periods here with the commodity price crash, and between 2014 and 2019 as well as, of course, COVID here in 2020.</p><p>From 1997, we were 6,000 barrels a day. And if we look at where we're going to be in 2022, we're in excess of 31,000 and those production that we have in those jurisdictions, the places, the need to import energy from other areas, which of course from a full cycle emission point of view was actually lower.</p><p>And then you get to the economic benefits of producing in Europe. I mean we're displacing the need again to import energy, which means there's deployment. There's support of the service sector, and then there's the royalties and taxes that we pay to both communities and the federal level.</p><p>If you look at 2022 across our portfolio, like we're looking at cash taxes plus royalties in excess of $550 million, and that's prior to the additional windfall tax. With that in perspective, I mean that's in excess of the $500 million of corporate cash flows we generate in 2020. So I mean, as we think about the policies in Europe is really we want stable and predictable policies and two, I'd say, a recognition of twofold. Our business is cyclical and there's periods of low prices, and there's periods of high prices. And we need those periods of high prices to offset the lows of course.</p><p>And then third, again, the benefits of having producers like Vermilion in that market day-and-day to ensure their secure lower emission energy. But with that, I mean, that's our view is just strategically looking at some of the things that we'll continue to navigate in the near term here, but I'll pass it over to Lars to talk about some of the mechanics of the individual jurisdictions and how it will be applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Menno, I'll just take this chance to reiterate what Dion commented on. We have this disclosure in our press release as well. So the EU regulation requires member states to levy that minimum 33% tax on in scope companies for 2022 and/or 2023 surplus profits. Surplus profits defined in the regulation as taxable profits exceeding 120% of the annual average during that 2018 to 2021 period.</p><p>EU member states are required to implement the tax or some kind of equivalent national measure by December 31, 2022. So, we're within weeks of having that finalization. At the end of the day, depending on the national measures that are adopted by the EU member state, as well as the financial years, which measures will be applicable that's where we're basically just applying the EU framework at this point to get that estimate of $650 million to $750 million of two-year cumulative impact. So, I think in short order here, we should have a little bit more certainty on at least 2022 in terms of that deadline.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>A bit of a long answer there Menno, but that answers your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>No, that was great. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question will come from Dennis Fong from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. The first one really relates a little bit more towards North American operations. Just wanted to understand a little bit in terms of how you're moderating the potential cost inflation impacts, especially given ramping activity, both within Mica and then if I think about Powder River Basin as well? Thanks, Dennis. I'll pass over Bryce Kremnica, our VP of North America, just to touch on inflationary pressures in North America.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bryce Kremnica:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, thanks for the question, Dennis. Yeah, overall inflation in North America on the capital side of things is in the range of about 20%. And notably on the opex side of things, it's much lower in the 5% range, testament to all the work the team started on managing opex and managing contracts. Just jumping over specifically to the Powder River Basin, inflation there is about 20%, up year-over-year. When compared to Canada, our Alberta assets are up about 20%, and then Saskatchewan is probably up the most in the 30% range. So, we've done lots of great work in the Powder River Basin executing our cost reduction strategies over the last few years, and we continue to do that.</p><p>This year, we brought a warm crew down from Alberta when we kicked off a program to help manage costs. So we'll continue to do the same. And then with respect to Mica, we got a good view on our costs going into the later half of this year as we've had active operations into Q3, and then we're starting up a new pad into Q4. So we have a good handle on our cost going forward into 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Bryce. Yes. And we're seeing -- again, it's interesting. I think that's one of the advantages of our model, Dennis, is to be able to deploy capital in different parts of the business. And put a lot of thought into things like Saskatchewan drilling in the summer when we find costs are lower in the Powder River Basin, again, using crews from Alberta. So, again, very thoughtful there, but we are seeing inflation and doing our best to manage it, as Bryce noted,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And maybe if I wouldn't mind on -- in terms of kind of an add-on to that question, if there were -- if there was incremental activity within Europe, how would you potentially think about contracting services. I mean, obviously, it's less call it, less busy over there. But how are you thinking about the cost impacts of accelerating activity out there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. I would say it's less. I can pass over to Darcy just to touch on what we're seeing there for inflation on the services side for Europe. Yes. In Europe, certainly, we're seeing lower inflation numbers on the services side than we're seeing in North America, probably in the range of kind of 5% up to 10%. As you suggested, that's kind of due to limited activity in Europe and we've gotten a little bit of help as well from the exchange rate that even makes that a little bit lower. So, that's, kind of, fully baked into our plans next year. We -- because of the longer time lines in Europe too, we do tend to acquire tubulars and enter into contracts earlier. So, we have a pretty good handle on what the prices look like in Europe for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Darcy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And then my last question here is just around hedging. I see like a small uptick in natural gas -- European natural gas hedges as we think about 2023 as a percentage of total production. Can you just kind of reiterate your strategy there? Obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the curve. I wanted to kind of understand if anything has changed on that side? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, Travis, we were quite active in August with some of these higher prices. But with that, I'll pass it over to Lars to touch on our strategy and some of the recent hedges we were able to execute.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So you can see there in the second half of 2022, European gas hedges got up to that 60% level. 2023, we're at about that 50% level now. Those are probably pretty good bookends to think about in terms of where we could get European gas hedging too. We feel very comfortable with where we're at for 2023 at this point, and it's probably a little bit more around looking to be opportunistic if we do go higher than that versus risk mitigation at this point.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Perfect. I appreciate it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Dennis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>We will take our next question from Travis Wood from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Wood:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks. And most of my questions were answered around Menno's questions and the discussion on Windfall. So that was super helpful. But maybe just in the context of the complexities of the windfall tax and maybe just how you guys are thinking about stressing that into 2023 and then as you think about capital allocation, the language was looking to spend more on European gas projects. If you see this or policy language potentially push this into 2023 and possibly 2024, would that change your decision to continue to add volumes or cash flow out of the region just to offset some of the future tax or how are you thinking about balancing that against a really strong kind of macro backdrop on pricing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Travis. I'll pass the Lars to address that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So in terms of the first part of your question there, Travis, around sort of the complexities around the windfall tax. If you just sort of rewind here, the EU approved this legislation or the framework of the legislation late September. If you think back to the early part of September, there wasn't a lot of discussion around a EU-led windfall tax regime. So the velocity, the pace, the scope of this legislation I don't know if it's unprecedented, but it has been extremely rapid. And as you introduce new legislation that's going to impact 27 member states, there's just a lot of moving parts in terms of what that ultimately is going to look like within each of the countries that adopt it.</p><p>So we're monitoring it as the rest of folks are in terms of what's available in the public domain. But I just want to emphasize that this is legislation. This is a new tax that has evolved very quickly here. What we felt was important was to provide some disclosure here in terms of what the impact could be over that two-year period, and we'll look to update that disclosure here as we go forward and as we get certainty kind of going into the end of the year here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. And with respect to capital.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Wood:</emphasis></p><p>I mean I think we understand that what is there -- if you took the status quo and expected this to kind of roll for another couple of years, do you think that would impact the capital decisions in the region, or is the bottom line there just too large of a number to position capital to avoid, or not avoid, I won't use that word, but to mitigate some of the tax impact in the short term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Travis. I'll pass it back to Lars to talk about capital allocation and how we're thinking about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Travis, we -- as Dion mentioned earlier, we've been navigating operations in Europe for 25 years here. I think, it has been a very good place to do business. Absolutely, we're going to have to factor in any kind of windfall tax that would go beyond 2023 into our capital allocation decisions.</p><p>I think what you heard from Dion as well as Darcy today is, we do have an incentive to allocate more capital to Europe just in terms of we want to be part of the energy security supply response, and we think that we do have a role to play into that.</p><p>We'll obviously have to make sure that we factor in anything here. At this point, it is a temporary windfall tax. The scope of it has been limited to 2022 and 2023. If we were to extend beyond that, we'd have to factor that into our decisions. But we're in Europe for the long term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Wood:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, guys.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Travis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions]. We will take our next question from Nilay [Phonetic] Mehta from Hudson Bay. Please go.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, guys. Can you hear me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Hey. Thank you. So, yes, I just want to revisit the windfall tax, I know that's getting a lot of questions this morning. I guess I just wanted to better understand. I know you're saying, obviously, you want to focus on the strength of the balance sheet, first and foremost, and then look to sort of reintroduce the dividend at some point. And I know in the prepared remarks, you guys expect it to end the balance sheet or net debt a little higher than expected. Kind of, I know, it was 1.2% at the year-end, kind of give a a better sense of where you think that lands?</p><p>And then, another way to sort of dig around that too, is just, I think someone asked a little bit earlier, but in a similar manner, if you have a sense of the total magnitude potentially being in that 600 to 700 range or whatever over two years. And then, what was the thought process spending it now, given that we're almost this part in the quarter?</p><p>Is the tax that retracted for 2022? Is that going to have to be paid like the day of the decision? And therefore, there was a thought that, that would impact the net debt higher, because that's going to be the cash flow from that, like a one-time payment, or is it going to be paid over time for the retroactiveness of 2022? And how does that also get paid for 2023? Is that, as it's earned? Like, what's the mechanism there for the windfall tax payments?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Okay. Yes. No, I can -- so a couple of things there. Yes, just to clarify, I mean, we suspended the share buybacks. We are paying and continue to pay the dividend. And again, our strategy is to provide ratable increases of the dividend over time. With respect to the mechanics of when the windfall tax would be accrued and paid. I'll pass it back to Lars to talk about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. And I'll address that as well as your question around debt balance as well. I think that the $1.2 billion debt target was going to be a nice landing spot at the end of 2022 in terms of being able to go lower than that in 2023, as well as being able to return capital. Our estimate now that incorporates the windfall tax would be about $1.6 billion of exit 2022 net debt.</p><p>And that's a segue way into the third part of your question in terms of the accounting for the windfall tax. Ultimately, it's going to be subject to when legislation gets finalized. As I mentioned earlier, there is a mandate right now for member states to have legislation in place by the end of this year, assuming that comes to fruition, and that is met, we would expect that to trigger an accrual for the windfall tax 2022 exposure in the fourth quarter of this year. So that will get reflected in 2022. We've embedded that into that $1.6 billion net debt estimate. In terms of when that tax would be payable, that will be variable depending on the country, but I would expect it to range anywhere from early to late first half of 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. And then just to, sort of, I guess, related a little bit of a follow-up. I think you sounded like a couple of the countries have come to a policy and outstanding on a couple of other ones. I think mostly at Ireland and Germany. On the countries that have come in so far on their policies on windfall tax, how is it compared to what you guys were thinking and relative to what EU was implementing? Is it sort of in line with that or better, etc? And are there any offsets that you guys have in those countries that may -- are factored into your estimates right now, or are there -- at this point, there are no offsets in the estimates?</p><p>And then also, just back to the accounting and how it's pay and all that stuff, again, back to like if you're exiting with $1.6 billion this year on net debt, and you're looking at production into 2023, if it's a similar level, I guess, and what people have out there for estimates, it looks like cash flow generation should be fairly robust. And given the total size of the windfall tax is estimated and the net debt exiting this year, does the -- is it still feasible for you to reach your net debt target next year, that's sub-$1 billion and you're back to in that range of free cash flow generation and being able to pay out 50% or so of the free cash flow into 2023 once the buybacks are resumed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I'll just paraphrase the question here. And some of these, again, we can -- eager to meet with you off-line if you can get into some of the more modeling questions. But I'll pass to Lars here around just to comment on maybe some of the offset mechanics of the windfall tax. And just secondly, how we're thinking about debt targets for next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So just back to the windfall tax, without getting into each of the four countries that will have windfall tax exposure, there are varying degrees there in terms of certainty, in terms of how the framework is going to be employed. I would say at this point, we have factored in all information that we have today into that estimate of $650 million to $750 million. There's quite a bit of nuances once you get into each country, both from a, I'd call it a front office, as well as back office perspective in terms of how the calculation is ultimately going to unfold.</p><p>And then just back to your question -- follow-up question on debt here. So if you start with that $1. 6 billion at the end of 2022, just as a reminder, we have fully burdened that with our estimate for the core of closing cost as well. If that gets pushed to 2023, that's something that will shift between 2022 and 2023.</p><p>In terms of net debt balance, debt target for 2023, that's something that we'll work through here. A good landing spot could be targeting an undrawn for credit facility revolver, in terms of setting ourselves up strongly for 2024 and then navigating the uncertainties that are there regardless of windfall tax in terms of commodity price uncertainty. But that is the pause that we wanted to take here in the fourth quarter is just to work through those decisions and what's the right capital allocation.</p><p>We have a firm belief, that by taking a pause here in the fourth quarter the fact that, that free cash flow it is still going to accrue to shareholders, it will accrue to shareholders through a lower debt balance in terms of where we exit this year as opposed to a lower share count. And if that puts us in a position to accelerate buybacks in 2023, we think that that's a prudent decision here in the short-term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. Got it. Yeah. Thank you. And then, I guess, maybe just a final one on that last one. You said obviously accruing to shareholders. I guess a big part of the Vermilion story. And I know it's sort of part of the energy space in general has been sort of the capital return story. And I guess the pause near-term given sort of the windfall tax situation. And I don't know if there's any related on the production or cost side as well, if that any reason there. But how important does the capital returns remain as part of Vermilion's sort of shareholder story in general, just given that the pause is happening here. And obviously, there's going to be a reaction from shareholders to that. So. Yeah, I can take this one. I mean, I think if you look back on the history of the company, we paid over $40 a share of dividends. Our focus is to have a strong balance sheet. And as debt levels decrease to return increasing amounts of cash flow to our shareholders. And again, over the longer timeframe, we've consistently done that. I think to Lars' point, we were about 25%, 26% of free cash flow return to our shareholders for return of capital in Q3. We hit the pause in Q4. And again, really just that trade-off of near-term, gathering more data as well as prioritizing year-end debt balance. And I think it just positions us to be that much stronger going into 2023. If you look at where our debt level is going to be and where the strip pricing is currently for all commodities, again, we think we're positioned well. The next step for us is to continue to work through this in December. And we look forward to releasing our budget early in the New Year. And that I think then would provide an appropriate time to really get into the details around spending levels, free cash flow levels or thoughts on return on capital. But just to be clear, a pause in Q4 does not, in any way, infer our change of our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Again, we've got a long-term track record of doing that. It was truly for this quarter to pause and gathers additional information and focus on a lower year-end debt target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Got it, all right.

My name is Elaine, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vermilion Energy Q3 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Dion Hatcher, you may begin your conference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thank you, Elaine. Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>I'm Dion Hatcher, President of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars Glemser, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerwin, Vice President, International HSE; Bryce Kremnica, Vice President, North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p><p>We will be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss the Q3 2022 results. Presentation can be found on our website under Invest with Us in Events and Presentations. Please refer to our advisory and forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes the forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today and outlines the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>As shown on slide 2, we generated $508 million of fund flow in Q3, which is a 12% increase over the prior quarter and is another quarterly record for Vermilion. For perspective, this quarterly fund flow is more than we generated for the full year of 2020. Free cash flow of $324 million was down slightly from the previous quarter due to higher capital expenditures associated with our Australia drilling program, which we successfully completed during the quarter.</p><p>Majority of Q3 free cash flow was allocated to debt reduction. Our net debt decreased by 11% to $1.4 billion, representing a debt to trailing 12-month fund flow ratio of 0.8 times. As we outlined last quarter, with our formal return of capital framework, it is our intention to return more free cash flow to our shareholders as debt decreases.</p><p>In Q3, we paid a cash dividend of CAD0.08 per share and repurchased 2.3 million shares under our NCIB for $72 million. Combine this amounts to $85 million returned to our shareholders, representing 26% of Q3 free cash flow.</p><p>Pro-forma Q3 fund flow and free cash flow incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $611 million and $426 million respectively. Q3 production averaged 84,237 BOEs per day, which was in line with the prior quarter as we previously guided to, reflecting planned turnaround activity in Canada and the forest far related downtime in France, which offset the new production added from the Leucrotta acquisition, which closed at the end of May.</p><p>As I mentioned on the previous slide, our net debt to trailing fund flow ratio decreased 0.8 times. As can be seen on slide 3, this is our lowest leverage in over 10 years. We have made significant progress on debt reduction in the last two years. We intend on maintaining this discipline going forward. We operated with a leverage ratio near one times or below for 10 straight years from 2003 to 2013. We will target lower leverage going forward. While commodity prices have helped drive this ratio lower, we'll manage our debt targets based on mid-cycle pricing assumptions, which at one times fund flow implies an absolute debt target of $1 billion or less. Contributing to our strong Q3 financial results was a robust European gas prices, which nearly doubled in Q3 compared to the prior quarter.</p><p>As shown on slide 4, TTF reached an all time high of CAD120 per MMBtu in late August following various supply disruptions and growing concerns regarding Europe's ability to meet winter energy demand.</p><p>Energy security and inflation have become focal points for many countries and citizens around the world, especially in Europe. Energy security situation in Europe, which is really the result of policy decisions over multiple years have been amplified by the ongoing and devastating conflict in Ukraine.</p><p>Prior to 2022, Europe relied on Russia for approximately 40% of its gas supply, but Russia imports have significantly decreased in recent months as key infrastructure was taken offline.</p><p>Damage to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea in late September has removed approximately 6 Bcf of supply capacity, which brings the total supply loss of 10 Bcf per day year-over-year. At this time, it is uncertain if or when this capacity will come back.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Europe managed to source enough gas over the summer months to essentially fill storage ahead of the winter heating season. Even with partial Russian gas supply, prices averaged approximately 60 per MMBtu for the injection season period. We will discuss some of the underlying fundamentals driving European gas and outline why we are bullish on this commodity. It is important to understand how Europe was able to fill stores this past year and how the situation may be different next year.</p><p>Chart on slide 5 illustrates the year-over-year change in LNG imports versus China and the rest of the world. As you can see, over 50% of Europe's increase in LNG imports this year was due to reduced LNG demand in other countries. The Global LNG supply did not materially increase, it was rerouted to Europe.</p><p>European LNG imports were up significantly as Europe started to wean itself off from Russian gas. This is a very large undertaking as Russian gas represent approximately 18 Bcf per day of Europe's gas supply. Europe achieved higher LNG imports by outbidding the rest of world for LNG. However, this was also during a period where China had lower demand due to stringent COVID lockdown policies. In addition, Nord Stream 1 was an operation at supplying Europe for over half of the injection period.</p><p>Storage essentially full, Europe is expected to have enough gas to meet demand this winter, assuming average weather conditions. However, refilling storage capacity next year may prove to be more difficult with Nord Stream 1 presumably offline and Chinese demand potentially returning to pre-COVID levels. Europe has become structurally more dependent on LNG imports to meet current natural gas needs. To put it in perspective, the volume of Russian gas that was supplied to Europe before the war represents approximately a third of the world's current LNG supply.</p><p>Another way to think about it is you would need to more than double the US LNG export capacity to replace the Russian volumes supply to Europe. The increased LNG demand will require direct competition with Asia, where LNG demand is also expected to increase over the coming decades. There's very limited new LNG supply coming online over the next few years. New projects require significant capital underpinned by long-term contracts, which many European countries have been reluctant to commit to.</p><p>In the recent weeks, the QatarEnergy Minister [Indecipherable] Qatar as the largest supplier of LNG in the world stated that negotiations with the European countries on new LNG supply are challenging due to Europe's unwillingness to commit to long-term contracts, which are typically 15 years, 20 years.</p><p>Investments of this scale are expected to structurally change long-term pricing of European gas to higher than what it was before the war. Given this global LNG backdrop and the underlying supply and demand fundamentals developing in Europe, we expect LNG and European gas prices to remain elevated. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, European gas was a meaningful contributor to remain strong Q3 financial results and we expect to be a key driver for future results. The chart on the left of Slide 6 shows historical and forward price for TTF, JKM and AECO. The blue bar is Vermilion's average corporate realized price premium to AECO.</p><p>On a pro-forma basis, including the core of acquisition volumes, European gas represents about a quarter of Vermilion's production base and contributes over 40% of our fund flow. Vermilion has approximately 3.8 million net acres of undeveloped land in the prospective basins across Europe. And we believe there is an opportunity to increase gas production with government support and the appropriate regulatory frameworks in place.</p><p>High European gas prices and the prospect for higher energy costs in the years ahead has become a front and center concern of all stakeholders in Europe, including politicians. For the past several months, there have been various government policy ideas debated on how to contain energy prices in Europe, ranging from voluntary demand reduction to price caps to infill taxes.</p><p>Vermilion has been actively engaged with government officials in the countries where we operate to identify opportunities where we can contribute to domestic gas needs. As natural gas is an important energy source, that should be produced locally where possible to ensure security of supply. This is consistent that Europe having recognized natural gas as a transition fuel.</p><p>Late in the third quarter, the European Union announced several proposals in an attempt to address high energy costs. One of the proposals, which was subsequently approved, the temporary windfall tax measure aimed at EU companies with activities in the hydrocarbon sector. This windfall tax is calculated as a percentage of earnings above a baseline of 120% of the average of taxable earnings with a subject company between 2018 and 2021.</p><p>We have provided an estimate for 2022 windfall tax impact of $250 million to $350 million within our Q3 release. There continues to be many unknown variables related to the final implementation of the tax. However, our current estimate of the potential two-year exposure for 2022 and 2023, if the tax was implemented as framed by the EU, would be approximately $650 million to $750 million, again, over two years based on the current strip pricing. This estimate is inclusive of the incremental core working interest.</p><p>As shown on Slide 7, we have updated our 2022 pro forma financial outlook to incorporate this windfall tax and now forecast pro forma fund flow of $2.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion or over $9 per share, which implies a free cash flow yield of in excess of 30%.</p><p>Getting back to our Q3 results, we provided a brief summary of our operational highlights on Slides 8 through 11. Production from our international operations averaged 27,095 BOEs per day in Q3 and increased 1% from the prior quarter. Production increased in Australia and Germany, which has more than offset far related downtime in France and natural decline in other jurisdictions.</p><p>Most notable activity in our international operations in Q3 was a successful completion of an offshore drilling program in Australia. As highlighted last quarter, this program was scheduled to start earlier in the second quarter, but was delayed approximately one month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on the third-party contracted rig.</p><p>Drilling program was a success and the wells were brought on production in September. In Europe, we focused on restoring production in France that was impacted by the forest fire and expect most of the products to be restored by the end of the year. During the quarter, three wells were drilled in Hungary, but none of these wells encountered commercial hydrocarbons. Capital spend on this program was minimum, while the findings will further enhance our knowledge and understanding of the geology in this region.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, we continued with support work for our Q4 drilling campaign, which will include one well in the Netherlands, one well in Germany and two wells in Croatia. The Netherlands and German program continues into early 2023 for a total of six wells combined.</p><p>As mentioned, we had a very successful drilling campaign in Australia. We drilled the B17 and B18 wells for a total of 6,500 meters horizontal well length drilled between the two wells. The 360-degree well path with planned sidetracks in the B-17 well resulted in accessing new reserves. The wells have produced over 300,000 barrels cumulative to date. Our Wandoo crude currently sells at an approximately $14 premium to Brent, resulting in a Q3 Australian operating netback of approximately $96 per BOE. At current pricing, these two wells have generated approximately $30 million of operating cash flows, recovering 40% of the invested capital in the first two months on production. As in previous years, we will limit the production of these wells to manage our marketing contracts. We are currently evaluating the results to identify potential new targets and plan for our next drilling campaign, which we expect to occur in 2024 or 2025.</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 57,142 BOEs per day in Q3, a decrease of 2% from the prior quarter, primarily due to third-party downtime in Canada, a delayed start up of our Turner wells in the U.S. In Canada, we ramped up our Southeast Saskatchewan drilling program. We brought on production 14 wells and completed the six wells of our first Montney pad and Mica, which were drilled in Q2.</p><p>In the United States, we completed the brought on production the remaining five wells of the six-well Turner program. Three of the wells were drilled with the extended reach two-mile laterals and we executed lower intensity fracs across the wells, which resulted in approximately $2.7 million of total cost savings.</p><p>While the initial production from these wells is lower than our previous higher intensity completions, we are monitoring performance to determine the impact on longer-term decline profiles, well recovery and overall capital efficiencies. One of our farm-in partners drilled and completed two commitment wells testing the Parkman formation. The performance of those wells has exceeded our internal type curves, which we will continue to monitor while accessing the potential of this play on our lands. At River Basin assets, similar to other North American assets, has multiple stack targets including the Parkman, the Niobrara and the [Indecipherable], which represents significant upside beyond the turn.</p><p>As a reminder, we closed the Leucrotta acquisition at the end of May and took over operations during the six-well drilling program that was initiated by Leucrotta on the Alberta Lands. We successfully completed the wells executing over 1,000 fracs. Well testing was limited due to player restrictions, however, we are nearing completion of the initial build out of the facility and are excited to bring the wells on production shortly. We will be kicking off another three-well pad in Alberta in Q4.</p><p>Late in the third quarter, we received approval to restart one mile well in BC, which is now producing over 1,000 barrels a day over the last month, which is in line with our expectations. We have prepared detailed development plans for both our Alberta and BC lands. Although our preference is focused on the BC development, we will continue to maintain flexibility in terms of infrastructure development across the asset, including a drill-to-fill option on the Alberta lands, utilizing the existing infrastructure, which will result in approximately 7,000 to 8,000 BOEs a day of production in 2023.</p><p>This option manages our near term capital by deferring additional Alberta infrastructure and instead building out the BC infrastructure, where the majority of our drilling inventory is located. As part of our corporate allocation, we are optimistic that we can also increase capital to European gas drilling in 2023. Our 2022 capital budget and production guidance remains unchanged. However, we expect annual production to be at the lower end of the range due to the fire-related downtime in France and delayed downstream timing of the Australia and U.S. wells.</p><p>Closing of the Corrib acquisition is nearing the final stages and we now anticipate acquisition to close in Q1 2023 due to administrative delays. As previously noted, all free cash flow generated by the acquired interest in Corrib from Jan 1, 2022 until close we accrue to Vermillion will be netted off the final purchase price.</p><p>We plan to announce our 2023 budget in early January as we require additional time to assess the impact of windfall tax. We'll work with our regulators in Europe to facilitate additional drilling and continued timing -- confirmed timing on the Corrib acquisition close. We will remain disciplined in 2023 as we continue to focus on debt reduction.</p><p>At this time, we anticipate a capital budget similar to 2022 investment levels with potentially a greater portion allocated to European gas. We have the ability and desire to drill more wells in Europe and if ongoing discussions with regulators are productive, we would look to allocate additional capital to the region in 2023.</p><p>In particular, we have several large gas prospects in Germany, targets that are approximately 10 times larger than our recent Netherlands drills. We have -- we're having a very encouraging dialogue with local and state officials in Germany about the prospect of Selan drilling into late 2023.</p><p>That concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Greg Pardy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert Mann:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, team. It's Robert Mann on here for Greg Pardy. My first question is just surrounding the Corrib deal. Could you provide some guidance around what the net cost or benefit would be if it closed in the first quarter of 2023? And what the probability of the deal is -- if the deal does not close for some reason? And if so, how would the unwind work there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Well, thanks, Robert. I'll pass it to Lars just to discuss the financial question and then Darcy to address the timing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Robert. As Dion mentioned, we have factored in the windfall tax impact of the 36.5% interest on Corrib into our analysis here. As opposed to giving a hard number, what I would guide to is a payout at some point in the second half of 2023 now that we would have to factor in the windfall tax obligation, which we will incorporate into the final purchase price effective Jan 1, 2022. So a payout at some point in the second half of 2023.</p><p>The thing that I would highlight then is that includes the hedges that we put in place as part of the original transaction. As you get into 2024, you would then have all of that European gas benefiting cash flows on an unhedged basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. Darcy, do you want to follow up on the second part of the question?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. As it relates to the timing of the close, we certainly do expect that this deal will close. Originally, we did expect it to close in 2022. That is still a possibility, but we think it's likely to slip now into Q1 of 2023. All the parties continue to work together to complete this transactions. We're all working through the administrative delays related to finalizing documents with the government and our partners. I think, it's worth noting that all cash flows are accruing to our benefit as of January 1, 2022, effective date. So the timing of the close really doesn't impact the financial contributions of the acquisition and kind of put things in perspective, when we last did a deal in Ireland to acquire an additional 1.5% stake in quarter, it took approximately 18 months to close. And so we're used to this kind of longer closure period taking place in Europe. So we do expect to fully close in the first quarter 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert Mann:</emphasis></p><p>That's great. Thank you. And just switching gears here a little bit, if I can. How should we be thinking about cash taxes in 2022 and 2023, not including the windfall tax as a percentage of pre-tax cash flow? Does the 10% to 11% range in 2022 still seem reasonable?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Robert. I'll pass it back to Lars for that one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Hey, Robert, for 2022, I think forecasting a cash tax rate of 9% to 11% for the full year would be a reasonable range. Keep in mind that does not include any contribution from the acquired Corrib interest. And then for 2023, pre any kind of windfall tax inclusion, 14% to 16% cash tax would be a reasonable estimate. That does include the contribution of the 36.5% acquired working interest from Equinor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert Mann:</emphasis></p><p>That's great. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll turn it back to the operator now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Robert.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question will come from Menno Hulshof from TD Securities. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the suspension of the NCIB for Q4. Does that mean, you're simply not electing to buy back that stock this quarter or was there a filing submitted to formally suspend it? I'm just not clear on the mechanics of that? And then the second piece of that is, why suspend it at all? It feels like, if the upper end of the windfall tax range is $350 million per annum, that there would still be enough to go around for at least some buyback activity. So any thoughts on that front would be helpful as well?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Menno. I'll pass it over to Lars to address those questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Menno. On the first part of your question, no formal submission has been made in regards to the NCIB. And so what we really wanted to accomplish with this press release was being transparent with shareholders in terms of taking a pause here in the fourth quarter to reassess the impact of a windfall tax that is likely going to be retroactive in nature, as well as potentially exposure to a two-year period as well.</p><p>So we wanted to take some time to prioritize that. When we do our analysis around the appropriate way to return capital over the longer term, every scenario that we run includes a strong balance sheet in terms of being able to support that return of capital over the longer term. If we end up taking a quarter to ensure that we don't put that strong balance sheet at risk, we think that, that is a pause that is worthwhile over the longer term.</p><p>In terms of the second part of the question, yeah, I think that really factors into taking a pause here in the fourth quarter just to make sure that we do prioritize the balance sheet. And we'll reevaluate the merits of capital allocation as we go into 2023 here incorporating this new information that we have, as well as --as we work through the budget and those other variables.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks for that. And then on windfall taxes, did you now have a better sense of how each of the individual countries are going to manage the EU proposal, and what is your best guess on when we have announcements from each company in which you operate? And is there any risk that these announcements get pushed into 2023?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Menno, and maybe I'll take this opportunity just to zoom out and talk a little bit more about the windfall tax, and pass it over to Lars to talk about some of the mechanics. It's been interesting time with the policy in Europe. It's during this energy crisis. It's discussions from price caps to windfall taxes and oil and gas companies. I think it's important to note that the current situation is not solely the result of the war, and really the policies that only resulted in declining supply and increasing demand have created a pretty tight market.</p><p>You think about Vermilion over the last 25 years, going back to 1997, we put meaningful capital at risk to provide secure energy in Europe. And over that time, we've worked hard or operations to too best-in-class. So for our shareholders, we took some risk and we've deployed capital into that market. And with the guarantees of return and also during some pretty difficult periods here with the commodity price crash, and between 2014 and 2019 as well as, of course, COVID here in 2020.</p><p>From 1997, we were 6,000 barrels a day. And if we look at where we're going to be in 2022, we're in excess of 31,000 and those production that we have in those jurisdictions, the places, the need to import energy from other areas, which of course from a full cycle emission point of view was actually lower.</p><p>And then you get to the economic benefits of producing in Europe. I mean we're displacing the need again to import energy, which means there's deployment. There's support of the service sector, and then there's the royalties and taxes that we pay to both communities and the federal level.</p><p>If you look at 2022 across our portfolio, like we're looking at cash taxes plus royalties in excess of $550 million, and that's prior to the additional windfall tax. With that in perspective, I mean that's in excess of the $500 million of corporate cash flows we generate in 2020. So I mean, as we think about the policies in Europe is really we want stable and predictable policies and two, I'd say, a recognition of twofold. Our business is cyclical and there's periods of low prices, and there's periods of high prices. And we need those periods of high prices to offset the lows of course.</p><p>And then third, again, the benefits of having producers like Vermilion in that market day-and-day to ensure their secure lower emission energy. But with that, I mean, that's our view is just strategically looking at some of the things that we'll continue to navigate in the near term here, but I'll pass it over to Lars to talk about some of the mechanics of the individual jurisdictions and how it will be applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Menno, I'll just take this chance to reiterate what Dion commented on. We have this disclosure in our press release as well. So the EU regulation requires member states to levy that minimum 33% tax on in scope companies for 2022 and/or 2023 surplus profits. Surplus profits defined in the regulation as taxable profits exceeding 120% of the annual average during that 2018 to 2021 period.</p><p>EU member states are required to implement the tax or some kind of equivalent national measure by December 31, 2022. So, we're within weeks of having that finalization. At the end of the day, depending on the national measures that are adopted by the EU member state, as well as the financial years, which measures will be applicable that's where we're basically just applying the EU framework at this point to get that estimate of $650 million to $750 million of two-year cumulative impact. So, I think in short order here, we should have a little bit more certainty on at least 2022 in terms of that deadline.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>A bit of a long answer there Menno, but that answers your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Menno Hulshof:</emphasis></p><p>No, that was great. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question will come from Dennis Fong from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. The first one really relates a little bit more towards North American operations. Just wanted to understand a little bit in terms of how you're moderating the potential cost inflation impacts, especially given ramping activity, both within Mica and then if I think about Powder River Basin as well? Thanks, Dennis. I'll pass over Bryce Kremnica, our VP of North America, just to touch on inflationary pressures in North America.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bryce Kremnica:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, thanks for the question, Dennis. Yeah, overall inflation in North America on the capital side of things is in the range of about 20%. And notably on the opex side of things, it's much lower in the 5% range, testament to all the work the team started on managing opex and managing contracts. Just jumping over specifically to the Powder River Basin, inflation there is about 20%, up year-over-year. When compared to Canada, our Alberta assets are up about 20%, and then Saskatchewan is probably up the most in the 30% range. So, we've done lots of great work in the Powder River Basin executing our cost reduction strategies over the last few years, and we continue to do that.</p><p>This year, we brought a warm crew down from Alberta when we kicked off a program to help manage costs. So we'll continue to do the same. And then with respect to Mica, we got a good view on our costs going into the later half of this year as we've had active operations into Q3, and then we're starting up a new pad into Q4. So we have a good handle on our cost going forward into 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Bryce. Yes. And we're seeing -- again, it's interesting. I think that's one of the advantages of our model, Dennis, is to be able to deploy capital in different parts of the business. And put a lot of thought into things like Saskatchewan drilling in the summer when we find costs are lower in the Powder River Basin, again, using crews from Alberta. So, again, very thoughtful there, but we are seeing inflation and doing our best to manage it, as Bryce noted,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And maybe if I wouldn't mind on -- in terms of kind of an add-on to that question, if there were -- if there was incremental activity within Europe, how would you potentially think about contracting services. I mean, obviously, it's less call it, less busy over there. But how are you thinking about the cost impacts of accelerating activity out there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darcy Kerwin:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. I would say it's less. I can pass over to Darcy just to touch on what we're seeing there for inflation on the services side for Europe. Yes. In Europe, certainly, we're seeing lower inflation numbers on the services side than we're seeing in North America, probably in the range of kind of 5% up to 10%. As you suggested, that's kind of due to limited activity in Europe and we've gotten a little bit of help as well from the exchange rate that even makes that a little bit lower. So, that's, kind of, fully baked into our plans next year. We -- because of the longer time lines in Europe too, we do tend to acquire tubulars and enter into contracts earlier. So, we have a pretty good handle on what the prices look like in Europe for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Darcy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And then my last question here is just around hedging. I see like a small uptick in natural gas -- European natural gas hedges as we think about 2023 as a percentage of total production. Can you just kind of reiterate your strategy there? Obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the curve. I wanted to kind of understand if anything has changed on that side? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, Travis, we were quite active in August with some of these higher prices. But with that, I'll pass it over to Lars to touch on our strategy and some of the recent hedges we were able to execute.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So you can see there in the second half of 2022, European gas hedges got up to that 60% level. 2023, we're at about that 50% level now. Those are probably pretty good bookends to think about in terms of where we could get European gas hedging too. We feel very comfortable with where we're at for 2023 at this point, and it's probably a little bit more around looking to be opportunistic if we do go higher than that versus risk mitigation at this point.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Fong:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Perfect. I appreciate it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Dennis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>We will take our next question from Travis Wood from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Wood:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thanks. And most of my questions were answered around Menno's questions and the discussion on Windfall. So that was super helpful. But maybe just in the context of the complexities of the windfall tax and maybe just how you guys are thinking about stressing that into 2023 and then as you think about capital allocation, the language was looking to spend more on European gas projects. If you see this or policy language potentially push this into 2023 and possibly 2024, would that change your decision to continue to add volumes or cash flow out of the region just to offset some of the future tax or how are you thinking about balancing that against a really strong kind of macro backdrop on pricing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Travis. I'll pass the Lars to address that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So in terms of the first part of your question there, Travis, around sort of the complexities around the windfall tax. If you just sort of rewind here, the EU approved this legislation or the framework of the legislation late September. If you think back to the early part of September, there wasn't a lot of discussion around a EU-led windfall tax regime. So the velocity, the pace, the scope of this legislation I don't know if it's unprecedented, but it has been extremely rapid. And as you introduce new legislation that's going to impact 27 member states, there's just a lot of moving parts in terms of what that ultimately is going to look like within each of the countries that adopt it.</p><p>So we're monitoring it as the rest of folks are in terms of what's available in the public domain. But I just want to emphasize that this is legislation. This is a new tax that has evolved very quickly here. What we felt was important was to provide some disclosure here in terms of what the impact could be over that two-year period, and we'll look to update that disclosure here as we go forward and as we get certainty kind of going into the end of the year here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. And with respect to capital.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Wood:</emphasis></p><p>I mean I think we understand that what is there -- if you took the status quo and expected this to kind of roll for another couple of years, do you think that would impact the capital decisions in the region, or is the bottom line there just too large of a number to position capital to avoid, or not avoid, I won't use that word, but to mitigate some of the tax impact in the short term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Travis. I'll pass it back to Lars to talk about capital allocation and how we're thinking about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Travis, we -- as Dion mentioned earlier, we've been navigating operations in Europe for 25 years here. I think, it has been a very good place to do business. Absolutely, we're going to have to factor in any kind of windfall tax that would go beyond 2023 into our capital allocation decisions.</p><p>I think what you heard from Dion as well as Darcy today is, we do have an incentive to allocate more capital to Europe just in terms of we want to be part of the energy security supply response, and we think that we do have a role to play into that.</p><p>We'll obviously have to make sure that we factor in anything here. At this point, it is a temporary windfall tax. The scope of it has been limited to 2022 and 2023. If we were to extend beyond that, we'd have to factor that into our decisions. But we're in Europe for the long term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Travis Wood:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, guys.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Travis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions]. We will take our next question from Nilay [Phonetic] Mehta from Hudson Bay. Please go.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, guys. Can you hear me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Hey. Thank you. So, yes, I just want to revisit the windfall tax, I know that's getting a lot of questions this morning. I guess I just wanted to better understand. I know you're saying, obviously, you want to focus on the strength of the balance sheet, first and foremost, and then look to sort of reintroduce the dividend at some point. And I know in the prepared remarks, you guys expect it to end the balance sheet or net debt a little higher than expected. Kind of, I know, it was 1.2% at the year-end, kind of give a a better sense of where you think that lands?</p><p>And then, another way to sort of dig around that too, is just, I think someone asked a little bit earlier, but in a similar manner, if you have a sense of the total magnitude potentially being in that 600 to 700 range or whatever over two years. And then, what was the thought process spending it now, given that we're almost this part in the quarter?</p><p>Is the tax that retracted for 2022? Is that going to have to be paid like the day of the decision? And therefore, there was a thought that, that would impact the net debt higher, because that's going to be the cash flow from that, like a one-time payment, or is it going to be paid over time for the retroactiveness of 2022? And how does that also get paid for 2023? Is that, as it's earned? Like, what's the mechanism there for the windfall tax payments?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Okay. Yes. No, I can -- so a couple of things there. Yes, just to clarify, I mean, we suspended the share buybacks. We are paying and continue to pay the dividend. And again, our strategy is to provide ratable increases of the dividend over time. With respect to the mechanics of when the windfall tax would be accrued and paid. I'll pass it back to Lars to talk about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. And I'll address that as well as your question around debt balance as well. I think that the $1.2 billion debt target was going to be a nice landing spot at the end of 2022 in terms of being able to go lower than that in 2023, as well as being able to return capital. Our estimate now that incorporates the windfall tax would be about $1.6 billion of exit 2022 net debt.</p><p>And that's a segue way into the third part of your question in terms of the accounting for the windfall tax. Ultimately, it's going to be subject to when legislation gets finalized. As I mentioned earlier, there is a mandate right now for member states to have legislation in place by the end of this year, assuming that comes to fruition, and that is met, we would expect that to trigger an accrual for the windfall tax 2022 exposure in the fourth quarter of this year. So that will get reflected in 2022. We've embedded that into that $1.6 billion net debt estimate. In terms of when that tax would be payable, that will be variable depending on the country, but I would expect it to range anywhere from early to late first half of 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Lars.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. And then just to, sort of, I guess, related a little bit of a follow-up. I think you sounded like a couple of the countries have come to a policy and outstanding on a couple of other ones. I think mostly at Ireland and Germany. On the countries that have come in so far on their policies on windfall tax, how is it compared to what you guys were thinking and relative to what EU was implementing? Is it sort of in line with that or better, etc? And are there any offsets that you guys have in those countries that may -- are factored into your estimates right now, or are there -- at this point, there are no offsets in the estimates?</p><p>And then also, just back to the accounting and how it's pay and all that stuff, again, back to like if you're exiting with $1.6 billion this year on net debt, and you're looking at production into 2023, if it's a similar level, I guess, and what people have out there for estimates, it looks like cash flow generation should be fairly robust. And given the total size of the windfall tax is estimated and the net debt exiting this year, does the -- is it still feasible for you to reach your net debt target next year, that's sub-$1 billion and you're back to in that range of free cash flow generation and being able to pay out 50% or so of the free cash flow into 2023 once the buybacks are resumed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I'll just paraphrase the question here. And some of these, again, we can -- eager to meet with you off-line if you can get into some of the more modeling questions. But I'll pass to Lars here around just to comment on maybe some of the offset mechanics of the windfall tax. And just secondly, how we're thinking about debt targets for next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lars Glemser:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So just back to the windfall tax, without getting into each of the four countries that will have windfall tax exposure, there are varying degrees there in terms of certainty, in terms of how the framework is going to be employed. I would say at this point, we have factored in all information that we have today into that estimate of $650 million to $750 million. There's quite a bit of nuances once you get into each country, both from a, I'd call it a front office, as well as back office perspective in terms of how the calculation is ultimately going to unfold.</p><p>And then just back to your question -- follow-up question on debt here. So if you start with that $1. 6 billion at the end of 2022, just as a reminder, we have fully burdened that with our estimate for the core of closing cost as well. If that gets pushed to 2023, that's something that will shift between 2022 and 2023.</p><p>In terms of net debt balance, debt target for 2023, that's something that we'll work through here. A good landing spot could be targeting an undrawn for credit facility revolver, in terms of setting ourselves up strongly for 2024 and then navigating the uncertainties that are there regardless of windfall tax in terms of commodity price uncertainty. But that is the pause that we wanted to take here in the fourth quarter is just to work through those decisions and what's the right capital allocation.</p><p>We have a firm belief, that by taking a pause here in the fourth quarter the fact that, that free cash flow it is still going to accrue to shareholders, it will accrue to shareholders through a lower debt balance in terms of where we exit this year as opposed to a lower share count. And if that puts us in a position to accelerate buybacks in 2023, we think that that's a prudent decision here in the short-term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dion Hatcher:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lars. Got it. Yeah. Thank you. And then, I guess, maybe just a final one on that last one. You said obviously accruing to shareholders. I guess a big part of the Vermilion story. And I know it's sort of part of the energy space in general has been sort of the capital return story. And I guess the pause near-term given sort of the windfall tax situation. And I don't know if there's any related on the production or cost side as well, if that any reason there. But how important does the capital returns remain as part of Vermilion's sort of shareholder story in general, just given that the pause is happening here. And obviously, there's going to be a reaction from shareholders to that. So. Yeah, I can take this one. I mean, I think if you look back on the history of the company, we paid over $40 a share of dividends. Our focus is to have a strong balance sheet. And as debt levels decrease to return increasing amounts of cash flow to our shareholders. And again, over the longer timeframe, we've consistently done that. I think to Lars' point, we were about 25%, 26% of free cash flow return to our shareholders for return of capital in Q3. We hit the pause in Q4. And again, really just that trade-off of near-term, gathering more data as well as prioritizing year-end debt balance. And I think it just positions us to be that much stronger going into 2023. If you look at where our debt level is going to be and where the strip pricing is currently for all commodities, again, we think we're positioned well. The next step for us is to continue to work through this in December. And we look forward to releasing our budget early in the New Year. And that I think then would provide an appropriate time to really get into the details around spending levels, free cash flow levels or thoughts on return on capital. But just to be clear, a pause in Q4 does not, in any way, infer our change of our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Again, we've got a long-term track record of doing that. It was truly for this quarter to pause and gathers additional information and focus on a lower year-end debt target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Mehta:</emphasis></p><p>Got it, all right.
