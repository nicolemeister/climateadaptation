The grant was from the National Science Foundation and awarded to Dr. Lisa Patrick Bentley of the Biology department at Sonoma State. This money went straight to Dr. Bentley who was the Principal Investigator for researching the project. She already has a plan on how to budget the project as well as the smaller sub-projects that come with this research funding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Dr. Bentley, \"The overall goal of this research is to integrate research with education in novel ways to increase scientific literacy and public engagement around the topic of wildfire while promoting inclusion, accessibility and equity.\" She wants to introduce new ways of learning about wildfires such as implementing virtual reality in fourth through sixth grade students at Loma Vista Immersion Academy in Petaluma. The VR side of teaching opens up brand new frontiers within the scientific community and gives them new ways to learn through a medium that hasn't really been utilized as much.</p><p>This $1.1 million shows that Sonoma State can compete at a national level for grants. The National Science Foundation is a highly competitive grant and Dr. Bentley is hopeful that this will put SSU 'on the map' and show that Sonoma can be recognized at the national scale. She wants to emphasize and acknowledge the 3DForests team members work that went into the proposal which was a \"huge contribution of intense field work and lab work\" which ultimately helped define the project and won the school the money from both the NSF and CALFIRE's Forest Health Program.</p><p>The Dean of the School of Science and Technology, Elisabeth Wade, mentioned in an interview that \"the more experience you have in the departments and the school will allow you the opportunity to receive this grant which usually means the more successful they tend to be with an NSF grant...I am very proud of Dr. Bentley for receiving and competing for this highly prestigious grant.\" The grant will go on to help biology students at Sonoma State learn and document recent landscapes devastated by forest fire within a safe environment such as virtual reality or controlled environments free from the dangers imposed by areas affected by wildfire.</p><p>Receiving this grant, Dr. Bentley became the first person at SSU to receive the money. She believes that this will hopefully open the doors for other professors to receive this grant or some similar grant which will overall help Sonoma State reach its goal of expanding and broadening field work and expand on opportunities for a more diverse group of students.</p><p>Dr. Bentley is excited for her research into forest fire health as well as having the opportunity to mentor underrepresented minority first-year Biology students and graduate students in a virtual \"field trip\". This field trip will integrate information related to climate change, local tree species, fire fuels, and land management. After going through the student program, the field trip will then be adapted for public outreach at SSU Fairfield-Osborn Preserve and the previously mentioned fourth through sixth grade students at a Spanish-immersion school.</p><p>With public outreach, Dr. Bentley hopes to allow younger generations to learn with a new medium, VR. The virtual reality medium will allow for students and the public to address real-world issues related to wildfire via a virtual environment.</p><p>COURTESY// Lisa Patrick Bentley</p><p>Dr. Lisa Patrick Bentley, associate professor for the Biology department, taking sold samples outside.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5211886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64RN-WP41-DY7P-T47V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sonoma State Star: Sonoma State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 8, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Rohnert Park</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Field Trips</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzA1OEE0MjNCMjgyNEEwNTkwNkYwMDAwOUQ4QzMyQ0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTNDOTREN0QwMTQwNDJCMkJGODMxOUY2QUIyNzI2QTE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDZGQjQzQzZBMzkwNEZDNzgzRTRBNTBBQTBGNzU5QUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUY0N0ZBMDUxNDIxNEVGNTlCQUNBNUY5NDRCNzA2ODI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

(AP Photo/Patrick Sison)  </p><p><br/>NEW YORK \u2014 Smoke from Canadian wildfires poured into the U.S. East Coast and Midwest on Wednesday, covering the capitals of both nations in an unhealthy haze, holding up flights at major airports and prompting people to fish out pandemic-era face masks. <br/>While Canadian officials asked other countries for additional help fighting more than 400 blazes nationwide that already have displaced 20,000 people, air quality with what the U.S. rates as hazardous levels of pollution extended into central New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. Massive tongues of unhealthy air extended as far as North Carolina and Indiana, affecting millions of people. <br/>'I can taste the air,' Dr. Ken Strumpf said in a Facebook post from Syracuse, New York, which was enveloped in an amber pall. The smoke, he later said by phone, even made him a bit dizzy. <br/>A pedestrian walks past the smoke and haze shrouded New York Stock Exchange building in New York City Wednesday, June 7, 2023.

David Ake)  <br/>In Baltimore, Debbie Funk sported a blue surgical mask as she and husband, Jack Hughes, took their daily walk around Fort McHenry, a national monument overlooking the Patapsco River. The air hung thick over the water, obscuring the horizon as distant ships pushed slowly through the haze. <br/>'I walked outside this morning, and it was like a waft of smoke,' said Funk. She said the couple planned to stay inside later Wednesday, as officials were urging. <br/>Canadian officials say this is shaping up to be the nation's worst wildfire season ever. It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said. <br/>Smoke from the blazes in various parts of the country has been lapping into the U.S. [1]since last month but intensified with a recent spate of fires in Quebec, where about 100 were considered out of control Wednesday. <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>'The smoke was insane' Tuesday in Montreal, said resident Zachary Kamel, 36. 'I had to close my window because the fresh air just smelled like campfire.' <br/>In this GOES-16 GeoColor and fire temperature satellite image taken Tuesday, June 6, 2023 at 6:40 p.m. EDT and provided by CIRA/NOAA, smoke from wildfires burning in the Canadian Provinces of Quebec, right, and Ontario, left, drift southward. (CIRA/NOAA via AP)  <br/>Quebec Premier Franois Legault said the province currently has the capacity to fight about 40 fires \u2014 and the usual reinforcements from other provinces have been strained by conflagrations in Nova Scotia and elsewhere. <br/>Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre spokesperson Jennifer Kamau said more than 950 firefighters and other personnel have already arrived from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and more will be arriving soon. <br/>In Washington, White Housepress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. His administration has contacted some U.S. governors and local officials about providing assistance, she said. <br/>The largest town in Northern Quebec \u2014 Chibougamau, population about 7,500 \u2014 was evacuated Tuesday, and Legault said the roughly 4,000 residents of the northern Cree town Mistissini would likely have to leave Wednesday. <br/>Eastern Quebec got some rain Wednesday, but Montreal-based Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said no significant rain is expected for days in the remote areas of central Quebec where the wildfires are more intense. <br/>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Zach Taylor said the current weather pattern in the central and eastern U.S. is essentially funneling in the smoke. Some rain should help clear the air somewhat in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend or early next week, though more thorough relief will come from containing or extinguishing the fires, he noted. <br/>Across the border, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned the public to 'prepare for this over the long haul.' New York City Mayor Eric Adams told residents of the United States' most populous city to limit outdoor activities and parks officials closed beaches as smoke smudged out the skyline. <br/>The Federal Aviation Administration paused some flights bound for LaGuardia Airport and slowed planes to Newark Liberty and Philadelphia because the smoke was limiting visibility. It also contributed to delayed arrivals at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. <br/>The smoke even affected Broadway, where 'Killing Eve' star Jodie Comer had difficulty breathing and left the matinee after 10 minutes; the show restarted with an understudy, show publicists said. <br/>Schools in multiple states canceled sports and other outdoor activities, shifting recess inside. Live horse racing was canceled Wednesday and Thursday at Delaware Park in Wilmington. Organizers of Global Running Day, a virtual 5K, advised participants to adjust their plans according to air quality. <br/>New Jersey closed state offices early, and some political demonstrations in spots from Manhattan to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, were moved indoors or postponed. Striking Hollywood writers were pulled off picket lines in the New York metropolitan area. <br/>Sitting in a Brooklyn park with a black face mask on, nanny Meagan Bobb said she was surprised by how bad the air was. <br/>'The little girl was coughing, and I was having problems breathing when I was walking around, so we're looking to go inside somewhere soon,' Bobb said. <br/>The smoke exacerbated health problems for people such as Vicki Burnett, 67, who has asthma and has had serious bouts with bronchitis. <br/>After taking her dogs out Wednesday morning in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Burnett said, 'I came in and started coughing and hopped back into bed.' <br/>Still, she stressed that she's concerned for Canadians, not just herself. <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>'It's unfortunate, and I'm having some problems for it, but there should be help for them,' she said. <br/>___ <br/>Gillies reported from Toronto.

Air with hazardous levels of pollution extended into the New York metropolitan area, central New York state and parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Massive tongues of unhealthy air extended as far as North Carolina and Indiana, affecting millions of people.</p><p>\u201cI can taste the air,\u201d Dr. Ken Strumpf said in a Facebook post from Syracuse, New York, which was enveloped in an amber pall. The smoke, he later said by phone, even made him a bit dizzy.</p><p>The air quality index, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency metric for air pollution, exceeded a staggering 400 at times in Syracuse, New York City and Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley. A level of 50 or under is considered good; anything over 300 is considered \u201chazardous,\u201d when even healthy people are advised to curtail outdoor physical activity.</p><p>In Baltimore, Debbie Funk sported a blue surgical mask as she and husband, Jack Hughes, took their daily walk around Fort McHenry, a national monument overlooking the Patapsco River. The air hung thick over the water, obscuring the horizon.</p><p>\u201cI walked outside this morning, and it was like a waft of smoke,\u201d said Funk.</p><p>Canadian officials say this is shaping up to be the nation's worst wildfire season ever. It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said.</p><p>Smoke from the blazes in various parts of the country has been lapping into the U.S. since last month but intensified with recent fires in Quebec, where about 100 were considered out of control Wednesday \u2014 which, unsettlingly, was national Clean Air Day in Canada.</p><p>The smoke was so thick in downtown Ottawa, Canada's capital, that office towers just across the Ottawa River were barely visible. In Toronto, Yili Ma said her hiking plans were canceled and she was forgoing restaurant patios, a beloved Canadian summer tradition.</p><p>\u201cI put my mask away for over a year, and now I\u2019m putting on my mask since yesterday,\" the 31-year-old lamented.</p><p>Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said the province currently has the capacity to fight about 40 fires \u2014 and the usual reinforcements from other provinces have been strained by conflagrations in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-halifax-rain-fb4a05893fc375ecc1f0db9f37ce18dd\">Nova Scotia</url> and elsewhere.</p><p>Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre spokesperson Jennifer Kamau said more than 950 firefighters and other personnel have arrived from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and more are due soon.</p><p>In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. His administration has contacted some U.S. governors and local officials about providing assistance, she said.</p><p>The largest town in Northern Quebec \u2014 Chibougamau, population about 7,500 \u2014 was evacuated Tuesday, and Legault said the roughly 4,000 residents of the northern Cree town of Mistissini would likely have to leave Wednesday. But later in the day, Mistissini Chief Michael Petawabano said his community remains safe and asked residents to wait for instructions from Cree officials.</p><p>Eastern Quebec got some rain Wednesday, but Montreal-based Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said no significant rain is expected for days in the remote areas of central Quebec where the wildfires are more intense.</p><p>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Zach Taylor said the current weather pattern in the central and eastern U.S. is essentially funneling in the smoke. Some rain should help clear the air somewhat in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend or early next week, though more thorough relief will come from containing or extinguishing the fires, he said.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said 1 million N95 masks would be available at state facilities. New York City closed beaches, and Mayor Eric Adams told residents to stay indoors as much as possible as smoke smudged out the skyline. The Bronx and Central Park zoos closed early and brought their animals inside. The popular Shakespeare in the Park performance was canceled.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration paused some flights bound for LaGuardia Airport and slowed planes to Newark Liberty and Philadelphia because the smoke was limiting visibility. It also contributed to delayed arrivals at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, where a heavy haze shrouded the Washington Monument and forced the cancellation of outdoor tours.</p><p>Major League Baseball put off games in New York and Philadelphia, and even an indoor WNBA game in Brooklyn was called off. On Broadway, \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star Jodie Comer had difficulty breathing and left the matinee after 10 minutes; the show restarted with an understudy, show publicists said.</p><p>Schools in multiple states canceled sports and other outdoor activities, shifting recess inside. Live horse racing was canceled Wednesday and Thursday at Delaware Park in Wilmington. Organizers of Global Running Day, a virtual 5K, advised participants to adjust their plans according to air quality.</p><p>New Jersey closed state offices early, and some political demonstrations in spots from Manhattan to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, were moved indoors or postponed. Striking Hollywood writers were pulled off picket lines in the New York metropolitan area.</p><p>The smoke exacerbated health problems for people such as Vicki Burnett, 67, who has asthma and has had serious bouts with bronchitis.</p><p>After taking her dogs out Wednesday morning in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Burnett said, \u201cI came in and started coughing and hopped back into bed.\u201d</p><p>Still, she stressed that she's concerned for Canadians, not just herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, and I\u2019m having some problems for it, but there should be help for them,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Gillies reported from Toronto.

Saplings for plantation both in forest areas and outside forest areas are raised from various nurseries established in different locations in the States with the funding sources from various schemes implemented in the States. Nurseries for producing quality planting material are established by different State forest departments and such material is also made available for expansion of forests outside designated forest areas. States are regularly advised to raise good quality planting material.</p><p>For restoration and conservation of ecology, the Government is implementing various Centrally Sponsored Umbrella schemes namely National Mission for a Green India, Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats, Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystems, and National River Conservation Programme. The funds collected under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), as compensatory levies from states inter-alia, is also used in plantation activity including compensatory afforestation by States/UTs. The schemes primarily supports ecological restoration through afforestation in and outside forest areas, forest landscape restoration, habitat improvement, soil and water conservation measures, protection etc.</p><p>Expansion of forest and tree cover is an inherent principle of National Forest Policy, 1988, which envisages a national goal to have a minimum of one-third of the total land area of the country under forest and tree cover. Various afforestation related schemes implemented by MoEFandCC and other ministries aim at increasing and improving forest and tree cover. State Governments also implement various schemes for restoration of degraded forest areas.</p><p>MoEFandCC provides funds for conservation, development and promotion of forests in various States under its three major schemes namely, National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green India Mission (GIM) and Forest Fire Protection and Management Scheme (FFPM). NAP has been merged with GIM and an amount of Rs.289.37 crores has been allocated for the current year for GIM whereas Rs.44.19 crores has been allocated for FFPM during the current year.</p><p>This information was given by the Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125373153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6638-D911-JCBF-S0MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 4, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Air with hazardous levels of pollution extended into the New York metropolitan area, central New York state and parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Massive tongues of unhealthy air extended as far as North Carolina and Indiana, affecting millions of people.</p><p>\u201cI can taste the air,\u201d Dr. Ken Strumpf said in a Facebook post from Syracuse, New York, which was enveloped in an amber pall. The smoke, he later said by phone, even made him a bit dizzy.</p><p>The air quality index, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency metric for air pollution, exceeded a staggering 400 at times in Syracuse, New York City and Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley. A level of 50 or under is considered good; anything over 300 is considered \u201chazardous,\u201d when even healthy people are advised to curtail outdoor physical activity.</p><p>In Baltimore, Debbie Funk sported a blue surgical mask as she and husband, Jack Hughes, took their daily walk around Fort McHenry, a national monument overlooking the Patapsco River. The air hung thick over the water, obscuring the horizon.</p><p>\u201cI walked outside this morning, and it was like a waft of smoke,\u201d said Funk.</p><p>Canadian officials say this is shaping up to be the nation's worst wildfire season ever. It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said.</p><p>Smoke from the blazes in various parts of the country has been lapping into the U.S. since last month but intensified with recent fires in Quebec, where about 100 were considered out of control Wednesday \u2014 which, unsettlingly, was national Clean Air Day in Canada.</p><p>The smoke was so thick in downtown Ottawa, Canada's capital, that office towers just across the Ottawa River were barely visible. In Toronto, Yili Ma said her hiking plans were canceled and she was forgoing restaurant patios, a beloved Canadian summer tradition.</p><p>\u201cI put my mask away for over a year, and now I\u2019m putting on my mask since yesterday,\" the 31-year-old lamented.</p><p>Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said the province currently has the capacity to fight about 40 fires \u2014 and the usual reinforcements from other provinces have been strained by conflagrations in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-halifax-rain-fb4a05893fc375ecc1f0db9f37ce18dd\">Nova Scotia</url> and elsewhere.</p><p>Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre spokesperson Jennifer Kamau said more than 950 firefighters and other personnel have arrived from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and more are due soon.</p><p>In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. His administration has contacted some U.S. governors and local officials about providing assistance, she said.</p><p>The largest town in Northern Quebec \u2014 Chibougamau, population about 7,500 \u2014 was evacuated Tuesday, and Legault said the roughly 4,000 residents of the northern Cree town of Mistissini would likely have to leave Wednesday. But later in the day, Mistissini Chief Michael Petawabano said his community remains safe and asked residents to wait for instructions from Cree officials.</p><p>Eastern Quebec got some rain Wednesday, but Montreal-based Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said no significant rain is expected for days in the remote areas of central Quebec where the wildfires are more intense.</p><p>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Zach Taylor said the current weather pattern in the central and eastern U.S. is essentially funneling in the smoke. Some rain should help clear the air somewhat in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend or early next week, though more thorough relief will come from containing or extinguishing the fires, he said.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said 1 million N95 masks would be available at state facilities. New York City closed beaches, and Mayor Eric Adams told residents to stay indoors as much as possible as smoke smudged out the skyline. The Bronx and Central Park zoos closed early and brought their animals inside. The popular Shakespeare in the Park performance was canceled.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration paused some flights bound for LaGuardia Airport and slowed planes to Newark Liberty and Philadelphia because the smoke was limiting visibility. It also contributed to delayed arrivals at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, where a heavy haze shrouded the Washington Monument and forced the cancellation of outdoor tours.</p><p>Major League Baseball put off games in New York and Philadelphia, and even an indoor WNBA game in Brooklyn was called off. On Broadway, \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star Jodie Comer had difficulty breathing and left the matinee after 10 minutes; the show restarted with an understudy, show publicists said.</p><p>Schools in multiple states canceled sports and other outdoor activities, shifting recess inside. Live horse racing was canceled Wednesday and Thursday at Delaware Park in Wilmington. Organizers of Global Running Day, a virtual 5K, advised participants to adjust their plans according to air quality.</p><p>New Jersey closed state offices early, and some political demonstrations in spots from Manhattan to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, were moved indoors or postponed. Striking Hollywood writers were pulled off picket lines in the New York metropolitan area.</p><p>The smoke exacerbated health problems for people such as Vicki Burnett, 67, who has asthma and has had serious bouts with bronchitis.</p><p>After taking her dogs out Wednesday morning in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Burnett said, \u201cI came in and started coughing and hopped back into bed.\u201d</p><p>Still, she stressed that she's concerned for Canadians, not just herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, and I\u2019m having some problems for it, but there should be help for them,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Gillies reported from Toronto.

Kathy Hochul said 1 million N95 masks would be available at state facilities. New York City closed beaches, and Mayor Eric Adams told residents to stay indoors as much as possible as smoke smudged out the skyline. The Bronx and Central Park zoos closed early and brought their animals inside. The popular Shakespeare in the Park performance was canceled.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration paused some flights bound for LaGuardia Airport and slowed planes to Newark Liberty and Philadelphia because the smoke was limiting visibility. It also contributed to delayed arrivals at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, where a heavy haze shrouded the Washington Monument and forced the cancellation of outdoor tours.</p><p>Major League Baseball put off games in New York and Philadelphia, and even an indoor WNBA game in Brooklyn was called off.

And there's little the government can do about it. The primary cause: smoke wafting downwind from more than 150 wildfires burning in Quebec Province, Canada, with no immediate respite in sight. The plume \"is about as widespread as I've ever seen it,\" said Paul Miller, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a Boston-based group of air pollution regulators from many of the states most directly affected. </p><p>The episode ranks among the worst on record for the eastern U.S., EPA data indicates. It's also the latest manifestation of a trend that those regulators are effectively helpless to confront in the short term: bigger and longer-lasting wildfires linked to the effects of climate change. While those blazes are already catastrophically common in California and other Western states, hotter and drier conditions in eastern forests are now facilitating their spread in that part of the country as well. And short of solving climate change, there's not much for federal regulators to do about it. \"We're going to see more fire risk,\" said Jessica McCarty, director of the Geospatial Analysis Center at Miami University in Ohio and a NASA researcher in atmospheric smoke, told a House committee two years ago. Absent any way to stop the plume's spread, state and local agencies could only warn residents to avoid it. From the normally pristine Adirondack Mountains in New York state to central North Carolina, rural and urban areas alike suffered from soot levels that EPA rated as either unhealthy or very unhealthy . Poor visibility from the smoke also caused cascading delays for flights in and around New York City on Wednesday afternoon, some lasting up to an hour. The Federal Aviation Administration briefly halted arriving flights at New York's LaGuardia Airport and has slowed departures at airports around the city, the agency said. \"The agency will continue to adjust the volume of traffic to account for the rapidly changing conditions,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"I know for many communities out West this is nothing new. They experience this every year, but it is certainly getting worse. It is yet another alarming example of the ways in which the climate crisis is disturbing our lives and our communities,\" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday afternoon. President Joe Biden is in touch with the Canadian government, and the U.S. has deployed more than 600 U.S. firefighters and personnel, along with \"water bombers\" and other firefighting equipment, Jean-Pierre said. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA regulates soot by setting air quality standards, which the agency is in the midst of strengthening. But those standards are designed to control soot exposure from industrial plants, vehicles and other human sources. They make no provision for the impact of wildfire smoke. EPA's daily exposure standard is 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Soot levels in Syracuse, N.Y., topped 400 micrograms, NASA scientist Ryan Stauffer wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning. \"Unprecedented does not begin to describe this event,\" Stauffer wrote. In Washington, EPA estimated soot concentrations at 194 micrograms. For regulatory purposes, EPA continues to consider wildfire-related pollution as an \"exceptional event\" that doesn't count against an area's compliance status. In the course of the review of the current soot standards, an EPA advisory panel last year recommended that agency officials \"consider the implications\" of that traditional approach. In a draft rule released in January, EPA staffers agreed that forest blazes are a challenge to implementing ambient air quality standards, but punted on offering any alternative to the status quo. Stay inside In Washington, where soot levels were more than five times EPA's daily exposure standard, public school leaders Wednesday canceled recess, athletic practices and all other outdoor activities. On Twitter, New York City Mayor Eric Adams urged residents with heart or breathing problems to \"try to limit your outdoor activities today to the absolute necessities.\" \"Everyone should limit their exposure by staying indoors and closing windows, especially those with risk factors,\" the Maryland Department of the Environment wrote in a website alert. But for construction workers and others who don't have the option of staying inside, the crisis left them exposed to extraordinarily high levels of smoke, a mashup of harmful compounds that include hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, according to an EPA guide. Most perilous are the tiny bits of particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs and even leach into the bloodstream. Commonly dubbed soot, those fine particles are technically known as PM2.5 because they are no bigger than 2.5 microns in diameter, or one-thirtieth the width of a human hair. They are linked to a wide variety of respiratory and cardiovascular ills, including worsened breathing problems, higher risk of stroke and non-fatal heart attacks, and increased odds of premature deaths in some circumstances. Dr. Susie O'Mara, chair of emergency medicine at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said there could be an uptick in hospital or emergency room visits in coming days as people begin to experience more severe symptoms. \"What we worry about is that we're not seeing it today, but we'll start seeing it tomorrow or the next day when people are actually in quite a bit of trouble,\" O'Mara said. She said the change in air quality can impact asthmatic or nonasthmatic people and could trigger early symptoms like a cough, shortness of breath or runny nose. She urged people to take preventative measures now, particularly if they have a chronic medical condition. Canadian smoke plumes could continue rolling into the U.S. for at least a few more days: As of Tuesday, there were 426 active wildfires across all of Canada, with more than half categorized as \"out of control,\" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre . \"There are fires going on all over the place almost all the time,\" said Miller of the Boston-based air regulatory consortium. Recalling the groundswell of public support that led to passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act, Miller noted that many Americans have no experience with the pollution levels common in the 1960s. The increasing frequency of large wildfires - and highly visible wildfire smoke - raises the possibility of a similar support for action on climate change, he said. \"The point is that people tend to act on things they can see.\" Reporters Rebekah Alvey, Robin Bravender and Danielle Muoio Dunn contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001889365db74ab98b3f7a1630000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MH-9Y51-DY7N-F359-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1147\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 7, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On Friday morning, the blaze was reportedly one half mile away from the Upper Timberline neighborhood.</p><p>After about two weeks of more than 200 firefighters working the project, fire protection lines are around 85% complete in the neighborhood and the process of moving fuel from nearby structures is finished. Despite the fire now reaching 3,632 acres, these efforts should ensure the highest priority of the crews \u2014 human safety.</p><p>Burning operations on the non-civilized end of the fire are taking place. According to a spokesperson with the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, firefighters are still looking to several weeks out for the blaze to be fully extinguished. It is 0% contained.</p><p>A daily news release from the Forest Service stated: \"The percent of containment on a fire is one measure of progress, but not the only one. Completion of firefighting objectives is another measure of progress. These objectives include construction of control lines and protecting highly valued resources such as the Packwood community, sensitive tribal resources and historic structures at Packwood Lake.\"</p><p>Neighborhoods northeast of Butter Creek and in Lower Timberline and Goat Rocks are still at evacuation level one, \"be ready.\" The Upper Timberline area remains at level two, \"be set.\"</p><p>According to James Donahey with the Cowlitz Valley Ranger District, some stands in the forest fire's track contain trees that are over 600 years old.</p><p>Through oral history, record-keeping and determining the age of the majority of the trees, Forest Service staff have determined the area hasn't burned since the 1400s.</p><p>\"Back in the day, they would say, 'OK, all these trees are approximately the same height, similar composition on a similar kind of slope feature. We're going to call that a stand,'\" Donahey said. \"They would then go out and measure the trees in that stand, core some, determine the age of those trees.

The amount depends more on available fuels than fire weather, shows new research from Northern Arizona University and Michigan Technological University, along with other collaborating institutions, published this week in Nature Climate Change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a large retrospective study stretching across Canada and Alaska, the international team of researchers found that carbon stored belowground in soil organic matter was the most important predictor of how much carbon a fire releases, as opposed to drought conditions, temperature or rain.</p><p>The team analyzed field data collected from 417 burn sites in six ecoregions in Canada and Alaska between 2004 and 2015. Although the amount of carbon stored in soils was the biggest predictor, they found that soil moisture was also significant in predicting carbon release.</p><p>\"In these northern forests, soil, not trees, can account for up to 90% of carbon emissions, so we expected that these organic soils would be a significant driver,\" said lead author Xanthe Walker of the Center for Ecosystem Science and Society at Northern Arizona University. \"But we were surprised that fire weather and the time of year a fire starts proved to be poor indicators of carbon combustion. It's really about the fuels that are there when a fire starts.\"</p><p>That's a pivotal finding, since fire weather, as measured by a Fire Weather Index, is one of the main tools scientists and fire managers currently use to model carbon emissions in these boreal forests. This study suggests fuels should be a bigger component of those models.</p><p>\"Soils in high northern latitudes are unique because they contain a large amount of organic carbon,\" said Liza Jenkins, a research scientist at Michigan Tech Research Institute who uses remote sensing for temporal monitoring and landscape change in boreal forests. \"This study shows the importance of belowground carbon and soil moisture in determining carbon emissions from boreal wildfires. This is significant as climate change is altering moisture conditions, which has the potential to unlock belowground carbon through fire and significantly increase carbon emissions in the future.\"</p><p>The vegetation patterns the researchers uncovered were complex - soil moisture, tree species composition and stand age at the time of fire all interacted to predict combustion amounts.</p><p>\"This study upends traditional thought that fire weather is a critical predictor of carbon combustion,\" Jenkins said. \"We hope this finding may help shift research and management focus from fire weather to fuel, and specifically belowground carbon pools.\"</p><p>The site-level resolution of the study allowed the researchers to capture such dynamism in carbon combustion patterns, and offers clues about the way they may shift in the future. Highly flammable black spruce was generally a predictor of carbon combustion, the researchers found, and the presence of this species increased with site moisture and stand age at the time of fire. But such interactions are likely to change with the climate. For example, as the climate warms and fire intervals shorten, black spruce stands are being replaced by deciduous trees and jack pine, which grow in shallower soils that release less carbon during fires.</p><p>Evan Kane, associate professor in Michigan Tech's College of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, synthesized pre- and post-fire data collected during fieldwork sessions following large wildfires in interior Alaska.</p><p>He noted that fire management practitioners have long regarded fuels as the base of two triangles of factors controlling both the presence of fire and fire behavior. Fuels are paired with oxygen and heat in the former triangle, and weather and topography in the latter.</p><p>\"We demonstrate that fuel availability is the most limiting factor in constraining carbon emissions from boreal wildfires, which helps us understand how emissions might change in a warmer climate with changing hydrology and fuel structure,\" Kane said.</p><p>Co-authors on this study include Xanthe Walker, Brendan Rogers, Sander Veraverbeke, Jill Johnstonee, Jennifer Baltzer, Kirsten Barrett, Laura Bourgeau-Chavez, Nicola Day, Bill de Groot, Catherine Dieleman, Scott Goetz, Elizabeth Hoy, Liza Jenkins, Evan Kane, Marc-Andre Parisien, Stefano Potter, Ted Schuur, Merritt Turetsky, Ellen Whitman and Michelle Mack.

Residents or drivers who see smoke in the area southwest of Rawlings should be aware that it may appear to be a forest fire, but is deliberate and controlled, and there is no need to report it to authorities. Originally planned for late fall, the burn was rescheduled due to weather.</p><p>The fire will create smoke, but it will be a controlled flame targeting underbrush and ground cover debris. Pre-burning is planned March 17 with the larger burn scheduled to take place March 18, and resume March 21.</p><p>Access to the wildlife management area at its primitive camping area and at Middle Ridge Road will be limited during the burn, due to potential for low visibility, but will reopen as soon as the burn is completed.</p><p>The purpose of the burn is to improve habitat for wildlife and to restore stands of pitch pine and table mountain pine that are more than 90 years old.</p><p>DNR will conduct the burn with trained wildland firefighters and equipment present to assure safety and efficiency. Adequate firelines will be established before the burn. There are no homes or other structures nearby.</p><p>Updates will be posted on the DNR website and social media platforms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125089448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6510-JKX1-JCBF-S1P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"235\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 15, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, another defendant, Shawn Edward Williams, 49, joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the National Forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>This was the first use of tree DNA evidence in a federal criminal trial. Wilke claimed the wood he sold to a Tumwater mill had been harvested from private property with a valid permit. However, at trial, Richard Cronn, Phd., a Research Geneticist for the USDA Forest Service, testified that the wood Wilke sold was a genetic match to the remains of three poached maple trees investigators had discovered in the Elk Lake area. The DNA analysis was so precise that it found the probability of the match being coincidental was approximately one in one undecillion (one followed by 36 zeroes). Based on this evidence, the jury concluded the wood Wilke sold the mill had been stolen.</p><p>On August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. Some witnesses testified at trial that Wilke was standing next to the nest when it was lit on fire, and therefore appeared to have set the fire. However, because the fire was set at night, they were not able to see his exact actions. The jury did not convict Wilke of the two federal counts related to the forest fire: setting timber afire and using fire in furtherance of a felony.</p><p>One of those who testified that Wilke set the fire, Shawn Williams, pleaded guilty in December 2019 to theft of public property and setting timber afire. He was sentenced in September 2020 to 30 months in prison.</p><p>Quick and diligent investigative work by a U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officer and by a U.S. Forest Service Wildland firefighter preserved important evidence in the case.</p><p>The counts of conviction are punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Judge Settle will determine the appropriate sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.</p><p>Press contact for the U.S. Attorney's Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at 206-553-4110 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov\">Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov</email></p><p>Copyright 2021 Forks Forum</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORFOR-news20210728PXK4191564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORFOR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637S-6RD1-F0HF-82HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475085</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

According to news originating from Montpellier, France, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Fire is a recurrent disturbance in Mediterranean ecosystems. Data assemblage from forest fire services can provide useful information for understanding climate controls on daily fire hazard or long term trends.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Institut De Recherche Pour Le Developpement; University of Montpellier; National Council For Scientific Research; Fire Information System. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Universite de Montpellier: \"Located at the driest range of the Mediterranean bioclimate, and with contrasting socio-political systems compared to the European area, the southern Mediterranean ecosystems are subjected to more extreme climate and social events. This could potentially lead to unique fire regimes and trends worth being characterized for prevention plans and ecosystem management. However, the region is far less documented, due to missing or inhomogeneous fire records, leaving local authorities with no management strategies when large fires happen. We filled this knowledge gap for Lebanon by combining high spatial resolution Landsat data with high temporal resolution VIIRS (S-NPP and NOAA-20) and MODIS (MCD14ML) hotspots to characterize the seasonal and interannual fire regime over the 2001-2020 period. Numerous small fires were hardly detected by global remote sensing. We estimated that 2044 ha burn annually, representing 0.58% of the wildland cover, with no significant trend over the period, but with non climate-related fires detected during the year experiencing socio-political troubles. The spatial and temporal resolution of this dataset identified a particular prolonged fire season up to November, and an unusual bimodal fire season peaking in July and November.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We related these features to the prolonged autumnal soil drought and high August air humidity in the region. This updated fire regime in Lebanon illustrates the benefits of this combined approach for data-scarce regions and provides new insights on the variability of fire weather types in the Mediterranean basin.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Fire Regime Analysis in Lebanon (2001-2020): Combining Remote Sensing Data in a Scarcely Documented Area.

The real estate and lender duo supported local businesses in their endeavor to honor the area's first responders by ordering pizza from Benny&amp;amp;#8217;s Pizza in Oak Park and ice cream from Brown Cow in Forest Park. They dropped off lunch and dessert at Oak Park Fire Department, River Forest Fire Department, and the Forest Park Fire Department. &amp;amp;#8220;We wanted to show our appreciation for what these firefighters do day-in and day-out and feeding them was the least we could do,&amp;amp;#8221; said Jeff Emerson at Berkshire Hathaway Home Services. </p><p>&amp;amp;#8220;I also give up a portion of my commission through Berkshire Hathaway when a first responder buys or sells a home to save them money and Key Mortgage offers a closing credit as well&amp;amp;#8221; he said. The timeliness of the lunch was not a coincidence, coinciding with the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Emerson and Matas both noted that not enough is done to honor First Responders. The real estate team plans on making lunch an annual tradition and will continue to offer discounted services for first responders Jeff Emerson is a full time Real Estate Broker specializing in Chicago and the Western suburbs.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said colder temperatures overnight assisted the state Forest Fire Service and numerous local fire departments in knocking the fire down. </p><p>Authorities have not released details about what happened to the firefighter from the forest fire service. The DEP said the cause of the fire remains under investigation, but added it did not start from any prescribed burning, an effort involving small fires deliberately set by authorities to clear out flammable underbrush in wooded areas. Such efforts have been underway in the area over the last week. The fire yesterday afternoon closed the Garden State Parkway in both directions for several hours, as well as nearby roadways. The DEP said all evacuees have since been allowed to return to their neighborhoods. DEP spokesperson Caryn Shinske said two mixed-use office buildings were destroyed, along with eight smaller buildings, but added additional structures and property were damaged as well. The fire burned near the parkway in an area where Lakewood and Brick Township meet, causing damage in both municipalities. Firefighters from neighboring communities were called to the scene, and a helicopter was used to dump water from a nearby lake in Brick Township on the burning brush, which was fueled by strong wind gusts. The National Weather Service in Mount Holly today placed most of the state under a fire warning with humidity levels recorded at about 20% in the Lakewood area and winds gusting near 40 mph, officials said. -- Wayne Parry, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62F1-F1B1-DY7N-F0GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"298\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 15, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Indo-Burma hotspot is the worst hit -- the extent of vegetation in the region has been reduced from 2,373,057 sq km to a mere 118,653 sq km, a loss of 95 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twenty five species have also gone extinct in these hotspots. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List monitors 1,212 animal species in India - the IUCN says over 12 per cent of them are endangered. Of the 148 endangered species, 69 are mammals, 456 amphibians and 23 reptiles.</p><p>These ominous statistics have been brought to light in an e-publication released here on World Environment Day by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). State of India's Environment in Figures 2021, as the e-publication is titled, is an annual compendium of data and statistics on key issues of environment and development.</p><p>Releasing the e-book, CSE director general Sunita Narain said: \"There is drama in numbers, especially when these numbers give you a trend--are things getting better or worse. It is even more powerful when you can use the trend to understand the crisis, the challenge and the opportunity.\"</p><p>India's forests could certainly use a better understanding of the crisis they are facing. Says Richard Mahapatra, managing editor of Down To Earth, \"At a time when we are witnessing an alarming fall in the timber and non-timber forest produce services in Indian forests -- implying overuse of resources -- climatic cycles are combining with other factors to result in a dramatic rise in forest fire alerts. We must learn to connect the dots.\"</p><p>The CSE report points out that 16 states - including Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand - have witnessed a significant rise in number of forest fire alerts. It says: \"India has seen a drastic rise in forest fires since the start of 2021. As of May 1, the number of fire alerts recorded by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is 433,581. This is quite a jump, even though the official forest fire season of the country is from February to June. Forest fires are influenced by temperature and rainfall in the preceding monsoon. The year 2016, the hottest on record when India's annual temperature rose 0.71oC over the annual average of 25oC, saw 541,135 forest fires -- the most in a decade.\"</p><p>The report adds: \"Rainfall during the 2015 monsoon was 765.8 mm, 14 per cent less than the normal 880 mm, as per the India Meteorological Department. In 2021, too, India sees unusually warm weather along with 8.7 per cent surplus rainfall last monsoon that leaves adequate humidity for fires to spread.\"</p><p>Says Narain about the publication: \"In an age when the quality of data available to us is usually poor--it is either missing, unavailable publicly or of questionable quality--a collection like this can be immensely helpful, especially for journalists. Improving the quality of data can only happen when we use it for policy. Take the case of the ongoing pandemic. Just consider how we have suffered in this past year because we do not have sufficient or accurate data on tests, or the number of deaths, or serological surveys, or genomic sequencing of the variants. In each case, data would have been (and is) critical for policy making.\"</p><p>She adds: \"Data collection is important--it is part of the art of governance--but it is equally important that entire data sets are shared and worked upon so that they can be critiqued and through this process used and improved upon.\"</p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7504601 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7504601</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62W2-3HN1-DYG2-R519-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 8, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This has resulted in a record number of forest fires, 70% of them caused by lightning strikes[1]. </p><p><br/><br/>These forest fires[2] throw tons of particulates into the atmosphere, which have drifted into New Hampshire, forcing the state to issue a public health warning[3]. <br/><br/><br/>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services says fine-particle air pollution concentrations have reached unhealthy levels statewide for people with lung diseases and those who are active outdoors as smoke from wildfires in the west and Canada reaches the area. <br/><br/><br/> Yes, Gov. Sununu, Canada, is officially a public health crisis in New Hampshire. Lock them down! <br/> Ha! He can't. It is distant fires and wind and junk. <br/> Related: US Forest Fire Data Tampering - They Disappeared 57-Years of Inconvenient Truth[4] <br/> And yes, the the green meanies (who are also blue meanies) will say it's climate change, which means you. I say, screwdriver! <br/> I'm no meteorologist, but if there are record numbers of lightning strikes, the odds are good, which means atmospheric energy, storms, and rain. The Canadian government's own analysis[5] predicts increases rainfall through the 21st century from 10-70% above the 1986-2005 baseline. <br/> That includes more frequent and intense rainfalls, such as downpours from thunderstorms, more instances of rain falling on snow, and new storm patterns. This is the opposite of drought, for those keeping score, which, by their own admission, is unlikely because of, you guessed it, crap you put in the atmosphere. <br/> Speaking of which, record numbers of forest fires, not unlike volcanic eruptions (which do this much better) have a cooling effect on the planet. Think about that. Perfectly natural processes that have occurred for millennia result in natural actions that reverse weather trends independently from you or me doing anything. <br/> It gets hot and dry. It rains there's lightning and fires fill the sky with bits that block light from the thing without which the earth would be a cold and barren rock (That's the sun, for Liberals). <br/> Changes in the sun alter cloud formation which impacts temperature. Solar machinations and alignments and tilt and distance change how effectively the sun warms the earth or does not. And that's all find a good or good and fine but what matters is this. <br/> Related: CO2 Increases 'Linked to' Rising Education Costs and More Gun Crimes in Democrat Cities but not Forest Fires.[6] <br/> It's not about you; it's about them - wanting to convert western economies away from free markets. And Canada is one of those, and their fires create a health hazard in the Granite State. <br/> As for the green thing, there is a cure, but you have to electorally sacrifice many Democrat-held seats for elected office\u2014most of them at a minimum. And you'll know when you've done enough because people will just stop talking about legislating the weather. <br/><br/> The post Where There's Smoke There's Canada Which Is Officially a Public Health Menace to Granite Staters[7] appeared first on Granite Grok[8]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/07/04/1013026434/canada-battles-more-than-180-wildfires-with-hundreds-dead-in-heat-wave\">https://www.npr.org/2021/07/04/1013026434/canada-battles-more-than-180-wildfires-with-hundreds-dead-in-heat-wave</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/?s=forest+fire\">https://granitegrok.com/?s=forest+fire</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wcax.com/2021/07/26/nh-air-quality-affected-by-smoke-wildfires-west-canada/\">https://www.wcax.com/2021/07/26/nh-air-quality-affected-by-smoke-wildfires-west-canada/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/05/us-forest-fire-data-tampering-they-dissapeared-57-years-of-inconvenient-truth\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/05/us-forest-fire-data-tampering-they-dissapeared-57-years-of-inconvenient-truth</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/basics/trends-projections/changes-precipitation.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/basics/trends-projections/changes-precipitation.html</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2020/09/wildfires-result-of-systemic-democrat-incompetence-not-co2-or-your-modern-lifestyle\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2020/09/wildfires-result-of-systemic-democrat-incompetence-not-co2-or-your-modern-lifestyle</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/07/where-theres-smoke-theres-canada-which-is-officially-a-public-health-menace-to-granite-staters\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/07/where-theres-smoke-theres-canada-which-is-officially-a-public-health-menace-to-granite-staters</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com\">https://granitegrok.com</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-GRAG13621616273395366952587910001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRAG-136216</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637D-YXC1-F03R-N3JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><timeReceived>10:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Granite Grok</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 26, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats Climate Cult</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forest Fire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Public Health</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New Hampshire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Smoke</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

(Despite 300 years of slavery, 100 years of Jim Crow racism, 50 years of mass incarceration, thousands of lynchings and murders, redlining to prevent access to housing, etc., etc.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even with the equal protection presumably provided by the 14th Amendment, systemic racism has been the real determinant of the lived experiences of African Americans in our country. Affirmative action has been and should continue to be a tiny part of the reparations this country, my country, owes to Black Americans who have been brutalized for the duration of our country's existence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And now the six justices who voted in the majority to end affirmative action want me to believe this is because they endorse equal protection? No, I don't think they appreciate the irony.</p><p>Vic Sandler, Plymouth</p><p>\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7</p><p>So the Supreme Court has decided that using race as a factor in college admissions is no longer legal. Let's hope that the same fate awaits the very unfair practice of legacy admissions. Legacy admissions give a substantial preference to those whose relatives have attended a particular college. It results in a system that gives overwhelming preference to students based on nothing more than their relationship to prior graduates.</p><p>Douglas Wobbema, Burnsville</p><p>\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7</p><p>Anyone who didn't vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 is responsible for today's Supreme Court decision on affirmative action.</p><p>Also, it's a warning for those progressives who \"aren't excited\" by President Joe Biden in 2024.</p><p>Jim Piga, Mendota Heights</p><p>NEIL GORSUCH</p><p>When public officials break the mold</p><p>I read with interest \"Justice for the tribes: Neil Gorsuch\" (Opinion Exchange, June 29), wherein I especially appreciated the statement \"It should instead serve as a warning against our tendency to essentialize the justices, to carve out categories of 'conservative' and 'liberal' to fit our prejudices.\"</p><p>I think this tendency applies broadly to all categories of elected and appointed leaders in this nation. With or without their consent, candidates gain entry into power by becoming caricatures of themselves and their party. By the end of a campaign season filled with sound bites and invective, I must make my best guess about which individuals are most likely to show up with calm wisdom in work that seeks to uphold justice for all. Thank you, Justice Gorsuch, for consistently standing up for justice and respect for the first nations of this land.</p><p>Kathleen McDonough, Richfield</p><p>SMOKE</p><p>I want our summer back!</p><p>It used to be standard practice that some wildfires were allowed to burn out rather than having forest firefighters work to contain and put out the fires. That practice has been changed in some places, but not everywhere.</p><p>The standard practice needs to be changed dramatically and right now. In Minnesota and across the U.S. and Canada, this summer's forest fires have spread smoke as never before. The smoke pollution is affecting hundreds of millions of people. It not only causes \"haze\" so thick that some days one can't see across Minneapolis lakes, but more importantly, the particulate matter in smoke can cause both immediate and long-lasting adverse health impacts for everyone.</p><p>Unfortunately, wildfires and forest fires are not just a North American phenomenon. In recent years, there have been major wildfires in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, Australia and elsewhere. Smoke from this summer's fires is reaching Europe and elsewhere. The upsurge in such fires is a real, tangible consequence of global climate change. And they can be expected to occur even more frequently and widely in the future, as droughts cause vegetation to dry out and become even more susceptible to fires.</p><p>So, what can we do?</p><p>In the short term, the U.S. and Canada (at a minimum) need to mobilize forest firefighters and deliver them to the areas where the forests fires are raging. Both countries should also assign military personnel and equipment to join in the battles including aircraft to deliver the firefighters and equipment as well as water and fire-suppressing chemicals.</p><p>In the longer term, the U.S., Canada and other nations need to work together to create an international forest fire-fighting service whose mission is to immediately find, target and put out forest fires and other wildfires and that will eventually expand into a global fire service. Why global? Smoke from these fires can blow all across the earth.</p><p>James Uttley, Golden Valley</p><p>The three seasons in Minnesota: winter, road construction and wildfires.</p><p>Sue Kruskopf, Minneapolis</p><p>CAR-FREE TRIPS</p><p>We need zoning changes, not marketing</p><p>For Minneapolis to make 60% of trips car-free as transportation planners hope (front page, June 26, and \"Car-free utopia will collide with reality,\" Opinion Exchange, June 28), we need two major things, a comprehensive public transit system and walkable neighborhoods.</p><p>To create walkable neighborhoods, there need to be zoning changes so that residents can find a grocery store, hardware store, post office, library, etc., in their neighborhood. If you can walk down to the corner to get a gallon of milk and stop at the post office on your way, most people who are able to walk will walk. If they have to travel more than a mile or two to these amenities, most will drive.</p><p>I have been lucky to live near where I worked (one mile) for more than 20 years and could walk to work. I could also walk to the local garden store, gym, movie theater and pharmacy (just over a mile). But a trip to the post office or library required more of a time and effort commitment, especially in inclement weather.</p><p>The more foot traffic we have in our neighborhoods, the more we get to know our neighbors. And the more \"eyes on the street,\" which deter crime, the safer our neighborhoods will be. Safe and connected neighborhoods provide greater enjoyment and livability. Sixty percent of trips could absolutely be car-free. But that would require zoning changes, planning and work, not just marketing.</p><p>Michelle Lee-Reid, Minneapolis</p><p>THE WORKPLACE</p><p>Facing burnout? Make some changes.</p><p>I applaud the Star Tribune for tackling burnout, a prevalent yet pervasively misunderstood subject (Business, June 26). Unfortunately, the complexity of the topic deters those who experience it from trying to understand it. I keep the definition simple for my exhausted and overwhelmed clients - burnout is the difference between your expectations and your reality.</p><p>Perhaps you expected to be assigned a workload for one person, but then three colleagues quit and now you're doing the work of four people. Maybe you expected exciting developmental opportunities, but then found yourself stuck in the same routine day after day. Perhaps you expected to be treated with respect at work, but then found yourself in a toxic work environment. The greater the difference between your expectations and your reality, the greater the opportunity for burnout.</p><p>While the subject may be complex, the solution isn't terribly sophisticated - change your expectations or change your reality.</p><p>Leah Phifer, Minneapolis</p><p>The writer is an employee engagement consultant.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN71250465</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MT-S951-DYRH-952Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1211\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 30, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>OPINION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000033</classCode><className>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DK</classCode><className>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000035</classCode><className>AFRICAN AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000104</classCode><className>APPEALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

The air, he said, \"just didn't smell right. </p><p>\"I thought I would mask up and be safe,\" he said. \"I'm going to be 59 years old, and I'm trying to watch myself.\" </p><p>A fog-like haze crept into Western Pennsylvania overnight as most people slept, leaving the sun obscured for much of Wednesday and prompting bewildered residents to post photographs of the smoky landscapes to social media. </p><p>The smoke is anticipated to impact Pennsylvania for the rest of the week, with the worst conditions being in the morning. Some relief is possible on Saturday, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. </p><p>The agency announced that all of Pennsylvania was under a Code Red air quality action day Wednesday as a result of the Canadian wildfires, and would be again on Thursday. </p><p>Local and state agencies warned that sensitive groups including children, senior citizens and others with respiratory issues should avoid outdoor activities. The general public should reduce long or intense outdoor activities and take more breaks. </p><p>Paige Spisso of New Alexandria said her family would've stayed home, but she didn't want her 4-year-old son to miss a swimming lesson at Veterans' Memorial Pool in Greensburg. </p><p>\"We try to stay inside and have the air purifiers running,\" she said. </p><p>Children at the Center on Franklin home-school class in Vandergrift had to nix outdoor play and tending to the community garden nearby. </p><p>\"We can't take the children outside,\" teacher Chloe Kruse said. </p><p>Others took the smoke in stride. </p><p>The smoke didn't affect the the Frank B. Fuhrer Jr. Invitational at the Pittsburgh Field Club in Fox Chapel. The players were greeted with cool temperature, some fog and a light breeze. </p><p>\"We knew there was a warning, but we didn't consider postponing the event,\" Tri-State PGA Director David Wright said. \"The closest alert was in the Mon Valley. Our early start helped. One thing it did affect was my daughter's field trip, which was cancelled.\" </p><p>Dennis Munko of Leechburg said he saw the alert, but he didn't smell anything different in the air. </p><p>\"It didn't affect me,\" Munko said. \"I didn't think about it when I played.\" </p><p>The air quality index seemed to be pretty consistent by midday around the region -- the index measures air pollution levels and the number rises as pollution increases. In Greensburg, Pittsburgh and Tarentum midday, the index hovered just below 200 -- the top of the unhealthy range, meaning the general public may experience some health effects, according to airnow.gov. </p><p>National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Kennedy said that as of 8 p.m. Wednesday night, Downtown Pittsburgh's air quality index was at 171, down from a high of 211 at 10 a.m. that morning. </p><p>The area typically is in the index range deemed \"good\" -- zero to 50, said Lee Hendricks, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Moon. Moderate includes an index between 51 and 100, and air unhealthy for sensitive groups ranks between 101 and 150. Unhealthy air that would cause health effects for everyone is between 201 and 300. </p><p>It seems likely the poor air quality will stick around for at least a couple more days. </p><p>\"This isn't something that's going to clear out, unfortunately, in 24 hours,\" Hendricks said. </p><p>Canada is seeing its worst wildfire season on record with about 29,000 square miles being affected, Reuters reported. The ongoing wildfires caused pollution problems locally and elsewhere earlier this month. The problems returned Wednesday throughout the Great Lakes region and in parts of the central and eastern United States, according to The Associated Press. </p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, Inc. reported on an interactive map that there were 480 active fires as of Wednesday afternoon, 239 of which were out of control. </p><p>For some, the smoky conditions resembled fog at first. Until they got a whiff. </p><p>Stacey Oden said she noticed a \"burnt wire\" smell around her New Kensington home early Wednesday. </p><p>\"Our dogs like to play in the backyard after we get home from work, but we'll probably just keep them in if the odor/air quality is concerning,\" she said. </p><p>Outdoor activities around the area were postponed or moved to a different location. </p><p>Stage AE moved a Wednesday evening performance by My Morning Jacket indoors and a Tom Keifer performance scheduled for July 1 at Mountain View Amphitheater near Harmar was moved to Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall. </p><p>A \"City in the Streets\" event in Garfield was postponed to July 5. Wheeling Island Hotel Casino Racetrack canceled races.  </p><p>Geoff Rabinowitz, environmental health deputy director for the Allegheny County Health Department, said the agency doesn't have any regulations that limit outdoor activities when air quality is an issue. </p><p>\"The hosting of outdoor activities, such as concerts, festivals and sporting events, during poor days are up to the discretion of the event organizers,\" he said. </p><p>The department provides up-to-date information about air quality at its online dashboard to help residents make decisions about participating in outdoor activities based on their own health, Rabinowitz said. </p><p>For people who work outside, it was inescapable. </p><p>PennDOT reviewed work schedules in District 12, which covers Fayette, Greene, Washington and Westmoreland counties, to limit employees' exposure. Workers performed activities inside enclosed equipment or a building, spokeswoman Melissa Maczko said. </p><p>\"Hopefully this will only last a few days and operations will be back to normal early next week,\" she said. </p><p>Crews were still working without an issue at Creekside Landscape Supply in Southwest Greensburg, but there was a noticeable difference in the atmosphere, owner Bill Reese said. He didn't give closing up the shop a thought. </p><p>\"It's just hard to believe that the smoke has traveled this far,\" he said. </p><p>Greensburg public works crew member Jeff Heater said he's used to a different odor -- asphalt. </p><p>\"It's just a normal working day,\" he said while paving an alley off Harrison Avenue with crew members. </p><p>Gary Negley of Tarentum didn't let the smoky haze affect his daily routine. His gym had open doors welcoming patrons on Fourth Avenue. </p><p>\"I haven't had any issues, and I'm not worried about it,\" he said. </p><p>Neither was landscaper Mark Barkowski who used a leaf blower to clean a sidewalk in Harrison. </p><p>\"I've been doing this for 40 years, you just have to bear with it and go,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-6335943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68KB-H621-JBXT-N2DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1173\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000800</classCode><className>GOLF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

(AP) \u2014 Firefighters continue to make progress against a huge California forest fire that forced evacuations for thousands of people and destroyed 41 homes and other buildings near Yosemite National Park, officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Crews battling the Oak Fire in Mariposa County got a break from increased humidity levels as monsoonal moisture moved through the Sierra Nevada foothills, said a Tuesday morning report by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.</p><p>After minimal growth Monday and overnight, the blaze had consumed more than 28 square miles (72 square km) of forest land, with 26% containment on Tuesday, Cal Fire said. The cause was under investigation.</p><p>\u201cFire crews continue providing structure defense, extinguishing hot spots, and building and improving direct fire lines,\u201d the report said.</p><p>About 6,000 residents from mountain communities were still under evacuation orders while heavy smoke from the fire drifted more than 200 miles (322 kilometers), reaching Lake Tahoe, parts of Nevada and the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said.</p><p>Nearly 3,000 firefighters with aircraft support were battling the blaze that erupted last Friday southwest of the park, near the town of Midpines. It exploded in size on Saturday as flames churned through tinder-dry brush and trees amid the worst drought in decades.</p><p>Numerous roads were closed, including a stretch of State Route 140 that\u2019s one of the main routes into Yosemite.</p><p>California has experienced increasingly larger and deadlier wildfires in recent years as climate change has made the West much warmer and drier over the past 30 years. Scientists have said weather will continue to be more extreme and wildfires more frequent, destructive and unpredictable.</p><p>The Oak Fire burned as firefighters also made progress against an earlier blaze that burned to the edge of a grove of giant sequoias in the southernmost part of Yosemite. The Washburn Fire, spanning a 7.6-square-mile (19-square-km) area, was 87% contained on Tuesday after burning for more than two weeks and moving into the Sierra National Forest.</p><p>In North Texas, crews are battling a wildfire that destroyed 16 homes and damaged five others amid sweltering temperatures and strong winds. In a Tuesday statement, officials said there were \u201csignificant hotspots\u201d throughout the Chalk Mountain Fire near Glen Rose involving unburned and partially burned fuels. The blaze was 20% contained.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-1ceaf38a54afd6c82eb2c143434a9f0e20220726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6614-FW81-DYMD-642C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"407\"/><timeReceived>8:44 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 26, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kathy Hochul expanded an air quality health advisory in New York to include the entire state on Wednesday. Air quality levels in parts of the state are now unhealthy for all people, while the New York City area remains unhealthy for sensitive groups. Hundreds of thousands of N95 masks are available to New Yorkers, with some being distributed at transit hubs and parks, Hochul said in a news release. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://\"/></p><p>Residents are being advised to stay indoors with their air conditioning running or, in some areas, wear N95 masks if they have to be outside.</p><p>Places from Pennsylvania to Iowa are experiencing very unhealthy air, which means the risk of detrimental health effects is increased for everyone, not just sensitive groups. A small area east and north of Detroit reached hazardous levels Wednesday morning - that's considered a \"health warning of emergency conditions,\" according to the federal government's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/\">Air Quality Index</url>. </p><p>Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Davenport, Iowa, all saw readings in the very unhealthy range Wednesday morning. The smoke is causing unhealthy air quality readings stretching south as far as St. Louis, Cincinnati and Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>A Code Red alert - warning of unhealthy air quality - was issued for much of the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Wednesday, according to AirNow.gov. </p><p>Locations under the Code Red warning include Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Erie in Pennsylvania, Columbus, Ohio, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Madison and Milwaukee in Wisconsin. </p><p>The wildfire smoke has prompted closures and event cancellations in the Northeast and the Midwest. The zoo in Eerie, Pennsylvania, was closed for the day; the band Garbage canceled their show in Madison, Wisconsin; and in Ohio, concerts, some sports events and pools were closed. In Minneapolis, the Parks and Recreation Board canceled all Wednesday outdoor programs in the parks, according to a Facebook post. </p><p>Chicago and Detroit had the worst air quality in the world Tuesday night, with Detroit's air at one point reaching a \"very unhealthy\" Air Quality Index of 205, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iqair.com/us/world-air-quality-ranking\">IQAir</url>. Chicago registered an Air Quality Index of 174 late Tuesday. The Air Quality Index runs from 0 to 500, where levels of 50 or below are considered healthy.

Motorists were asked to drive slowly and with caution due to the reduced visibility on the bridge. </p><p>High levels of fine particulate in the air in Michigan could become unhealthy or hazardous for all residents at some point - not just sensitive groups, the state's health department warned. </p><p>\"The most protective option when air is unhealthy for you is to stay indoors with air conditioning, reduce strenuous activities and limit outdoor activities. If you must be outside, N95 masks offer enhanced protection when used according to product instructions,\" the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.</p><p>Wildfire smoke carries particulate matter, or PM2.5 - a tiny but dangerous pollutant that, when inhaled, can travel deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdc.gov/air/particulate_matter.html\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</url>. The particulate matter has been linked to a number of health problems including<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/13/health/wildfire-smoke-asthma-health-wellness/index.html\"> asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses</url>. </p><p>American cities under air quality alerts are mostly in \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/\">Code Orange</url>\" - with the air deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups - or \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/\">Code Red</url>,\" which is when the air is believed to be unhealthy for the public.</p><p>Hazy skies could return to New York</p><p>Officials in New York warned that air quality levels could spike to hazardous levels this week - about three weeks after New York City topped the list of the world's worst air pollution as smoke from the Canadian wildfires wafted south, turning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/us/new-york-air-pollution-canada-wildfires-climate/index.html\">skies orange.</url></p><p>\"With smoke from the Canadian wildfires once again impacting air quality throughout our state this week, we're urging New Yorkers to remain vigilant,\" Hochul said in a statement. </p><p>\"We're activating emergency cell phone alerts to ensure New Yorkers have the latest information and are continuing to coordinate with local counties to monitor conditions and distribute masks.

The higher the AQI values, the greater the level of air pollution and health concern there is, according to AirNow.gov. \"Levels of concern\" in relation to air pollutants range from \"good\" to \"hazardous.\" This is based on how someone would be affected after breathing in polluted air for a few hours or days.</p><p>Each level is also assigned a corresponding color, from green, representing \"good,\" to maroon, representing \"hazardous.\"</p><p>If the AQI values are at or are below 100, air quality is generally considered satisfactory.

Some improvement in the air quality is expected on Thursday, particularly over the Great Lakes area, where rain and storms will help cleanse the air.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Canada is seeing its\u00a0worst fire season on record\u00a0as hundreds of blazes rage across the country - with more than 250 burning \"out of control,\" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>As massive clouds of smoke cross into the US, air quality alerts have been issued for the entire states of New York, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Delaware and Maryland as well are parts of Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul expanded an air quality health advisory in New York to include the entire state on Wednesday. Air quality levels in parts of the state are now unhealthy for all people, while the New York City area remains unhealthy for sensitive groups. Hundreds of thousands of N95 masks are available to New Yorkers, with some being distributed at transit hubs and parks, Hochul said in a news release.</p><p>Live updates: US air quality impacted by wildfire smoke</p><p>Residents are being advised to stay indoors with their air conditioning running or, in some areas, wear N95 masks if they have to be outside.</p><p>Places from Pennsylvania to Iowa are experiencing very unhealthy air, which means the risk of detrimental health effects is increased for everyone, not just sensitive groups. A small area east and north of Detroit reached hazardous levels Wednesday morning - that's considered a \"health warning of emergency conditions,\" according to the federal government's\u00a0Air Quality Index.</p><p>Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Davenport, Iowa, all saw readings in the very unhealthy range Wednesday morning. The smoke is causing unhealthy air quality readings stretching south as far as St. Louis, Cincinnati and Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>A Code Red alert - warning of unhealthy air quality - was issued for much of the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Wednesday, according to AirNow.gov.</p><p>Locations under the Code Red warning include Chicago, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Erie in Pennsylvania, Columbus, Ohio, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Madison and Milwaukee in Wisconsin.</p><p>The wildfire smoke has prompted closures and event cancellations in the Northeast and the Midwest. The zoo in Eerie, Pennsylvania, was closed for the day; the band Garbage canceled their show in Madison, Wisconsin; and in Ohio, concerts, some sports events and pools were closed. In Minneapolis, the Parks and Recreation Board canceled all Wednesday outdoor programs in the parks, according to a Facebook post.</p><p>Chicago and Detroit had the worst air quality in the world Tuesday night, with Detroit's air at one point reaching a \"very unhealthy\" Air Quality Index of 205, according to\u00a0IQAir. Chicago registered an Air Quality Index of 174 late Tuesday. The Air Quality Index runs from 0 to 500, where levels of 50 or below are considered healthy.

(Chrissy Suttles/Beaver County Times/USA Today Network)</p><p>Chicago asked all residents - especially those with heart or lung disease, older adults, pregnant people and young children - to avoid outdoor activities and protect themselves from exposure. Chicago Public Schools and camps are also moving activities indoors, city officials said in a news release.</p><p>\"Within five steps of walking outside in the morning yesterday I could smell the smoke and see the haze-it looks like if you were looking through clingfilm,\" Brent Rappaport, a Chicago resident, told CNN, referring to the air quality in the city on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>\"I usually bike to work in the summer months but with this air that's really not possible.\"</p><p>About 11 miles away, Evanston, Illinois, closed\u00a0all swimming beaches and canceled a concert Tuesday due to the poor air quality, the city said on Facebook, asking residents to limit outdoor exposure through Wednesday.</p><p>In Michigan, the Mackinac Bridge was shrouded in smoke Tuesday. Motorists were asked to drive slowly and with caution due to the reduced visibility on the bridge.</p><p>Smoke from Canadian fires covers the Mackinac Bridge connecting the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan. (The Mackinac Bridge Authority)</p><p>High levels of fine particulate in the air in Michigan could become unhealthy or hazardous for all residents at some point - not just sensitive groups, the state's health department warned.</p><p>\"The most protective option when air is unhealthy for you is to stay indoors with air conditioning, reduce strenuous activities and limit outdoor activities. If you must be outside, N95 masks offer enhanced protection when used according to product instructions,\" the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.</p><p>Wildfire smoke carries particulate matter, or PM2.5 - a tiny but dangerous pollutant that, when inhaled, can travel deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream, according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The particulate matter has been linked to a number of health problems including\u00a0asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.</p><p>American cities under air quality alerts are mostly in \"Code Orange\" - with the air deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups - or \"Code Red,\" which is when the air is believed to be unhealthy for the public.</p><p>Hazy skies could return to New York</p><p>Officials in New York warned that air quality levels could spike to hazardous levels this week - about three weeks after New York City topped the list of the world's worst air pollution as smoke from the Canadian wildfires wafted south, turning\u00a0skies orange.</p><p>\"With smoke from the Canadian wildfires once again impacting air quality throughout our state this week, we're urging New Yorkers to remain vigilant,\" Hochul said in a statement.</p><p>\"We're activating emergency cell phone alerts to ensure New Yorkers have the latest information and are continuing to coordinate with local counties to monitor conditions and distribute masks. I encourage all New Yorkers to stay informed about the latest updates and take the necessary precautions to protect yourselves and your loved ones.\"</p><p>In Ohio, a spokesperson for the Cleveland's mayor's office said, \"what happened in NY a few weeks ago and Chicago today may happen here in Cleveland tomorrow.\"</p><p>The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency issued an air quality advisory, forecasting fine particulate levels in the \"Unhealthy\" Air Quality Index range.</p><p>Indianapolis drivers were also warned about reduced visibility, with the National Weather Service saying to \"be prepared for haze that could suddenly reduce visibilities\" in some areas Tuesday and Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5532487</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K4-CFM1-JBSN-3258-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Kent Stater: Kent State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 28, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Kent</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>OH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001885</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY MONITORING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Vidyut and his co-founder Kevin Kung, Chief Technology Officer of Takachar and also a Breakthrough Energy Fellow, had the opportunity to showcase their groundbreaking technology for Breakthrough Energy leaders and community leaders during a recent trip to India.</p><p>Vidyut explained that his drive for launching Takachar and advancing clean tech started early, sharing, \"I grew up in New Delhi, and the city is known to have one of the worst air qualities in the world. You can see it around here right now, right? This is due to the open burning of agricultural waste here. So every winter, we would have very bad air quality and part of it would be contributed by the open burning of agricultural waste in farms surrounding the city.\"</p><p>Vidyut began his career as a senior user experience researcher with Simpa Energy, where he developed affordable solar energy systems for off-grid households and small businesses in rural India. He went on to co-found Pirool Energy during his master's study on biomass technology at TU Delft, a biomass-to-fuels company that focused on utilizing forest fire-causing pine needle waste in the Himalayas. He co-founded Takachar with Kevin in 2018.</p><p>Takachar's mission also hits close to home for Kevin. He grew up next to a rice field and experienced farmers disposing of agricultural waste. He explained, \"I grew up in Taiwan, and I lived right next to a rice field. I remember after every harvest, farmers would also burn some of the residues and it creates this smell, which is actually not unpleasant. Even today, it creates a very nostalgic memory whenever I smell that, but that's not the sort of memories I want my children to have.\"</p><p>After completing a Doctor of Philosophy in Biofuels and Renewable Energy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kevin spent six years designing engineering systems in resource-constrained settings. His past work includes borehole restoration in Uganda, interlocking stabilized construction materials in Ghana, and renewable energy systems in Kenya and India.</p><p>Takachar's groundbreaking technology</p><p>The problem Takachar seeks to solve is massive--globally, $120 billion worth of biomass (crop residue) is burned in the open air each year. Takachar developed a portable machine that attaches to tractors and turns crop waste into biofuels, fertilizers, and other valuable products onsite, making it accessible to farmers in rural and underserved communities.</p><p>Traditional biomass process technologies are large-scale and expensive, forcing many farmers to burn their crop residues at the end of the harvest--especially those without the financial resources to transport waste to a centralized place. This results in both detrimental air pollution, GHG emissions, and economic loss for farmers. Through the deployment of the portable machine that can attach directly to tractors, Vidyut and his team solve for both.</p><p>He stated, \"We want to really make rural communities resilient and withstand the shocks of climate change themselves while also creating economic value for them. That's why we are in this over the long term.\"</p><p>Takachar worked with farmers and potential customers to develop the technology to ensure it would be both accessible and functional for users. \"We really spent a lot of time and effort speaking and engaging with our users and our customers and farmers to understand the needs, pain points, their aspirations, and work together with them to arrive at the features of the technology and the performance metrics and the functional requirements,\" Vidyut said. \"We've developed a really good system in our company to inculcate this habit in our prototyping process so that we come up with a product that really solves a problem for our end users.\"</p><p>The role of the Breakthrough Energy Fellows Program</p><p>Vidyut and Kevin are both part of the 2022 Cohort of the Breakthrough Energy Fellows Program, which supports early-stage entrepreneurs with the funding, resources, and network needed to develop their technology at scale. For Vidyut, the opportunity to connect with other climate entrepreneurs has been key to advancing not just Takachar's technology, but also the company's business model and plan to go to market.</p><p>Vidyut explained, \"The Breakthrough Energy Fellows program is like a family for us of entrepreneurs who are on a similar journey for climate impact. And it's great to be with similar deep tech, climate tech startups who are trying to do their R&amp;D, develop their technology and get that into the market.\"</p><p>Kevin agreed. He shared that the Fellows program provides a community of innovators determined to tackle the world's greatest climate challenges and solutions, making his experience more collaborative and successful. \"The journey can get pretty lonely and you are not sure if you're doing things correctly. That's when having fellow innovators, people with whom we have Brain Trusts, and just having conversations about certain challenges that we've met. Building that community is very empowering and also very beneficial to our work.\"</p><p>What's next for Takachar?</p><p>Takachar is at the forefront of revolutionizing biomass process technologies and farming as a whole. For Vidyut, Kevin, and the rest of the leaders behind Takachar, their work is just one part of the global, collaborative effort needed to achieve a clean tech future--and Vidyut is optimistic.</p><p>\"This work in the climate tech space has become mainstream. Everything is going to see a change and an upheaval, the way we produce power, the way we make cement, the way we make fertilizers, the way we make steam. Everything is going to change, and it has to change. And society is going to change on a very fundamental level because of that. So that's what makes me very optimistic about seeing an impact, at least within my working career in the next 10 to 15 years.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://breakthroughenergy.org/news/takachar/\">https://breakthroughenergy.org/news/takachar/</url></p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8172392 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8172392</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C1-1S71-JC11-131X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1146\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 31, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Harrowing escapes. The charred shells of what's left behind. It's hard not to be terrified by images of deadly wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jon Heggie - who has been a division chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) - knows what's it's like facing down a wildfire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I've been in my fair share of major incidents up and down the state,\" Heggie told CNN Travel. \"A description will not ever do it justice. The sights, the sounds, the feelings - the energy you feel from a large-scale incident is sensory overload,\" he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You can feel the radiant heat penetrating your body basically, the smoke conditions that kind of blur your vision. ... [The] sound of numerous trees being engulfed, it basically shakes the ground. It's quite a dramatic event when you're at the fire front of a large fire.\"</p><p>The hard-earned experience of Heggie and other experts can help the rest of us increase our chances of survival in a wildfire - or avoid being trapped in one.</p><p>Learn about wildfires before you travel</p><p>Residents in wildfire-prone areas of the United States and the rest of the world might be used to keeping up with news of wildfires. It behooves travelers, who might have less experience, to do the same.</p><p>\"Keep situational awareness. Pay attention to the local news. Pay attention to your local surroundings,\" Heggie said. \"... If you're in a wildland area, you must pay attention to your surroundings because if a fire were to start, it can very quickly move in directions that can put people in harm's way.\"</p><p>Beth Pratt, California regional executive director of the National Wildlife Federation, owns a home just outside fire-prone Yosemite National Park and echoes that advice through decades of experience.</p><p>\"Stay alert. Know you might need to be flexible with your plans or routes,\" she said.</p><p>Nick Mott, co-author of the book \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/this-is-wildfire-9781639730797/\">This Is Wildfire: How to Protect Yourself, Your Home, and Your Community in the Age of Heat</url>,\" said to pay attention to so-called red flag warnings.</p><p>\"So basically, those are weather warnings when there's high fire danger.\" Watch for \"super-high heat, high winds.\"</p><p>\"If you're a traveler, it might be smart to stay out of an area that seems prone to burn,\" he said.</p><p>The Red Cross also advises that you might want to leave an area before there's even an official evacuation notice.</p><p>Some more preparedness tips:</p><p>\u00b7 Get alerts to your phone: Sign up for alerts at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/\">readyforwildfire.org</url>, Heggie suggested. On a road trip, listen to local talk radio and news stations. <url normalizedValue=\"https://fire.airnow.gov/\">AirNow</url> also tracks wildfires in North America. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">European Forest Fire Information System</url> (EFFIS) can help people traveling there. <url normalizedValue=\"https://myfirewatch.landgate.wa.gov.au/map.html\">My Fire Watch</url> can help with tracking in Australia.</p><p>\u00b7 Be prepared to get away: When you're in wildfire-prone areas, you should not only have an escape plan, but also an alternative escape route to that, Heggie said. And Mott added that travelers shouldn't rely just on Google maps. Have a physical map at the ready in case service is interrupted.</p><p>\u00b7 Have a survival kit: Keep plenty of water, extra food and clothes in the vehicle in case you do get caught up in an emergency - \"all the things you would need to survive for camping,\" Heggie said. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/wildfire.html\">The Red Cross</url> suggests you have a battery-powered radio, too.</p><p>\u00b7 Mask up: \"Be sure to have a mask handy for the smoke, because air quality can get bad fast,\" Pratt said. Use an N-95 mask, Mott advises.</p><p>\u00b7 Be on the vanguard: If you see smoke or fire, report it immediately, Pratt said.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/></p><p>Expand your 'when' and 'where' fire horizons</p><p>In the past, you could think of summer in California and other places out West as the \"fire season.\" But not anymore. Watch for big swings in conditions year to year and season to season.</p><p>\"We don't think about disaster until it happens,\" Mott said. \"We need to be thinking about wildfire, in particular, year-round - not just in fire season.\"</p><p>Mott said we also are having to expand our horizons about where wildfires might happen. They aren't just a mainland Western US problem, as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/17/us/hawai-maui-wildfire-report/index.html\">deadly 2023 Maui fires demonstrated</url>. Any place with hot weather, dried-up brush and grass and high winds could have a wildfire, he said.</p><p>East of the Mississippi River, an area that generally gets more rain than the bulk of the West, can see wildfires. After a dry autumn, fires killed more than 10 people in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/us/gatlinburg-fires/index.html\">Gatlinburg, Tennessee, area in 2016</url>.</p><p>And it's a global hazard. As Europe baked in broiling heat in 2023, wildfires on the normally idyllic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/22/europe/greece-record-breaking-heat-wave-climate-intl/index.html\">Greek island of Rhodes</url> sent tourists fleeing a hellscape.</p><p>And 2024 is offering no relief. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/02/climate/venezuela-wildfires-climate-amazon-drought-intl/index.html\">Spring wildfires</url> broke out in the Amazonian rainforest in Venezuela, which suffered from drought. As a hot July was ending, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/park-fire-arson-arraignment-wildfires/index.html\">Park Fire </url>in Northern California and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/weather/jasper-national-park-canada-wildfire/index.html\">wildfire in the Jasper National Park area</url> in the Rockies of Canada grabbed headlines.</p><p>If you're in a vehicle</p><p>If you're in a car and a wildfire is beginning to surround you, resist the urge to jump out.</p><p>\"Vehicles are very good at protecting yourself from fires. If you're completely overrun by fire, take shelter inside your vehicle - you're going to be much better off than outside of the vehicle. ... It's not a guarantee, but it's better than nothing,\" Heggie said.</p><p>\"If you can see well enough, you should try to [drive] out of the fire area.</p><p>\"Other tips if you're in your vehicle from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/go-evacuation-guide/what-to-do-if-trapped/\">Readyforwildfire.org</url>:</p><p>\u00b7 Close all vehicle windows and vents</p><p>\u00b7 Cover yourself with a jacket or blanket</p><p>\u00b7 If possible, lie on the vehicle floor</p><p>If you're in a structure</p><p>It's the same idea with a house or other structure - you have a better chance inside it than outside, Heggie said. Let the fire sweep across the lot while you hunker down inside.</p><p>\"There's a good chance the structure will catch on fire, and after that, then you need to exit outside the structure, obviously.\"</p><p>While riding out a wildfire inside a structure, <url normalizedValue=\"https://idahofirewise.org/evacuation/if-you-get-trapped/\">Idaho Firewise</url> offers these tips:</p><p>\u00b7 Close all windows and doors and place wet towels under door and window openings.</p><p>\u00b7 Have fire extinguishers out and ready to use.</p><p>\u00b7 Fill sinks, tubs and buckets with water to put out any embers.</p><p>If you're trapped outside during a wildfire</p><p>If you're trapped outdoors with a wildfire approaching, call 911 and give them your exact location, Heggie said. Rescuers might be able to get a helicopter to you or firefighters can try to put the fire out around you.</p><p>Try to get away downhill but not into a gulch or ravine, Heggie said. It's harder to escape hoofing it uphill. Plus, <url normalizedValue=\"https://pvnu.org/how-wildfire-spreads\">high-rising flames can reach toward uphill fuel</url>, and the rising convective heat can expand uphill.</p><p>Heggie said the worst place to hunker down: low-lying gulches or ditches filled with dry vegetation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://pvnu.org/how-wildfire-spreads\">Stay out of ravines</url>, which can act as fire funnels.</p><p>Take refuge in or near a body of water if you can reach one, Mott said, as some people did in Maui. \"If you're out in the wilderness or say out on the beach, get in the water. People have successfully waited out wildfires in lakes and rivers.\"</p><p>If you're trapped by a fire and can't swim, Mott said get in as far as you're comfortable - just don't get over your shoulders or where you might be swept away.</p><p>If trapped outdoors, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ucanr.edu/sites/fire/Safety/Burnover/\">University of California's Agriculture and Natural Resources</url> department seconds trying to find areas that won't burn as readily or at all: irrigated fields, golf courses, paved parking lots and ponds. You can try to shelter by boulders and rock outcrops.</p><p>Dangers after the fire has swept through</p><p>Like mines left over after a war, wildfires leave potential dangers after they've burned through.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/wildfire.html\">The Red Cross advises</url>:</p><p>\u00b7 Avoid hot ash, smoldering debris and live embers.</p><p>\u00b7 Stay clear of damaged or fallen power lines, poles and downed wires.</p><p>\u00b7 Watch for pits in the ground filled with ash. They may have hot embers you can't see.</p><p>Mott said we should think ahead and prepare for wildfire but also \"don't worry yourself sick about it. I think that's important for mental health, too, to find a positive outlook on the world and not think only about worst-case scenarios.\"</p><p>This article was first published in 2023 and is updated periodically.         </p><p>             By Forrest Brown, CNN         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Suppression of forest fires has been one of the important research directions in the field of fire safety, ammonium phosphate and its mixture of inhibitors commonly used in solid combustible fires, for forest fire scenarios, also has a good fire suppression effectiveness, inexpensive and easy to store, but also the current suppression of forest fires is one of the main inhibitors.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Institute of Technology: \"However, there are few studies on the interaction between ammonium phosphate and forest fires. In this paper, to facilitate the study, we enter the previous research ideas for gas fires, reduce the scale of the research object, establish a small-sized simplified flame model for suppressing wood fires, take red pine wood as the research object, analyze the pyrolysis gas components after high-temperature pyrolysis, and construct the Cup-burner experimental system, together with an improved powder delivery control system, so that the process of NH4H2PO4 powder quenching fuel flames such as red pine pyrolysis gas at 350 \u00b0C, 450 \u00b0C and 550 \u00b0C was well presented on this device. It was found that the flame morphology was not only related to the gas composition but also the amount of NH4H2PO4 powder added and the particle size; the Minimum fire extinguishing concentration(MEC) value was not only related to the gas composition but also the particle size of NH4H2PO4 powder. This is because the CO2 content decreases and the H2 and CH4 content increase significantly in the gas composition at 550 \u00b0C compared to the 450 \u00b0C gas composition. Among the same pyrolysis gas components, the MEC value gradually increased as the particle size of NH4H2PO4 powder decreased, and the MEC value of 30 mm-40mm particle size powder was the lowest, and the difference between the particle size MEC value and the other two particle sizes was large, while the difference between the MEC values of 20 mm-30mm particle size powder and 10 mm-20mm particle size powder was small; according to the Cup-burner test The chemical thermodynamic analysis was carried out according to the results of the Cup-burner test to obtain the proportion of NH4H2PO4 powders playing a physical role in fire extinguishing. When NH4H2PO4 powder is involved in syngas/air combustion, the end product is P2O5 and xsp = 2.35%.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"When the end product is HPO3, xsp = 7.29%. The products were collected after the interaction of NH4H2PO4 powder with the synthesis gas flame, and the analysis of the products revealed that the products were sticky and not dry solids, and the material analysis of them revealed that they contained more HPO3 and its mixture, which shows that the physical heat absorption played a greater role when NH4H2PO4 powder interacted with the synthesis gas flame.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Experimental study of flame extinguishing of red pine wood pyrolysis gas by NH4H2PO4 powder based on Cup-burner.

Welcome to the Conifex Timber Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call.</p><p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Ken Shields, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thank you, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call covering our third quarter 2023 results. Here with me, I have our CFO, Trevor Pruden; and our President, Andrew McLellan. And we're going to hear from both of them very shortly after I go through some brief opening remarks.</p><p>First, quickly dealing with a housekeeping item. We will be making forward-looking statements and references to non-IFRS measures, and therefore, call your attention to the warning statements set out on pages one and two of the MD&amp;A dated November 7 that we released a short while ago.</p><p>Turning to our results. In the third quarter, we reported negative EBITDA of CAD6.7 million, which was similar to what we reported in Q1, but represented an improvement of around CAD2 million from what we reported for the second quarter. On our previous call, we indicated that we expected improved lumber mill net sales realizations, and that would lead to improved results in Q3. Although we caution that Q3 was expected to have negative EBITDA.</p><p>Our Q3 results were favorably impacted by CAD1.7 million in recoveries of duty deposit overpayment. But this recovery was more than offset by a CAD2.4 million inventory write-down that was taken in response to the lower lumber prices that came into effect as we progressed through Q3. And it was also impacted by CAD600,000 in write-offs that we took at a logging camp that was destroyed by a forest fire. Fortunately for all of us, no employees or contractors were impacted by the fire, and we were not using the camp because we had proactively relocated our harvesting crews to lower risk fire -- lower fire risk locations. We presently have a $33.5 million and potentially refundable duties, which translates into something like CAD46 million which is CAD1.14 per Conifex share. And many of you on the phone will recognize that these potential duty refunds exceed our current trading price by at least two-thirds. And that this is unusual because the other public lumber companies' share trading prices are well above their potential duty deposit refund.</p><p>So I'm now going to turn it over to Andrew McLellan, who's got an important update on our outlook for our operations for the balance of 2023 and some preliminary comments on the outlook for 2024. Over to you, Andrew.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew McLellan:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much, Ken, and good afternoon to those on the line, and welcome to our Q3 call. We're very pleased with our year-to-date accomplishments, particularly in terms of our safety performance, environmental compliance and harvest sustainability. I'd also like to take the opportunity to recognize our employees for their ongoing dedication and commitment in these important areas.</p><p>Our sawmill is performing in line with our expectations. As we've mentioned previously, in May of 2023, the Chief Forester concluded that the remaining dead pine stands in the Mackenzie Timber Supply Area have lost their commercial value with saw logs. And as a result, our shift to a greener log diet has improved sawmill performance resulted in higher grade outturns and stronger selling price realization. As we continue to see incremental improvements in log quality, we anticipate even better grade outturns and further improvements to average mill at sales realizations in 2024 as we proceed through that operating cycle. These operational successes are further bolstered by lower delivered log costs, which will continue to positively impact our overall results in 2024. Our power plant is operating well, and we anticipate we'll exceed 90% uptime through the front half of the year, extending into our annual maintenance window in 2024.</p><p>Looking ahead to Q4, we expect our fourth quarter EBITDA loss will be lower than our Q3 EBITDA loss, even if prices for lumber and exchange rates remain unchanged. In the coming weeks, we'll be diligently working on our 2024 budget and business plan aiming to develop a realistic and achievable strategy that will enable us to report high single-digit or low double-digit positive EBITDA in 2024. We based this outlook on current exchange and duty rates assuming that 2024 benchmark lumber prices average out at $450 per thousand board feet.</p><p>For the remainder of 2023, we anticipate lumber prices to remain consistent with year-to-date levels, and we also expect our lumber production and shipments in the closing quarter of 2023 to modestly surpass those of the third quarter with seasonally higher power prices recorded in our Power business.</p><p>As we look forward to 2024, we agree with an analyst estimate forecasting a low double-digit percentage improvement in benchmark lumber prices. This optimism stems from what we perceive to be an improved supply-demand balance emerging for lumber producers in North America. For context, in the Northern interior region of BC where we operate, trailing 12-month lumber production has decreased by a third from 4.5 billion board feet in early 2021 to 3 billion board feet currently. Additionally, it's worth noting there has been a further 1 billion board foot reduction in the Southern Ontario region. Combining these two together, the interior BC lumber production has declined by 2.5 billion board feet since early 2021.</p><p>On the demand side, we anticipate a boost from potential moderation in key interest rates, a critical driver of residential construction activity and level prices. Additionally, we expect to benefit from lower stumpage charges and lower delivered log costs in Q4 of 2023 and into 2024. These improvements in the supply-demand balance, coupled with our move to a lower ranking on the lumber industry cost curve position us favorably to improve our EBITDA in 2024, even if lumber prices, exchange rates and duty impositions remain at 2023 levels.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Trevor Pruden.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trevor Pruden:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Our quarter end liquidity was unchanged at approximately CAD16 million. However, the loss we incurred in Q3 caused our net debt to capitalization ratio to increase slightly from 32% at the end of Q2 to 34% at the end of Q3. Some of you on this call have advised us that 32% leverage ratio is higher than the ratio as reported by many other public lumber companies.</p><p>I'd like to take the next few minutes to talk about our financial leverage. We have CAD122 million of shareholders' equity at book value. About CAD50 million of our equity is utilized in our Power business to support just over CAD50 million of limited recourse borrowings owed by our Power subsidiary. Our Power business is established -- has established a decade-long track record of generating CAD12-plus million in annual EBITDA. This means that annual debt service obligations of just over CAD6 million are well covered. With 11 years remaining on our Power contract, we are confident that this loan will be fully repaid prior to the expiry of our Power contract.</p><p>Our remaining CAD72 million of shareholders' equity is used in our lumber business to support just under CAD2 million in capitalized leases and CAD12 million drawn down on our ABL. It follows that our lumber business presently has a net debt to capitalization ratio of about 16%. If our ABL facility was fully drawn, our debt-to-capitalization ratio would rise approximately to 27%. Consequently, it is unlikely our net debt to capitalization ratio in lumber will exceed 25%. I trust you agree with us that our lumber business is appropriately and conservatively financed.</p><p>I will now turn the discussion back to Ken.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>Well, thanks very much, Trevor. And the people on the call, you will be mindful of the fact that on our recent calls, we disclosed that we intend to leverage our power sector expertise to develop industrial scale power infrastructure to serve next-generation data center customers. And we believe that many North American operators are interested in locating in BC because of our affordable green power.</p><p>In August, we released a white paper that outlined both the opportunities and the legal challenges associated with this initiative. And a short while ago, we distributed an update to our white paper that brings people up-to-date on recent developments. But our sense is that the province continues to be unaware how technological advancements, innovation and changing user preferences, have catapulted e-commerce to the forefront of the financial sector. The province also appears to be unaware of the emergence of a new technology boom based on artificial intelligence, machine learning and other high-performance computing or HPC applications. The most well-known artificial intelligence application ChatGPT was launched one month before the provincial -- the provincial cabinet imposed its moratorium on providing interconnection services to say that we had under development.</p><p>ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months. And many of you would be aware, this is by far the fastest adoption of any app in history. And I seem to recall it took something like 16 years for mobile phones to reach 100 million user and probably six or seven or eight years for the Internet to reach the same number of users. But clearly, these new artificial intelligence and machine learning applications are gaining momentum, and they're leading to skyrocketing demand for data center power infrastructure that our Power team is very capable of designing, building and operating reliably. Our legal challenge to the moratorium that prevents us from moving ahead on this diversification initiative was heard in the Supreme Court of BC last month. And obviously, we'll advise you on the outcome of the hearing as soon as we hear what they have commenced and we're expecting to hear something towards the end of this calendar year.</p><p>So summing up our presentation, clearly, Andrew and Trevor, in my opinion, demonstrated that our finances are solid. And operationally, we have log cost and log quality tailwinds that will enable us to report much improved operating results in 2024. And so against that backdrop, I think we'll stop here and look forward to any questions any of you on the call may have.</p><p>So I'll now turn the meeting back to our operator. Thank you.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Mr. Shields. [Operator Instructions] There are no questions registered at this time. I would now like to return the meeting back over to Mr. Shields.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Well, Rebecca, thank you very much for handling our call today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>I do apologize -- I do apologize to interrupt. We do have the first question. One moment, please. I'll open the line. The first question is from [Speech Overlap]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>Hamir Patel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, Ken. I just want to get your thoughts on how you see stumpage prices playing out in British Columbia as we progress through 2024?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>Hamir, as you know, what was previously a multi-month leg has been shortened considerably. And I can tell you what's happening in our case is that our stumpage rates have declined considerably in the recent months. And we're not expecting any material change going forward in 2024. And we are shifting over to a slightly greener log diet. So it's quite possible that operators that had a consistent harvest profile will end up experiencing more stumpage release than we experience but the fact of the matter is moving to a better log means that we don't have the same opportunity for lower stumpage prices because log quality is improving.</p><p>So we factored in our best assessment of stumpage costs in 2024 when we set our targets. And as Andrew mentioned, we think that we will have positive EBITDA if we have benchmark prices stabilized in the CAD4.45 or CAD4.50 range. And that's a very significant change due primarily to log diet and improving grade outturn. So those are the targets we've set. Andrew and his team are hard at work identifying the specific harvest locations and the grade outturns that we will expect as we move into the greener harvest. But certainly, 2024 looks much more promising for us than 2023 was when we were obligated to comply with a salvage harvest partition for a majority of our wood. And of course, since we started our summer logging program, we've been hard at work transitioning to a greener log diet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Ken, that's helpful. And just the last question I had was, as you think about 2024 just based on your current sort of pricing view, what level of production would you be targeting? And where would you expect capex to land?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>I can answer the first question easily and part of the second question. But the last numbers that I've seen indicate that we're going to come in at around 200 million board feet of production in 2024, and that's up from 155 million to 160 million in 2023 is our best guess as to where we might end up. And at the moment, our capital expenditure forecast for 2024 capex certainly not to exceed depreciation and amortization, which runs about CAD12 million a year. So it will be below that from the latest numbers that I've seen. But of course, if we end up being cash flow positive and generating some cash, Andrew has got an inventory of high return, quick payback smaller projects on the shelf that we'll be pursuing. And so if the results are better in 2024, our capex is likely to end up being a bit higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ken. That's all I had. I'll turn it over.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, Hamir. All the best.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I would now like to return the meeting back over to Mr. Shields. You may proceed, sir.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Shields:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Well, thank you, Rebecca. And once again, everyone, thank you for your interest in Conifex.

Efforts to bring it under control Thursday failed and strong winds have made the fire \u201cvery aggressive,\u201d the Valencian regional government said.</p><p>In neighboring Portugal, the government on Friday announced a nationwide three-day state of alert beginning Sunday. Portugal is in the grip of a severe drought and has also seen devastating wildfires this summer.</p><p>The measure, which grants authorities special, temporary powers such as barring people from woodlands, is a response to forecasts of inland temps above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) beginning Sunday in what could be the country's third heat wave this summer.</p><p>Portuguese Interior Minister Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Carneiro said the armed forces would provide extra forest patrols on those days. He also announced that the Civil Protection Agency will get additional funding to hire another 500 firefighters.</p><p>In Spain's Valencia, meanwhile, four people were still hospitalized after suffering severe burns Wednesday when <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-fires-spain-madrid-2829e0591a95ae81e0e7f842bd8fc8a2\">several passengers tried to jump off a train</url> that had stopped and tried to go back amid surrounding flames. The train had inadvertently headed into the fast-spreading wildfire.</p><p>Regional government head Ximo Puig has requested a report from the firefighting services to clarify why the train was allowed to proceed through an area that was burning.</p><p>Spain has been hit harder than any other European country by forest fires this year, according to the European Commission\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation program. This year, wildfires in Spain have burned four times more land than they did during the last decade.</p><p>Up to early August, 43 large wildfires \u2014 those affecting at least 500 hectares (1,235 acres) \u2014 were recorded in the Mediterranean country, while the average in previous years was 11.</p><p>The European Forest Fire Information System estimates Spain has seen 284,764 hectares (704,000 acres) burn this year \u2014 four times higher than the average since records began in 2006.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow all AP stories on the environment and climate change at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-a219c8a7ff5542b0b3732afd7fc1989020220819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6666-PDJ1-JC5B-G0V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><timeReceived>3:29 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 19, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Harrowing escapes. The charred shells of what's left behind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's hard not to be terrified by images of deadly wildfires like those that tore through parts of Hawaii this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jon Heggie - formerly public information officer and now a division chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) - knows what's it's like facing down a wildfire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I've been in my fair share of major incidents up and down the state,\" Heggie told CNN Travel. \"A description will not ever do it justice. The sights, the sounds, the feelings - the energy you feel from a large-scale incident is sensory overload,\" he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You can feel the radiant heat penetrating your body basically, the smoke conditions that kind of blur your vision. ... [The] sound of numerous trees being engulfed, it basically shakes the ground. It's quite a dramatic event when you're at the fire front of a large fire.\"</p><p>The hard-earned experience of Heggie and other experts can help the rest of us increase our chances of survival in a wildfire - or avoid being trapped in one.</p><p>Learn about wildfires before you travel</p><p>Residents in wildfire-prone areas of the United States and the rest of the world might be used to keeping up with news of wildfires. It behooves travelers, who might have less experience, to do the same.</p><p>\"Keep situational awareness. Pay attention to the local news. Pay attention to your local surroundings,\" Heggie said. \"... If you're in a wildland area, you must pay attention to your surroundings because if a fire were to start, it can very quickly move in directions that can put people in harm's way.\"</p><p>Beth Pratt, California regional executive director of the National Wildlife Federation, owns a home just outside fire-prone Yosemite National Park and echoes that advice through decades of experience.</p><p>\"Stay alert. Know you might need to be flexible with your plans or routes,\" she said.</p><p>Nick Mott, co-author of the upcoming book \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/this-is-wildfire-9781639730797/\">This Is Wildfire: How to Protect Yourself, Your Home, and Your Community in the Age of Heat</url>,\" said to pay attention to so-called red flag warnings.</p><p>\"So basically, those are weather warnings when there's high fire danger.\" Watch for \"super-high heat, high winds.\"</p><p>\"If you're a traveler, it might be smart to stay out of an area that seems prone to burn,\" he said.</p><p>The Red Cross also advises that you might want to leave an area before there's even an official evacuation notice.</p><p>Some more preparedness tips:</p><p>\u00b7 Get alerts to your phone: Sign up for alerts at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/\">readyforwildfire.org</url>, Heggie suggested. On a road trip, listen to local talk radio and news stations. <url normalizedValue=\"https://fire.airnow.gov/\">AirNow</url> also tracks wildfires in North America. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">European Forest Fire Information System</url> (EFFIS) can help people traveling there. <url normalizedValue=\"https://myfirewatch.landgate.wa.gov.au/map.html\">My Fire Watch</url> can help with tracking in Australia.</p><p>\u00b7 Be prepared to get away: When you're in wildfire-prone areas, you should not only have an escape plan, but also an alternative escape route to that, Heggie said. And Mott added that travelers shouldn't rely just on Google maps. Have a physical map at the ready in case service is interrupted.</p><p>\u00b7 Have a survival kit: Keep plenty of water, extra food and clothes in the vehicle in case you do get caught up in an emergency - \"all the things you would need to survive for camping,\" Heggie said. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/wildfire.html\">The Red Cross</url> suggests you have a battery-powered radio, too.</p><p>\u00b7 Mask up: \"Be sure to have a mask handy for the smoke, because air quality can get bad fast,\" Pratt said. Use an N-95 mask, Mott advises.</p><p>\u00b7 Be on the vanguard: If you see smoke or fire, report it immediately, Pratt said.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/></p><p>Expand your 'when' and 'where' fire horizons</p><p>In the past, you could think of summer in California and other places out West as the \"fire season.\" But not anymore. Watch for big swings in conditions year to year.</p><p>This past winter brought <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/us/atmospheric-river-winter-california-drought-climate/index.html\">record snows and wet weather</url> to much of California. But the year before that, the drought was so bad that the state saw fires in the dead of winter. Heggie cited a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.co.monterey.ca.us/government/departments-a-h/administrative-office/office-of-emergency-services/2022-wildfires\">700-acre fire in January 2022</url> on the coast in Monterrey just weeks after heavy rains.</p><p>\"We don't think about disaster until it happens,\" Mott said. \"We need to be thinking about wildfire, in particular, year-round - not just in fire season.\"</p><p>Mott said we also are having to expand our horizons about where wildfires might happen. They aren't just a mainland Western US problem, as the deadly Maui fires demonstrate. Any place with hot weather, dried-up brush and grass and high winds could have a wildfire, he said.</p><p>East of the Mississippi River, an area that generally gets more rain than the West, can see wildfires. After a dry autumn, fires killed more than 10 people in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/us/gatlinburg-fires/index.html\">Gatlinburg, Tennessee, area in 2016</url>.</p><p>And it's a global hazard. As Europe baked in record heat in 2023, wildfires on the normally idyllic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/22/europe/greece-record-breaking-heat-wave-climate-intl/index.html\">Greek island of Rhodes</url> sent tourists fleeing a hellscape.</p><p>If you're in a vehicle</p><p>If you're in a car and a wildfire is beginning to surround you, resist the urge to jump out.</p><p>\"Vehicles are very good at protecting yourself from fires. If you're completely overrun by fire, take shelter inside your vehicle - you're going to be much better off than outside of the vehicle. ... It's not a guarantee, but it's better than nothing,\" Heggie said.</p><p>\"If you can see well enough, you should try to [drive] out of the fire area.</p><p>\"Other tips if you're in your vehicle from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/go-evacuation-guide/what-to-do-if-trapped/\">Readyforwildfire.org</url>:</p><p>\u00b7 Close all vehicle windows and vents</p><p>\u00b7 Cover yourself with a jacket or blanket</p><p>\u00b7 If possible, lie on the vehicle floor</p><p>If you're in a structure</p><p>It's the same idea with a house or other structure - you have a better chance inside it than outside, Heggie said. Let the fire sweep across the lot while you hunker down inside.</p><p>\"There's a good chance the structure will catch on fire, and after that, then you need to exit outside the structure, obviously.\"</p><p>While riding out a wildfire inside a structure, <url normalizedValue=\"https://idahofirewise.org/evacuation/if-you-get-trapped/\">Idaho Firewise</url> offers these tips:</p><p>\u00b7 Close all windows and doors and place wet towels under door and window openings.</p><p>\u00b7 Have fire extinguishers out and ready to use.</p><p>\u00b7 Fill sinks, tubs and buckets with water to put out any embers.</p><p>If you're trapped outside during a wildfire</p><p>If you're trapped outdoors with a wildfire approaching, call 911 and give them your exact location, Heggie said. Rescuers might be able to get a helicopter to you or firefighters can try to put the fire out around you.</p><p>Try to get away downhill but not into a gulch or ravine, Heggie said. It's harder to escape hoofing it uphill. Plus, <url normalizedValue=\"https://pvnu.org/how-wildfire-spreads\">high-rising flames can reach toward uphill fuel</url>, and the rising convective heat can expand uphill.</p><p>Heggie said the worst place to hunker down: low-lying gulches or ditches filled with dry vegetation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://pvnu.org/how-wildfire-spreads\">Stay out of ravines</url>, which can act as fire funnels.</p><p>Take refuge in or near a body of water if you can reach one, Mott said, as some people did in Maui. \"If you're out in the wilderness or say out on the beach, get in the water. People have successfully waited out wildfires in lakes and rivers.\"</p><p>If you're trapped by a fire and can't swim, Mott said get in as far as you're comfortable - just don't get over your shoulders or where you might be swept away.</p><p>If trapped outdoors, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ucanr.edu/sites/fire/Safety/Burnover/\">University of California's Agriculture and Natural Resources</url> department seconds trying to find areas that won't burn as readily or at all: irrigated fields, golf courses, paved parking lots and ponds. You can try to shelter by boulders and rock outcrops.</p><p>Dangers after the fire has swept through</p><p>Like mines left over after a war, wildfires leave potential dangers after they've burned through.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/wildfire.html\">The Red Cross advises</url>:</p><p>\u00b7 Avoid hot ash, smoldering debris and live embers.</p><p>\u00b7 Stay clear of damaged or fallen power lines, poles and downed wires.</p><p>\u00b7 Watch for pits in the ground filled with ash. They may have hot embers you can't see.</p><p>Mott said we should think ahead and prepare for wildfire but also \"don't worry yourself sick about it. I think that's important for mental health, too, to find a positive outlook on the world and not think only about worst-case scenarios.\"         </p><p>             By Forrest Brown, CNN         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In the two years since 15-year-old Scarlett Faith disappeared, the police and even her older brother, Seattle coder Aidan Faith, have pretty much given up on finding her. Then, suddenly, a train passenger's fleeting sight of a woman who looks just like Scarlett fleeing through the wilderness gives Aidan new hope and new energy. </p><p>His visit to Eaglewood, near where his sister was spotted, produces nothing from local Sgt. Giglio, Mayor Christopher Hood, or Cody, the mayor's thuggish fixer. But it does bring Aidan together with Lana Carrera, a graduate student seeking her vanished brother, Samuel, whom the authorities have assumed to be dead ever since his cellphone was found in the ruins of a forest fire. With no one to rely on but each other, the pair quickly bond as they discover traces of other missing persons and two neighboring groups the story has already provided glimpses into: Darryl Moses' Sugar Magnolia Farm, whose economy depends on marijuana and prostitution, and the Cradle, whose eco-terrorist leader, Shannon Reinhardt, is running an even more radical operation. Unlike the searchers, the local countercultures share a relationship that's purely transactional, and it's not surprising that Edwards peppers the story with a high body count, including a surprising number of victims shot dead by the good guys, who seem just fine about it in the moment and even finer afterward. A so-so thriller whose premise and events are at once unnerving and deeply familiar.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2022-06-21</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Thomas &amp;

The EU co-finances the travel, accommodation, subsistence, and some part of the operations costs of European firefighters to France, Greece and Portugal and back to the countries of origin.</p><p>* The rescEU reserve complements and enhances the assets that were available so far from the European Civil Protection Pool (ECPP):</p><p>- 4 Canadair planes (2 from France and 2 from Greece)</p><p>- 5 ground forest firefighting teams without vehicles modules from Greece (1), Spain (1), France (2), and Portugal (1)</p><p>- ground forest firefighting teams 7 with vehicles modules from Bulgaria (1), France (2), Poland (3), and Portugal (1)</p><p>- two forest firefighting advisory/assessment teams from Spain.</p><p>How is the rescEU firefighting fleet funded?</p><p>The EU funds 75% of the stand-by costs of assets (i.e. aircraft) and personnel during the period of the agreement (wildfire season).</p><p>100 % of transport costs for every deployment and 75 % of operational costs are covered by the EU in case of deployment inside Europe; 100% outside Europe</p><p>What was the EU's response to wildfires in previous years?</p><p>In the 2022 wildfire season, the EU's rescEU firefighting fleet was made up of 13 aircraft, including 12 airplanes and 1 helicopter. Positioned throughout the EU in Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden. France and Greece had also each registered 4 more Canadair in the European Civil Protection Pool.</p><p>During the year, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) received 11 requests for assistance for wildfires, in some cases simultaneously, from Albania, Czechia, France, Germany, Portugal and Slovenia. There were 33 planes, 8 helicopters and over 1500 firefighters on the ground via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to help overwhelmed national responders put down massive wildfires</p><p>The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) produced 328 maps of areas affected by wildfires across the world in 2022.</p><p>In 2021, rescEU firefighting planes and helicopters supported fire response in Cyprus (3 to 5 July), Italy (25 to 30 July), Turkey (1 to 24 Aug), Greece (3 to 30 August) and Austria (29 Oct to 5 Nov). In 2019, the EU sent rescEU firefighting airplanes to Greece's Evia island (13 August).</p><p>What other tools does the EU have in place for wildfire prevention, preparedness, and monitoring?</p><p>* The EU's 24/7 Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) monitors fires of concern and maintains close contact with the authorities of the affected country.</p><p>* The ERCC Wildfires Support Team with experts from EU Member States, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism Participating States, ERCC staff as well as scientific experts from the European Natural Hazard Scientific Partnership (\"ARISTOTLE\") consortium will be set up to from 19 June to 14 September.</p><p>* The European Civil Protection Pool (ECPP) brings together firefighting resources from Member States and Participating States, ready for deployment at short notice. These resources are pre-committed to the ECPP by Member States and Participating States and certified by the European Commission.</p><p>* In 2021, the Commission initiated the Wildfire Prevention Action Plan. As a tangible deliverable of this plan, a Wildfire Peer Review Assessment Framework (PRAF) is has now been made available. The PRAF supports wildfire risk management capacity building and good practices exchange among European countries. The PRAF will facilitate peer reviews of wildfire risk management systems within the framework of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). This new tool will help countries assess their capacity to prevent wildfires from starting and their preparedness to cope with them. Member States and Participating States are invited to volunteer for a wildfire management peer review or to use this tool for a self-review, at national and/or regional level.</p><p>* National and European monitoring services and tools such as the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) provide updated and reliable information on wildland fires in Europe. EFFIS provides fire danger forecast (short and long-term) as well as near-real time information on active fires and burnt areas.</p><p>- Regular meetings will be held with EU Member and Participating-* States to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism during the season to-* exchange information on their state of preparedness and fire risks.</p><p>* The EU's Copernicus emergency satellite mapping service can be activated to map wildfires.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For More Information</p><p>rescEU (<url normalizedValue=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/resceu_en\">https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/resceu_en</url>)</p><p>Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en\">https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en</url>)</p><p>EU Civil Protection Mechanism (<url normalizedValue=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/eu-civil-protection-mechanism_en\">https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/eu-civil-protection-mechanism_en</url>)</p><p>*</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2944\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2944</url></p><p>Contact: Balazs Ujvari, +32 2 295 45 78, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu\">balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8174757 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8174757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CF-06V1-JC11-10BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 30, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As the wind blew, pine needles, still wet with morning dew, would slap the wooden shingles of the roof in a rhythm that sounded like a heartbeat from inside the house. </p><p><br/>The back door of the house opened to a mossy forest with a green so deep that it looked black until your eyes adjusted. Once you saw the true green of the trees, you also saw the stream that cut across an open glade, which rolled up to the house like a verdant carpet. <br/>The glade twitched with life: mockingjays and marmots, water bugs and white-tailed deer. It was said that mountain lions once prowled the edge of the forest. <br/>Opening the front door provided the sound of the ocean: waves falling onto a rocky beach. As winter storms swelled, the waves hammered. Most days, the waters were gentle. The starfish \u2014 as orange as tangerines \u2014 clung to the freckled rocks on the beach as minnows darted through the water. <br/>The water's horizon was often broken by humpback whales cresting. When the whales crashed back to the water, you would see sprays of water sprout like shoots of the white Veronica flowers from the steely water. Moments later, the sound arrived: an epic splash, but muffled by the distance. <br/>When the windows of the house were open, you could hear the ocean and the forest and the glade. Breezes turned the pages of a book, left open, on the nearby table. The house's design, a feat of architecture, provided fresh air to every corner of the house, whether in the cool stone crawl space or the third-floor attic. With the rhythm of the breezes, light curtains drifted into the house and then, in the next moment, were nearly sucked out the window. Like the rise and fall of a person's chest, the house seemed to breathe. <br/>You could hike for days through the forest in any direction and never find another house. Perhaps it was weeks. No one really knew. The same was true of walking the beach or searching the ocean. The house seemed isolated by an eternity of space. <br/>Long ago, no one thought it was possible to live here, in this remote paradise. But here was this house, the one and only, a miracle. <br/>Neither of them \u2014 neither he or she \u2014 remembered how they wandered onto the house, whether from the forest or the ocean. <br/>She had been starving, but the house had a garden bursting with sprigs of cilantro lining the ground and enormous carrots hiding below the soil. She still remembered, like a familiar myth, the first apple she found in the nearby orchard, which was teeming with peaches and plums, too. <br/>He had been parched, but the house's kitchen had a water tap. During their first days at the house, he would set his chin on the table with a tall glass of water right in front of his eyes. Searching for some impurity \u2014 even a single speck of dirt \u2014 he could find none. The water was immaculately clear. It tasted like salvation. <br/>They both remembered how the house had nurtured them. How the front porch swing held them like a child holding two baby birds, as they sat pressed together and looking out toward the sunrise. <br/> They both remembered how the house had nurtured them. How the front porch swing held them like a child holding two baby birds, as they sat pressed together and looking out toward the sunrise. <br/> - Eric Thomas <br/><br/><br/>That seems so long ago now. The painful memory of a house alive. <br/>On this day, they found ways to avoid one another. He spent most of the day in a chair at the edge of where the forest used to be. She swung on the front porch, listening to the waves. Recently, being inside the house together was too tense. <br/>She couldn't resist reminding him. She saw this coming. She just knew it. <br/>He didn't want to hear it. The blame. The guilt. The finger pointing. <br/>Because the house was crumbling. <br/>Was it the leaking pipe above the kitchen that started it? It seemed impossible that it all had started with something so small, especially now that there was so much water. The pooling water buckled the floors. The plaster sloughed off the walls. The mold crept in every direction. <br/>Or, had it been the fireplace they had added on the second floor? They thought it would be a bit more convenient to have another fireplace. But the smoke choked the attic. Soot stained the house, smoke pouring back down the chimney and into the room. Embers from the hastily built chimney sparked fires in the forest. And the house was simply too hot with both fireplaces running. <br/>Nature seemed to recoil from the house. The couple hadn't seen a deer since the summer forest fire that cleared trees, miles of them, all the way to the base of the distant mountain. The mockingbirds had vanished with the trees. <br/>In the kitchen one day, the man again poured a glass of water. He held it up to the window light above the sink, inspecting it once again. Parasitic gunk fluttered through the glass. The water was alive with threats. As his stomach ached from the water he drank the day before, he felt a drop of water in his graying hair. The leak from the second story was getting worse. <br/>Through the same window, he saw her in the garden. With the scorched forest in the background, she tiptoed past the wilting tomatoes and helpless lettuce. She knelt down and pulled a carrot stem. The small, faintly orange stub emerged from the ashen soil, no larger than a baby's finger. She tossed it aside and looked up. <br/>Their eyes met. And then she turned away. <br/>Her thoughts went to blaming him. Why had he insisted on the second fireplace? Hadn't she waved it away as an extravagance? <br/>Why did he continue to stuff more wood into the fire when it belched ash and killed the forest? Hadn't she suggested using one log rather than two? <br/>And the leak! Why did he refuse to fix it? Hadn't she reminded him often enough? <br/>As her eyes rose up again to see him through the window, she saw the full profile of the house, its paneling singed by fire and stained by soot, its structure failing from the slow drip of the pipe's leak. <br/>This failing house was the one. The only. <br/>She understood at that moment that they shared in the blame. She too neglected the house. She had warmed herself by the new fireplace. She had avoided the days of work needed to fix the leak. In addition to the fire and the leak, the looming blame between the two of them was a third catastrophe for the house. <br/>In fact, she realized, the resentment between them was the most toxic to the house and therefore most vital to resolve. That distance would destroy the house. <br/>Forget about finding the culprit. Don't worry about excavating years of animosity. The key now was in the repair, the recovery, the solution. How can the house be saved? <br/>Seeing him frozen in the kitchen window, she could sense that he knew this, too. <br/>As she walked into the back door to the house, a cool breeze clapped the screen door closed behind her. Raindrops fell, slowly at first, but then as a torrent that began to wash the soot from the side of the house. Taking his hand, she led him to the front door. <br/>'Let's get to work,' she said. <br/>Miles off coast and hidden by the rain from the couple, a whale breached from the ocean and then slipped beneath the surface. <br/>Eric Thomas[1]directs the Kansas Scholastic Press Association and teaches visual journalism and photojournalism at the University of Kansas.

This will potentially have a significant impact on nature-based carbon projects, and the voluntary carbon markets.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1949056/Forest_Fire.jpg\"/></p><p>To read more download the full white paper\u00a0here</p><p>Sharm-El Sheikh, Egypt (November 16, 2022)<br/>This year's United Nations Conference of Parties (COP 27) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt is in full swing, with countries gathered to decide on global action to combat climate change, with a sharp focus on fulfilling Article 6.</p><p>The CCD delegation visiting COP has released a white paper, detailing how carbon stocks in forests are being impacted by rising temperatures, and intensifying forest fires across the Indian subcontinental region. This gives concern for the future health of both natural ecosystems, and carbon markets. Current climate trends, and future projections are alarming, as the average temperature trend for the last 40 years has seen a rise of 0.5\u00b0C, leading to markedly increased weather volatility.</p><p>Projections out to 2100 for central India predict a significant increase in rainfall of 100 mm and rise in average temperature of 1.2\u00b0C. As such, the frequency, duration, and intensity of forest fires are also expected to be exacerbated.</p><p>These pose major risks for nature-based solutions (NBS) projects, and carbon project developers. In turn there will be a direct bearing on global carbon registries, which will have to manage the buffers required for mitigating the associated permanence risk.</p><p>Currently, around 20% of a project's carbon credits are set aside in a buffer by registries at the time of issuance, to mitigate the permanence risk. However, this level may be inadequate in the future, and have a knock-on effect on global markets.</p><p>The paper \u2013 titledClimate Change:\u00a0 Impact on Rainfall, Temperature and Forest Fires, an Indian Perspective\u2013 examines the past trends for central India from 1951 to 2020, and out to 2100. The study highlights the need for similar types of climate analysis to be conducted in other parts of the world.</p><p>Based on its findings,Climate Connect Digitalhas started developing tools which enable near real-time monitoring of forest fires in areas of interest and generate actionable alerts.</p><p>About Climate Connect Digital:</p><p>Climate Connect Digital\u00a0(CCD) is a climate-tech company which has provided innovative technology and advisory solutions to the climate and clean energy domains for over 12 years.</p><p>A pioneer in applying AI to energy and climate tech, its solutions are deployed in various grids, and manage 12 GW of solar and wind power generation across more than 100 power plants.</p><p>With software solutions and expert consultants, CCD enables companies to build and implement strategies to achieve long-term emission reduction targets. Its software tools and expert advisory services also help carbon project developers to seamlessly achieve the maximum from their carbon assets.</p><p>Photo -<url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1949056/Forest_Fire.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1949056/Forest_Fire.jpg</url></p><p>To connect please write to us atcontact@climateconnect.digital</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=IO38894&amp;sd=2022-11-16\"/> View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rise-in-forest-fires-is-a-permanence-risk-for-global-carbon-markets-301680336.html</p><p>SOURCE Climate Connect Digital (CCD)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=IO38894&amp;Transmission_Id=202211161054PR_NEWS_USPR_____IO38894&amp;DateId=20221116\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: +91 9082963493</p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-IO3889420221116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66W7-33M1-JB72-129V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><timeReceived>10:54 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 16, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Climate Connect Digital (CCD)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer; Electronics Products</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alternative Energies (incl.

By ensuring community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response, these airports contribute to keeping Canadians safe and connected from coast to coast to coast.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in the Northwest Territories. Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, four airports in the Northwest Territories will receive over $1.5 million for the purchase of critical safety equipment that will assist in the removal and control of ice and snow from airside surfaces such as runways, taxiways, and the apron.</p><p>The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>Fort Simpson</p><p>* to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck - $420,000</p><p>Hay River</p><p>* to purchase a grader - $410,000</p><p>Inuvik</p><p>* to purchase a loader - $381,425</p><p>Yellowknife</p><p>* to purchase a sweeper - $314,500</p><p>* to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck - $357,000</p><p>* to purchase a de-icing trailer - $89,250</p><p>These investments are in addition to the more than $19.8 million in funding provided through the program in May 2021 for safety-related projects at the Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, and Yellowknife airports.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"The pandemic highlighted the important role Canada's local and regional airports play in our country's economy, and in sustaining the social and economic well-being of our communities. In addition to supporting personal travel, local and regional airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. Investing in our airports will improve access to safe, reliable, and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver on our commitment to build safer, healthier, and stronger communities as Canada recovers from the pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>\"The airports in Fort Simpson, Inuvik, Hay River, and Yellowknife are all critically important for residents and businesses in their regions. These investments in safety equipment will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for Northerners.\"</p><p>Michael McLeod, Member of Parliament for Northwest Territories</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* The Fall Economic Statement 2020 also announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airports System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country. Funded projects include runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles as well as installing wildlife control fencing.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2022/11/government-of-canada-makes-important-investments-at-four-northwest-territories-airports.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2022/11/government-of-canada-makes-important-investments-at-four-northwest-territories-airports.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7998406 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7998406</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66W6-RXF1-JC11-124T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 16, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The order makes up to 30 specially-trained service personnel available to assist local emergency responders in preserving life and property.</p><p>The Briarwood Fire is one of more than 800 wildfires reported this year in the Commonwealth which have burned a combined 1,248 acres according to the Department of Conservation and Recreation Bureau of Forest Fire Control and Forestry. Burning for one month across a 19-acre profile, the Briarwood Fire continues to smolder above and below ground. To protect residents and visitors, state and local officials have established a delineated containment area which members of the National Guard will support as part of the mission.</p><p>The dedicated women and men selected for this mission serve as firefighters in the Massachusetts Army National Guard's tactical firefighting units on Joint Base Cape Cod. The 179th and 180th Engineer Detachments specialize in complex rescue and firefighting operations at home and abroad, including forest fires, structural fires, aircraft crash incidents, vehicle emergencies, and hazardous material incidents. Their wildfire suppression training, skilled expertise, and regular collaboration with the Department of Conservation and Recreation equip them to strengthen the containment line and meaningfully contribute to Rockport's ongoing fire mitigation efforts.</p><p>In light of the drought facing every region of the Commonwealth, members of the public can access the Department of Fire Safety resources here, and are asked to take special care around any outdoor activities that increase the risk of brush and forest fires such as grilling, camping, smoking, and using power equipment that can reach high temperatures, such as lawnmowers and ATVs.</p><p>The Massachusetts National Guard trains regularly with military, law enforcement, and civilian agencies to provide a broad spectrum of services in support of security, logistics, disaster relief, and other missions. The Guard has a proven track record of success supporting civilian authorities. Their frequent side-by-side training with state and local first responders makes them well-suited for a variety of missions. This mission will not interfere with the Massachusetts National Guard's ability to respond to and assist in other emergencies within the Commonwealth.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125395947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6662-1JV1-DYTH-G1YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 18, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

UNITED STATES</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Court holds that the discretionary function exception bars claims based on the Forest Service's decisions about how to contact landowners affected by a forest fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel: \u00a0Judges McKeown, Miller, and Thomas, with Judge McKeown writing the opinion.</p><p> Key highlight: \u00a0 \u00a0'The Forest Service's communication with the landowners about fire-suppression activity that had a high probability of occurring on or near their land satisfies both steps of the discretionary function exception.\u00a0Determining how to consult with private landowners while the Lolo Peak fire raged is precisely the type of decision the discretionary function exception was designed to shield, and the landowners' claims are thus barred.'</p><p> Background: \u00a0The Lolo Peak fire burned in Western Montana for nearly three months during the summer of 2017.\u00a0The U.S. Forest Service and the Montana Department of Natural Resources delegated an incident management team 'responsibility for fire management activities,' including communicating with the public about the fire.\u00a0The team's first incident decision required it to '[c]onsult with private landowners and local fire district authorities if suppression activities have a high probability of occurring on private lands.'\u00a0In order to reach as many members of the public as possible, the team held public meetings at churches and schools, visited high-traffic areas, and posted updates online and on social media.\u00a0The team chose these methods over individualized outreach based on 'the number of residents in proximity to the fire, the community's sophistication, and the widespread availability of internet access.'\u00a0(Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p><p> Plaintiffs are landowners whose property was the site of controlled burns lit by the incident management team in order to slow the spread of the fire.\u00a0Plaintiffs sued the Forest Service, arguing that it was required to personally consult them about fire-suppression activities on their properties.\u00a0The district court granted summary judgment for the Forest Service on the basis that plaintiffs' claims were barred by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA.</p><p> Result: \u00a0The Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p><p> The United States has waived its sovereign immunity for certain tort claims brought under the FTCA, which authorizes claims arising from 'the negligent or wrongful act[s] or omission[s]' of government employees.\u00a0But the FTCA's discretionary function exception preserves sovereign immunity, and thus bars FTCA claims, when the government employee's act or omission was 'based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.'\u00a0 Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, 572-73 (9th Cir. 2021).\u00a0To determine whether the discretionary function exception applies, courts ask (1)\u00a0whether 'the challenged actions involve an 'element of judgment or choice,' and, if so, (2) whether the 'judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.'\u00a0 Id. \u00a0 at 573-74 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p> The Court held that both steps of the discretionary function exception test were satisfied.\u00a0As to the first step, an agency exercises judgment or choice when no statute, regulation, or agency policy 'dictates the precise manner in which the agency is to complete the challenged task.'\u00a0 Green v. United States, 630 F.3d 1245, 1250 (9th Cir. 2011).\u00a0Here, no law or policy dictated the precise manner in which the Forest Service communicated with plaintiffs.\u00a0Although the team's incident decision required it to consult with landowners 'when suppression activities have a high probability of occurring on private lands,' it 'did not dictate when or how the Forest Service was to consult with private landowners and did not require the Forest Service to consult with landowners individually.'</p><p> As to the second step, the discretionary function exception was intended to protect agency actions that are based on 'social, economic, and political policy.'\u00a0 Esquivel, 21 F.4th at 574.\u00a0'The challenged decision need not be actually grounded in policy considerations, but must be, by its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.'\u00a0 Green, 630 F.3d at 1251.\u00a0The Forest Service's decision was subject to a policy analysis because it had to balance the incident management team's safety against the time-intensive work of individually contacting landowners and based its decision on the public's sophistication and widespread access to the internet.\u00a0The Court had previously held that communications between fire crews and landowners was covered by the discretionary function exception when, as here, that communication concerned how to conduct and organize fire suppression.\u00a0The Court distinguished a previous case that held the exception inapplicable to the Forest Service's failure to contact local landowners at all because in the prior case there was no evidence that the Forest Service had to choose between allocating resources to fire management or to public communication.\u00a0It had therefore made no policy decisions like the ones that informed the agency action here. Because both steps of the discretionary function exception test were satisfied, plaintiffs' claims were barred by sovereign immunity.</p><p> [ <url normalizedValue=\"https://leftcoast.mofo.com//topics/this-week-at-the-ninth-the-ftca-s-discretionary-function-exception\">View source</url> .]</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=0fa500c3-2478-4424-8788-1ffc09d6cd73\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXJD-JSUP1054111680567366759258793000051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67XS-JVR1-JCMN-Y25R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><timeReceived>12:16 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Firefighting aircraft buzzed over the flames and dropped water on the slopes of Mount Penteli, 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of the city. Officials ordered hundreds of people to evacuate their homes.</p><p>Wildfires also kept emergency crews busy in England, Germany, Portugal and Spain.</p><p>In the Gironde region of southwest France, two massive fires feeding on tinder-dry pine forests also have forced tens of thousands of people to flee homes and summer vacation spots since they broke out July 12.</p><p>One of the blazes, tearing through woodlands south of Bordeaux, is suspected to have been started deliberately. A motorist told investigators that before pulling over and trying unsuccessfully to extinguish the flames, he saw a vehicle speeding away from the spot where the fire started, the Bordeaux prosecutor\u2019s office said.</p><p>Criminal investigators found evidence pointing to possible arson, the prosecutor's office said.</p><p>The 39-year-old man being questioned Tuesday lives in Gironde and was detained Monday afternoon, the office said. He also was questioned in 2012 on suspicion of starting a forest fire but that investigation was shelved in 2014 for lack of evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s office added.</p><p>Ten water-bombing planes and more than 2,000 firefighters worked day and night to contain that fire and another fierce blaze southwest of Bordeaux that police investigators were treating as accidental. The blazes have burned through more than 190 square kilometers (more than 70 square miles) of forest and vegetation, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>Thick clouds of smoke and the risk of flames spreading to buildings have forced the evacuations of more than 39,000 people, including 16,000 on Monday, authorities said. A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing regional firefighting resources.</p><p>Swirling winds and extreme heat have complicated firefighting. Record-smashing temperatures eased along France's Atlantic seaboard Tuesday while other parts of the country and the continent continued to broil.</p><p>In Paris, the thermometer in the French capital\u2019s oldest weather station \u2013 opened in 1873 \u2013 topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit ) for just the third time.

Gorman. The jury deliberated about 7 hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, and attempting to traffic in unlawfully harvested timber. U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle scheduled sentencing for October 18, 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When people steal trees from our public lands, they are stealing a beautiful and irreplaceable resource from all of us and from future generations,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Gorman. \"That theft, coupled with the sheer destruction of the forest fire that resulted from this activity, warrants federal criminal prosecution. I commend the various branches of the U.S. Forest Service who worked diligently to investigate and hold this defendant accountable.\"</p><p>According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, Justin Andrew Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, another defendant, Shawn Edward Williams, 49, joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the National Forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>This was the first use of tree DNA evidence in a federal criminal trial. Wilke claimed the wood he sold to a Tumwater mill had been harvested from private property with a valid permit. However, at trial, Richard Cronn, Phd., a Research Geneticist for the USDA Forest Service, testified that the wood Wilke sold was a genetic match to the remains of three poached maple trees investigators had discovered in the Elk Lake area. The DNA analysis was so precise that it found the probability of the match being coincidental was approximately one in one undecillion (one followed by 36 zeroes). Based on this evidence, the jury concluded the wood Wilke sold the mill had been stolen.</p><p>On August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. Some witnesses testified at trial that Wilke was standing next to the nest when it was lit on fire, and therefore appeared to have set the fire. However, because the fire was set at night, they were not able to see his exact actions. The jury did not convict Wilke of the two federal counts related to the forest fire: setting timber afire and using fire in furtherance of a felony.</p><p>One of those who testified that Wilke set the fire, Shawn Williams, pleaded guilty in December 2019 to theft of public property and setting timber afire. He was sentenced in September 2020 to 30 months in prison.</p><p>Quick and diligent investigative work by a U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officer and by a U.S. Forest Service Wildland firefighter preserved important evidence in the case.</p><p>The counts of conviction are punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Judge Settle will determine the appropriate sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.

Officials ordered hundreds of people to evacuate their homes.</p><p>Wildfires also kept emergency crews busy in England, Germany, Portugal and Spain.</p><p>In the Gironde region of southwest France, two massive fires feeding on tinder-dry pine forests also have forced tens of thousands of people to flee homes and summer vacation spots since they broke out July 12.</p><p>One of the blazes, tearing through woodlands south of Bordeaux, is suspected to have been started deliberately. A motorist told investigators that before pulling over and trying unsuccessfully to extinguish the flames, he saw a vehicle speeding away from the spot where the fire started, the Bordeaux prosecutor\u2019s office said.</p><p>Criminal investigators found evidence pointing to possible arson, the prosecutor's office said.</p><p>The 39-year-old man being questioned Tuesday lives in Gironde and was detained Monday afternoon, the office said. He also was questioned in 2012 on suspicion of starting a forest fire but that investigation was shelved in 2014 for lack of evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s office added.</p><p>Ten water-bombing planes and more than 2,000 firefighters worked day and night to contain that fire and another fierce blaze southwest of Bordeaux that police investigators were treating as accidental. The blazes have burned through more than 190 square kilometers (more than 70 square miles) of forest and vegetation, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>Thick clouds of smoke and the risk of flames spreading to buildings have forced the evacuations of more than 39,000 people, including 16,000 on Monday, authorities said. A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing regional firefighting resources.</p><p>Swirling winds and extreme heat have complicated firefighting. Record-smashing temperatures eased along France's Atlantic seaboard Tuesday while other parts of the country and the continent continued to broil.</p><p>In Paris, the thermometer in the French capital\u2019s oldest weather station \u2013 opened in 1873 \u2013 topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit ) for just the third time. The 40.5 C (104.9 F) measured there Tuesday by weather service Meteo-France was the monitoring station\u2019s second-highest reading ever, topped only by a blistering 42.6 C (108.7 F) in July 2019.</p><p>The first time the station topped 40 C \u2013 hitting 40.4 C (104.7 F) -- was in July 1947, Meteo France said. After a 72-year gap, the station has now twice surpassed 40 C in the space of just three years.</p><p>The people evacuated Monday included 74 residents of a retirement home, authorities said. Another 80 care-home residents were among 2,000 people getting moved out Tuesday from the latest of more than a half-dozen towns and villages that were ordered to evacuate, authorities said.</p><p>Approaching flames also forced the emergency evacuation Monday of 363 animals from a zoo in the Arcachon maritime basin, southwest of Bordeaux, the government's ecological transition ministry said Tuesday. About 10 animals died of heat and stress, the ministry said.</p><p>Five camping sites also went up in flames in that area, which is famous for its oysters and beach resorts, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>The double blow of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">heat waves and droughts exacerbated by climate change</url> are making wildfires more frequent, destructive and harder to fight. In Spain, the prime minister has linked wildfires that have killed two people to global warming, saying Monday that \u201cclimate change kills.\u201d</p><p>The head of Spain\u2019s Civil Protection and Emergencies agency, Leonardo Marcos Gonz\u00e1lez, noted Tuesday that extreme heat and wildfires have hit the country three weeks earlier than usual this year and that many fires broke out at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWe are in the midst of the most significant civil protection emergency on record,\u201d he told radio station SER.</p><p>In charred countryside near Barcelona, Ricardo Serra and Julia Garrido returned Tuesday to the wreckage of their home. They'd been renovating it for the upcoming wedding of Garrido's son.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s been burnt,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of our wedding clothes.\u201d</p><p>In Portugal, cooling temperatures have eased pressure on emergency crews, with just two major wildfires being tackled by around 800 firefighters Tuesday. But more torrid weather is forecast for Wednesday.</p><p>Authorities suspect a wildfire was to blame for the death of a couple in their 80s whose car went off the road and flipped over in a northern Portuguese village late Monday. Their charred vehicle with two bodies inside was found after a blaze engulfed the area. Officials suspect the couple died while trying to flee the flames.</p><p>The pilot of a water-dumping plane also died in Portugal last week when his aircraft crashed while fighting a wildfire.</p><p>___</p><p>Leicester reported from Le Pecq, France.
